This photo-microstructure shows a typical untreated carbon chromium bearing steel with the presence of alloy carbides (carbon compounds). In this case, the presence of alloy carbides can be undesirable 
as they are difficult to machine (due to their high hardness) but this can be rectified by a normalising or annealing heat treatment, which will break down the alloy carbides into a form which has less effect on 
machineability and a better response to subsequent heat treatment. Credit: Klaus-Peter Rezsni, Bodycote.

Business model
Provider of essential services to engineering manufacturers
Heat Treatment and Metal Joining
 Heat treatments are controlled processes 
used to alter the microstructure of 
materials such as metals and alloys to 
impart properties which benefit the 
working life of a component.
 Metal joining includes specialised 
processes used to join and assemble 
parts, sometimes dissimilar in material.
Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP)
 HIP combines very high temperature 
with inert gas under very high pressure. 
HIP can be used to eliminate porosity 
in castings and manufacture specialist 
components with unique properties.
Surface T echnology
 Surface technologies are used 
extensively to prolong the working life 
of components and protect them from 
environmental factors such as corrosion 
and abrasion.
The global leader
Customer focus
 Bodycote is focused on continual 
improvement of our quality of service 
and takes an active role in finding 
solutions to technical issues and 
promoting mutual business development 
with our customers.
 Bodycote seeks to secure long-term 
agreements and strategic partnerships 
with our customers which are often 
exclusive in nature and embody 
protection and relative freedom from 
risk, allowing both companies to 
concentrate capital and other resources 
on core competencies.
Global network
 Bodycote’s global network of over 190 
market-focused
6,7
 facilities in 26 countries 
brings economies of scale - particularly 
for energy consumption and equipment 
utilisation. This makes Bodycote’s 
processing inherently more efficient than 
customers’ in-house operations
31
 and 
enhances our competitive position in the 
sub-contract market. 
 The capital intensive nature of 
Bodycote’s business also provides 
significant barriers to entry. The scope of 
Bodycote’s network enables Bodycote 
to specialise more effectively than 
competitors at individual locations and 
provides comprehensive back-up for our 
customers.
Transferable know-how
 The global Bodycote network provides 
unique opportunities for the transfer of 
knowledge and skills, and the transfer of 
technology.

Core technologies
Bodycote has become the partner of choice for the world’s 
most respected and innovative engineering companies by 
providing highly efficient, cost-effective services to the highest 
quality standards through strategic investment in people and 
the latest technology, equipment and quality systems.
By outsourcing non-core but vitally important thermal processing 
requirements to Bodycote, customers are able to concentrate 
their business resources where they are needed most. Bodycote’s 
services offer tangible benefits to customers such as reduced 
equipment maintenance, capital expenditure, energy costs, people 
costs and a major reduction in CO
2
 emissions.
Bodycote has a long history of successful outsourcing partnerships, 
from global to local manufacturers. In many cases, subcontracting 
relationships lead to component and service-specific long-term 
agreements, or strategic partnering arrangements, which embody 
protection and freedom from risk for the customer and Bodycote. 
These are normally exclusive in character and provide the basis 
for mutual business development, with both companies freed to 
concentrate capital and other resources on core competencies.
Making innovations possible
Bodycote’s extensive facilities and expertise mean development 
projects can expand far beyond customers’ in-house capabilities, 
helping to realise goals more quickly and more cost-effectively.
Around the globe, Bodycote has dedicated teams working on a 
variety of projects and sharing knowledge where appropriate. When 
required, this may include the development of specific processes 
and equipment for a customer or verification of materials or 
designs, prior to their application.
Bodycote provides thermal processing services which improve 
material properties such as strength, durability and corrosion 
resistance, enabling manufacturers’ components to work more 
efficiently with significantly extended operational lifetimes. 
Bodycote’s services consist of a number of core technologies: 
heat treatment and metal joining, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) 
and surface technology.
Heat treatment and metal joining
Heat treatments are controlled processes used to alter the 
microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, to impart 
properties which benefit the working life of a component, for 
example: increased surface hardness, temperature resistance, 
ductility and strength. Metal joining includes specialised processes 
such as electron beam welding, vacuum and honeycomb brazing – 
complex operations requiring a fusion of expertise and technology.
Bodycote offers an extensive range of heat treatment services and 
specialist metal joining techniques from facilities around the world. 
With unmatched capacity and computerised systems, Bodycote 
facilities can process a wide range of component sizes to exacting 
standards with reliable, repeatable results.
Hot isostatic pressing (HIP)
HIP combines very high temperature (up to 2,000°C) with inert 
gas under very high pressure (up to 30,000 psi – equivalent to that 
found at an ocean depth of 11,000m such as at the bottom of the 
Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean). HIP can be used to eliminate 
porosity in castings and consolidate encapsulated powders to 
dense materials. Dissimilar materials can be bonded together to 
manufacture unique cost-effective components. Every week a 
typical Bodycote HIP plant will process many tons of titanium, 
aluminium, steel and super-alloy castings, removing porosity and 
improving the performance of parts such as turbine blades and 
oilfield components.
With the largest operational capacity in the world and a wide variety 
of sizes of equipment, Bodycote HIP is able to accommodate 
large volumes of small product as economically as large individual 
components.
Surface technology
Surface technologies are used extensively to prolong the working 
life of components and protect them from environmental factors 
such as corrosion and abrasion. The range of surface treatments 
available from Bodycote covers a wide variety of applications, 
providing manufacturers with solutions to meet requirements such 
as durability, wear resistance, improved hardness and electrical 
conductivity.
Bodycote is a provider of specialised plasma spray, high velocity 
oxy fuel (HVOF) and thermally formed ceramic treatments and is 
able to surface engineer components (including complex geometric 
shapes and internal bores) that are designed to operate in the most 
demanding of industrial applications.

Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012 10
Chairman’s statement
Overview
Against the backdrop of a weak economic environment, particularly 
in Europe, I am pleased to report that Bodycote made further 
progress in 2012. In line with our strategy to provide thermal 
processing services on a global scale, we made a number of 
acquisitions in the USA at a cost of £84.7m. These represent the 
first portfolio additions the Group has made since 2008. Going 
forward we will continue to seek out opportunities to expand the 
Group through a combination of organic growth initiatives in new 
markets and technologies while seeking to build new plants and 
acquire new businesses.
Despite the adverse movement in exchange rates, headline 
earnings per share at 37 .4p grew by 14.4%, headline operating 
margins exceeded 16% and operating profits were fully backed by 
positive cash generation. The return on capital employed increased 
to an impressive 19.5%.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.3p, an increase of 
13.7%, which will be paid to shareholders on 7 May 2013 subject to 
approval at the AGM. This brings the total dividend for 2012 to 12.3p 
(2011: 10.9p) costing £23.4m, which is a year on year increase of 
12.8%.
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary responsibilities is to ensure 
that the Group operates to the highest standards in all aspects 
of governance and risk management. Our aim within Bodycote 
is to manage a growing business effectively, while ensuring that 
proper operating procedures are maintained at all times in each 
of the 26 countries where we operate. Transparency is central to 
this objective and you will find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the Corporate Governance section 
starting on page 38. This year’s Corporate Governance report now 
fully reflects the changes introduced in the UK Governance Code 
(The Code) in June 2010.
A feature of the Board’s agenda this year was the commissioning 
of an externally facilitated review of the Board’s performance. While 
the outcome was favourable, it did provide useful insight enabling 
the Board to continue its development.
During the year I met a number of Bodycote’s major shareholders 
and received positive feedback from them on their views of the 
Group. Going forward I will maintain this regular dialogue with our 
shareholders and look forward to meeting increasing numbers 
of you at this year’s AGM, when there will be an opportunity to 
discuss the Group’s business and achievements.
Board Changes
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Hans Vogelsang for 
his substantial contribution to Bodycote over the last 10 years, 
particularly as Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee. Hans will be retiring from the Board 
on 24 April 2013 at the end of our AGM. Hans was an invaluable 
supporter when in 2007 the Board took the strategic decision 
to dispose of the Testing division which enabled us to focus on 
revitalising the Thermal Processing business. His wise counsel will 
be missed.
Following an international search led by external consultants we 
welcomed Eva Lindqvist, our first female member, to the Board 
in June 2012. A Swedish national and a qualified engineer, Eva 
brings a wealth of skills and international experience, particularly 
of operating in Asia and North America. In addition to serving on 
the Nomination and Audit Committees she has agreed to chair the 
Remuneration Committee. Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information

People
Over the past year I have continued to visit our operations around 
the Group. Following our first business acquisitions for some years 
in North America, I was delighted by the welcome extended to the 
Bodycote team by our new colleagues. I continue to be impressed 
by the commitment and professionalism of our employees and 
their ongoing desire for the Group to grow and prosper. Our people 
are undoubtedly our key asset and I am certain that the long-term 
opportunities for growth mean that our employees will continue to 
find Bodycote a place where they can enjoy rewarding careers. On 
behalf of the Board I congratulate them all for delivering another 
year of successful trading and financial performance.
Summary
As you will read in this Annual Report Bodycote is in very good 
shape and has once again delivered value in terms of total 
shareholder return and the Board’s recommendation is for a 12.8% 
dividend increase.
I believe that the Group will continue to deliver positive returns 
in the years ahead. Underpinned by our continued focus upon 
excellent customer service, strong cash management and the 
quality of our global workforce, I look forward to the future with 
confidence.

The Aerospace, Defence and Energy business took full advantage 
of the strong markets and delivered sales growth of 11 .5%, of 
which 4.2% came from acquisitions, with margins expanding 
to 26.7% (2011: 21 .9%). Progress was particularly pleasing in 
the Automotive and General Industrial segments. Even though 
revenues declined by 2.9%, notwithstanding adding 3.8% from 
acquisitions, margins remained constant at 13.3%, providing 
continued evidence of the improved resilience of Bodycote’s 
profitability.
Return on capital employed increased to 19.5% (2011: 16.9%) on 
the back of the higher level of profits and carefully managed net 
capital expenditure of £47 .7m, which was 0.9 times depreciation 
(2011: 0.9 times). Capital expenditure was lower than expected 
due primarily to longer than anticipated approval and regulatory 
processes. Capital expenditure was targeted at expansion of 
aerospace capacity and greenfield sites in emerging economies 
together with a focus on specific technologies such as Specialty 
Stainless Steel Processes (S
3
P), HIP Product Fabrication, Corr-i-Dur
®
 
and Low Pressure Carburising. 
Headline operating cash conversion was once again very strong at 
113% demonstrating the Group’s commitment to cash generation 
as a primary focus. Net debt finished the year at £34.2m after 
spending £84.7m on acquisitions during the year. On 18 February 
2013, the Group’s €125m revolving credit facility was refinanced to 
1 March 2018.
Strategic Progress
2012 marked a year of excellent strategic progress for Bodycote. 
Our initiatives aimed at improving market focus and increasing 
efficiencies through deployment of enhanced business processes 
all worked together to help drive profitable growth. Indeed the 
expansion of Group margins and growth in ROCE underscores the 
quality of earnings and resilience of the business.
While there are many examples of the successful deployment 
of Bodycote’s strategy, activities in Brazil and in Eastern Europe 
disappointed in 2012. In Brazil the currency rose strongly, disrupting 
Brazil’s position in the global supply chain. In Eastern Europe sales 
dropped, mainly due to manufacturers choosing to sustain their 
facilities in France and Germany, bearing the brunt of cutbacks in 
parallel plants in Eastern Europe.
In contrast, the growth in S
3
P was very pleasing, overcoming 
many of the capacity constraints that had hampered this business 
following its strong growth in 2011 . Late in the year capacity was 
increased in the HIP Product Fabrication business and the benefits 
should be seen in 2013.
A number of businesses were acquired in 2012. North America has 
been under-represented in Bodycote, with the business heavily 
weighted towards Western Europe. Acquisitions in North America 
were high on the priority list as a result.
In April the heat treatment division of Curtiss-Wright was acquired, 
adding eight sites to the Group’s footprint in North America. One 
major attraction of this business is its high degree of aerospace and 
energy work. Three of the acquired sites are located in the Wichita, 
Kansas aerospace hub, an important centre that previously did not 
have a Bodycote presence. The remaining sites dovetail very well 
into the pre-existing North American network.
“2012 has been another year of good 
progress. Improving business mix and 
the part-year benefit of acquisitions 
have enabled further improvements in 
performance and enhanced the Group’s 
geographic balance. ”

In October seven sites were acquired from Bluewater Thermal 
Processing LLC. Six of these sites constituted the business 
formerly known as Carolina Commercial Heat Treating, which has a 
strong competitive position in the so called ‘right to work’ states of 
the South Eastern USA. This region, spanning from North Carolina 
down to Georgia and across to Tennessee, has enjoyed higher than 
average growth in the USA having been the target for significant 
inward investment for some time. It is not only benefiting from the 
arrival of many new foreign companies, but also from businesses 
that are relocating away from the union dominated north. The 
fledgling aerospace supply chain that is being established in the 
region provides a further attraction for Bodycote.
Other acquisitions included a small business comprising three sites 
in Michigan and Indiana, which was acquired from a private owner 
on 31 December 2012. They bring to the Group some of the best 
practitioners of Low Pressure Carburising and sophisticated vacuum 
heat treating technology in the world and are a welcome addition to 
the Group.
As we enter 2013 all of the businesses acquired are performing in 
line with expectations.
Summary and outlook
2012 has been another year of good progress. Growth in our 
global Aerospace and Energy business outweighed the decline in 
Automotive and General Industrial markets in Europe. Improving 
business mix and the part-year benefit of acquisitions have enabled 
further improvements in performance and enhanced the Group’s 
geographic balance.
2013 has started slowly and we are mindful of the near term 
macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, at this early stage in 
the year the Board expects modest progress in 2013.
Looking further ahead, the improvements made to the business in 
recent years give the Board confidence that Bodycote will continue 
to deliver good profits and cash through the business cycle.

Markets
In automotive, in the face of reduced demand in all geographies 
except North America, the Group built on the gains achieved 
in 2010 and 2011 by offering the broad range of new and 
traditional processes the sector requires, along with the 
reliability of service and supply that the extensive network 
of facilities can offer. Sales to the car and light truck sector 
declined by 7 .1% and to heavy truck by 15.1%.
General industrial revenue performance was mixed by sector and 
geography. Sales decreased in the year by 0.5%.
In North America automotive revenues improved strongly and 
for the year as a whole were ahead of 2011 by 25.9% (25.0% at 
constant exchange rates, of which 5.8% was organic and 19.2% 
from acquisitions). Car and light truck related sales increased by 
23.1% and heavy truck increased by 40.1%. General industrial sales 
also advanced well and revenues were ahead 25.0% compared to 
2011 (23.9% at constant currencies of which 6.5% was organic and 
17 .4% from acquisitions).
In Western Europe sales were significantly impacted both by 
reduced demand and currency translation effects due to the 
weakness of the Euro versus Sterling. Automotive revenues were 
down 14.5% in 2012 (9.5% in constant currencies, there were no 
acquisitions). Car and light truck fared better (down 11 .8%, 6.0% in 
constant currencies) than heavy truck, which was lower by 22.6% 
(19.9% in constant currencies). General industrial sales were much 
less affected but were, nevertheless, down compared to 2011 
by 6.3% (but only 0.6% in constant currencies, there were no 
acquisitions).
The Group’s business in emerging markets had a disappointing 
year, with sales lower year on year by 13.1% (6.5% at constant 
currencies, there were no acquisitions). In Eastern Europe weak 
demand from Germany and France saw our customers reducing 
their output in Poland and the Czech Republic rather than cut back in 
their home countries. Asia, notably China for Bodycote, witnessed 
a short term slow-down in manufacturing activity and Bodycote’s 
business in Brazil was impacted by a significant reduction in 
industrial activity in 2012.
Aerospace and defence revenues improved in 2012 by 17 .5% 
(18.7% at constant exchange rates, of which 13.5% was 
organic and 5.2% from acquisitions), due to a combination of 
new contract gains, market share improvement and market 
demand. 
Original equipment sales improved as both Boeing and Airbus 
continued to increase production rates. Available seat kilometres 
grew by 3.9% indicating an increase in aircraft flying hours, which 
in turn drove an increase in demand for aftermarket parts. Sales 
growth in North America covered most sectors of the aerospace 
industry but in Europe was primarily due to the supply chain for 
narrow body aircraft. Sales for engines for wide body aircraft have, 
as yet, been more muted.
Sales into the defence sector, which account for around 5% of 
Group sales, were robust with little or no evidence of the downturn 
reported in the industry finding its way to the platforms that 
Bodycote serves. Most of the Group’s revenues come from the 
installed equipment base, with a heavy emphasis on applications 
for US homeland defence.
Power generation sales increased by 3.5% in 2012 (6.3% at 
constant exchange rates, of which 3.3% was organic and 3.0% 
from acquisitions) compared to 2011 and would have been higher 
but for capacity constraints in our US HIP business. Additional 
capability is due on-stream towards the end of 2013. Once again 
demand was stronger in North America than in Europe.
Sales to oil & gas customers increased by 21 .8% (22.3% at 
constant exchange rates, of which 15.4% was organic and 6.9% 
from acquisitions). Much of this growth came from gains in subsea 
applications and market share wins. Requirements for gas fracking 
in North America have subsided as the year progressed and this has 
been exacerbated by inventory correction at the oilfield services 
companies. The switch from gas fracking to oil provided some 
mitigation as rigs were made ready for production in a new location.

Subsea components
Components operating in the harsh environments of the oil & gas industry 
must withstand extreme material demands and resist attack from a variety of 
aggressive mediums. Corrosion and wear can lead to expensive downtime in 
exploration, where equipment is in continual use. The application of thermally 
sprayed coatings and the use of powder metal HIPed Near Net Shape (PM - 
NNS) components offer optimised material solutions allowing these components 
to operate reliably for extended periods of time, reducing cost and downtime.

Revenues for the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) business 
were £260.4m in 2012 compared to £233.5m in 2011, an increase 
of 11 .5% (12.6% in constant currencies made up of 8.4% organic 
growth and 4.2% from acquisitions). Organic revenue growth in 
the year reflects further strong demand from aerospace customers 
in all geographies and market share gains, particularly for subsea 
oil & gas requirements. Revenues for onshore oil & gas began 
the year strongly but slowed in the second half, as gas fracking 
requirements fell. 
 
Headline operating profit
1
 for ADE was £69.6m (2011: £51 .1m). The 
headline operating profit margin improved from 21 .9% to 26.7% as 
a result of improved mix of business and higher capacity utilisation.
 
In 2012, the Group has added capacity in a number of aerospace 
focused facilities, notably in California to ensure customer demand 
is met. The acquisition of three aerospace facilities in Wichita, 
Kansas at the end of the first quarter also added capacity to the 
Group’s network. In the coming year it is expected that capital 
expenditure will again be slightly above depreciation as further 
capacity and capability are added to support continuing growth in 
aerospace demand. 
Net capital expenditure in 2012 was £21 .1m (2011: £15.2m) which 
represents 1 .1 times depreciation (2011: 0.8 times).
Capital employed in ADE in 2012 was £233.6m (2011: £219.2m). 
The small increase is primarily due to investment in new capacity to 
meet continued sales growth in the aerospace markets. Return on 
capital employed in 2012 was 29.8% (2011: 23.3%).
Achievements in 2012
ADE made considerable progress during the year in gaining new 
agreements with a range of customers and for a variety of end 
uses. In heat treatment this included additional business with aero 
engine OEMs both for new build and repair and with the supply 
chain for aircraft structural components. The Group’s unrivalled 
capabilities across heat treatment, metal joining and hot isostatic 
pressing are a key selling point. Bodycote’s new presence in the 
Wichita, Kansas market has seen Bodycote gain new business with 
several customers there, while the greenfield site in Empalme, 
Mexico has entered into a number of new contracts. In HIP , new 
customers, who are key suppliers to the oil majors in the subsea oil 
& gas market, have been serviced for the first time in 2012.
 
Organisation and people
Overall full time equivalent headcount at 31 December 2012 was 
2,123 (2011: 1,983), an increase of 7% compared to revenue growth 
in ADE of 11 .5%. At 31 December 2012 the headcount included 132 
full time equivalents from the acquisition completed in 2012.
Looking ahead
Order books for commercial aerospace OEMs remain strong, 
although the increase in aircraft build rates in the higher volume 
platforms is now slowing and there is some short term softness 
in oil & gas demand. Notwithstanding the slower pace of market 
growth that is anticipated in the near term, Bodycote expects to 
be able to capitalise on its world leading position and once again 
outperform the market.

Drivetrain components
The automotive industry faces numerous challenges, ranging from consumer 
driven price and reliability expectations to enhanced environmental and 
efficiency requirements. Drivetrain components are subjected to high 
operational loads and can be exposed to extreme environments. The 
manufacturer’s choice of material combined with Bodycote’s various processes 
ensure that every component in the drivetrain operates to design specifications. 
Many parts are hardened to attain the required strength, whilst others are 
hardened in local areas prone to wear. Additional procedures can be carried out

Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business revenues were 
£327 .4m in 2012, compared to £337 .2m in 2011, a decrease of 2.9% 
(but an increase of 2.2% in constant currencies, made up of an 
organic decline of 1 .6% and an increase from acquisitions of 3.8%). 
In 2012 there was a clear difference in demand for the Group’s 
services across the different geographies. North America followed 
a strong 2011 with a robust 2012 in both automotive and general 
industrial markets and revenues continued to be enhanced by 
market share gains. North American revenues grew by 10.5% 
excluding acquisitions and in constant currencies. In Europe and the 
emerging markets Group revenues declined by 3.4% (in constant 
currencies) driven by the weaker macroeconomic conditions 
particularly in the Eurozone.
Headline operating profit
1
 in AGI was £43.6m compared to £44.7m 
in 2011 . Despite the reduction in revenues, headline margins 
remained stable at 13.3% reflecting an improved mix in the 
business and a prompt reaction in managing costs in geographies 
where demand levels weakened.
Net capital expenditure in 2012 was £23.0m (2011: £27 .0m), which 
represents 0.8 times depreciation (2011: 0.9 times). In 2013 we 
expect that capital expenditure will be just above depreciation as 
we add capacity in China, Mexico and for selected technologies 
such as S
3
P , Corr-i-Dur
®
 and Low Pressure Carburising. Return 
on capital employed in 2012 was 16.3% (2011: 15.6%). The 
increase reflects continuing focus on improving capital returns by 
increasingly targeting higher added-value activities. On average, 
capital employed in 2012 was £267 .5m (2011: £286.2m).
Achievements in 2012
The Group has continued to win business across all geographies. In 
North America our ability to support automotive manufacturers as 
they move to newer technologies in pursuit of better fuel efficiency 
has provided Bodycote with market share growth. New outsourcing 
contracts in Europe and contributions from differentiated 
technologies such as S
3
P meant that the revenue declines 
stemming from the weak economic environment were moderated 
and margins held up well. 
AGI continued to see the benefits of restructuring and market 
focus. The emphasis on improved efficiency has been a key factor 
in the achievement of 20% margins in North America and the 
maintenance of margins in the low teens in Europe in the face of 
declining revenues.
Organisation and people
At December 2012, the number of full time equivalent employees in 
AGI was 3,595 (including 415 from acquisitions completed in 2012) 
compared to 3,423 at the end of 2011 and 1,606 less than its peak 
in July 2008. AGI revenues of £327 .4m compare to £352.7m in 2008 
(at 2012 exchange rates) a decrease of 7 .2%.
Looking ahead
The AGI divisions will continue to build on their success of 
enhancing their margins through capturing high value work. The 
focus on improving customer service helps drive this effort while 
the prioritisation of existing capacity in favour of higher value work 
and investing in selected technologies such as S
3
P , Corr-i-Dur
®
 
and Low Pressure Carburising provides additional momentum. In 
addition the Group will continue with its strategy of adding to its 
existing footprint in emerging markets, with an emphasis on China 
and Mexico in the near term.

Headline operating profit for the year increased by 14.4% from 
£85.5m to £97 .9m, and headline operating margin was 16.6% (2011: 
15.0%). Acquisitions in the year increased headline operating profit 
by £5.1m. The impact of foreign currency movements in the year 
was a reduction in headline operating profit of £2.2m. Operating 
profit was £93.4m (2011: £80.4m) after charging £2.0m (2011:

A profit on disposal of the Group’s investment in Ionbond of £2.4m 
(2011: £nil) and reorganisation costs of £2.4m (2011: £nil) were also 
recognised.
Headline operating cash flow
1
 for the Group was £110.8m (2011: 
£96.0m). This was 113.2% of headline operating profit (2011: 
112.3%). Net capital expenditure was again below depreciation 
at 0.9 times (2011: 0.9 times) as the Group continued to focus on 
increasing the utilisation of existing equipment. Working capital 
reduced in the year, with increases in the level of inventory more 
than offset by an increase in the level of payables.
After deducting interest and tax, the Group recorded positive free 
cash flow

 of £81 .2m (2011: £70.5m).
Exceptional costs
Total exceptional costs charged to the income statement amounted 
to £4.5m (2011: £5.1m). The amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets arises from acquisitions in both the current and prior years 
and the level of the charge has increased to £2.0m (2011: £0.9m). 
£2.5m of acquisition costs were expensed in the year (2011: £nil). 
A profit on disposal of investment of £2.4m (2011: £nil) has been 
recognised and reorganisation and redundancy costs of £2.4m 
(2011: £nil) have been incurred in relation to the establishment of an 
accounting Shared Service Centre in Prague.
The 2011 charge of £4.2m for impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets related to the Group’s South American operations. 
No goodwill remains on the Group’s balance sheet in respect of this 
business. The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is 
required in 2012.
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2012 total 
£11 .5m. Of the remaining costs, £6.2m is expected to be spent in 
2013 and £5.3m in 2014 and later. All expenditure after the end of 
2013 will relate to ongoing environmental remediation, primarily in 
the USA.

Finance charge
The net finance charge was £3.6m compared to £4.6m in 2011 (see 
details below) resulting from lower net interest rates (£0.1m) and 
lower average net debt (£0.6m). Facility fees (£0.3m) and financing 
costs (£0.6m) were lower than last year. Bank charges were similar, 
but pension and other finance charges were higher by £0.6m.

T axation
The tax charge was £22.8m for the year (2011: £19.8m).
The effective tax rate of 25.4% (2011: 26.1%) resulted from the 
blending of differing tax rates in each of the countries in which the 
Group operates.
The headline tax rate for 2012 was 25.7% (2011: 24.6%), being 
stated before accounting exceptionals, including amortisation of 
goodwill and acquired intangibles (which are generally not allowable 
for tax purposes).
Subject to any future tax legislation changes, due to the Group 
making most of its profits in countries other than the UK, the 
headline tax rate is expected to remain around current levels which 
is higher than the current UK statutory tax rate of 24%, and which 
is due to fall to 21% from 2014.
Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share (as defined in note 9) increased 
to 37 .4p from 32.7p. Basic earnings per share for the year increased 
to 35.8p from 30.0p.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 8.3p (2011: 7 .3p) 
bringing the total dividend to 12.3p per share (2011: 10.9p). If 
approved by shareholders, the final dividend of 8.3p per share for 
2012 will be paid on 7 May 2013 to all shareholders on the register 
on 12 April 2013.

Total before net debt 782.6 (244.0) 538.6
Net debt 10.0 (44.2) (34.2)
Net assets as at  
31 December 2012 792.6 (288.2) 504.4
Net assets as at  
31 December 2011 758.7 (276.1) 482.6
Net assets increased by £21 .8m (4.5%) to £504.4m (2011: 
£482.6m). In constant currencies, net assets increased by £45.3m 
(9.4%). The major movements compared to 31 December 2011 
were an increase in goodwill and intangible assets of £55.3m 
primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during the year, an 
increase in net debt of £34.3m, an increase in retirement benefit 
obligations of £5.0m, an increase in property, plant and equipment 
of £4.8m, together with an increase in other net current liabilities of 
£6.2m and a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of £4.1m.
The increase in property, plant and equipment was due to net 
capital expenditure of £47 .7m, depreciation of £48.7m, and 
additions through the acquisition of businesses of £22.0m, offset 
by the effect of disposals and foreign exchange variances.
Net deferred tax liabilities decreased by £4.1m due to an increase 
in deferred tax assets resulting from a charge to equity in respect 
of share-based payments and retirement benefit obligations, an 
adverse movement in foreign exchange rates and a net reduction in 
liabilities due to corporate tax rate changes in various jurisdictions. 
Restructuring provisions were reduced by £4.0m, as Group 
restructuring activities proceeded as planned.
Retirement benefit obligations increased by £5.0m during the year, 
largely as a result of a fall in corporate bond yields reducing the 
discount rate from 4.75% to 4.50% in the UK, which is the most 
significant liability. 24 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Net debt/(cash)
Group net debt at 31 December 2012 was £34.2m (2011: net cash 
£0.1m). During the year, additional loans of £27 .5m were drawn 
under committed facilities after funding £84.7m of acquisitions. 
The Group continues to be able to borrow at competitive rates and 
therefore currently deems this to be the most effective means of 
funding.
Cash flow
The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was £7 .6m (2011: 
£7 .7m), made up of net cash from operating activities of £131 .2m 
(2011: £119.8m), less investing activities of £130.6m (2011: £45.9m) 
and less cash used in financing activities of £8.2m (2011: £81 .6m).
The increase in net cash flow from operating activities from 
£119.8m to £131 .2m is driven primarily by the increase in headline
EBITDA
1
 from £142.3m to £153.1m. Working capital decreased 
as tight control of working capital led to a small increase in the 
level of inventory being offset by an increase in trade payables. 
Net current tax liabilities also increased by £4.1m in line with the 
profitability of the Group. The continuing utilisation of environmental 
and restructuring provisions offset the working capital reduction by 
£2.8m. The net effect was a decrease in the level of working capital 
of £2.1m (2011: increase of £6.3m).
Net cash outflows from investing activities increased from £45.9m 
to £130.6m, primarily due to acquisitions in the year as disclosed 
in note 24. The level of net capital expenditure in 2012 at £47 .7m 
(2011: £44.5m), although higher than in the prior year, remained 
below historical levels, reflecting continued tight management 
control. 
Net cash outflows used in financing activities decreased from 
£81 .6m to £8.2m. 2012 saw the repayment of loans of £2.3m 
(2011: £59.3m) and new bank loans raised of £28.8m (2011: £0.4m), 
together with payment of dividends totalling £21 .3m (2011: £17 .4m).
There has been a continued focus on cash collection with 
receivable days at 31 December 2012 reducing to 58 days (2011: 59 
days).
Net interest payments for the year were £2.5m (2011: £4.5m). Tax 
payments were £19.3m (2011: £15.3m) reflecting the increase in 
Group profits.
Capital expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £47 .7m (2011: £44.5m). The 
multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was 0.9 times 
(2011: 0.9 times), which reflects the Group’s continued careful 
management of its capital expenditure programme. As at 31 
December 2012 the Group had capital expenditure creditors of 
£13.9m (2011: £13.1m). Major capital projects that were in progress 
during 2012 include continued investment in our HIP and S
3
P 
processes and additions to heat treatment capacity to support the 
aerospace sector.
Borrowing facilities
Total funding available to Bodycote under its committed facilities 
at 31 December 2012 was £232.6m (2011: £236.4m), expiring 
between July 2013 and August 2016.
There have been no new committed facilities arranged during 
2012, although the €125m revolving credit facility, due to mature 
on 31 July 2013, has been refinanced during February 2013. The 
replacement facility is for the same amount and is available from  
1 March 2013 maturing 1 March 2018. The new facility has a higher 
margin than the 2006 arranged facility it replaced.

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising the 
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Board. The 
Group’s policy is to maintain gearing, determined as the proportion 
of net debt to total capital, within defined parameters, allowing 
movement in the capital structure appropriate to the business cycle 
and corporate activity. The gearing ratio at 31 December 2012 has 
increased to 7% (2011: 0%).
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the UK, 
Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, USA and Brazil and cash lump 
sum obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the entire liabilities for 
which are reflected in the Group balance sheet.
The net deficits in these arrangements are as follows:
2012 
£m  
2011  
£m
Funded
UK 4.2 1.8
Other Western Europe 0.5 0.7

Unfunded
Western Europe 12.6 9.9
Emerging Markets 0.3 0.2
12.9 10.1

The UK plan is closed to new entrants but the 98 active members 
continue to accrue benefits. The arrangements in France, Italy and 
Turkey are open to new members. All other arrangements are 
closed to new entrants.
UK scheme liabilities have increased from £82.2m to £85.5m over 
the year. A fall in corporate bond yields has reduced the discount 
rate from 4.75% in 2011 to 4.50% in 2012, which increases

the present value of the liabilities. Changes in other actuarial 
assumptions have had minimal impact.
Assets have increased over the period from £80.4m to £81 .3m 
leading to a deficit of £4.2m as at 31 December 2012.
The liability for unfunded Western European schemes increased 
by £2.8m, primarily in France. As with the UK, the key reason for 
the increase in the deficit in the Western European schemes is a 
reduction in the corporate bond yields.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group is required to 
adopt IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits.

£m
Operating costs 1.1 1.5
Net finance charge 1.2 0.6
Total IAS 19 charge 2.3 2.1
The impact is summarised in the table above and the reasons for 
changes are:
 A £0.4m increase in operating costs as a result of the 
requirement to reclassify pension scheme administration costs 
from net finance charge to operating costs. Such costs include 
the PPF levy and actuary, audit, legal and trustee charges which, 
under the current IAS 19, are allowed to be included within the 
net finance charge.
 A £0.6m reduction in the net finance charge, being the sum 
of a £0.2m reduced charge due to the new requirement for 
the expected return on assets to be calculated by applying the 
corporate bond yield based discount rate to the balance sheet 
pension-related assets, and a £0.4m decrease as a result of the 
reclassification of the pension scheme administration costs to 
operating costs identified above. The Group expects the 2012 
pension deficit (as restated) to increase by £0.5m due to the 
removal of the option for the Group to adopt the corridor method 
of accounting for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.
The Group expects the 2012 pension deficit to increase by £0.5m 
due to the removal of the option to amortise past service costs 
over the vesting period. Any outstanding past service costs will be 
recognised in full at the start of the year.
Post balance sheet events
The €125m Revolving Credit Facility was refinanced on 18 February 
2013 and further details are noted opposite. There have been no 
other post balance sheet events.
Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report, the 
Directors have considered the Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position. This includes an overview of the Group’s financial 
position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through 
a combination of committed and uncommitted facilities and 
overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities are repayable 
on demand but the committed facilities are due for renewal as set 
out below. There is sufficient headroom in the committed facility 
covenants to assume that these facilities can be operated as 
contracted for the foreseeable future.
Committed facilities as at 31 December 2012 were as follows:
 €125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 July 2013
 £125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
 $10m Letter of Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
On 18 February 2013, the €125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 
on 31 July 2013 was refinanced for the same amount, extending 
the maturity to 1 March 2018, increasing the weighted average life 
of the committed facilities at that date to 4.2 years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable 
potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current committed 
facilities.
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to access further funding. The Directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the Directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Cautionary statement
The Group Review, as defined in the Directors’ Report, contains 
certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made 
by the Directors in good faith based on the information available 
to them up to the time of their approval of this report and such 
statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent 
uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, 
underlying any such forward-looking information.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Effective management of risks is essential to the delivery of the Group’s objective of creating superior shareholder returns. The Board 
is responsible for the Group’s risk management and the review of risk activities has been delegated to the Audit Committee. Under the 
leadership of the Vice President of Risk, Bodycote has developed the risk management framework to identify, report and manage its 
business critical risks. During the year a Risk Committee was established, represented by senior managers from each of the operating 
divisions. The role of the Risk Committee is to embed risk management and facilitate the implementation of risk management measures at 
a divisional level. 
A variety of approaches is used to identify and report risks, which are aggregated first at a sub-divisional level and then at Group level. For 
each business critical risk, assurance activities have been documented in risk assurance maps and this is used to direct assurance activity. 
The Vice President of Risk provides an update to the Audit Committee on the Group’s risk activities at every meeting and a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s business critical risks is presented in December. In addition, the Board examines a specific risk topic at each Board 
meeting.
The table below highlights the major risks that may affect Bodycote’s ability to deliver the strategy, as laid out in page 4. Details of the 
Group’s financial risks (funding, foreign exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks), which are managed by the Group’s treasury function, 
are provided in note 18 to the financial statements. The mitigating activities described below will help to reduce the impact or likelihood 
of the major risk occurring, although the Board recognises that it will not be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. Furthermore, there 
could be risks that may be unknown or that may be judged to be insignificant at present, but may later prove to be significant. For this 
reason more effort has been directed at measures to recover from a situation where a significant risk does crystallise. These include a 
comprehensive review of the Group’s business continuity planning measures and the development of crisis management planning. 
Risk Description and Impact Mitigation
Market and Customer Risks 
Markets
Bodycote’s exposure to macroeconomic performance means that it suffers from a high 
level of sales volatility. A substantial proportion of Bodycote’s sales are closely linked to 
the economic cycle: Sales in the markets served by the AGI businesses (63% of the total 
Group) tend to develop in line with or ahead of the economic cycle, whereas aerospace and 
defence sales (23%) tend to track behind the economic cycle. Sales to the energy sectors 
(14%) are closely linked to energy prices, which in turn can be affected by general economic 
activity. The high proportion of fixed costs in the business means that a drop in sales will 
have a significant impact on profitability. However, Bodycote’s presence in 26 countries 
in a wide variety of end-markets acts as a natural hedge to neutralise localised economic 
volatility. Nevertheless, the Board is mindful of the potential impact on demand for the 
Group’s services while uncertainty around the Eurozone debt and the US fiscal problems 
continues.
 Implement strategic plan with medium term objective 
of “above-market” sales growth, a focus on targeted 
“growth-premia” business segments and a more 
balanced geographic spread.
 Maintain flexibility of cost base e.g. by ensuring that a 
proportion of the workforce is employed on temporary 
contracts.
 Respond quickly to changes in customer demand on a 
local or a Group-wide level.
 Wide geographical and market sector spread of Group 
sales.
Loss of key customers
Bodycote benefits from many long-term relationships with key customers. Damage to, or 
loss of, any of these relationships would be detrimental to Group results and could affect 
the viability of one or more of Bodycote’s facilities. However, the Board believes this is 
unlikely as Bodycote strives to provide a high level of customer service and the Group’s 
network of strategically located facilities ensures that it is the supplier of choice to these 
major manufacturers. Furthermore there is no significant customer dependency, with the 
Group’s top ten customers accounting for less than 14% of sales and the balance made up 
by many thousands of customers.
 Continue focus on customer service and quality 
processes to maintain excellent relationships with 
major customers. Use key account management to 
monitor customer satisfaction with the Group’s service 
levels.
 Ensure there is no significant customer dependency.
Corporate and Community Risks
Human resources
Bodycote is reliant on its ability to attract, develop and retain staff of the right calibre to 
support its growth strategy. Competition for capable resources is high and there is a risk 
that Bodycote may not be able to attract or retain skilled individuals. As a market leader 
Bodycote is seen as a source of talent by competitors, while the Group competes with 
employers from a wide range of sectors to attract staff into the business. 
 Continue the development of an HR strategy to 
address the long-term development and retention  
of staff.
 Develop succession plans.

Risk Description and Impact Mitigation
Corporate and Community Risks
Safety and health
Bodycote is committed to providing a safe work environment for its employees. The nature 
of Bodycote’s activities presents safety and health risks which can have a significant 
impact on individual employees. Furthermore poor safety and health practices could lead to 
disruption of business, financial penalties and loss of reputation. 
 Group-wide health and safety policies set by the Group 
Chief Executive. 
 ISO 18000 compliant SHE management systems being 
implemented by Group Head of Safety, Health and 
Environment with the support of divisional safety and 
health teams.
 Programme in place to focus on reduction of incidents 
which could have a high impact. 
 Safety compliance audits at all plants at least once a 
year.
 Oversight of safety and health framework provided by 
the Group SHE Committee. 
Environment
Bodycote is committed to providing the highest level of protection to the environment. 
Environmental contamination could lead to health risks, disruption of business, financial 
costs and loss of reputation. 
Historical use of solvents and other hazardous chemicals by plants operated by Bodycote or 
by plants acquired by Bodycote could have led to ground contamination. The environmental 
regulations in many of the jurisdictions that Bodycote operates in impose actual or potential 
obligations on Bodycote to remediate contaminated sites. Bodycote incurs costs annually 
(2012: £1 .5m) in meeting its obligations and maintains a provision of £13.9m. If the provision 
is insufficient to meet the cost of remediation, then this could have an impact on the 
Group’s results. Some of the Group’s heat treatment plants continue to use solvents and 
hazardous chemicals in small quantities.
 Remediation of contaminated sites as required by local 
legislation.
 Reduction in the use of hazardous substances, such as 
chlorinated solvents.
 Environmental procedures and measures in place 
conforming to ISO 14001 (2012: 78% of plants).
 Environmental due diligence of businesses for 
acquisitions.
Operational Risks
Service quality
The Bodycote brand is reliant on the repeatable delivery of parts to agreed specification 
to an agreed timescale. Deterioration in quality or service levels can cause serious long-
term damage to Bodycote’s reputation with financial consequences such as the loss of a 
customer and the cost of damages or litigation. Work that is released into use which is not 
in compliance with specification could arise as a result of system or human failure. Bodycote 
has stringent quality systems in place managed by qualified staff. Where necessary plants 
have relevant accreditations, such as ISO 9001, Nadcap and TS 16949. 
 Maintain industry relevant accreditations.
 Quality systems and processes operated at plant level 
with oversight by divisional quality teams. 
 All plants subjected to internal and external quality 
audits and inspections at least once a year. 
Major disruption at a facility
Bodycote’s business processes are inherently risky and there is a possibility that a major 
fire or utility outage could lead to closure of a facility’s operation. In addition a number of 
sites are exposed to natural hazards, such as earthquakes, flooding and storms. As a result 
there is a possibility that service to Bodycote’s customers from the affected site could be 
disrupted. However Bodycote’s global network of 186 plants creates a framework to provide 
back-up capability for any affected facility.
 ISO 18000 compliant SHE management systems are 
being implemented by Group Head of Safety, Health 
and Environment with support of divisional safety and 
health teams.
 Programmed equipment maintenance and inspections. 
 Independent insurer inspections to assess hazard and 
business interruption risks. 
 Overhaul of business continuity and crisis 
management plans. 
Information technology projects
The efficient operation of the Group will rely increasingly on the proper development and 
operation of its IT systems. Bodycote is currently undergoing a group-wide implementation 
of a new ERP system. The impact of the re-engineered business processes will have 
significant long-term benefits on Bodycote’s operational effectiveness. However, failure to 
manage the implementation programme successfully could result in cost overruns and, 
potentially, disruption to the business.
 Project approval and progress subject to Board review.
 Project teams made up of skilled subject matter 
experts supplemented with third party advisors. 
 Best practice project management processes in place 
with assurance provided by third parties.
Regulatory Risks
Regulatory and legislative compliance
The global nature of Bodycote’s operations means that the Group has to comply with a 
wide range of local and international legislative requirements, including anti-bribery and anti-
competition legislation, taxation legislation, employment law and import and export controls. 
Failure to comply with legislation could lead to substantial financial penalties, disruption 
to business, diversion of management time, personal and corporate liability and loss of 
reputation.
 Establish business processes supported by HR 
policies and the Group Code of Conduct. 
 Implement whistleblower facility managed by a third 
party: the Open Door Line.
 Training and awareness programmes.
 Engage local specialists to support Bodycote at local, 
divisional and Group level.

Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers and to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations are 
sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one 
of the key challenges for management is to ensure availability of 
appropriately qualified people to support its continued growth. 
Bodycote is fortunate to have a competent and committed 
international team that is well-respected in technical and business 
circles. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people both 
at local and Group level. At a local level the Company is committed 
to providing the appropriate skills and technical training which will 
allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in their roles 
and deliver excellent customer service. At Group level a number 
of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive excellence in 
management.
A tool to develop further understanding and skill in the area 
of performance management has been built and has been 
cascaded globally through the management population. Through 
communication of clear messages coupled with skills development, 
the organisation aims to raise the capability of its management 
population in driving performance. This initiative is backed by a

Responsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical 
standard, consistent with an international UK-listed company. 
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal 
interests do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. 
Shareholder employees are advised of and comply with share 
dealing codes.
Bodycote has systems in place designed to ensure compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations and conformity with all relevant 
codes of business practice. Furthermore, Bodycote does not make 
political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ unfair 
trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within the 
requirements of the applicable laws. Employees are prohibited from 
either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern orally or in writing and in confidence to an independent 
third party provider to ensure anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Vice President of Risk, who then passes the matter 
to the appropriate individual in the business to address.
Bribery and Competition Law online training courses have been 
put in place, translated into the major languages used throughout 
the Group, and relevant employees have completed the interactive 
courses. 
Operational SHE performance
Bodycote is committed to building and maintaining a high reliability 
organisation; one that delivers consistently high performance 
across all aspects of safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
management. Its objective is to be known for the excellence of 
its SHE performance in all of its business activities and at all of its 
sites.
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
potentially exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of a robust safety management system 
which includes appropriate policies and procedures.
Although Bodycote has reduced its lost-time accident rate by 35% 
over the past five years, it recognises the need to improve further. 
Starting in 2012, a three-year global improvement strategy has been 
initiated, which focuses on all aspects of the safety management 
system, whilst developing cultural maturity. An important element 
of this is the role of leadership, including the active engagement 
of managers at all levels in managing safety, but recognising that 
all employees have responsibilities for their own safety and the 
safety of others. In keeping with this, a group-wide employee 
‘safety climate’ survey was undertaken in 2012, to which 41% of all 
employees responded. A number of specific improvement actions 
have been taken to address some of the concerns raised by the 
survey.
KPI – accident frequency (lost-time injury rate)
Accident frequency is defined as the number of lost time accidents 
per 200,000 hours worked.
Environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption and re-use energy. The continuing focus on 
lessening its impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
advancing towards ISO 14001 accreditation at all of its facilities, 
with most of the Group having already achieved this standard.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to reduce the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of our 
customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, which 
is operated around the clock so as to optimise thermal processing 
cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be using older 
technology in-house and running their equipment at reduced 
capacity, both of which are a drain on energy resources. Working 
with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more easily to 
carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of its customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and by enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in the 
reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering a cost-
effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to manufacture 
new replacement parts, and treated parts often last up to twenty 
times longer than the original.
So, whilst thermal processing is an energy-intensive business, it is 
a vital part of the manufacturing chain and its use saves the energy 
it consumes many times over.
ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is 
taken very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 
14001 helps to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects 
at Bodycote’s locations. At the end of 2012, the Group had 193 
locations and 78% of our operating facilities had achieved ISO 
14001 accreditation. The decrease in the percentage compared to 
prior years is due to facilities acquired which have not yet obtained 
accreditation. Excluding acquisitions, 86% of our facilities had 
achieved ISO 14001 accreditation.
KPI – Carbon footprint and water consumption
As a consequence of the increase in sales, and the acquisition of 
a number of new operational sites, the absolute electricity usage 
increased by 2% whilst gas usage increased by 14.4% - together 
accounting for an increase in energy usage of 8.8%. The total 
Group energy use excluding these acquisitions remained constant 
compared with 2011 .
Excluding acquisitions the carbon footprint decreased by 3.5% from 
629.1 tonnes per £m sales to 606.9 tonnes per £m sales. Including 
acquisitions the carbon footprint increased by 0.6% to 632.8 tonnes 
per £m of sales.
Water usage per £m sales decreased by 8%. The Group’s total 
CO
2
 emission data is based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
as defined by the UK Government’s Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs, and data relating to this has been calculated 
to include country-specific electricity conversion factors.
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
equipment has been introduced. In 2012 the overall solvent use 
decreased by 7% compared with the previous year. 32 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Corporate responsibility and sustainability continued
A greener, cleaner environment 
Reducing any detrimental impact on the environment 
has become a growing focus of industry worldwide and 
Bodycote can assist in the drive towards carbon reduction and 
environmentally friendly approaches in a number of ways.
For example, certain heat treatment and thermally sprayed 
surface treatments are leading the way in the replacement of 
older, less environmentally friendly processes such as chrome 
plating.
Future restrictions that will be placed on chrome plating due to 
health and environmental issues have led many businesses, 
including the major aerospace companies, to embark on 
initiatives to replace it. These companies have highlighted 
thermal spray coatings as the preferred replacement for 
chrome plating.
Bodycote has been involved in a number of initiatives to 
replace chrome plate and results have shown that, in addition 
to the environmental benefits, thermally sprayed tungsten 
carbide outperforms hard chrome plate for both wear and 
corrosion protection.
Modern thermal processing techniques have allowed 
designers and manufacturers to use much lighter materials, 
such as aluminium and titanium, and have significantly 
prolonged component lifetimes. Through the effective use 
of thermal processing, parts can now be lighter and overall 
component weight reduced, leading to improved efficiency and 
reduced fuel consumption of products in service. Financial statements Additional information

is provided on pages 4 to 32 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the businesses of the Group, the financial 
performance during the year ended 31 December 2012, key performance indicators, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group and information about the use of financial instruments. The Group review has been prepared solely to assist the 
shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other party for any 
other purpose. Forward-looking statements have been made by the Directors in good faith using information available up to the date of this 
report and such statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks. 
Since the end of the financial year no important events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 8.3p per ordinary share making a total for the year of 12.3p per share (2011: 10.9p). The final 
dividend, if approved, will be paid on 7 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 12 April 2013.
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2012 was £33.1m and during the year was increased by the issue 
of 160,421 ordinary shares between 8 March and 26 November 2012 for a total consideration of £252,458.79, in connection with the 
Company’s executive share incentive schemes. At the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2012 the shareholders authorised the Company 
to purchase up to 19,126,367 of its own shares. This authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 24 April 2013, at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 23. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 27 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by 
a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the Directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 38. Under 
the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,021,387 . 36 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as 
a whole, and the Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.
Directors
The current Directors and their biographical details are listed on pages 33 and 34 and all served throughout the year with the exception of 
Eva Lindqvist, who was appointed on 1 June 2012. Under the Articles of Association of the Company each Director must retire from office 
and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every third Annual General Meeting in order to continue to serve as a Director. 
However in view of the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further increase accountability, all Directors retired at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2012 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going forward all Directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting and 
will stand for re-election by the shareholders, if they wish to continue to serve as Directors of the Company. Accordingly, those Directors 
retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2013 Annual General Meeting are Messrs A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless, 
J.A. Biles, Dr K. Rajagopal and E.Lindqvist. After 10 years of service J.Vogelsang will retire at the 2013 Annual General Meeting and will not 
stand for re-election. The service agreements for Messrs Harris and Landless are terminable by 12 months’ notice. The remaining Directors 
do not have a service agreement with the Company and their appointments are terminable by six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and details of the Directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 46 to 51 . No Director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2012. Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) has 
remained in force for the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2012 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the benefit 
of the current Directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the course of 
their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the Directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the 
Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.
Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a Company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only 
had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential. 
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a ‘Situational 
Conflict’) which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one Company. In order to ensure that each 
Director was complying with the new duties, each Director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational 
Conflicts affected him or her. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict until 
September 2013 and permitted each affected Director to attend and vote at Bodycote Directors’ meetings, on the basis that each such 
Director continued to keep Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the 
interests of shareholders. Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman 
or the Nomination Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment of 
employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation in strategy, production, safety 
and health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to 
the Group made by their site and are advised of safety and health issues. The Group publishes in 11 languages, via the Group intranet, an 
electronic magazine for all staff detailing the Group’s activities, performance and some of its personalities. Under the Group’s Open Door 
Line, employees’ concerns can be voiced over the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 3,700 Bodycote 
employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology 
exchange and co-ordination. It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed 
by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the 
employment and arrange appropriate training. An equal opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Research and development
Product development and quality improvement at all Group companies is a continuous process. The Group has a policy of deploying the 
best technology available and actively seeking improvements. It also conducts research programmes with its customers.
Donations
Charitable donations during the year net of income tax amounted to £2,000 (2011: £9,000). There were no political contributions in 2011 or 
2012.
Creditors policy
Group operating companies are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which business transactions are conducted. It is 
Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with the terms agreed, provided that these suppliers have also complied 
with applicable terms and conditions. Creditor days at the year end for the Group were 45 days (2011: 47 days).

Bodycote recognising that good governance serves to ensure that the business is run to achieve growth on a controlled and ongoing basis. 
What I believe are the important governance developments at Bodycote over the last year are detailed in Governance reporting below.
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles of corporate governance contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code by promoting wide discussions on topics to which Board members contribute and demonstrate mutual 
engagement. We strive to maintain best practice and continually seek to improve our practices for the benefit of our shareholders.

Board diversity
Following the publication of the Davies Report on the representation of women on plc boards, our Nominations Committee discussed its 
recommendation.
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 26 countries and therefore diversity generally is an integral part of how we do business. 
The Nominations Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant skills, experience, 
knowledge, personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our overriding aim in any 
new appointments must always be to select the best candidate. We have made progress in addressing the issue of gender and diversity, 
with the appointment of Eva Lindqvist to the Board as a Non Executive Director on 1 June 2012. As and when we are recruiting new 
members we would expect to continue to address the issue of gender and ethnicity. Due to the small size of our Board, comprising two 
Executive Directors and four non-Executive Directors and a non-Executive Chairman, we believe it difficult to set targets or timescales for 
the percentage of women, or any other group, on our Board and do not propose to set targets for the percentage of women on our Board in 
future years. 
Female representation on our Board is currently 14% and at manager level it is 23%. We will increase female representation on the Board if 
appropriate candidates are available when Board vacancies arise. Females represent 16% of our total workforce.
Board evaluation
The Board has undertaken its first external Board Evaluation during 2012. Following a review of proposals from five external facilitators, the 
Board appointed ICSA Board Evaluation to facilitate a review of its performance.
The facilitator Mr Geoffrey Shepheard met with each director on an individual basis to obtain their views on seven aspects of the Board’s 
performance and to ascertain whether their needs and expectations were being met. The evaluator ensured that pre-defined constituent 
elements of each topic were covered in the discussions and a qualitative score was assigned by each director. The seven topics were as 
follows:
 Board responsibilities
 Oversight
 Board meetings
 Support for the board
 Board composition
 Working together
 Outcome and achievements
The results of the evaluation were considered by the Board at its meeting in October 2012 and the directors discussed the 
recommendations which are now in the process of being implemented. Additional emphasis will be placed on risk management and certain 
operational matters. The approach to Board Evaluation included relevant questions to cover the activities of each Board committee.
The report concluded that the Board was performing well and high governance standards had been adopted. Strong evidence of cohesion 
and genuine support for colleagues was noted and it was apparent that the Executive is strongly challenged when appropriate. 
Arising from the exercise, the Board has concluded that its focus should remain on divisional growth strategies, technology development, 
risk and sustainability as well as continued training. Financial statements Additional information

Governance Business review
The Executive Directors Messrs S.C. Harris and D.F . Landless were appraised internally in January and February 2013. 
Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the Directors have carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in 
December 2012. The performance of the other individual Non-Executive Directors was appraised internally by the Chairman.
T raining
All new directors receive initial induction training on a diverse range of topics including trading, investor relations, organisational and legal 
matters. The Board receives training via ad hoc presentations and papers from advisers and the Company Secretary. External periodic 
training on important topics takes place through the Deloitte Academy and during the year the directors received training on trends in 
financial reporting, corporate governance and risk management.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. The plans 
are regularly reviewed by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.
The road map for Non-Executive refreshment continued to be developed in 2012.
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2012 Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in June 2010 (the ‘Code’).
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the 2010 Code and has voluntarily adopted 
most of The UK Corporate Governance Code issued in September 2012 (as reflected in the Report of the Audit Committee), with the 
exception of provision E1 .1 . The Board has taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Finance Director to manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss overall 
strategy, governance and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of communication have failed 
would the Board expect the Senior Independent or other Non-Executive Directors to become involved, notwithstanding that the 2010 Code 
specifies attendance of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at meetings with major shareholders. Regular feedback by the 
Company’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all Directors.
Apart from this distinct area, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the 2010 Code throughout 2012.
Operation of the code
Taken together with the Report of the Audit Committee, the Report of the Nomination Committee and the Board report on remuneration 
presented on pages 38 to 51, this statement explains how Bodycote has applied the principles of good corporate governance set out in the 
2010 Code.
Leadership
The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Company’s strategic objectives, values and standards 
and ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on nine occasions during 2012, including a specific meeting to review and update the Company’s long-term strategy. The 
Board of Directors comprises seven members, of whom five are Non-Executive Directors and two are Executive Directors, led by the 
Company’s part-time Non-Executive Chairman, Mr A.M. Thomson, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Group Chief Executive is 
Mr S.C. Harris and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (‘SID’) was Mr J. Vogelsang, who chaired the Remuneration Committee 
until 14 December 2012 and who stepped down as SID at the conclusion of our AGM in 2012. The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr J.A. 
Biles, who was appointed SID after the conclusion of our AGM in 2012. Ms E. Lindqvist was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 1 June 
2012 and was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee as of 14 December 2012. After 10 years of service, Mr J Vogelsang 
will not stand for re-election at the 2013 AGM. Mr J. Vogelsang stepped down as a member of the Audit and Nomination Committee on 31 
December 2011 . Brief biographical details of all Directors are given on pages 33 and 34. The Board makes visits to UK sites and overseas 
facilities during the year. Certain defined powers and issues are reserved for the Board to decide, inter alia:
 Strategy;
 Approval of financial statements and circulars;
 Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
 Annual budgets;
 Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and 
succession planning;
 Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and 
environment, donations;
 Committees’ terms of reference;
 Board and committee chairmen and membership;
 Investments;
 Equity and bank financing;
 Internal control and risk management;
 Corporate governance;
 Key external and internal appointments; and
 Employee share incentives and pension arrangements. 40 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
In advance of Board meetings Directors are supplied with up-to-date information regarding the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year, budgets and forecasts. They are also 
supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and details of the safety and 
health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work.
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Company. All Directors 
have access to the Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. In 
accordance with the Articles of Association, all newly appointed Directors and any who have not stood for re-election at the two previous 
Annual General Meetings, if eligible, must submit themselves for re-election. However, this has been superseded by the Directors’ decision 
to stand for yearly re-election. Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding three years 
from the date of first election by shareholders, after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A statement of the 
Directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 52. The Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members serve for a period of six years which will only be extended in 
exceptional circumstances.
So that the necessary actions can be taken promptly, a Finance Sub-Committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing him any other Non-
Executive Director), the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director operates between the dates of scheduled Board meetings 
and is authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, tax or investment matters.

Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers that Messrs J.A. Biles, J. Vogelsang, Dr K. Rajagopal and Ms E. Lindqvist are all independent for the purposes of the 
Code. During 2013 J. Vogelsang will have served as a Board Director for 10 years and the Board recognises that his tenure has reached a 
threshold at which his independence could be called into question. However, given the importance of the experience and skills required 
to perform the role of Chair of the Remuneration Committee, J. Vogelsang remained as Chair of the Remuneration Committee until 14 
December 2012, when E. Lindqvist took over as Chair. J. Vogelsang will be a Board Director until the 2013 AGM, at which time he will not 
stand for re-election.

Remuneration Committees.
Proposals for re-election

Governance Business review
S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless, J.A. Biles and Dr K. Rajagopal will stand for re-election, and Ms E. Lindqvist having been appointed by the 
Board on 1 June 2012 will stand for election. After 10 years of service, Mr J. Vogelsang will not stand for re-election at the 2013 AGM. 
The Board recommends to shareholders that they re-elect or elect all the Directors. In accordance with the recommendations of the 
Code, Board members will serve for a period of six years which may be extended in exceptional circumstances.
The performance of each Director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social 
engagement. The Board continuously and regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of 2000 to the date 
of approval of this report and which is in accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published 
in September 1999 and with revised guidance on internal control published October 2005. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from 
management and from internal audit to consider whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging these review responsibilities.
The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix 
clearly sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
The Internal Audit department monitors the Group’s internal financial control system and its reviews are conducted on the basis of 
plans approved by the Audit Committee, to which Internal Audit reports are submitted on a regular basis.
Every Bodycote site provides assurance on specified financial and non-financial controls through a control self assessment process. 
The results are validated by Internal Audit through spot checks and are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition the President and 
the Vice President of Finance of each Division sign a letter of Representation annually. 
During 2012, in compliance with provision C.2.1, management performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. 
Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included a review of the Group’s key 
strategic and operational risks, which is summarised from work performed by VP of Risk and the Group’s Risk Committee to identify 
risks (by means of workshops, interviews, investigations and by reviewing departmental or divisional risk registers). The risks identified 
were assessed using conventional impact and likelihood scoring (both before and after mitigating actions), and further assessment, 
monitoring and review work was carried out in 2012. The Group’s risk management framework is progressively being embedded 
throughout the Group. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are shown on pages 26 and 27 . No significant previously 
unidentified risks were uncovered as part of this process, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy any 
significant failings or weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.
Investor relations
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and 
collectively, and this has enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy. Makinson Cowell 
undertook an investor audit and presented the views of shareholders to the November Board. During the year the Chairman met 
separately with three of the five largest shareholders to discuss governance matters. The business of the Annual General Meeting 
comprises a review of the Group’s operations for the benefit of shareholders attending. In addition, internet users are able to view 
up-to-date news on the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users of the website can access 
recent announcements and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a regular basis, Bodycote’s 
financial advisers, corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide the Directors with opinion surveys from analysts 
and investing institutions following visits and meetings with the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The Chairman and 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director are available to discuss any issues not resolved by the Group Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director. On specific issues, such as the introduction of long-term incentive and share matching schemes in 2006 and changes 
thereto in 2009 and 2010, the Company has sought and will continue to seek the views of leading investors.

Report of the Nomination Committee 
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose principal purpose is to advise on the appointment and, if necessary, 
dismissal of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are listed on the company’s website, 
include all matters required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on “The Code” can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website www.frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are reviewed periodically by the Company Secretary and any changes 
are then referred to the Board for approval. No changes were made to the terms of reference during the year. 
Composition of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises all the independent Non-Executive Directors together with the Chairman and Group Chief Executive. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be an independent Non-Executive Director.
As recommended by the Code the Chairman acts as the Chairman of the Committee which also comprises Messrs J. A. Biles, S.C. Harris, 
Dr. K. Rajagopal and Ms. E. Lindqvist (appointed 1 June 2012). J. Vogelsang, after 9 years of service, retired from the Committee on 31 
December 2011 . The Chairman may not chair the Committee when it is dealing with the matter of succession to the Chairmanship of the 
Company. Only members of the Committee have the right to attend the Committee meetings. Other individuals and external advisers may 
be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that is required, from any officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries. 
In connection with its duties, the Committee is authorised by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or other 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense) as it considers necessary, including requests for information from, or commissioning 
investigations by, external advisers.
Main activities of the Nomination Committee
In 2012 the Committee formally met four times and reviewed the skills of the Board, with a view to considering the current and future skills 
and experience which the Board might require.
The Committee discussed succession planning, board diversity and reviewed the performance of the Group Chief Executive and other 
senior executives. In particular, the need to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed. The 
Chairman led the ensuing recruitment project and Egon Zehnder, an international search firm, was engaged to identify suitable candidates 
with relevant experience. Egon Zehnder produced a shortlist of candidates and a sub-group of the Committee met with the shortlisted 
candidates. All members of the Committee and the Executive Directors met with the preferred candidate prior to confirmation of her 
appointment. Eva Lindqvist, a Swedish national and qualified engineer, was appointed to the Board in June 2012. She has lived and worked 
at senior management level in Europe, North America and Asia over the last 30 years. The Committee also considered and approved the 
appointment of J. Biles as Senior Independent Director (SID) with effect from 1 April 2012 in succession to J. Vogelsang.
The Committee considered and authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might arise where a Director has fiduciary 
responsibilities in respect of other organisations. The Committee concluded that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee 
also assigned the Chairman to review and agree with the Group Chief Executive the Group’s objectives for the forthcoming year.
In December 2012 the Nomination Committee reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of the process for Board and 
Committee meetings, best practice for the handling of a number of Board issues including defining the Committee’s terms of reference and 
drawing up a training programme for Directors. In anticipation of the retirement of J. Vogelsang at the 2013 Annual General Meeting, the 
succession of the Remuneration Committee Chairman was addressed and E. Lindqvist was appointed Chairman of that Committee with 
effect from 14 December 2012.
In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code the Committee carried out its first external Board Evaluation during 2012. The project was 
undertaken by Geoffrey Shepheard of ICSA Board Evaluation, who presented the report to the October Nomination Committee meeting, 
with both Executive and Non-Executive Directors in attendance. Further details of the review can be found in the Corporate Governance 
section of the Annual Report. Recommendations arising from the 2012 Board Evaluation are in the process of being addressed.
As Chairman of the Committee I will be available at the 2013 Annual General Meeting to answer questions relating to the work of the 
Committee.

Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main role is to encourage and safeguard the highest standards of integrity, 
financial reporting, risk management and internal controls.
The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in written terms of reference which include all matters indicated by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Code, which are available for inspection on the Company’s website, and include reviewing the form and content 
of interim and year end accounts and results announcements, risk management and internal financial controls, monitoring internal audit, 
considering the appointment of the external auditor and agreeing the nature and scope of their work and monitoring and reviewing their 
independence, objectivity and effectiveness.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises J.A. Biles, Dr K. Rajagopal and E. Lindqvist (appointed 1 June 2012) who are all independent Non-
Executive Directors. J. Vogelsang, who was a member of the Audit Committee resigned as a member of the Committee on 31 December 
2011 . Their biographical details are set out on pages 33 and 34 and their remuneration is shown on page 50. The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee since 16 August 2007 has been Mr J.A. Biles, who was appointed a Director on that date, following a recommendation from 
the Nomination Committee. The Audit Committee Chairman is considered to have recent and relevant financial experience. Mr Biles is a 
chartered accountant, who served as a plc finance director (FKI plc from 1998 to 2004 and Chubb Security plc from 1991 to 1997) and until 
its takeover in January 2012 was also the Chairman of the Audit Committee of Charter International plc (2005-2012). The Company Secretary 
is secretary to the Audit Committee. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, J Vogelsang, Group Financial Controller, 
Vice President of Risk, Group Treasurer, Head of Tax, other senior finance personnel, external auditor and internal auditors attend Audit 
Committee meetings as appropriate by invitation.
Fair, balanced and understandable Overview of Annual Report and Accounts
In light of discussions undertaken by the Directors during Board and Audit Committee meetings, the Directors were satisfied that the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Main activities of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met four times during 2012, and in February 2013, to consider this financial report and all Committee members 
attended the maximum number of meetings they were scheduled to attend. The Committee also meets separately with the Vice President 
of Risk, internal auditors and with the external auditor, without management being present, after the end of most formal meetings.
In addition, the Committee Chairman has preparatory meetings with the external auditor, internal auditors and, where necessary, with 
Group senior management, prior to Committee meetings. At their meetings, the Audit Committee considers an agenda of items including 
the minutes of the last meeting and a list of action points from previous meetings, to ensure that these are progressed. In addition, a 
number of specific items were reviewed:
 Significant issues, judgements and estimates in relation to the financial statements were considered and addressed by the Committee 
by discussing and challenging these during meetings. The Committee considered the following key estimates and judgements ensuring 
that appropriate rigour had been applied as part of the year end process:
 The accounting for the acquisitions in the year, in particular the assumptions adopted in determining the fair value of assets and 
liabilities including goodwill and intangible assets
 The appropriateness of the Company’s tax provisions were reviewed on a country by country basis taking account of acquisitions 
completed in 2012 to ensure that tax provisions were adequately stated
 Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible fixed assets, including an assessment of the discount rates used, and the 
appropriateness of specific risk factors applied to cash generating units and the adequacy of sensitivities applied
 Environmental costs, including the adequacy of the Group’s provisions
 Remaining restructuring actions, and the appropriateness of outstanding provisions
 Claims provisions and litigation, including the adequacy and valuation of provisions
 Validity of the going concern assumption used in preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts was reviewed in considerable depth. 
Appropriate downside sensitivity analysis has been performed on net debt profile, committed facility headroom, financial covenants 
and Euro based sales. There is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
even if the situation outlined in the sensitivity analysis occurred
 Actuarial assumptions relating to retirement benefit schemes
 A quarterly report on internal audit from the Vice President of Risk was presented at each meeting and the findings discussed. During 
the year the plan for the ensuing year’s work was considered.
 The external auditor also presented, for the year end statutory audit and interim review engagements respectively, their audit plans 
at the December and April meetings covering scope of work to be done and during the year there was a detailed review of their 
management letter covering the auditor’s findings in respect of 2011 . 44 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
 The external auditor presents their audit plan and procedures, and in particular the identification of significant risks, to the Audit 
Committee every year before the interim and the final audit. Following completion of the audit, the external auditor confirmed that no 
additional matters had arisen during the audit which would have required them to alter their planned procedures. The Audit Committee 
also requested feedback from both management and audit teams as well as operating companies’ financial management about the 
effectiveness of the audit carried out in the various locations around the world where the Company operates.
 The Audit Committee is also presented with an update on any material litigation in which the Group may be involved.
 At each meeting an update is presented on any new accounting developments and requirements and any changes in corporate 
governance arrangements that may affect the Group.
 On a regular basis, the Committee reviewed papers on liquidity, banking arrangements and the appropriateness of the going concern 
assumption for preparation of the financial statements. The Committee’s activities supported the Directors in their assessment of the 
going concern position of the Group, which is set out on page 25.
 The Audit Committee met with the external auditor without management.
 The Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process and reported to the Board.
The Vice President of Risk has responsibility for developing the Group’s risk management framework, including internal audit, and 
enhancing the Group’s risk assessment and mitigation activities. This appointment demonstrates the Board’s continued commitment to 
maintain sound risk management and internal control systems. 
During 2012 the Audit Committee also:
 assessed and confirmed the independence of the external auditor;
 having reviewed the effectiveness of the audit, the performance and capabilities of the external auditor and having taken into account 
their tenure of office from 2002 and whether the position should be formally tendered, recommended to the Board that the auditor be 
reappointed and agreed their fees;
 discussed putting the audit out to tender after the conclusion of the audit of the accounts for the year ending 31 December 2019, five 
years after the current audit partner rotates off the assignment;
 approved the Group’s accounting policies;
 approved the management representations to the external auditor;
 reviewed arrangements for reporting and investigating fraud and employee concerns; normal internal audit activity and operation of the 
Group’s ‘Open Door’ policy uncovered a small number of potentially fraudulent incidents which were all fully investigated. None had any 
material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and procedures were amended to minimise the risk  
of recurrence;
 reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management processes and recommended certain changes;
 reviewed the terms of reference for the Audit Committee; and
 assessed the Committee’s own effectiveness.
T raining
The Committee receives regular technical updates as part of the agenda of each Committee meeting as well as specific or personal training 
as required. A training session was held during November 2012, where Deloitte updated the Committee on a number of relevant accounting 
matters and discussed trends in corporate reporting.
Independence of external auditor
The Audit Committee has put in place safeguards to ensure that the independence of the audit is not compromised. In this respect, the 
Audit Committee reviewed:
 the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory auditor, who signs the audit report and who, in 
accordance with the professional rules, has not held office for more than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff;
 the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship; and
 the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor as specified below.
Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are available in note 3 on page 71 . There has been no significant non-audit engagement.
Report of the Audit Committee continued Financial statements Additional information

Governance Business review
The policy in respect of services provided by the external auditor is as follows:
 Audit-related services: The external auditor is invited to provide services where their position as auditor renders them best placed 
to undertake the work. This includes reporting and certification connected with borrowings, shareholders and circulars, regulatory 
requirements and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals.
 Other services: No contracts in excess of £20,000 in value can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
 Tax and general consulting work: In general and where conflict could arise, the work is not awarded to the external auditor and is 
put out to tender.
 There are no contractual restrictions on who the Audit Committee can choose as external auditor.
Internal audit
Following a review of the Group’s internal audit processes and capabilities a decision was taken by the Committee to outsource 
the major part of the internal audit provision. The Group went out to tender to three major accounting firms and after receiving 
presentations from them, the contract for services was awarded to Ernst & Young LLP , who commenced their work in April 2012.
Internal Audit independently reviews the risk and control processes operated by management. It carries out independent audits in 
accordance with an internal audit plan which is agreed with the Audit Committee before the start of the financial year. This plan takes 
account of the risk management framework surrounding major business risks in each operation and provides the required degree of 
coverage. The Audit Committee requires that all accounting centres are visited at least once every two years and that all plants are 
visited at least once every five years. From 2013 onwards additional assurance will be obtained through control self assessments, 
when all plants and accounting centres will be required to self certify annually the effective operation of their controls. The accuracy of 
these returns will be checked by Internal Audit. Internal Audit reports include recommendations to improve internal controls together 
with agreed managerial action plans to resolve issues raised. Internal audit follows up the implementation of recommendations and 
reports progress to senior management and the Audit Committee. The Committee noted that the 2012 Internal Audit programme was 
successfully completed. The effectiveness of the Internal Audit function is reviewed and discussed on an annual basis with the Vice 
President of Risk and the Engagement Partner of Ernst & Young LLP .
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference 
and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.

Remuneration policy and structure 
The Committee is responsible for remuneration policies that are consistent with the Group’s overall business strategy and thereby attract 
and retain high calibre executives at the same time as delivering value for shareholders. Remuneration includes both fixed and variable 
elements of pay, variable pay being clearly linked to superior performance. The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and 
variable performance based pay for each Executive Director based on the maximum entitlements.

Each of the above components is discussed in greater detail in the following sections of this report. The sections dealing with Directors’ 
emoluments paid, pensions and incentives have been audited.
Fixed elements of pay
Base salary
The Committee reviews base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives annually taking into account the responsibilities and 
performance of the individual, current market practice, pay in similar engineering businesses and companies of a comparable size and scale 
of operations. The Committee was also mindful of pay levels amongst the employee population.
The Executive Directors received inflationary salary increases for 2012 and 2013. The salaries of the Executive Directors are as follows:
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2012 Salary from 1 January 2013
S.C. Harris Group Chief Executive £457 ,800 £470,200
D.F . Landless Group Finance Director £292,400 £300,300
Pension
The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with 
those provided by other similar companies. 
Mr Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 22% of basic salary, of which £82,000 was waived during the year. 
In addition, in the event of death, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable. 
From April 2012 Mr Landless ceased to participate in the Group’s UK contributory defined benefit pension scheme due to him prospectively 
reaching the lifetime limit. Instead Mr Landless receives a salary supplement of 22% of basic salary up to the defined benefit scheme cap 
and 16% of base salary above the cap, of which £35,000 was waived during the year.
The defined benefit scheme is closed to new members and provides increases in pensionable salary capped at 3% per annum. The scheme 
also provides lump sum death-in-service benefits and pension benefits based on final pensionable salary. For Mr Landless death in service 
under the defined benefit scheme changed when he ceased to be a contributory member of the defined benefit scheme from four times 
basic salary with spousal pension to eight time’s basic salary without spousal pension.
An analysis of the accrued pension entitlements for Mr Landless under the defined benefit pension scheme during 2012 is given on page 51 .
Variable elements of pay
Clawback policy
During the year the Committee introduced a formal clawback policy for Executive Directors in respect of annual bonuses and long-term 
incentive awards. This clawback policy is to come into effect from 1 January 2013 and has been introduced to provide the Committee with 
discretionary powers to clawback performance based remuneration should exceptional circumstances occur. Such circumstances would 
include:
 Fraud;
 Misconduct;
 Significant misstatement of financial results; or
 Miscalculation of performance conditions. 
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such circumstances to have occurred during a performance period from 2013 onwards then 
the clawback policy will provide the Committee discretion to determine that any amounts paid or awards vested by reference to the relevant  48 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
period shall be clawed back. Clawback will start to apply to awards made from 2013 and the Committee expects that the mechanism 
to clawback any such amounts will be to reduce future annual bonus payments, reduce the value of subsisting awards that have, at the 
relevant time, not yet vested or by reducing the level of award to be made at the following grant date.
Annual bonuses
The annual bonus provides the Executive Directors and other senior executives with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus wholly 
payable in cash based on achievement of certain performance targets. Recognising that despite an increase, the Group Chief Executive 
remained behind many of his peers in terms of base salary in 2011, the maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Group Chief Executive 
was increased to 130% of base salary to ensure comparability in terms of total reward on achievement of superior performance. The 
structure of the annual bonus scheme in 2012 for Executive Directors was as follows:
Maximum Profit Cash flow Personal objectives Actual
% salary % weight % achieved % weight % achieved % weight % achieved % salary
S.C. Harris 130 70 48 10 10 20 15 95
D.F . Landless 100 70 48 10 10 20 15 73
The Committee also has discretion to reduce the awards by up to 10% if the safety performance is less than targeted.
For 2013 the Committee has determined that the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent 
on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives. No bonus will be paid for the cash 
management element unless the level of operating profit achieved is at least 95% of target. The target is based on budget exchange rates 
and acquisitions are excluded. In addition, future annual bonus payments will be subject to the Committee’s clawback policy as outlined 
previously.
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up 
to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an earnings 
per share (EPS) performance condition. The Committee, in determining the performance targets attached to awards, takes into account the 
current and forecasted performance for the business and its sector along with broker consensus to ensure stretch targets are set.
ROCE EPS
Award year Threshold performance Maximum performance Threshold performance Maximum performance 
2010 11 .1% 16% 19.8p 31 .0p
2011 14.6% 20% 28.3p 39.8p
2012 18.7% 23% 36.2p 62.15p
2013 18.7% 23% 42.0
1
p61.3
1
p
1 The 2012 EPS targets restated at exchange rates on 31 December 2012 correspond to 33.8p at threshold and 58.08p at maximum performance with the result that 2013 targets in real 
terms are ahead of those for 2012. 
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest. Regardless of 
ROCE performance, should EPS at the end of the performance period be below 16p for any BIP awards made between 2010 and 2011, 
below 31 .1p for awards made in 2012 and below 42p for awards made in 2013, then no award shall vest. Awards commence vesting 
progressively from zero on achievement of threshold performance with maximum performance resulting in awards vesting in full. In 
addition, the 2013 and future BIP awards will be subject to the Committee’s clawback policy as outlined previously.
The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and are cognisant of the fact that overdriving 
incentives on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short term capital starvation for the business.
The Committee intends to use the ROCE and EPS measures in combination for BIP Awards made in 2013. Details of the awards made 
under the BIP are provided on page 50. Following completion of the performance period the Remuneration Committee has determined 
that 175% of the BIP awards made in 2010 shall vest (2009: 175%) as the level of ROCE and EPS performance was 87 .5% and 87 .5% 
respectively. In reaching this conclusion, the Remuneration Committee took into account certain review procedures carried out by the 
external auditor.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (CIP)
The CIP provides a link between the Company’s short and long-term incentive arrangements and permits executives to invest in shares 
up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an 
annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years 
and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR 
growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 
1:2. 10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 . In addition, the 
2013 and future CIP awards will be subject to the Committee’s clawback policy as outlined previously.
As the performance period for the 2010 CIP award commenced on 1 May 2010 and ends on 30 April 2013, the outcome will be reported in 
next year’s report.

Advisors
During the year the Committee has taken independent advice from Ernst & Young LLP on remuneration together with legal advice from 
Eversheds. Fees relating to the Ernst & Young LLP services were £70,000, which included amongst other things, benchmarking of 
executive salaries, advice relating to the vesting of awards made under the Bodycote Incentive Plan both in the UK and overseas and advice 
regarding the proposed changes to the reporting of remuneration by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills. Ernst & Young LLP 
also advises the Company on tax matters and provides the internal audit service. Other fees included £2,000 paid to Eversheds in respect 
of Remuneration Committee advice.
T otal Shareholder Return
The graph on page 51 illustrates the Company’s TSR performance since 2007 relative to the FTSE All Share Industrial Index of which the 
Company is a component part. This sector is considered the most appropriate comparator group over the five-year period to 31 December 
2012. In line with market practice the calculation for TSR assumes reinvestment of dividends and is based on data provided by Datastream.
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period. All the Executive Directors have 
service agreements which are terminable by one year’s notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s remuneration in 
lieu of notice by the employer. One year’s remuneration does not include any BIP or CIP payments (which would be subject to the normal 
leaver provisions) or, by default, payment of any projected bonuses, instead any bonus payment due will be calculated by reference to the 
average of the previous three years. With the exception of David Landless, the Executive Directors do not have a change of control clause. 
David Landless’ service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 
and provides for one year’s remuneration on a change of control if his employment is terminated. To the extent that executive contracts are 
renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of best practice when entering into service contracts. 
In any case legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual 
incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a 
change in control or for payments in lieu of notice. Mr Harris’ service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr Landless’ contract is 
dated 26 September 2001 .
Long-term savings vehicle
During the financial year the Company made discretionary contributions into the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan. The plan is entirely 
cash based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior executives. The Committee considers the plan an essential tool 
to aid retention while recognising the need for executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning. Company contributions are 
discretionary and vary year on year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore the Company remains cost neutral and any 
risk in relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants. Contributions for the Executive Directors are 
shown on page 51 .
Shareholding policy
In 2005, the Committee introduced a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are 
expected, within five years of that date or commencement of employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect 
of Executive Directors the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. As at 31 December 2012, the Committee is satisfied that 
Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Fees retained for external Non-Executive Directorships
Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors. Stephen Harris was the only Executive Director with 
such a position held at Mondi plc from 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of £77 ,765.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Remuneration for the Chairman 
is determined by the whole Board (excluding the Chairman). Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes into 
account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved. The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of 
appointment which have been agreed in accordance with best practice which set out the terms of their appointment, including membership 
of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director. The letter also covers such matters as 
the confidentiality of information and Bodycote’s share dealing code. During 2011 the letters of appointment for the Chairman and each 
Non-Executive Director were renewed, each for a period of no longer than three years. Each is terminable under the Company’s Articles 
of Association, the Act, by the Director’s resignation or otherwise on six months’ notice if termination occurs before expiry of the term. To 
determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate calibre and 
expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other companies of a similar size and scale of operations and the time commitment 
attached to each appointment. The Board keeps fees under review. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any 
pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
Responsibility of Directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Board report on remuneration and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s report, the Finance Director’s report, all the information contained on pages 4 to 
51 together comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2012. It includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2013 and is signed on its behalf by:

Financial statements Business review
Independent auditor’s report 
To the Members of Bodycote plc 
We have audited the group financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2012, which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 29.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for  
our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the group financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 the Directors’ statement contained within the Group Review in relation to going concern;
 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 December 2012
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.
 
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC. 
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and are 
therefore subject to change.
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below. 
Going concern 
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s report on page 25. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at  
fair value. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company. 
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities are disposed of. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the directors have made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which 
are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
Goodwill on acquisition
Accounting for goodwill arising in a business combination requires an assessment of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or associate at the acquisition date. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of 
goodwill arising on acquisition are set out below. Governance Additional information

Financial statements Business review
In establishing the fair value for intangible assets recognised on acquisition and their estimated useful lives, the Group has to make 
various subjective assessments of projected data and takes account of the individual circumstances of the entity acquired. This includes 
consideration of trading data such as historic sales and profitability levels, assessment of the discount rate used to calculate present value, 
the likelihood of loss of customers, the ability of former owners to compete, together with the estimated impact of competition. 
Provisions for restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts 
that are both necessarily required by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group. Uncertainty arises in the 
estimation of site clean up and dilapidation costs. The Group has to make a subjective assessment of the cost involved based on previous 
experience, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in a wholly accurate prediction of the 
actual costs that may be incurred.
Provisions for environmental liabilities
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in 
other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. The provision is reviewed annually. Due to the significant uncertainty 
associated with the future level of such environmental liabilities there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the 
provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be incurred. The Directors take account of the advice of experts in 
quantifying the expected costs of future remediation.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are  
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £131 .8m (2011: £102.6m). Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of impairment are set out below.
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with actuarial 
assumptions, which are set out in note 29. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit schemes are set  
out below.
T axation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax 
provision, deferred tax provisions and income statement in the period in which such determination is made.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition. 
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.  60 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Non-current assets held for sale 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to acquired intangibles, followed by the other tangible 
assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to 
being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is recognised on the completion of 
services rendered. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established. 
The Group as lessee 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Group as lessor 
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2012 Governance Additional information

Financial statements Business review
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for: 
 Exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/hedge 
accounting); and 
 Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. 
Government grants 
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the 
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items consist of amortisation of acquired intangibles, impairment charges, and other one off items which the Group considers 
significant for separate disclosure. 
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to
state -managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations 
under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations 
being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are 
recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight- line 
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted 
for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is 
limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit. 62 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set -off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight- line method, on the following bases:
 
Freehold buildings 2% 
Leasehold property over the period of the lease 
Fixtures and fittings 10% – 20%

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments 
(see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in 
accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (Revised 2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income T axes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; and
 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash -generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

Financial statements Business review
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include: 
 significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or 
 default or delinquency in payments. 
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables. 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.  64 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, 
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes 
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months. 
Hedge accounting 
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements. 
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net  
investment hedges. 
Note 18 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. 
Fair value hedge 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedge 
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance 
with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period. 
Net investment hedge 
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses. 
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve. 
General information 
Bodycote plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Acts 1948 to 1980. The address of the registered 
office is given on page 34. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on page 35 of the Directors’ report. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in  
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the Foreign Currencies accounting 
policy above. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
 IFRS 1 (amended) Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters 
 IFRS 7 (amended)  Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets 
 IFRS 9   Financial Instruments  
 IFRS 10   Consolidated Financial Statements  
 IFRS 11   Joint Arrangements  
 IFRS 12   Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities  
 IFRS 13   Fair Value Measurement  
 IAS 19 (revised)   Employee Benefits  
 IAS 27 (revised)   Separate Financial Statements 
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows: 
 IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments;  
 IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures; and 
 IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension 
obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Group’s total obligation. It is likely that following the replacement of expected 
returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the income statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other 
comprehensive income increased. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.  66 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The Group’s reportable segments have been determined in accordance with the activity of the Group, focusing on key market sectors. 
Principally, this splits the Group into two business areas being:
 Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE); and 
 Automotive & General Industrial (AGI). 
This initial split is determined following consideration of factors including the different customer sets, differing service requirements 
and different characteristics of business activity. A further split is then made for the geographical divisions of the Group being:
 Western Europe 
 North America; and 
 Emerging Markets.

The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those 
calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs in respect of future cash 
flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the cash generating units. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units is 11 .3% 
(2011: 9.5%). This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate. The recoverable 
amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period, being management’s expectation of the useful life of the 
existing asset base.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years. The expected sales reflect 
management’s expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected profit margin reflects 
management’s experience of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales. Cash flows after five years are 
based on an estimated growth rate of 3.2% (2011: 3.2%), being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the 
Group operates in. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash 
generating unit. A decline in sales of 26.2% per annum would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being 
reduced to its carrying value.
The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2012. The charge for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible 
fixed assets in 2011 related to the Group’s South American operations, where trading activity has previously lagged expectations, 
which together with an increase in the perceived risk adjusted discount rate, led to an impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible 
fixed assets. No goodwill nor intangible fixed assets remain on the Group’s balance sheet in respect of the South American 
businesses. 76 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

15.  Other financial assets (continued) 
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £20.6m (2011: £17 .7m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

At 31 December 6.2 6.2
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £8.9m (2011: £8.9m). 
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of 
the expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

(ii) At 31 December 2012 the Group has two principal borrowing facilities which are secured by upstream guarantees provided by 
subsidiaries:
(a) Drawings of £nil (2011: £nil) under a Revolving Credit Facility of £125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 27 July 2011 
and matures on 31 August 2016. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1 .15% and 
2.00% above LIBOR (the margin at 31 December 2012 was 1 .15%).
(b) Drawings of £33.5m (2011: £6.0m) under a Revolving Credit Facility of €125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 
2006 for a period of seven years. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 
1 .10% above LIBOR (the margin at 31 December 2012 was 0.80%). 
At 31 December 2012 the Group had available £192.9m (2011: £223.9m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities. 
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. 82 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2012 or 2011 .
    
In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be 
classified as level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 
1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
    
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities 
of the contracts.
    
The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow 
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within 
Group policy. However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Financial risk management 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.  
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury 
personnel. The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to 
minimise risk for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no 
significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.

18.  Derivative financial instruments (continued)
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a 
centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each 
December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt/cash 
is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt/cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term 
loans in excess of one year) to exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £100m).
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had revolving credit committed borrowing facilities of £226.4m (2011: £229.9m) which exceeded 
net debt of £34.2m (2011: net cash of £0.1m) by £192.2m (2011: £230.0m). The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities 
to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group manages longer-term 
liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets. As at 31 December 2012 the Group’s 
principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates:
 €125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 July 2013 (0.6 years) 
 £125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 August 2016 (3.7 years)
 $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 (3.7 years) 
On 18 February 2013, the €125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing on 31 July 2013, was refinanced for the same amount, extending 
the maturity to 1 March 2018, increasing the weighted average life of the committed facilities at that date to 4.2 years.
In addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 
2012, the Group had gross cash of £10.0m (2011: £18.1m).
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest 
rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to 
achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but 
exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the 
Group’s reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time 
to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2012, 2% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2011: 8% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash). The 
average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.5 years (2011: 3.6 years).
Currency risk
Bodycote has operations in 26 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets 
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
Over 89% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 36%, USD 33% and SEK 7%). Cumulatively over the year, 
sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were £19.6m worse than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2011 .
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group 
will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt 
in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange 
movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances. 
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign 
currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though approximately 
89% of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are 
limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis
The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease 
of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the 
applicable rates as at 31 December 2012, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for 
illustrative purposes only. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations. 84 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
18.  Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
 changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments; 
 changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are 
recognised at their fair value; and
 changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments. 
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable 
net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2012 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.4m (2011: £0.1m). 
There is no significant impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity 
Taking the 2012 sales by currency, a 10% weakening/strengthening in the 2012 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus 
sterling would have given rise to a +£58.2m/-£47 .6m movement in sales respectively. The impact on headline operating profit is 
affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies. However, taking the 2012 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening/
strengthening in 2012 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£11 .1m/-£9.1m movement in headline 
operating profit.
Counterparty risk 
Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, 
time deposits and money market funds.  The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where 
applicable) and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit 
risk. Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better.  However, 
acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as 
practicable.

19.  Deferred tax (continued)
Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in 
particular in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £122.3m (2011: £183.1m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £18.7m (2011: £96.3m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future 
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of the remaining £103.6m (2011: £86.8m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating 
to future profitability. The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

year ended 31 December 2012, the average effective borrowing rate was 8.0% (2011: 7 .8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract 
date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. The fair 
value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.

The restructuring provision relates to the remaining costs associated with the closure of various Heat Treatment sites.
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, 
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into 
Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme 
from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives. In addition £2.4m  
of reorganisation and redundancy costs have been recognised in relation to the establishment of an accounting Shared Service Centre 
in Prague.
The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within 5 years.

24. Acquisition of businesses and subsidiaries
The Group made a number of acquisitions in the year, the most significant of which were as follows:
On 31 March 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of the heat treatment business of Curtiss-Wright Corporation for a cash 
consideration of £32.4m. The acquisition was made to provide additional capacity and a broader customer base in key regions of North 
America. The acquisition gives the Group a major presence in the strategically important aerospace industry hub in Wichita, Kansas; 
Louisiana provides access to the oil & gas market, and the northern plants fit well with the Group’s automotive and general industrial 
network, enhancing service to existing customers and extending the geographic coverage.
On 16 October 2012 the Group acquired the trade and assets of Carolina Commercial Heat Treating, together with an additional facility 
in Southern Indiana, for a cash consideration of £41 .4m. This acquisition was completed to develop a footprint in the south eastern 
USA, which continues to be amongst the highest recipients of inward investment in North America, with many domestic and overseas 
corporations establishing businesses and supply chains in the area.

The carrying value of inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximates their fair value. Fair values of 
the acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets are provisional, pending completion of the final valuations.
The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables was £8.0m. The best estimate at the acquisition dates of the contractual 
cash flows not expected to be collected was £0.2m.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability of the Group’s services in new markets and the 
anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with the Group of each of the acquired businesses.
Acquisition-related costs (reported in exceptional items) amounted to £2.5m.
The acquired businesses contributed £22.4m revenue and £5.1m to the Group’s operating profit for the period between their dates of 
acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of all the businesses had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the year would have 
been £620.9m and Group operating profit would have been £98.7m. 88 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) 
The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares 
up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and fifty per cent of the award is 
subject to an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan (CIP) 
The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of 
awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred 
shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in 
the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2. Ten per cent per annum compound growth in excess of growth 
in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 . 90 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

29.  Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Brazil, 
Canada, Italy and the United States of America. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under 
the control of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions 
payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions. 
The Group’s employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes operated by the governments of each country. The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions. 
The total cost charged to income of £5.1m (2011: £4.5m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2012 contributions of £0.3m (2011: £0.4m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.

UK Scheme 
The Company sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees. 
The preliminary actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2011 and was updated 
on an approximate basis to 31 December 2012. 
The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £1 .5m, comprising £0.5m in respect of benefit accrual and 
£1 .0m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expense. This level of contribution is currently under review following the 6 April 2011 
triennial valuation of the Scheme.
It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss 
account and in other comprehensive income.

Independent auditor’s report 
To the Members of Bodycote plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2012, which comprise the  
Parent Company Balance Sheet, the Company Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 11 . The financial reporting framework that  
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted  
Accounting Practice).  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone  
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2012; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent company financial statements.

Directors 100 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012
Company accounting policies
Accounting convention 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable law and United 
Kingdom accounting standards. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout 
the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements. In 
accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has 
not been presented. 
Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s report on page 25. 
Investments 
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period. 
Pension costs 
For defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the 
contributions payable in the year. For further details see note 29. 
Leases 
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period 
of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt 
with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
The Company as lessor 
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases. 
T angible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates: 
Fixtures and fittings  10% to 20% 
Software   20% to 33% 
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition. 
T axation 
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements. 
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is 
estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse. The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be 
obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.  Governance Additional information

Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ not to disclose transactions or 
balances with wholly-owned entities of the Group. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.  102 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2012

The other reserves are stated after deducting £11 .3m (2011: £6.7m) relating to shares held in the Bodycote International Employee 
Benefit Trust. The Bodycote International Employee Benefit Trust holds Bodycote plc shares and satisfies awards made under various 
employee incentive schemes when issuance of new shares is not appropriate. 
At 31 December 2012 4,373,136 (2011: 5,089,830) ordinary shares of 17 ³/11p each were held by the Bodycote International Employee 
Benefit Trust and, following recommendations by the employer, are provisionally allocated to satisfy awards under employee incentive 
schemes. The trust waives payment of dividend. The market value of these shares was £19.8m (2011: £13.4m). 
Included in other reserves is the capital redemption reserve of £129.4m (2011: £129.4m). 
8.  Contingent liabilities 
The Company has guaranteed bank overdrafts, loans and letters of credit of certain subsidiary undertakings amounting to £47 .2m

10.  Pension commitments 
The Company participates in a Group defined benefit scheme, the details of which are disclosed in note 29 to the consolidated financial 
statements. However, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities and has therefore accounted 
for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Full disclosures concerning the scheme as required by IAS 19 are set out in 
note 29 to the consolidated financial statements. These also satisfy the requirements of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’. 
The contributions made by the Company over the financial year to both the defined contribution and the defined benefit schemes 
amounted to £0.2m (2011: £0.4m) and £0.1m (2011: £0.1m) respectively. As at 31 December 2012, contributions of £nil (2011: £0.1m) 
due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
11.  Related party transactions

members of the Group.  Governance Financial statements

Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Leading the way for over 160 years
We have chosen the Inchcape lighthouse
as the symbol for this year’s annual report
because of the significance it holds –
both for our Company’s founders and
for us today.
Our leading founder,James Lyle Mackay,
was so inspired by the building of the
lighthouse on the Inchcape Rock – a lethal
submerged reef off the Scottish coast –
that he took the title‘Baron Inchcape of
Strathnaver’and so named the company
that he led.
From our Company’s earliest days as an
intrepid trading pioneer to today’s status
as a leader in the highly competitive
automotive industry,Inchcape has been a
beacon of performance,even in the midst
of the most disruptive economic storms.
Solid,responsive,confident,the qualities on
which Inchcape was founded,are precisely
those that have seen the Company thrive
and prosper through more than 160 often
turbulent years.
As we face challenging times,we too are
inspired by the Inchcape lighthouse.With its
robust structure that stands strong against
the North Sea and the pioneering spirit
of those that built this lasting wonder of the
industrial age that even now continues to
save lives,its guiding light illuminates the
journey ahead.

Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Despite the weakening trading conditions
in many markets around the world,we
are pleased to report results for 2008 in
line with our expectations,reﬂecting the
progress we have made against our
growth strategy and the beneﬁts of
excellent portfolio diversiﬁcation.
Performance
Group sales have increased by 3.4% to
£6.3bn for the full year to 31 December
2008,beneﬁting from strategic and focused
acquisitions and from organic sales growth
in most of our markets.On a like for like,
constant currency basis,sales fell by 4.3%
reﬂecting the impact of an unprecedented
and rapid downturn that started to affect
our industry in the second half of 2008.
Proﬁt before tax and exceptional items of
£190.7m was 18.9% lower than 2007 and
adjusted earnings per share fell 18.9% to
30p.On a statutory basis,which includes
exceptional items,proﬁt before tax of
£108.2m was 54.9% below 2007 and
earnings per share fell 70.5% to 11.2p.
We responded swiftly to the market decline
by reducing our cost base,closing 24 less
proﬁtable sites,reducing our workforce by
more than 2,000 people and implementing
other restructuring measures which are
expected to generate an annualised saving
of approximately £58m at 2009 exchange
rates.These actions have resulted in an
exceptional charge in 2008 of £28.3m
together with a charge of £54.2m for
goodwill impairment largely due to the
downturn in Latvia.
When reviewing the performance of
our business units,trading proﬁt is a key
measure and is deﬁned as operating proﬁt
excluding the impact of exceptional items
and unallocated central costs.
In our Distribution businesses we grew
sales by 5.8% despite challenging trading
conditions.We primarily beneﬁted from
strong performances in Singapore,where
we outperformed the market with new
model launches and strong commercial
vehicle sales resulting in a trading proﬁt
growth of 23.9%,in Hong Kong with a
trading proﬁt growth of 17.7% and in the
Rest of World with trading proﬁt growth
of 23.2%.We retained market share as well
as market leadership in Greece and sales
in Belgium grew 0.2% on 2007 under very
difﬁcult conditions.In Australia,whilst new
models helped to improve market share
by 10bp,the market decline resulted in a
trading proﬁt decrease of 3.7%.The UK ﬂeet
management business,Inchcape Fleet
Solutions,suffered from a residual value
provision increase of £8.5m.

Inchcape has a proven
and resilient business
model.The industry
faces an unprecedented
downturn but we will
remain solid by focusing
on our core activities.

Sales in our Retail businesses grew by 1.6%
in 2008,beneﬁting from our acquisitions in
Russia,9.3% growth in Australia and a new
Lexus retail centre in China.Across Europe,
sales grew 3.0% as a result of strong
performance in Greece and Finland.In the
UK we outperformed the market with like for
like sales falling 5.4% in a market which fell
11.3%.In the Russia and Emerging Markets
segment,trading proﬁts increased by 40.9%
largely as a result of our acquisitions in
Russia and growth in Poland.
Acquisition and disposal summary
We made further progress in our UK disposal
programme in accordance with our strategy
to streamline the business following the
acquisition of European Motor Holdings plc in
2007.We sold our Vauxhall business and the
majority of our Volvo retail outlets for a total
consideration of £17.0m.These transactions
followed the disposals of Inchcape
Automotive,Wilcomatic,and the Bentley,
Ferrari and Maserati retail outlets in 2007.
We have reinvested the proceeds from
these disposals into our Russia and Emerging
Markets segment,announcing in March the
acquisition of the remaining 24.9% stake in
our St Petersburg business for a total cash
consideration of £28.5m.This gave the Group
full ownership of its operations in St Petersburg
and was another step in the implementation
of the Group’s multi-brand Retail footprint,
providing broad segment coverage in what
is expected to be one of the fastest growing
markets in the world.
In April,we announced further expansion in
this market with the acquisition of an initial
75.1% shareholding in Musa Motors group,
one of Russia’s largest car retailing groups,
giving Inchcape a signiﬁcant scale position
in Moscow through 16 sites with key global
brand partners.The initial consideration
was £100.3m (see note 27 for details).This
acquisition has positioned Inchcape with
one of the largest networks of premium
brands in Moscow.
In May we announced another landmark
in our expansion into the Chinese market
with the ofﬁcial opening of our wholly
owned Lexus retail centre in Shaoxing.
During the year we also sold our French
operation to its management team for a
consideration of £7.6m.
Dividend
The Board is not recommending the
payment of a ﬁnal ordinary dividend for the
year in light of the current deterioration of
trading conditions (2007 – 10.5p).The Board
recommended a half year dividend for 2008
of 5.46p which reﬂected a 4.0% increase on
the half year 2007 dividend.
We currently do not expect to recommend
any dividend for the ﬁnancial year ending
31 December 2009.
We intend to return to our stated aim of
maintaining a progressive dividend policy
as soon as trading conditions allow.
Share buy back
The Group purchased £16.0m of its shares
in 2008 through the acquisition of 4.5m
shares,now held as Treasury shares at
an average price of £3.59 per share.
Approach to governance and
management
We continue to focus on the importance
of good governance and observe the
Combined Code and other relevant
guidance for listed companies in our global
operations.Integrating socially responsible
behaviour into every aspect of how we
operate and deﬁne ourselves remains high
on our agenda.In 2008 we have built on
the foundations of a global approach to
Corporate Responsibility (CR) that is making
responsible economic,environmental and
social behaviour intrinsic to the way we work.
People
Our people strategy is to have engaged
people in winning teams,creating the
ultimate customer experience for our brand
partners.On behalf of the Board,I wish to
express thanks to our colleagues across the
Group for their commitment and spirit in
delivering these results for 2008.
I would like to make special mention of William
Tsui,Chairman of Inchcape Asia-Paciﬁc who
sadly passed away in February 2009,after 18
years with the Group.Under his leadership,our
businesses in Hong Kong,Macau,Singapore,
Brunei,Guam and Saipan consolidated their
market leading positions.Latterly William
spearheaded our entry into China.William
will be remembered for his passion for the
motor industry and our customers and for
his truly inspirational leadership.
Strengthening our capital structure
The Group has historically maintained what
was considered to be an appropriate level
of borrowings given the prevailing economic
environment.Given the prospect of a difﬁcult
trading environment in 2009 and beyond,
we intend to continue our actions to reduce
net debt.In order to further strengthen the
position of the Group,the Board believes it
is both appropriate and in the best interests
of its shareholders to raise net proceeds
of approximately £232m in equity via a
Rights Issue which we announced on
19 March 2009.
We intend to use the net proceeds
of this Rights Issue to reduce the level
of indebtedness which in the short term
will increase headroom and delay the
reﬁnancing of existing facilities.In the longer
term,we expect that strengthening the
Group’s balance sheet through this
Rights Issue together with the action
we have taken to lower our cost base,
our geographic spread and diversiﬁed
revenue streams,will better position us
to take advantage of market recovery.
Outlook
Although the Group expects trading
conditions to remain extremely challenging
throughout 2009 and the actual results for
January and February were well below last
year,they have exceeded management’s
expectations in difﬁcult markets,due to a
good start to the year in Singapore and
a stabilisation of UK used car margins.
Currently,March order levels for the Group’s
UK operations are in line with our revised
expectations.The fundamentals of the
Group remain solid and our strategic
direction is clear.We have responded
quickly and decisively to global economic
conditions.Our experienced management
teams,our track record of operational
excellence,our focus on superior customer
service and the strength of our relationships
with our brand partners give us conﬁdence
that we will successfully weather the current
storm in our industry and emerge stronger.
Board change
As previously announced,I will be
retiring from the position of Non-executive
Chairman in May 2009,following 14 years
with the Company,six years as Group Chief
Executive and three years as Chairman.
I am delighted that Ken Hanna,who has
been a Non-executive Director of Inchcape
for six years,is to be appointed Non-executive
Chairman of the Group with effect from
14 May 2009.Ken has considerable skills
and expertise with a proven track record
both at a ﬁnancial and operational level
and as a Non-executive Director,as well as
direct experience of operating businesses
in emerging and developed markets.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my years with
Inchcape,especially working with so many
talented colleagues both on the Board and
in the business and I know that I am leaving
the Group in very good hands.

Group Chief Executive’s review
André Lacroix
Group Chief Executive
Inchcape is a leading independent,
international automotive distributor and
retailer,with scale operations in Australia,
Belgium,Greece,Hong Kong,Russia,
Singapore and the UK as well as operations
in 19 other markets.We represent some of
the world’s leading automotive brands with
whom we have long-standing relationships.
During 2008,the car industry faced
unprecedented challenges as the economic
downturn spread rapidly across the world.
While Inchcape is not immune to the
downturn,I believe we are well placed to
ride it out successfully,based on the intrinsic
strengths of our business together with the
prudent and decisive actions we are taking,
so that we will be well positioned to capitalise
on market recovery.
We have more than 160 years of successful
international trade experience based on
a pioneering spirit that has seen us at the
forefront of every industry in which we have
participated.Our focus today is squarely
on the car market where we have been
an industry leading retailer and distributor
for many years.We continue to owe this
pre-eminence to two fundamental factors:
the resilience of our business model,and
the clarity of our vision and strategy.
In addition,we have an exceptional senior
team with an in-depth knowledge of the
automotive industry and local markets and
who share a collective record of decisive,
successful management in the face of
economic upheaval.
We are a proven
industry leader,
solidly positioned
for market recovery. 7

Solid...
A proven track record A diversiﬁed and resilient business model
• 160 years of international
business experience
• Broad geographic spread
• Diversified multi-channel
business model
• Prudent governance
• Long-standing brand partner
relationships
• Experienced management
team
A diversiﬁed and resilient business model
We believe our business model has a number
of key strengths including a diversity that
ensures resilience and provides a balanced
portfolio of income streams.
First,we have a broad geographic spread
with scale positions and a presence across
both mature and emerging markets.We
beneﬁt from a decentralised organisational
model which enables us to stay close to
changes in the marketplace and react
quickly to ﬂex our operational focus.We
enjoy a leading market share in many
markets thanks to our ﬁrst-hand experience
and hard-won knowledge of different buying
preferences and our relentless focus on
superior customer service.
Second,we have long-standing relationships
with strong brand partners who outperform
the market,giving us access to a pipeline
of attractive new models.Our brand strategy
is market speciﬁc,enabling us to ﬁt the right
brand with the right market to pursue our
core purpose of creating the ultimate
customer experience for our brand partners,
whilst aiming to maximise market share.
Third,we have a multi-channel structure,in
which our Distribution businesses – where we
represent every aspect of a brand partner’s
presence in a speciﬁc national market –
have historically delivered stable,strong cash
generation and our Retail businesses provide
access to diversiﬁed and resilient sources of
revenue through,for example,aftersales
service and parts.
Inchcape’s history of outperformance is due
to the key strengths of our business model
and the clarity of our vision and strategy.
These diversiﬁed income streams (our value
drivers) give us both the growth opportunities
that drive our business forward (new and used
car sales,third-party ﬁnance and insurance
products) and defensive income (aftersales
service and parts) that becomes increasingly
important in times of economic difﬁculty.
Aftersales represents approximately 50% of
our gross margin.This is an area on which
we are focusing greater resources than
ever before as an integral component of
our Customer 1st strategy,emphasising the
quality and value beneﬁts for car-owners
in staying with their franchise retailer after
the expiry of their warranty period.
It is a signiﬁcant area of opportunity for
us as even during times of declining new
vehicle sales,the total population of cars
on the road (the car parc) continues to
grow and more motorists concentrate on
maintaining rather than replacing their
existing vehicle.
Our focus on maximising the economic
contribution of all our value drivers by
constantly driving new efﬁciencies has
enabled us historically to deliver strong
margins.We seek to continue to improve our
performance throughout 2009,when difﬁcult
market conditions mean that maximising
returns will be particularly important.
A clear vision and strategy
Meeting our vision of being the industry’s
most customer-centric retailer anywhere in
the world is fundamental to the success of
our business model.
To be the world’ s
most customer-
centric automotive
retail group
A clear vision and strategy
Our goal of creating and delivering the
ultimate customer experience is a key
differentiator for Inchcape in our industry
and provides the basis of our long-standing
relationships with many of the world’s
leading motor manufacturers.Our passion
for superior customer service reﬂects directly
on the reputation of our brand partners,
making this a compelling reason for them to
select Inchcape as their partner of choice.
This Customer 1st approach is central to our
business and drives decisions taken at every
level of the organisation.Understanding the
customer’s view of our performance is vital
and we continue to invest strongly in
mystery shopper and customer feedback
programmes and leading technologies
to support our activities.These combine to
give us a constant view of our performance
from the customer’s perspective and help
us identify opportunities the moment
they emerge.
The combination of our unique business
model and our differentiating customer
focus has underpinned Inchcape’s success
for many years.Today,it is enabling us to
outperform our competitors in the most
difﬁcult trading conditions to affect our
industry for more than a generation.

Our ﬁve key priorities
Managing the downturn
We have responded swiftly to the economic
downturn with decisive management action
to make our business even sharper,more
effective and more efﬁcient.We believe
this will help us both minimise the negative
impact from the current downturn and
prepare us to emerge stronger when
the market recovers.We have narrowed
our management focus to the ﬁve basics
of our business,our‘ﬁve key priorities’:
growing market share whilst protecting
margins; growing aftersales; reducing costs;
managing working capital; and reducing
uncommitted capital expenditure.
Focusing on these priorities now,means
that we will be well-placed to take
advantage of the growth opportunities
that come with recovery.
Market share growth
Growing market share whilst protecting
margins in our Retail businesses springs
directly from our Customer 1st strategy,with a
focus on trafﬁc conversion through rigorous,
disciplined sales processes and outstanding
levels of customer service.Further,in today’s
market,our ability to help customers gain
access to the ﬁnance credit they need to
buy a car is a clear advantage.In our
Distribution businesses we will grow our
market share through disciplined marketing
effectiveness,taking full advantage of our
brand partners’new product launches and
offering strong value for money propositions
to our customers.
Aftersales growth
Growing our aftersales business will come
from focused service and parts marketing,
a strong emphasis on retaining customers
and providing outstanding levels of customer
service through,for example,our‘Vehicle
Health Check’.The key for us today is to
recognise and respond to every transaction
as an opportunity to build a long-term
customer relationship that delivers value
to both parties.This is central to our
Customer 1st strategy.
Further,in our aftersales workshops,we
continue to apply ourselves to driving
productivity enhancement and therefore
gross margin.
Cost reduction
In terms of cost saving,we already have
a major restructuring programme under
way that will deliver an annualised beneﬁt
of approximately £58m,based on 2009
exchange rates.This includes a 12%
reduction of our global workforce,tight new
restrictions on travel and a retail site and
ofﬁce rationalisation which by the ﬁrst half
of 2009 will have resulted in the closure of
24 less proﬁtable sites,comprising 16 retail
centres,one used car centre and one
PDI centre in the UK,two retail centres in
Greece and four in the Baltics.The Group
has implemented a general hiring freeze
and a policy of no salary increases in 2009
or management bonuses for 2008.
Additionally,we are negotiating harder
than ever before on everything we spend
and successfully taking advantage of
reduced advertising media costs.
Working capital management
Managing our working capital as efﬁciently
as possible is a top priority right across the
business.Unsold stock on forecourts is a
major expense for any motor retailer and
we have set stock reduction targets across
the Group.We have the support of our
brand partners to match our inventory
levels to the new market demand,which
is successfully helping us to contain our
working capital levels.
Capital expenditure reduction
Our forward capital expenditure programme
is largely driven by the agreements we have
in place with our brand partners,some of
which commit us to building new retail
centres in an agreed expansion timetable.
The excellent relationships we have with
our brand partners however,mean we
have been able to defer some projects.
In addition,we are slowing some aspects
of the implementation of our new SAP
system across the Group,while streamlining
its adoption in our Retail business to beneﬁt
as rapidly as possible from its main
commercial advantages.

Confident
We are planning for the future,so that when
the recovery comes we will be uniquely
positioned to take advantage of the growth
opportunities and emerge stronger.
Solidly positioned for market recovery
We are conﬁdent that taking these
proactive steps now will prepare us for the
best possible performance once the market
recovers when,we believe,opportunities
will be signiﬁcant.We see a number of
structural and economic factors that will
help shape the future of our industry.
It is likely that,when it comes,recovery will
take place faster in the emerging markets,
where the current low levels of car ownership
means that there is greater potential for
the demand for new and used vehicles to
increase.We will be able to use our existing
presence in those emerging markets to
full advantage.
However,there will be signiﬁcant opportunities
in the mature markets too,stemming from the
need for vehicle replacement as the car parc
ages,combined with technological innovation
which will both stimulate demand and drive
down the cost of ownership.
Industry consolidation means that we
will face a reduced number of competitors
in some of our markets,so that when the
recovery comes it is likely that we will be
growing from a position of higher market
share,providing the opportunity for improved
throughput and economic performance of
our retail centres.
Further,we believe vehicle manufacturers will
address the current oversupply of vehicles
by rationalising their production to create
a better balance between supply and
demand,which should lead to enhanced
margins on both new and used cars.
For all these reasons,we are excited by
our future prospects,while recognising
the medium-term challenges that we face.
And we have a number of Inchcape-speciﬁc
factors that give us great conﬁdence.
We operate as market leader in many
markets with a scale position and with
brand partners who continue to outperform
the industry and who have the resources
to innovate and stimulate demand.We will
beneﬁt from a pipeline of new products
which are set to deliver better value,better
performance and lower CO2 emissions.
Following a period of integration,our aim
is to have established scale operations in
emerging markets,enabling them to make
a growing contribution to the Group.
Our decentralised organisational model
gives us a signiﬁcant advantage as we
are capable of responding rapidly to the
changes in our industry.
Superior levels of customer service based
on our differentiating Customer 1st strategy
and leading retail operating systems will
help us grow share in many of our markets.
As an organisation,we will be leaner and
more efﬁcient which will provide us with
leverage when the market returns.
Further,I am constantly impressed by
the quality of our employees across the
Group.Despite the economic downturn,
I see our people displaying a true
‘Inchcape spirit’and a real passion for
delivering exceptional customer service.
In short,our proven business model and
strategy,allied with the ﬁrm and prudent
actions being taken by our experienced
management teams today,mean that
Inchcape is set to emerge from the
current downturn leaner,stronger and
more successful than ever.
We are conﬁdent that we will emerge
a winner.

Growing market share
Focusing on brand management,customer funnel conversion,
outstanding service and new product launches
1
In the prevailing challenging
market conditions,we will
seek to grow our market share
organically without sacriﬁcing
margins.The focus will be on
using marketing and promotional
activities to increase the number
of customers who visit our retail
centres and on increasing
the conversion rate of those
customers into sales.To build
customer loyalty,we will
continue to emphasise high
levels of customer service and
satisfaction which we measure
through our Net Promoter
Score (NPS) system,using
feedback from customers on
their experience at our retail
centres.We will also seek to
facilitate access to credit for
our customers and,of course,
take full advantage of new
opportunities arising from the
introduction of new models
from our brand partners.
Market illustration
In Australia,we are both distributor
and retailer of Subaru vehicles
and in 2008 we achieved a
remarkable milestone of 11
consecutive years of record sales
in a market that dropped 4%.
Subaru’s core strength is
underlined by the success of
the new generation Forester,
which has regained the position
as the country’s best-selling
compact SUV .
Our marketing messages are
demonstrating the value of
Subaru ownership to many
thousands of customers in these
tough economic times,who are
recognising the beneﬁt of great
retained value,engineering,
safety and durability.
We will reinforce these
messages in 2009 with some
exciting developments that
we expect will attract new
customers to the brand while
strengthening the advocacy
of our existing customers.
We will continue to build upon
our 2008 segment-leading share
for the Forester.The launch of
the Impreza sedan and the new
WRX has broadened our product
range and will drive further
segment share growth.In October
2009 we launch the new Liberty
and Outback range with the ﬁrst
diesel Subaru being launched at
the end of the year.Our product
activity will be supported with a
combination of strong brand
and tactical promotions. 12

Aftersales revenues have
historically shown a greater
resilience to market downturns
than new car sales,as the
aftersales market is driven
more by the size and age of
the car parc and technological
advances than it is by new
car sales.Accordingly,we are
implementing a number of
actions to help maximise the
beneﬁts of the aftersales revenue
stream and maintain long-term
consumer relationships.Key
measures being undertaken
include focusing marketing
and sales efforts on the retention
of customers who are nearing
the end of the warranty period
on their new vehicle.There will
also be a focus on the use of
management tools such as
capture rate,vehicle health
check and the NPS system to
monitor customer satisfaction
and increase customer retention.
Market illustration
At Mazda Hong Kong we have
applied a strong focus on
retaining customers of vehicles
over three years old.As a result
of effective local marketing
and adapting our service
offerings to cars of different ages
we have increased service loyalty
levels signiﬁcantly.
Flexible,pre-paid maintenance
service packages include
additional beneﬁts like priority
booking and a free odourising
treatment.We also offer a pre-
inspection safety test package
with special discounts on
replacement parts.
Packages for newer vehicles
have been developed too,
like our 12-step exterior surface
treatment,interior cleansing and
engine compartment cleaning.
Growing aftersales
Further strengthening customer service,increasing
customer retention and enhancing productivity 13
Reducing costs
Prompt action by reducing employee headcount,closing
non-profitable sites and reducing all non-essential programmes
3
As a result of prompt actions
taken to reduce the Group’s cost
base to reﬂect the deterioration in
market conditions,our workforce
has been reduced by more than
2,000 people across the Group.
In addition,24 less proﬁtable
sites,comprising 16 retail centres,
one used car centre and one
PDI centre in the UK,two retail
centres in Greece and four in
the Baltics will be closed by the
ﬁrst half of 2009.The Group has
implemented a general hiring
freeze and a policy of no salary
increases in 2009 or management
bonuses for 2008.Further,we
have tight new restrictions on
travel.The cost of the restructuring
will be approximately £28.3m,
with an expected annual
saving of approximately £58m
at 2009 exchange rates from
2009 onwards.
We will continue to monitor
closely and review our cost base
in light of the prevailing trading
and market conditions to ensure
that it reﬂects appropriately our
ongoing requirements.
Annualised benefit

working capital
Focusing on working capital control to bring
inventory levels in line with market demand
4
14
As a result of the abrupt sales
declines in many of our markets
and the long lead time on orders
for new vehicles placed with our
brand partners,inventory levels
have been higher than desirable.
Vehicle orders were reduced
during the second half of 2008
to reﬂect the prevailing market
conditions and we are seeking
to reduce signiﬁcantly the level of
inventory held across the Group’s
Distribution and Retail businesses.
We are also targeting a
reduction in the length of time
vehicles will remain in inventory
at current levels of trading.
Speciﬁc sales incentives have
been put in place with the aim
of accelerating this reduction,in
particular in respect of vehicles
which have been in inventory for
over six months.
Market illustration
In the UK,we have taken decisive
management action to address
our used car stock.In addition to a
disciplined approach to reviewing
daily stock lists and applying
tight pricing management,we
have introduced an even ﬁrmer
approval process for all buying
of used cars.
Further,through our strong
relationships with our brand
partners,we have reduced the
number of demonstrator vehicles
that we hold in stock.Along with
an incentive programme to drive
down inventory,this has led to a
substantial improvement in our
UK working capital and vehicle
stock position. 15
Reducing capital
expenditure
Reducing discretionary capital expenditure
in agreement with brand partners
5
We are conﬁdent that our recent
investments have placed us in a
strong position to beneﬁt when
the markets rebound.There
will be considerable pent-up
consumer demand in emerging
markets,based on low levels of
car ownership,and we believe
our scale position in these
territories will reap their reward.
While we are putting on hold any
uncommitted new investments,
we are completing projects that
are already under way and
honouring our commitments
to our brand partners,with whom
we have excellent relationships.
This has meant that we have
been able to defer some projects
and should we see further
market deterioration,we have
scope for additional deferment.
Further,capital outlay on our
new SAP system has been
slowed whilst at the same time
we are accelerating its roll-out
into our Retail businesses,such
that we can take advantage of
earlier gains from this investment. 16

Our Retail businesses have been signiﬁcantly
affected by the global decline and overall
we saw a reduced in like for like sales of 3.5%.
Total trading proﬁt decreased by 36.6%.
In the UK we continue to outperform.In a

a 7.9% increase in trading proﬁt.
Our Russia and Emerging Markets segment
has been signiﬁcantly affected by the
18
Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Business review
Operating review continued
Group
The prevailing conditions in the global
ﬁnancial markets have signiﬁcantly affected
the demand for,and price levels of,new
and used vehicles.
In Q4 2008 most of our markets experienced
a signiﬁcant downturn: the UK declined
27%; Hong Kong 41%; Greece 21% and
Australia 15%.
These signiﬁcant market declines have
contributed to a decline in our Group
operating proﬁt,before exceptional items,
of 17.4% for the full year,from sales which
declined by 3.3%.This compares to the ﬁrst
six months where we reported operating
proﬁt growth of 13.4% before exceptionals,
on sales which grew by 5.1%.
The sales decline was however partially
mitigated by a solid performance from
aftersales,on which our like for like revenues
grew by 4.2% for the Group for the full
year compared to 2007.This is an area of
signiﬁcant opportunity which has received
an increasing focus through 2008 and will
continue to do so in 2009 and beyond.
We responded swiftly to the market decline
by reducing our cost base,closing 24 less
proﬁtable sites,reducing our workforce by
more than 2,000 people and implementing
other restructuring measures which are
expected to generate an annualised saving
of approximately £58m at 2009 exchange
rates.These actions have resulted in an
exceptional charge in 2008 of £28.3m
together with a charge of £54.2m for
goodwill impairment largely due to the
downturn in Latvia.
We continue to reﬂect our management
structure in our reporting by separately
providing an analysis of the two segments
of our business,Retail and Distribution,by
geographical region.We have continued our
expansion into emerging markets,particularly
in the strategically important Russian market.
We continue to include Russia,China,the
Balkans,the Baltics and Poland within the
Russia and Emerging Markets segment on
the basis that these markets have started to
grow but have yet to reach a mature stage
of development and accordingly are in the
growth phase of the development cycle.
We have re-named the segment‘Russia
and Emerging Markets’in our reporting. 19

Strategy
We have been the distributor for Subaru
in Australia and New Zealand since 1992
and a retailer since 2001.We currently own
11 retail centres out of a total Subaru retail
centre network of 106 across Australia.We
also operate nine retail centres for a further
four of the top 12 automotive brands by
volume in Australia (Volkswagen,Hyundai,
Mitsubishi and Kia).Inchcape retail centres
are located in Melbourne (including a
ﬂagship retail centre for Subaru),the greater
Sydney area and in the northern Brisbane
district of Queensland.
In Australia,we also own AutoNexus which
provides logistics services to the automotive
industry.In 2008,AutoNexus was responsible
for the storage and logistic management
of over 48,400 vehicles and 1.4m of parts
lines dispatched.
In our Subaru Distribution business we aim to
be Australia’s premium Japanese automotive
brand and to leverage that position in our
Retail business to become Australia’s most
customer-centric automotive retail group.
Market
The Australian vehicle market declined by
4% in 2008,with the large engine passenger
cars segment particularly affected,while
diesel engine vehicles gained share.The
market began to be affected by the global
downturn in Q4 with a decline of 15%.
Market conditions were very competitive,
fuelled by high levels of sales support and
marketing expenditure with consumers
particularly sensitive to fuel consumption.
Performance
Our Subaru Distribution business achieved
a milestone of 11 consecutive years of
record sales in 2008.Sales of 38,492 vehicles
distinguished the business in a difﬁcult
market where many competitors weakened.
Subaru in Australia maintained the largest
market share for the brand (3.8%) of any
major region outside Japan.
Subaru’s core strength was underlined by
the success of the new generation Forester,
which regained its position as the country’s
best-selling compact SUV ,with best-ever
sales of 14,423 units in 2008,up 14.9%.The
Subaru Impreza became one of Australia’s
fastest selling models of 2008.
Trading margins were below 2007 ,at 7.8%
due to the investment required for the
launch of two key new models.
Our Retail business achieved like for like
revenues of 1.0% above 2007,a performance
which was further enhanced by gross
margins which grew by 0.6ppt versus last
year.However total trading proﬁts were 7.7%
below 2007 (excluding a one off property
sale recorded in 2007).
Our AutoNexus business had another
successful year, winning several
new contracts.
Outlook
The new vehicle market is forecast to decline
in 2009.We expect market conditions to
remain highly competitive as the market
adjusts to lower sales volumes and excess
levels of inventory.The strength of the Subaru
brand in Australia has enabled us to enter
into an agreement with Esanda to replace
GMAC for the provision of wholesale ﬁnance
to support our dealer network.The Subaru
product offering should enable us to
compete strongly in 2009. Europe

We aim to drive growth in market share in
our Distribution business and to continue
our turnaround plan for Retail.In Distribution,
growth will be driven by new model launches
and a focus on operational excellence,
supported by tight overhead cost control.
In Retail,our plan continues to focus on
operational excellence and improvements
in footfall conversion.
Market
In Belgium,the new car market was up by
2% for the year,although Q4 was ﬂat versus
2007.In Greece,the market declined by 6%
in 2008.The Finnish car market grew by
11% in part due to a car taxation change.
Performance
In a year that saw the run out of many
Toyota models,trading proﬁts in our
Distribution business declined by £16.8m
(29.7%).The Retail business delivered a total
trading proﬁt of £0.7m which was in line with
last year following our disposal in July 2008
of our French business.
In Belgium,with no new products,our
Distribution business saw market share reduce
by 1.0ppt versus 2007 in a market which grew
by 2%.Like for like sales declined by 12.8%,and
our gross margin was lower than last year due
to intense competition and vehicles on run
out campaigns.Together with ﬂat overheads,
trading proﬁts were 80.3% down.The Retail
business experienced like for like sales down
by 7.9%,and with overheads in line with 2007
trading proﬁts were 45.7% below last year.
In Greece,our Distribution business
continued to lead the market and hold a
9.9% share of the passenger car market.In
the Retail business,our Customer 1st focus
and business restructuring continues to
deliver results.Total sales declined by 0.2%,
but with tight control on overheads,total
trading proﬁts were up by 8.3%.
In Finland,we gained market share,but like
for like sales in our Distribution business fell
by 15.8% due to a signiﬁcant decline of our
Distribution activities in the Baltics.Although
this was partly mitigated by a 1.3ppt
improvement in gross margins,trading proﬁts
were 48.2% lower than 2007 .A large portion
of the decrease year on year was as a result
of the market decline in the Baltics as
Finland Distribution exports there.However,
our Retail business performed better with a
1.2% decline in like for like sales offset by a
2ppt growth in trading margins and lower
overheads resulting in a like for like trading
loss which was 82.7% better than 2007.
Outlook
Our markets in Europe are expected to be
materially down in 2009.
In Greece,we expect to minimise the impact
on trading proﬁt by closing two loss-making
retail centres,focusing on strict cost-controls
and by taking full advantage of the new
model line up.
In Belgium,we are conﬁdent we will be able
to beneﬁt from new product launches,a
continued focus on customer satisfaction,
careful inventory management and the
opening of a state of the art Toyota factory
at Anderlecht during the year.
In Finland,we aim to offset the decline with
new models exploiting trends towards diesel
and the recent CO2 legislation. Hong Kong

Outlook
Forecasts indicate the market will be
materially down in 2009.We do expect that
with the launch of new models during the
year we will further strengthen our market
position.Tight cost control and growth in
aftersales continue to be the major themes
in the current difﬁcult time.Aftersales will
receive increasing focus throughout 2009.
Strategy
In Hong Kong,we are the distributor for
Toyota,Lexus,Hino Trucks,Daihatsu,Jaguar
and Mazda.We operate VIR for these brand
partners in this market.Our largest business
in Hong Kong is Crown Motors,which
represents Toyota,Lexus,Hino Trucks and
Daihatsu.We have won the Toyota Triple
Crown Award (in recognition of outstanding
customer service,retail excellence and
innovation) for 16 consecutive years since
1992,the only company in the world to have
done so over such an extended period.
We continue to make progress in Hong Kong
with a particular focus on the luxury segment
through our Lexus range and will continue
to expand in the growing multi-passenger
vehicle (MPV) segment,following the launch
of new models in 2008,with further new
model launches in 2009.
Market
We experienced a signiﬁcant change in
the market in 2008.The ﬁrst three quarters
saw a market growth rate of 28% however
during Q4 the market declined by 41%.For
the year,the market was up by 7% on 2007.
Performance
We have further strengthened our market
position in Hong Kong with sales of 13,661
vehicles in 2008,representing a combined
market share of 36.3%.As a result of the very
solid growth in the ﬁrst three quarters of the
year,full year like for like sales were 20.6%
better than 2007,beneﬁting from the launch
of the Noah and Alphard models into the
fast growing MPV segment.Tight overhead
cost control contributed to the delivery of
trading proﬁt growth of 9.6% versus 2007
(excluding a one off proﬁt of £2.9m related
to property booked in 2007). Singapore

Strategy
In Singapore,we are the distributor for
Toyota,Lexus,Hino Trucks and Suzuki.We
have represented Toyota in Singapore since
1967,following a merger at that time with
Borneo Motors,which is now a subsidiary
of the Group.Borneo Motors has been
Singapore’s market leading retailer by sales
for seven consecutive years since 2002.Our
subsidiary Champion Motors has held the
Suzuki distribution franchise since 1977.
Our strategy focuses on retaining market
leadership with acceptable margins in an
overall declining and highly competitive
market.Revenue generation is focused on
growing share with new model launches
where possible and developing special
editions of existing models to drive
differentiation and margin.We continue
to develop other revenue streams further,
speciﬁcally in aftersales and ﬁnance.
Market
The pace of deregistrations continued
to slow as expected and led to an overall
market decline of 13% (excluding parallel
imports) compared to 2007.Competition
from parallel imports continued to increase
through the ﬁrst half of 2008,driven by
importers selling new models from Japan
and the aggressive pricing from local
distributors buying inYen.However,with
strong marketing campaigns and new
model launches together with the
impact of the appreciation of theYen
on our competitors,we achieved a 7.9%
increase in trading proﬁt.
Performance
We have outperformed the market in the
second half of 2008,thanks to an excellent
product mix.Like for like sales were down by
11.9% but this was mitigated by signiﬁcantly
better trading margins,which grew by 2.2ppt,
resulting in a full year trading proﬁt which
was 7.9% higher than 2007.Despite high
competitive pressure,we have maintained
our market leadership position.
As expected,our performance in the
commercial vehicle segment was lower
in 2008 as a result of competitor model
launches.Our market share was down
6.6ppt versus 2007.
Our Suzuki business delivered another solid
performance,registering a slight market
share gain compared to 2007.
Outlook
The market is forecast to be materially down,
in light of the Land Transport Authority quota
announcement and slowing deregistrations.
We expect that new model and special
edition launches will help us to grow market
share.Our aftersales business will continue to
beneﬁt from our market leadership position. UK

IFS offers ﬂeet management and leasing
services to corporate and government
customers.With over 50 years’experience in
the automotive industry,IFS has a combined
ﬂeet size of approximately 31,000 vehicles.
Market
The economic downturn created
unprecedented challenges for the UK
automotive industry in 2008.We saw a
signiﬁcant change in the market from May
2008,with a rapid acceleration of the decline
through the second and third quarters,
resulting in a full year decline of 11% to 2.1m
units.Diesel market share reached an all-time
high of 43.6%.Market pricing was signiﬁcantly
affected,resulting in used car prices being
well below 2007 levels.
Performance
We continue to outperform our competitors
and in the face of an 11% market decline,
we achieved a like for like retail sales drop
of 5.4% versus 2007.Pressure on new and
used margins continued throughout 2008
and as a result like for like trading margins
declined from 2.4% to 1.2% in 2008.
An £8.5m increase in residual value
provision in IFS has resulted in a like for like
trading loss of £5.7m.This provision increase
is due to the fall in used car pricing,resulting
in lower than expected realisable values on
leased vehicles which will be returned over
the next two to three years.
Outlook
The new vehicle market is expected to
decline materially in 2009.Notwithstanding
this decline,much greater stability is
anticipated in the used vehicle market
while aftersales is expected to continue
to make a signiﬁcant contribution.
Strategy
In the UK,Inchcape has a signiﬁcant retail
business with 130 franchised retail centres
and a focus on core premium/premium-
volume brand partners.We also operate
a ﬂeet leasing business,Inchcape Fleet
Solutions (IFS).
Since May 2006,the Group has acquired
and integrated Lind Automotive Group
Holdings Limited and European Motor
Holdings plc.The enlarged portfolio has
extended the Group’s geographic reach
and we now have scale operations in the
core regions of the South East,Midlands,
North and North East of England.
We have streamlined our portfolio to focus
on the following core brands:Audi,BMW,
Honda,Jaguar,Land Rover,Lexus,
Mercedes-Benz,MINI,Porsche,smart,
Toyota and Volkswagen.
We aim to create signiﬁcant differentiation
by delivering an outstanding level of
customer service through our Inchcape
Advantage programme and drive growth
in aftersales and car ﬁnance penetration. Russia and Emerging Markets

Strategy
We operate 20 retail businesses in Moscow
and St Petersburg.Two further retail centres
for Toyota are under construction,one in
Moscow and one in St Petersburg.
In St Petersburg,we own and operate one of
the largest car retailing businesses in the city.
In 2008,we acquired a 75.1% shareholding
in Musa Motors,one of the largest car retail
groups in Russia,providing the Group with
scale presence in the Moscow region.
We are a distributor for Toyota and Lexus
in Bulgaria and Romania.In Romania,
we have increased our retail presence in
Bucharest with a new large-scale facility.
In Bulgaria,we are increasing our retail
presence in Soﬁa and developing our
independent network in the countryside.
In addition,we are the distributor for Toyota
and Lexus in Macedonia and Albania.
In Poland,we retail BMW and MINI in
Warsaw and Wroclaw.
In the Baltics,we are the distributor and we
operate VIR for Mazda,Jaguar and Land
Rover.We are also the retailer for BMW,
Mitsubishi and Hyundai in these markets.
We have market-leading positions in Latvia
with a 12% share and in Lithuania with 15%.
In China,we have Toyota and Lexus retail
centres in Shaoxing.A third retail centre,for
Lexus in Shanghai,is due to open in 2009.
Market
The second half of the year saw a signiﬁcant
shift in all emerging markets.In Russia,the
market for international brands fell by 6% in
Q4,the ﬁrst decline in many years.In China,
although the passenger car market declined
by 6% in 2008,foreign brand sales grew by
8%.The Balkans market dropped 11% in 2008
(Q4 decline of 37%) and the Baltics market
declined 22% in 2008 (Q4 decline of 50%).In
Poland,the market increased by 6% in 2008,
largely reﬂecting good economic growth.
Performance
Our Musa Motors acquisition performed
in line with expectations in the six months
to December.Our existing business in
St Petersburg delivered like for like trading
proﬁts that were 14.7% higher than 2007.
Overall,Russia contributed £18.9m of
trading proﬁt to the Group in 2008.
Our performance in the Baltics was affected
by a signiﬁcant market decline with Latvia
the worst affected.Overall trading proﬁts
declined by £9.5m versus 2007.We continue
to restructure our business in the region to
reﬂect the current and projected future
business environment.
In the Balkans,overall trading proﬁt fell by
£9.0m in 2008 primarily as a result of a 78.6%
drop in trading proﬁt in Romania.
In Poland,like for like trading proﬁt increased
by 120.5% with a sales increase of 21%.
In China,we successfully opened our Lexus
site in Shaoxing in January and we saw sales
from our existing Toyota site grow by 56.3%
versus 2007.Including the new Lexus site
total revenues in China grew by 212.2%.
Outlook
In Russia,2009 is expected to be challenging,
with the market forecast to be materially
down.The Group should beneﬁt from
expected increase in the highly proﬁtable
area of aftersales.
The markets in the Baltics and the Balkans
are expected to be substantially down.
Although the Polish market is expected
to be down in 2009,the Group expects
improvements in sales processes and the
opening of a new BMW retail centre in
Warsaw to offset this forecast lack of growth.
In China,growth is forecast to continue,
although more slowly than in recent years,
and will be helped by our new Lexus site
opening in Shanghai in 2009. Rest of World

Our Rest of World operations incorporate
Brunei,Chile,Ethiopia,Guam,New Zealand,
Peru and Saipan.In Chile and Peru,the
Group is the distributor for BMW.We have
represented BMW in Chile for 12 years and
in Peru for eight.In addition,the Group
operates VIR in Brunei,Guam and Saipan
for Toyota and Lexus,whilst in Ethiopia we
are the distributor and retailer of Toyota.
We will continue to focus on operational
excellence in these markets and drive
organisational efﬁciencies through tight
cost-controls.
Market
We saw good growth across most of the
other markets in which we trade.In South
America,the market in Chile grew 4% and
81% in Peru.Brunei recorded a more modest
growth of 2%.In Guam,New Zealand and
Saipan,the markets contracted by 2%,5%
and 6% respectively.
Performance
We continue to maintain market leadership
positions in Guam,Saipan and Brunei and
in 2008 these markets delivered a similar
like for like trading proﬁt to 2007.
Our business in Ethiopia delivered another
solid set of results in 2008,with trading proﬁt
growth of 15.3% on sales growth of 18.5%.
We delivered a strong performance in
South America.Like for like trading proﬁts
were up 56.7% compared to 2007.
In New Zealand,pressure on the new
car market and used car margins and
a reduction in the used car market
contributed to a decline in trading
proﬁts on a like for like basis.
Outlook
We continue to be conﬁdent of good
performance in many of these markets in
2009 despite an expected market decline.
Focus will be on preserving our market
leadership position in the luxury segment
and strengthening the core business,
especially aftersales. 26
Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Business review
Financial review
Acquisitions and disposals
The Group continued its expansion in
emerging markets in 2008 and invested a
total of £135.4m in acquisitions,offset by
total proceeds from disposal of non-core
businesses of £27.3m.
In March,the Group acquired the
remaining 24.9% stake in the St Petersburg
business for a total cash consideration of
£28.5m.As a result,the Group now owns
100% of one of the largest automotive retail
businesses in St Petersburg,the second
largest city in Russia.
In July,the Group acquired a 75.1%
interest in Musa Motors group for an initial
consideration of US$200m,with a further
payment due dependent on 2008 Earnings
before Interest,Tax and Amortisation (EBITA)
and subject to a cap of US$250m.The
remaining 24.9% is due to be acquired in
early 2011 for a payment dependent on
2010 EBITA,again subject to a cap of
US$250m.As a result,the Group has
therefore accounted for Musa Motors
group as if it was a wholly-owned subsidiary.
This acquisition provides the Group with a
signiﬁcant scale position in Moscow.
The Group disposed of its non-core Vauxhall
business and the majority of its Volvo retail
centres in the UK for £17.0m and also sold
its French operation to its management
team for a consideration of £7.6m.
Capital expenditure
The Group maintained its policy of investing
to improve the operating standards of its
retail centres and to develop new greenﬁeld
centres at a cost of £117.8m.The Group
also continued with its implementation
plan for a global SAP system for its operating
businesses.The ﬁrst retail centre went live
with the system in February 2009.
Capital expenditure relating to SAP in 2008
was £18.7m.
Minority interests
Proﬁts attributable to minority interests
reduced to £3.9m in 2008 from £5.7m
in 2007.This was largely the result of the
acquisition in March 2008 of the remaining
24.9% interest in our St Petersburg businesses
from the joint venture partner,the Olimp
Group.The Group’s minority interests at
the year end principally comprise a 33%
minority holding in UAB Vitvela,Lithuania
and 10% in Subaru Australia.
Foreign currency
During 2008,the Group beneﬁted by £22.9m
from translation of its overseas proﬁts into
Sterling at the 2008 average exchange rate.
Following the recent fall in Sterling against
most of the Group’s major currencies,a
Board decision has been taken to protect
the 2009 earnings by purchasing Sterling
call options on a matching basis with
overseas earnings for all major territories,
excluding Russia.
Cash ﬂow and net debt
The Group’s operations continued to be
cash generative in 2008,with cash ﬂow from
operating activities of £183.7m.The tight
management of working capital in the face
of the downturn in the automotive sector has
been a key factor in the delivery of this result.
During the year,the Group returned nearly
£90m to shareholders with £73.1m through
dividend payments and £16.0m through
a programme of buying shares in the
market.In addition,the Group invested
£264.0m in acquisitions and capital
expenditure,funded by additional
borrowing facilities,and realised £54.5m
from the disposal of businesses and other
assets.Overall,the Group had net debt of
£407.8m at 31 December 2008 compared
to £213.5m at 31 December 2007.
Pensions
During the year,and in line with the funding
programme agreed with the Trustees in
2006,the Group made cash contributions to
the UK deﬁned beneﬁt scheme amounting
to £20.8m.However,a reduction in the
market value of scheme assets during 2007
has resulted in a net pension surplus at
31 December 2008 of £6.0m,compared to
a net surplus at the end of 2007 of £28.5m.
The Group has produced results in line with
our expectations.The following Financial
review details the ﬁnancial implications of
our operational activity and the risks which
we monitor and take steps to mitigate.
Central costs
Unallocated central costs for the full year
are £9.6m before exceptional items,down
from £27.5m in 2007.This decrease is largely
a reﬂection of the Group’s performance
during the year which has resulted in no
management bonuses being paid and
an overall credit being recorded in respect
of share-based awards.
Joint ventures and associates
The share of proﬁt after tax of joint ventures
has decreased by £1.3m to £2.2m in 2008.
This is mainly as a result of the acquisition
of the remaining stake in our joint venture
in Djibouti,thereby converting it to a 100%
owned subsidiary.
Exceptional items
The exceptional items consist of goodwill
impairment charges of £54.2m,a one off
charge of £28.3m in connection with the
restructuring of certain Group businesses,
(which is expected to deliver approximately
£58m of annualised cost savings at 2009
exchange rates) and a £3.6m exceptional
tax charge.The exceptional proﬁt recorded
in 2007 related to the sale of Inchroy (£12.0m
proﬁt),Inchcape Automotive and non-core
retail centres in the UK (£7.1m loss).
Net ﬁnancing costs
The net ﬁnancing cost of £52.0m was £18.6m
higher than in 2007 and is a reﬂection of the
Group’s higher level of net debt.The majority
of the additional interest relates to the
ﬁnancing of the Musa acquisition,together
with the annualised cost of the acquisition of
the Audi and Peugeot businesses in Russia,
the acquisitions in the Baltics in 2007 and
the higher level of working capital reﬂecting
the downturn in the markets.
Tax
The subsidiaries headline tax rate for the
year is 26% compared to 25% in 2007.This
increase arises due to the mix of proﬁts
across the territories in which we operate.
The rate is expected to increase in 2009
due once again to the proﬁt mix,and to
the restricted ability to obtain tax relief on
UK ﬁnancing costs.
Delivering solid results despite
the unprecedented global
decline in the car industry. 27

Principal business risk factors
Enterprise risk identiﬁcation
and management
The Group applies an effective system of
risk management in terms of identifying
and monitoring actions to manage these
risks.Further details of the Group’s risk
management process can be found
on page 47 and 48.
Risk is a part of doing business; the risk
management system aims to provide
assurance to the Board on the effectiveness
of our control framework in managing risk
against a background of highly diverse
and competitive markets.The key beneﬁts
of the system include: maximised resource
efﬁciency through controlled prioritisation
of issues,benchmarking between
business units,sharing of best practice
and effective crisis management.
The following provides an overview of the
principal business risk areas facing the
Group along with a description,where
relevant,of the mitigating actions in place.
Market conditions
Over the past 12 months,the global car
industry has suffered an unprecedented
and rapid downturn.This downturn and
the broader economic conditions have
had an impact on the Group.The Group
is focusing on ﬁve core business priorities
(described on page 8).This focus is
intended to position the Group to take
advantage of improvements in the markets
in which it operates as and when they
begin to recover.
Another aspect of the current market
conditions is the availability of credit for
our customers.Inchcape is using its
relationships with external ﬁnance
providers and its brand partners to try and
secure such credit on acceptable terms.
Brand partners
The strength of relationships with our
brand partners is critical to the ongoing
success of the Group.We maintain
these relationships through constant
focus on performance,effective
communication and ensuring that
our objectives are closely aligned to
those of our brand partners.
The brand partners whom we represent
may also be affected by the current
downturn,which in turn could have an
impact on the Group.However,we believe
that our brand partners are amongst the
strongest in the industry and are therefore
best placed to weather the current
market conditions.
Treasury management and policy
The centralised treasury department
manages the key ﬁnancial risks of the
Group encompassing funding and
liquidity risk,interest rate risk,counterparty
risk and currency risk.The Treasury function
operates as a service centre under Board-
approved objectives and policies.
Funding and liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to ensure that the
funding requirements forecast by the
Group can be met within available,
committed facilities.
The inventory lead time in the automotive
industry can present a liquidity risk in a
contracting market,however this is offset
by strict controls on inventory levels which
were tightened across the Group during
the year.Access to supplier credit also
reduces the Group’s exposure to current
credit markets,as this funding is generally
available on extended and favourable
terms,even in a contracting market,and
this credit funds the largest cash outﬂows
of the Group.
The effect of the current general reduction
in credit availability has not yet increased
the liquidity risk exposure of the Group,as
the actual liquidity position of the Group is
secure in the medium term,due to the
current committed and available
borrowing facilities in place.
At the end of the year the Group’s principal
committed facility for general corporate
purposes,was a ﬁve year syndicated
£500m revolving credit facility put in place
with relationship banks in April 2007.In April
2008 the maturity of this facility was
extended for an additional year to 2013.
This facility was drawn by £370m at the year
end.A three year term loan of £35m put in
place in April 2007 was fully drawn during
the year.
The Group also has in place funding
with Private Placement loan notes totalling
$550m.Loan notes totalling $350m mature
in May 2017 and a further $200m of loan
notes mature in May 2019.
In July 2008 the Group put in place a
three year syndicated £185m revolving
credit facility and a £40m bilateral facility
with relationship banks.These facilities
were not drawn at the year end.
The committed bank facilities and Private
Placement borrowings are all the subject
of one ﬁnancial covenant being an interest
cover covenant based on an adjusted
EBITA measure to interest on consolidated
borrowings.The covenant is tested on a
trailing 12 month basis at 30 June and
31 December each year and is required
to be not less than three to one.The Group
was compliant with this covenant during
the year and regularly monitors actual
and prospective compliance.
The proceeds of the Rights Issue,
announced on 19 March 2009,are
intended to reduce indebtedness,which
in the short term will increase headroom,
delay the reﬁnancing of existing facilities.
In the longer-term,this will better position
the Group to take advantage of
market recovery.
Currency risk
The Group has transactional currency
exposures,where sales or purchases by
an operating unit are in currencies other
than in that unit’s reporting currency.
For a signiﬁcant proportion of the Group
these exposures are removed,as trading
is denominated in the relevant local
currency.In particular,local billing
arrangements are in place for many
businesses with our brand partners.
For those businesses that continue to be
billed in foreign currency,Group policy is
that committed transactional exposures
are hedged into the reporting currency
of that business.If possible,foreign
exchange exposures will be matched
internally before hedging externally. 28
Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Business review
Financial review continued
Principal business risk factors continued
The Group also faces currency risk on the
translation of its earnings and net assets,
a signiﬁcant proportion of which are in
currencies other than Sterling.On translation
into Sterling,currency movements can
affect the Group income statement and
balance sheet.
Historically the Group has adopted a policy
of not hedging the translation of its overseas
earnings.This policy has been reviewed in
the light of the increasingly high proportion
of the Group’s earnings from overseas and
a new policy has been adopted,effective
for 2009,which gives management the
opportunity to hedge translation exposures.
Any hedges put in place take into account
current exchange rates and management
expectations for future exchange rate
movements.The purchase of options
are approved instruments for hedging
translation exposures.
Hedging instruments are approved by the
Board and are restricted to forward foreign
exchange contracts,currency options and
foreign exchange currency swaps.Foreign
exchange currency swaps are also used
to hedge transaction exposures arising
on cross border Group loans.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate policy has
the objective of minimising net interest
expense and protecting the Group from
material adverse movements in interest
rates.Throughout 2008 the Group has
borrowed at ﬂoating rates only (after taking
into account existing interest rate hedging
activities) with the exception of US$75m
at a ﬁxed rate of 5.94% in the UK and
£11.5m in Russia.This approach reﬂects
the reduction in interest rates during 2008
and the benign interest outlook.
Group policy permits the ﬁxing of up to 30%
of gross borrowings at ﬁxed interest rates if
deemed appropriate by management.
Should further interest rate hedging
activities be undertaken in the future,
the Board has approved the use of
interest rate swaps,forward rate
agreements and options. 29

Counterparty risk
The amount due from counterparties,
arising from cash deposits and the use
of ﬁnancial instruments,creates credit risk.
Limits are in place which reduce credit
risk by stipulating the aggregate amount
and duration of exposure to any one
counterparty dependent upon the
applicable credit rating.Credit ratings and
the appropriate limits are reviewed regularly.
There is also a risk in the current
economic climate where the Group
operates distribution businesses relating
to the ﬁnancial health of the Group’s
third party dealer networks.However,the
Group has a long and successful history
of managing distribution businesses and
an experienced management team
running day-to-day operations.
Pensions
The Group has deﬁned beneﬁt pension
schemes to which it may be required
to increase its contributions in the event
of an adverse change in the Group’s
ﬁnancial position and/or to fund an
increase in the cost of future beneﬁts.
The Group maintains an open dialogue
with the pension trustees to ensure that
they have appropriate information upon
which to base their decisions.
Acquisition integration
The Group has grown considerably in
recent years as a result of acquisitions.
Due to the unprecedented economic
downturn,it is possible that the Group
will not realise all the projected beneﬁts
of the acquisitions,however the Group
continues to integrate the acquired
entities successfully.
Litigation and regulatory risk
The Group is subject to laws and
regulations in each of the countries in
which it operates,all of which are subject
to change and which if breached could
have an impact on its business.The Group
ensures that it obtains timely information
about forthcoming changes and that it
has robust procedures in place to minimise
any risk of detriment or non-compliance.
The Group’s operations also expose it
to the risk of litigation.In order to mitigate
this risk,processes are in place which
are aimed at reducing the potential for
litigation and for escalating any problems
which do arise with a view to managing
the exposure appropriately.
Attracting,developing and retaining
talented employees
The ability of the Group to achieve its
strategic objectives depends partly on
its ability to recruit,retain and develop
highly skilled competent people at all
levels.The Group has a talent review
process,remuneration is externally
benchmarked to ensure ongoing
competitiveness and succession plans
are developed for all key positions.

Corporate responsibility
2008 has built on the foundations of a
Group approach to CR that is making
responsible economic,environmental and
social behaviour intrinsic to the way we
work.The Group’s approach to CR has been
recognised by its inclusion again in 2008 in
the FTSE 4 Good index.The company has
also taken part again in the Carbon
Disclosure Project’s review.

Group’s impact on the communities in which
we operate and outlines a new development
in 2008 with the measurement of the Group’s
CO2 footprint.
At Inchcape we take responsibility for the
impact our activities have on:
• Our people
• Our customers
• Our communities

Governance and management
The Board is responsible for the strategic
direction of all CR initiatives and the
programme as a whole.The Board is
ultimately accountable to our shareholders
for our CR Programme.Day to day
management of the CR Programme has
been delegated to the CR Committee
comprising of the Group’s General Council
and Group Company Secretary,Director of
Strategy,Assistant Company Secretary and
Group Communications Manager.Above
all,the CR Committee’s role is to ensure that
our day to day business operations respond
to the opportunities and avoid the risks,
posed by CR-related issues.
A network of locally based CR Champions
(employees with Group and local
responsibilities) support the work of the CR
Committee across three areas of strategic
focus: our people,our communities and
our environment.Our activities are focused
through our internal CR Aware campaign.
As part of the risk management processes
embedded throughout the Group,
environmental,social and governance risks
are identiﬁed and mitigated appropriately.
Business conduct
In 2008,we reviewed our business and ethics
policy and will roll out the updated policy
during the ﬁrst half of 2009.In addition to
providing a framework for managing our
operations in line with a consistent set of
standards of behaviour,we have introduced
a speciﬁc CR element to the design to
ensure that CR remains at the forefront of
our activities. 31

Our people
At Inchcape we
recognise that it
is our people who
make the difference.
It is through our people that we are able
to consistently bring alive our core purpose
and thus our people strategy has been
defined as‘engaged people in winning
teams creating the ultimate customer
experience for our brand partners’.
Our people strategy aims at ensuring
we have:
The right people: by becoming a magnet
for talented people who live our values and
enjoy working in winning teams delivering
outstanding results;
The right learning: equipping our people
to excel today and provide exciting
development opportunities for the future,
aligned to our business ambition;
The right reward: by recognising,celebrating
and rewarding the contribution our people
and teams make to deliver our challenging
business ambitions;
The right culture: by creating a great place
to work where people choose to make a
real difference and deliver the ultimate
customer experience.
Our employee base is diverse and reﬂects
the different cultures and markets within
which we operate.This diversity creates a
range of perspectives that allows us to
constantly challenge and improve the way
we do things,as we work towards our goal
of putting the customer at the centre of
our business.
Employee communications
This year,much effort has been applied in
engaging our people with our customer-
centric agenda.Employees around the
Group have attended a unique and
innovative Customer 1st experience,
designed to reinforce the understanding of
our core purpose and its meaning to each
and every role within the whole organisation.
The vision and strategy for the Group is
regularly communicated through market
visits,employee events and informal meetings
with Inchcape employees across the Group.
Objectives in support of the strategy are
supported through the performance
management process.Additionally,
feedback is sought from a representative
group of employees on speciﬁc issues.
Employee recognition
Recognition of outstanding performance
is core to employee engagement and
high on our people agenda.We believe
tremendous value can be gained from
an investment in strategic recognition for
performance,personal achievement and
team successes,especially in these
challenging times.
We have several programmes in place to
recognise people on both a Group,regional
and local level.
In January 2008 we launched a 12-month
Group-wide programme designed to
recognise and reward retail centres and
distribution sales teams based on
embedding the concept of‘good proﬁt’
– how both outstanding customer service
and strong operational proﬁt are key drivers
for winning teams.Progress was monitored
via a dedicated website and winners
received personal notes of congratulations
from the Group Chief Executive on a
monthly basis.
Since 2006,the Executive Committee has
identiﬁed exceptional individuals and teams
from across the business for the Inchcape
‘Gold Standard’awards for performance
and contribution.These are made annually
and each case is fully discussed and
considered by the Executive team as a
whole and a suitable reward is given.
Outstanding performance is celebrated
and publicised via our Group-wide
employee e-zine,Inchcape Inside,a
monthly communication that features news
about the business,our exceptional people,
teams and business performance – all
components that we believe set us apart
from the competition.
Employee engagement
This year we have launched Heartbeat,
our long-term programme to increase
engagement throughout the Company.
This incorporated our ﬁrst Group-wide
employee survey – conducted in partnership
with Gallup – and individual team action
plans to address key issues raised.
Gallup’s leading research has identiﬁed
12 questions that measure employee
engagement and powerfully link to relevant
business outcomes.To these we added a
further six questions speciﬁc to Inchcape.
We achieved a response rate of 87% across
the Group.
Training was given to help teams understand
their Heartbeat scorecard and prepare for
successful action planning.These action
plans are regularly followed up and
discussed at team meetings.
Talent and performance management
Talent and performance management is at
the heart of our people strategy as we look
to ensure we have the right people in each
role.In 2008,we have been through the
second wave of talent review and action
planning sessions in each of our markets.
The process is now being cascaded
through the whole organisation.During the
year,we also ran several development and
assessment centres and programmes for
our managers,focusing on our leadership
skills.We have also conducted an annual
review of our leadership population,with a
view to continuously upgrading the quality
and depth of our talent pool.Our analysis
continues to show us that talented people
yield much higher levels of customer
satisfaction and proﬁt.
Attracting and retaining talented individuals
through attractive performance-based
rewards and interesting and diverse career
opportunities remains a key area of focus
for us.As a global business,we are also able
to provide international secondments and
promotions,enabling us to give our best
people constantly stimulating career paths
and growth.We will seek to build on this
in 2009.
Employee safety
The safety of our employees is of paramount
importance.Many of our employees handle
hazardous substances and work with heavy
machinery.We regularly review our policies
and procedures for our employees and
have appropriate training programmes
in place.
Employees with disabilities
We are an equal opportunities employer.
We are committed to the employment of
people with disabilities and will interview all
those candidates who meet the minimum
selection criteria.We provide training and
career development for our employees,
tailored where appropriate to their speciﬁc
needs,to ensure they achieve their potential.
If an individual becomes disabled while in
our employment,we will do our best to
ensure continued employment in their
role,including consulting them about
their requirements,making appropriate
adjustments and providing alternative
suitable positions. 33

Our customers
Every day,every time and everywhere we aim
to deliver a world-class retail experience giving
our customers better service,better choice and
better value.
We place strong emphasis on the quality
of our customer service and in 2007 we
launched the Customer 1st initiative as part
of the Inchcape Advantage programme
to deliver outstanding customer service
‘every time,every day,everywhere’.Following
extensive consumer research,we developed
and implemented Customer 1st processes,
training and systems throughout our retail
centres.In particular,this has allowed local
management to set targets for each centre
based on customer satisfaction measured
through Net Promoter Score (NPS) and sales
funnel management analysis.
We have introduced a system for tracking
daily customer information including retail
centre trafﬁc,sales leads,test drives and
orders.Results are collected and monitored
daily through a dedicated award-winning
portal on the Group’s intranet.This information
is aggregated overnight,providing reports
and comparisons against brand,country,
region and across time periods.This allows
us to measure,for example,the number
of orders taken as a percentage of leads
and to set targets accordingly and gives
management a strong knowledge of the
automotive industry and detailed insight
into particular markets.
Our customer understanding is facilitated
both by the monthly mystery shop of each
of our retail centres and by quantitative
analysis of NPS results.Here,on a monthly
basis,each retail centre submits feedback
from 20 buyers and a further 20 visitors
about their experience at the centre.
Guidance on best practice and detailed
recommendations on opportunities to
improve customer service are accessible
to all retail centre employees via our portal.
We use the Customer 1st programme to
monitor both our own performance as
the retailer for our brand partners and the
performance of third-party retailers where we
manage the retail network as the distributor.
We believe that this focus on customer
service and sales technology will help us
deliver a superior retail experience to our
customers.Further,an improved customer
experience sets us apart from our
competitors and builds loyalty,resulting
in stronger relationships with our brand
partners and leaving the Group better
positioned to grow market share.
Customer 1st in 2008
• We carried out approximately 2,650
mystery shop exercises in 240 retail
centre showrooms across the Group.
• We carried out approximately 1,700

• We talked to 37,800 vehicle buyers and
39,500 showroom visitors for our vehicle
sales NPS programme.
Our core purpose
To create the ultimate

for our brand partners.
• We talked to over 16,000 service
customers for our aftersales NPS.
Supporting our customers
We are committed to providing clear
information to our customers to help support
them in their vehicle purchase choices.
This is provided in our showrooms and on
our websites.
As part of providing a customer focused
aftersales service,we offer our customers
an environmental Vehicle Health Check
which includes:
• Tyre pressure test
• CO2 test and emissions test
• Air condition check
• Engine lubricant test
• Emissions test
In some of our retail centres,customers are
offered a free Green Test Drive when they
visit us for a vehicle service.The Green Test
Drive shares tips with the customer on how
to drive more efﬁciently,how to improve their
environmental impact and ultimately how
to reduce their vehicle running costs.
We also have accessories available
that help our customers manage their
environmental footprint,including low rolling
resistance tyres,which can reduce CO2
emission by around 2% and lower engine
friction lubricants which can reduce CO2
emission by around 1%. Our communities
With our extensive international interests,
Inchcape firmly believes in supporting the
many different communities and cultures within
which we operate,often through sponsorship
and support of local charities for local people.
We have highlighted some of the work that we
have been undertaking in our communities.

as well as our range of operations across
Retail,Distribution and VIR mean that there
is not an obvious benchmark against which
we can compare our CO2 footprint to other
companies.However,our approach to
date is as follows:
• For energy,we are analysing the CO2
usage data to establish a benchmark for
our own operations with a view to setting
best practice targets for our Retail and
Distribution businesses.This will allow us
to apply a standard,notwithstanding the
international nature and differing scale
of our operations.
• For transport,the CO2 usage is largely
ﬁxed due to the inherent requirements
of repeated shipping of cars and parts
between deﬁned points of supply.
• For ﬂights,the initial measurement
period coincided with the introduction
of a Group-wide priority on cutting costs
and reducing air travel.Our working
assumption is that therefore this data
will set a benchmark point against
which future travel can be measured.

This KPI measures our global electricity and gas usage.For the
last six months of 2008,data has been collated on the basis of
megawatt hours for electricity and cubic metres for gas.
CO2 target Description
Energy
This KPI measures the movement of cars and parts from the
point of ownership (legal or contractual) to the point we cease
to have legal ownership.This includes test drives.We calculate
our CO2 footprint by car or parts kilometres,depending on the
mode of transport,with a CO2 multiplier.
This KPI measures the impact of the movement of our people.
We have recorded the number of ﬂights (each ﬂight leg counts
as one unit) and calculate our ﬂight CO2 emissions with a
multiplier by ﬂight kilometre.

Governance
Directors’report continued
Transactions with Directors
No transaction,arrangement or agreement required to be disclosed
under the Companies Act 2006 and IAS 24 was outstanding at
31 December 2008,or occurred during the year,for any Director
and/or connected person (2007 – none).
Related party transactions
The Company entered into no related party transactions that
require disclosure.
Creditor payment policy
The Company has no trade creditors (2007 – none).The Group is
responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions,including terms
of payment under which business transactions with the Group’s
suppliers are conducted.Whilst the Group does not follow any
single external code or standard,in line with Inchcape Group policy,
payments to suppliers are made in accordance with agreed terms
and conditions.
Going concern
In determining whether the Group is a going concern,the Directors
have reviewed the Group’s current ﬁnancial position and have
prepared detailed ﬁnancial projections.These projections reﬂect
the recent unprecedented downturn in economic conditions and
credit availability across the Group’s operations,the actions already
taken to restructure the business and the plans in place to focus
operations on the ﬁve core priorities of growing market share,growing
aftersales,managing working capital and reducing overheads and
capital expenditure (see page 8).
The projections also assume that: new car sales will continue to
decline in 2009 and not begin to recover until the second half of
2010; the service and parts business will be more resilient to the
downturn; lower UK interest rates will continue; key brand partners
will remain in production and supply on normal terms of trade;
and there will be no further signiﬁcant downturn in the global
economic environment.
These projections,even after allowing for headroom to
accommodate a reasonable downside scenario (including
weaker trading and adverse movements in currency and interest
rates),indicate that the Group would be able to manage its
operations so as to remain within its current facilities and in
compliance with its banking covenant.
Accordingly,after making enquiries,the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future.
As such,the Company and the Group continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
Charitable and political donations
The Group’s charitable donations,including the amounts,are
shown on page 35.
No political donations were made during 2008.
Events after the balance sheet date
See note 32 on page 111.
Principal business risk factors
These risks are shown on pages 27 to 29.
Auditors and disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware,there is no relevant audit
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
The Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken
as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware
of that information.
Key contractual and other arrangements
Other than arrangements with SAP ,the Company’s contracts are
at an operating unit level rather than a Group level.As a result no
individual supplier or customer contract is signiﬁcant to the business.
The Group’s relationships with its brand partners are managed at
Group level.However,the contracts with brand partners are at a
local level with day to day management being led by each
operating business.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held at 11.00 a.m.on Thursday 14 May 2009
at The Royal Automobile Club,89-91 Pall Mall,London SW1Y 5HS.
The notice convening the meeting and the resolutions to be put
to the meeting,together with the explanatory notes,are given in
the Circular to all shareholders.
The auditors,PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ,have indicated their
willingness to continue in ofﬁce.A resolution to reappoint them
as auditors will be proposed at the AGM.

Governance framework
The Board is committed to ensuring that the Group delivers
shareholder value in the long term and recognises that good
governance will facilitate the achievement of sustainable growth.
The following sections explain how the Company has complied
with the main and supporting principles of the 2006 Combined
Code (Code).It is the Board’s view that it has been fully compliant
with the Code throughout the year.
A statement of the Directors’responsibilities for preparing the
Financial statements,including a statement regarding the status
of the Company as a going concern,is on page 42.
The Board of Directors
The Board comprises a Non-executive Chairman,seven
Non-executive Directors and two Executive Directors.
The role of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate
and there is a clear division of responsibilities.The Chairman,
Peter Johnson,is responsible for the leadership of the Board and
the balance of its membership.The Group Chief Executive,André
Lacroix,is responsible for leading and managing the business,
with support from the Executive Committee.
Will Samuel is the Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent
Non-executive Director.

is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and Peter Johnson is
Chairman of the Nominations Committee.
Graham Pimlott was appointed as a Non-executive Director
on 25 March 2008.
The biographies of the Directors (including details of other
directorships held) and the Executive Committee are on page 39
and 43 to 44 respectively.The Chairman’s other signiﬁcant
commitments are also included in his biography on page 39 and
the Board is satisﬁed that these do not have a detrimental impact
on his time commitment to the Company.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting (AGM),Peter Johnson
announced his intention to retire from the Company.Ken Hanna,
a Non-executive Director,will take over the role as Chairman at the
2009 AGM.Further details of the appointment can be found in the
Nominations Committee report on page 50.
The Company’s articles of association require that every Director
will seek re-election to the Board at least every three years,subject
to election by shareholders at their ﬁrst AGM.The reappointment of
a Non-executive Director after six years is subject to a rigorous review.
A Non-executive Director who has served for more than nine years
is subject to annual re-election.All Directors are subject to the
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the removal
of directors.
The details of those Directors subject to re-election are shown
on page 41.
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the principles
of good governance,the Board is collectively responsible for
promoting the success of the Company and for providing strong
leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls
that enable risks to be assessed and managed.
There is a schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board,which is

Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Governance
Corporate governance report continued
If any Director were to have any concerns regarding the running
of the Company or a proposed action,such concerns would be
recorded in the Board minutes.If a Director were to resign over
an unresolved issue,the Chairman would bring the issue to the
attention of the Board.No such issues or concerns arose during
the year.
In addition to the Board meetings,a Strategy Review day was held
where the Board and members of the Executive Committee agreed
the strategic agenda for the year.The Strategy Review day included
updates from each of the operating businesses.
The Non-executive Directors also met during the year without the
Executive Directors.
Board balance and independence
All Directors bring an individual judgement to bear on issues of
strategy,performance,resources (including key appointments)
and standards of conduct.The Non-executive Directors share
responsibility for the execution of the Board’s duties,taking into
account their speciﬁc responsibilities.They comprise the principal
external presence in the governance of the Company and provide
a strong independent element.
The Board considers all its Non-executive Directors,with the
exception of Raymond Ch’ien due to the length of his service
and previous employment with Crown Motors,to be independent
for the purposes of the Code.
The Board has also determined that Ken Hanna will be considered
independent upon his appointment as Chairman under provision
A.3.1 of the Code.
Graham Pimlott was appointed to the Board during 2008.It was felt
that his extensive skills and knowledge within the private and public
sector would enhance the composition of the Board.
Will Samuel and Michael Wemms are both Non-executive Directors
of Galiform plc.Having regard to all the circumstances,including
the independence they have demonstrated as Non-executive
Directors of the Company and the fact that there are no cross-
shareholdings or business relationships between Galiform plc and
the Company,the Board is satisﬁed and has determined that they
are both independent.
The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-executive Directors
are available from the registered ofﬁce.
Information,training and development
The Board receives,in advance of each Board meeting,detailed
ﬁnancial information and presentations relating to items for decision
from members of the Executive Committee and operational and
functional heads.
Each Director is continually updated on the Group’s businesses; the
competitive,regulatory and legislative environments in which they
operate; corporate governance and responsibility matters and other
changes affecting the Group and the markets in which it operates,
with brieﬁngs from the Company’s external advisors if appropriate.
These arrangements are designed to ensure that the Directors’skills,
knowledge and familiarity with the Company are kept up to date,
therefore enabling the Directors to make informed decisions and
to fulﬁl their role on both the Board and on its Committees.
The Group Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that
Board processes and procedures are followed,to support effective
decision making.New Directors are given an appropriate induction
upon joining the Company.This may include advice from external
consultants.In particular,it provides information on the business,
including visits to retail centres and overseas operations,to ensure
awareness of responsibilities and a full appraisal of the Group’s
activities and strategic direction.The Group Company Secretary
is also responsible for ensuring that Directors receive appropriate
training.The appointment and removal of the Group Company
Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.
The Directors may take independent professional advice at the
Company’s expense.None of the Directors sought to do so in 2008.

Performance evaluation
The Board undertook a formal evaluation of its own and each
Board Committee’s performance,roles and terms of reference.
The Board considers that an evaluation of its performance is key to
ensuring an effective Board,which in turn is vital to the success of
the Company.The Board reviewed the process in November 2008
and determined that an external facilitation was not necessary.
The decision was based on the fact that the composition of the
Board had not changed signiﬁcantly during 2008 and the Board
had successfully implemented recommended changes from the
2006 external evaluation and the 2007 evaluation.
Led by the Chairman and supported by the Group Company
Secretary,a performance evaluation questionnaire was used for
the performance evaluation process.This questionnaire covered the
effectiveness of the Board,each Committee’s performance against
objectives,preparation for and performance at meetings and
corporate governance matters.It addressed the issues raised by
the Higgs Review on the role and effectiveness of Non-executive
Directors published in January 2003.Following the evaluation,the
Board members concluded that appropriate actions have been
identiﬁed to address areas that could be improved and that,overall,
the Board and Committees continued to perform effectively.
The Chairman evaluates the performance of the Non-executive
Directors and met with each individually to discuss performance.
The Non-executive Directors,chaired by the Senior Independent
Non-executive Director,met without the presence of the Chairman
to evaluate the Chairman’s performance.
Following the performance evaluation process,the Chairman has
conﬁrmed that the Non-executive Directors standing for re-election
at this year’s AGM continue to perform effectively and demonstrate
commitment to their roles.The Board will continue to review
performance annually.
Relationship with shareholders
The Board understands the importance of maintaining good
communication with its shareholders.After the preliminary and
interim announcements,meetings are held with institutional investors
to keep them up to date with the Company’s progress throughout
the year and to discuss any issues they may have.This ensures that
investors have a balanced view of performance and the issues
facing the Company.
In 2008,the meetings were attended by the Group Chief Executive,
the Group Finance Director and the Investor Relations Manager.The
Chairman and Non-executive Directors are also given the opportunity
to meet institutional shareholders.The Senior Independent Non-
executive Director is available to shareholders if contact through
normal channels is inappropriate.
Other meetings are held for investors and analysts that cover a wide
range of issues including strategy,performance and governance.
The Investor Relations Manager provided the Board with regular
updates on the views of the Company’s major investors.During
the year,the Board received external presentations from advisors,
including the Company’s brokers,on shareholder and market
perception of the Company’s strategy.
The Board is equally concerned with the views of private
shareholders.The Group Company Secretary manages day to
day communication with these shareholders and they are actively
encouraged to give their views using the prepaid reply form issued
each year with the AGM documentation.This is particularly useful
for shareholders unable to attend the AGM in person.
The AGM provides an opportunity for private shareholders to
engage with the Directors and shareholders are invited to raise any
matters of interest to them.At the meeting the Company complies
with the Code as it relates to voting,the separation of resolutions
and the attendance of Committee chairmen.In line with the Code,
details of proxy voting by shareholders,including votes withheld,are
made available on the Company’s website following the meeting.
The Company continues to monitor and encourage provisions
allowing shareholders to receive electronic communications.
These arrangements allow the Company to take advantage
of environmental and cost beneﬁts from reduced paper usage,
printing and postage costs whilst investors are able to receive
communications in the form most appropriate to their needs.
Shareholders are entitled to change the way in which they
receive shareholder communications at any time.
The Disclosure Committee ensures that all relevant communications
are made available to the London Stock Exchange and
shareholders. All material information reported is made available
simultaneously on the Company’s website,ensuring access to
Company announcements.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the establishment and review of the
Company’s internal operational and compliance control systems.
The internal control systems are designed to ensure:
• Effective and efﬁcient operations;
• Quality of internal and external reporting;
• Internal control and compliance with appropriate laws
and regulations.
The implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility
of the Executive Committee.
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code and the Turnbull
guidance,the Board annually reviews the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control systems and reports to shareholders.
The Board has ensured that a process for managing signiﬁcant
risk has been in place during the year.
The process is designed to manage,rather than eliminate,the risk of
failure to achieve business objectives.In establishing and reviewing
the system of internal control,the Directors have regard to the nature
and extent of relevant risks,the likelihood of loss being incurred and
the costs of control.
The system can only provide a reasonable but not absolute
assurance against any material mis-statement or loss and cannot
eliminate business risk.
The Board has delegated the responsibility of reviewing in detail the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control systems to the Audit
Committee.The Audit Committee reports its ﬁndings to the Board as
a whole so that a view can be taken.
Risk identiﬁcation,assessment and management
To assist the Board and the Audit Committee in managing internal
controls,the Group operates a Risk Management Strategy Group
(RMSG),which is chaired by the Group Chief Executive.Membership
throughout the year comprised the Group Finance Director,the
Group Company Secretary,the Group Treasury Director and the
Group Audit and Risk Director.

Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The RMSG meets quarterly to consider what changes to risk
management and control processes should be recommended.
Its review covers matters such as responses to signiﬁcant risks that
have been identiﬁed,output from monitoring processes (including
internal audit reports) and changes to be made to the internal
control systems.It also follows up on areas that require improvement
and reports back to the Audit Committee.
Control procedures and monitoring systems
A Group Risk Register,which identiﬁes key risks,the impact should
they occur and actions being taken to manage these risks at the
desired level,is produced for each business unit.In addition,actions
to be taken in the event that such risks crystallise and proposed
improvements to the way they are managed are also included.
The Group Risk Register is approved by the RMSG and the Executive
Committee and forwarded to the Audit Committee for discussion
at their meetings.
The Group also monitors its control procedures in the following
key areas:
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive system with an annual budget approved
by Directors.Monthly actual results are reviewed and reported against
budget and,where appropriate,revised forecasts are presented at
Board meetings.
Investment appraisal
The Group has clearly deﬁned policies for capital expenditure.
These include annual budgets and detailed appraisal and
review procedures.
Internal audit
The adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems are monitored by the Internal Audit team who report to
the Audit Committee on a regular basis.Internal Audit also works
closely with management and the external auditor.
Business unit controls
Each business in the Group is required to identify its key risks and the
control procedures in place to mitigate those risks.This evaluation
takes place twice a year as part of the preparation and update of
the business plans.
In 2008,the Managing Director and Finance Director of each
business unit in the Group was asked to sign a compliance
certiﬁcate to conﬁrm: the accuracy and completeness of the
accounts submitted for consolidation; compliance with local laws
and regulations; the absence of fraud; the absence of conﬂicted
directorships and compliance with Inchcape policies.
Directors’responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU),and the parent
Company Financial statements and the Directors’Remuneration
report in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accountancy Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).The Group and parent Company Financial
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and the proﬁt or
loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those Financial statements,the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• State that the Group Financial statements comply with IFRS as
adopted by the EU,and,with regard to the parent Company
Financial statements,that applicable UK Accounting Standards
have been followed,subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the Financial statements;
• Prepare Group and parent Company Financial statements on
a going concern basis,unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company and the Group will continue in business,in which
case there should be supporting assumptions or qualiﬁcations
as necessary.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records,
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the Group Financial statements comply with the Companies
Act and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and the Company Financial
statements and the Directors’Remuneration report complies with
the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the
Group,and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the Company’s website.The work carried out by the auditors does
not involve consideration of these matters,and accordingly the
auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have
occurred to the Financial statements since they were initially
presented on the website.Information published on the internet is
accessible in many countries with different legal requirements.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of
Financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors conﬁrms that to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group Financial statements,which have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU,give a true and fair
view of the assets,liabilities,ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the
Group,and;
• The Operating review and Financial review shown on pages
16 to 29,include a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the Group,
together with a description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.

or values.
In addition to the above activities,the Audit Committee reviewed
its policy regarding the scope and extent of any non-audit services
provided to it by its external auditors.The purpose of the policy is to
ensure that the external auditors remain objective and independent.
A procedure is in place which must be complied with prior to the
auditors being engaged in non-audit work.There is a clear division
of responsibility between audit and non-audit staff,and ﬁnancial
limits are imposed on permitted areas of non-audit work such as
tax advice.The Audit Committee has acted in compliance with this
policy during 2008.
A full statement of the fees paid for audit and non-audit services is
provided in note 3 on page 79.

part of executives’remuneration packages;
• The interests of shareholders should be safeguarded by
aligning the remuneration package of the executives with
shareholders interests;
• The package as a whole should be easy to understand and
motivating for the individual; and
• The composition of the package should reﬂect best practice
among comparable companies.
The Remuneration Committee also has regard for the need to
continue to align with and support the Company’s business strategy
and reviews the mix of ﬁxed and performance linked remuneration,
including share incentive schemes, on an annual basis.Where
applicable,shareholders are invited to approve new long-term
incentive schemes and changes to existing schemes at the AGM.
The Remuneration Committee has been carefully monitoring the
Company’s remuneration policy to ensure that pay is appropriate
in the current difﬁcult environment.Further details of speciﬁc actions
are set out below,but the key points to note regarding Executive
Director pay in 2008/09 are that:
• Base salaries have been frozen for 2009;
• No bonuses were earned in respect of 2008 performance;
• Long-term incentive awards maturing in 2008 did not vest due
to the impact of the 2008 actuals;
• Special incentive awards made to both the Group Chief Executive
and the Group Finance Director on recruitment did not vest due
to the impact of 2008 actuals on the performance criteria;
• Executive Directors have committed substantial personal
investment into the Company over the past few years through
the regular purchase of shares,the co-investment plan and the
deferred bonus plan.These investments have fallen in value in
line with the investments of other shareholders and are unlikely
to earn matching awards in the future.

Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Governance
Remuneration report continued
Looking forward,the Committee is committed to ensuring that the
remuneration arrangements in place are suitably structured to help
drive the Company’s recovery and to support the current business
priorities.In particular,the following decisions have been made
regarding the pay arrangements in 2009:
• The economic proﬁt element of the 2009 bonus plan is now
focused on operating cash ﬂow;
• The performance condition attaching to the 2009 executive
share option grant will also be based on longer term operating
cash ﬂow; and.
• Long-term incentive award levels in 2009 will be signiﬁcantly
reduced due to the suspension of the co-investment plan.
Base salary
Base salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee,taking
into account the individual’s level of responsibility,experience
and performance.Base salary is the only element of remuneration
that is pensionable.
In setting base salary levels,the Remuneration Committee also takes
account of levels in comparable companies.The comparator group
has a retail focus and includes companies with a strong consumer
emphasis.This is in line with the Company’s strategic aim of
customer centricity and its desire to attract retail talent.
During 2008,the Executive Directors received a salary increase of
8.0%.With the increase,the Executive Directors’base salary levels
were slightly below comparator group median.The Executive
Directors will not receive a salary increase during 2009.
Annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee sets annual bonus plans for the
Executive Directors including performance measures,targets and
the maximum levels of individual bonus opportunities.In 2008,the
bonus plan was based on 70% Economic Proﬁt,20% Net Promoter
Score (NPS) and 10% achievement of personal objectives.
During 2008,the Company achieved the NPS target set at the start
of the year and both the Executive Directors fully achieved their
personal objectives.However,the Company did not meet the
performance target set for Economic Proﬁt and therefore no
bonuses were paid in respect of 2008.
For 2009,the Remuneration Committee has decided to change
the ﬁnancial performance criteria for the annual bonus plan from
Economic Proﬁt to Cash Flow from Operating Activities (CFOA) as
this is more aligned to the Company’s current strategic priorities.As
in previous years,NPS,our customer service measure,and personal
objectives will be the other criteria used to calculate bonus.
For 2009,bonus plans will be based on 70% CFOA,20% NPS and
10% personal objectives.If all of these targets are achieved in full
the Executive Directors will receive 50% of their base salary and
higher payments will be received for performance above target
to a maximum of 120% of base salary.
Executive share option plan
Under the plan,share options are granted to Executive Directors
and senior executives throughout the Group.Options are normally
granted following the announcement of preliminary annual results.
During 2008,the Remuneration Committee made annual grants of
two times base salary,taking into account the Executive Directors’
and Company performance.Details of executive share options
granted to Executive Directors are shown in note 3 on page 56.
As in previous years,executive share options granted in 2008 will vest
if the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) exceeds the increase on
the UK Retail Price Index (RPI),over a three year period,according to
the scale set below.
EPS growth per annum Vesting percentage
Less than RPI+3.0% 0.0%
RPI+3.0% 25%
RPI+8.0% 100%
Between RPI+3.0% and RPI+8.0% Straight line basis
There will be no retesting
As outlined in the Chairman’s statement on page 5,the Company
announced a Rights Issue on 19 March 2009.Clearly this will have
an impact on the number of executive share option awards that
the Company will grant during 2009 after the Rights Issue has taken
place.As such the Remuneration Committee is not in a position
to detail the number of executive share options to be awarded
with shareholders at this stage.However,outlined below are the
performance conditions the Remuneration Committee intends to
use with regard to the 2009 award.The Company will consult,as
appropriate,with its shareholders and institutional bodies before
ﬁnal decisions are made.
The Remuneration Committee intends to set performance
conditions that are speciﬁcally tailored to the Company’s current
business strategy and reﬂect the focus on cash ﬂow.Accordingly,
the measure that will be used will be growth in Cash Flow from
Operating Activities (CFOA), according to the scale set out below.
The Remuneration Committee has set CFOA targets that it considers
at least as challenging as the previous EPS hurdle.
Options awarded in 2009 will vest to the following sliding scale:
CFOA growth Vesting percentage
Less than 70% of target 0.0%
70% of target 25%
100% of target 100%
Between 70% and 100% of target Straight line basis

André Lacroix and Barbara Richmond bonus plan 2009 53
www.inchcape.com
Co-investment plan
The co-investment plan was introduced during 2008 after receiving
shareholder approval in 2007.André Lacroix can invest up to 50%
and Barbara Richmond can invest up to 40% of post tax annual
salary to obtain ordinary shares in the Company.In exceptional
circumstances,the Remuneration Committee may determine that
circumstances justify that up to 100% of post tax annual salary can
be invested.No such exceptional circumstances have arisen to date.
Details of awards are shown in note 4 on page 57.The plan has
been extended to certain other senior executives below Board level.
The shares acquired will be matched at the end of the three year
vesting period.The match will be determined by performance
against the cumulative Economic Proﬁt (EP) target.
Awards will vest according to the following sliding scale:
EP growth over three years Matching shares
Less than RPI+3.0% 0
RPI+3.0% 1:1
RPI+12.0% 2:1
Between RPI+3.0% and RPI+12.0% Straight line basis
As noted previously,the Remuneration Committee has decided to
suspend the co-investment plan for 2009.
Deferred bonus plan
The deferred bonus plan was a voluntary plan for Executive Directors
and certain other senior executives.Final awards under this plan
were made in 2007.Details of these awards are shown in note 4
on page 56.
Save as you earn (SAYE)
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s SAYE
scheme on the same terms as other employees.Participants make
monthly savings,to a maximum of £250 per month,over a three
year period.At the end of the savings period the funds are used to
purchase shares under option.The acquisition of shares under this
scheme is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
Executive share ownership
To emphasise the importance the Remuneration Committee places
in executive share ownership,Executive Directors are required to
hold a ﬁxed number of shares equivalent to 200% of base salary.
Each Executive Director has ﬁve years from 2007,or date of
appointment (if later),to reach this shareholding target.
The shares held by the Executive Directors is shown on page 41.
Retirement beneﬁts
The Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme (UK Scheme) provides
beneﬁts for Executive Directors and certain senior executives at
normal retirement age of 65.The beneﬁt is equal to a maximum of
two-thirds of ﬁnal base salary,where salary has a scheme-speciﬁc
ceiling of £117,600 in the 2008/09 tax year,subject to completion
of between 20 and 40 years’service.Pensions in payment are
guaranteed to increase in line with the lesser of 5.0% and the
increase in the UK Retail Price Index (RPI).This will be reviewed
in 2009 in light of recent changes to guidelines.
The UK Scheme requires members who join after March 2005 to
contribute 7.0% of base salary up to the scheme-speciﬁc ceiling
of £117,600 in the 08/09 tax year.
Executive Directors,whose base salary is higher than £117,600,
are paid a monthly cash supplement to enable them to make
additional pension arrangements.Barbara Richmond received
such supplements in 2008.Details of the amounts paid are shown
on page 55.André Lacroix received a cash supplement of 40 %
of his base salary in lieu of a formal pension provision.He is not a
member of the UK Scheme except in respect of the life assurance
beneﬁt for death in service.
A lump sum life assurance beneﬁt of four times full base salary
is provided on death in service.For pension scheme members,
a spouse’s pension of either half or two thirds of the prospective
member’s pension may also be payable.Children’s pensions
may also be payable of up to one-third of the member’s pension.
Taxable and other beneﬁts
These include items such as company cars,medical care
and life assurance premiums.These beneﬁts are in line with the
remuneration policy framework.These beneﬁts are non-pensionable.
Total Shareholder Return
The following graph illustrates the Group’s Total Shareholder Return
(TSR) over a ﬁve year period,relative to the performance of the total
return index of the FTSE mid-250 group of companies (excluding
investment trusts).TSR is essentially share price growth plus re-invested
dividends.The FTSE mid-250 has been chosen as the most suitable
comparator group as it is the general market index in which
Inchcape plc appears.

Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for Executive Directors’service contract
notice periods to be no longer than 12 months,except in
exceptional circumstances.Both current contracts contain notice
periods of 12 months.In the event of termination,the Company will
seek fair mitigation of contractual rights.Within legal constraints,the
Remuneration Committee tailors its approach,in the event of early
termination,to the circumstances of each individual case.

Policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited
to become Non-executive Directors of other companies and that
this additional experience is likely to beneﬁt the Company.Executive
Directors are generally allowed to accept one Non-executive
appointment as long as it is not likely to lead to conﬂicts of interest
or undue time commitments.The Group Chief Executive is permitted
to hold two such appointments.The policy in respect of Executive
Directors’commitments is kept under review by the Nominations
Committee.Any fees received for these duties may be retained by
the Executive Director.
André Lacroix is the Non-executive Chairman of Good Restaurants
AG,for which he does not receive a fee and a Non-executive
Director of Reckitt Benckiser for which he received a fee of £14,500
plus Reckitt Benckiser shares to the value of £3,000.
Barbara Richmond is a Non-executive Director of Scarborough
Building Society for which she received a fee of £38,000.

Notes on share options:
(a) Under the executive share option plan.
(b) Under the SAYE scheme.
Exercise prices are determined in accordance with the rules of the relevant share option scheme.
• All options were granted for nil consideration.
• The table shows Directors’options over ordinary shares of 25.0p at 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008.The mid-market price
for shares at the close of business on 31 December was 36.75p.The price range during 2008 was 451.0p to 36.75p.
• Options under the executive share option plan are granted on a discretionary basis to certain full time senior executives based
within and outside the UK,including Executive Directors of the Company.Such options are normally exercisable between three
and ten years of grant.
• Options may normally be exercised if the performance target has been met.For all options granted between 1999 and 2003 under
the executive share option plan,growth in the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) over a three year period must exceed the increase
on the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) over the same period by 3.0% per annum.Options granted after the 2004 AGM vest according to a
sliding scale: 25% of the shares vest if EPS growth of RPI+3.0% per annum is achieved over the initial three year period with all the shares
vesting if EPS growth is RPI+8.0% per annum over three years.Shares will vest on a straight-line basis between these points and there is
no opportunity to retest.
• The SAYE scheme is open to employees in the UK with at least three months’service.Participants make monthly savings for a three year
period.At the end of the savings period options become exercisable within a six month period.

Financial statements
Accounting policies
The consolidated Financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as endorsed by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985,applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Accounting convention
The consolidated Financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention,except for
the retention of certain freehold properties and leasehold buildings at previously revalued amounts (which were treated as deemed cost
on transition to IFRS) and the measurement of certain balances at fair value as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Going concern
In determining whether the Group is a going concern,the Directors have reviewed the Group’s current ﬁnancial position and have prepared
detailed ﬁnancial projections.These projections reﬂect the recent unprecedented downturn in economic conditions and credit availability
across the Group’s operations,the actions already taken to restructure the business and the plans in place to focus operations on the
ﬁve core priorities of growing market share,growing aftersales,managing working capital and reducing overheads and capital expenditure
(see page 8).
The projections also assume that: new car sales will continue to decline in 2009 and not begin to recover until the second half of 2010;
the service and parts business will be more resilient to the downturn; lower UK interest rates will continue; key brand partners will remain in
production and supply on normal terms of trade; and there will be no further signiﬁcant downturn in the global economic environment.
These projections,even after allowing for headroom to accommodate a reasonable downside scenario (including weaker trading and
adverse movements in currency and interest rates),indicate that the Group would be able to manage its operations so as to remain within
its current facilities and in compliance with its banking covenant.
Accordingly,after making enquiries,the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue as
a going concern for the foreseeable future.As such,the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report
and accounts.
Changes in accounting standards
A number of new standards,amendments and interpretations are effective for the ﬁrst time for 2008.The Group has adopted,with effect
from 1 January 2008,the amendment to IAS 23‘Borrowing Costs’and the IFRIC interpretations noted below.
The amendment to IAS 23 removes the option of immediately expensing borrowing costs that are directly attributable to a qualifying asset.
Under IAS 23,such costs are required to be capitalised as part of the cost of the relevant asset.The Group has adopted the amended
standard on a prospective basis from 1 January 2008.The impact of adoption on the results for the year ended 31 December 2008 is
disclosed in notes 11 and 12 of the consolidated Financial statements.
IFRIC 14‘The Limit on a Deﬁned Beneﬁt Asset,Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’has been adopted with effect from
1 January 2008.This interpretation provides guidance on how to assess the limit on the amount of surplus in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme that
can be recognised as an asset under IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts.The application of this Standard has affected one of the deﬁned beneﬁt
pension schemes of the Group,with the full effect being recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense
in the year.This is disclosed in note 5 of the consolidated Financial statements.
In addition IFRIC 11‘Group andTreasury ShareTransactions’is effective,but has not had a material impact on the results or ﬁnancial position
of the Group.
IFRS 8‘Operating Segments’replaces IAS 14‘Segmental Reporting’and requires operating segments to be disclosed on the same basis
as that used for internal reporting.It is required to be implemented by the Group from 1 January 2009 and will not have an impact on the
results or ﬁnancial position of the Group.
At the balance sheet date,a number of IFRSs,IAS and IFRS amendments and IFRIC interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
Effective for the Group’s ﬁnancial years commencing on or after 1 January 2009 are: IAS 1‘Presentation of Financial Statements (2007)’;
the amendment to IFRS 2‘Share-based Payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations’; amendments to IAS 32‘Financial Instruments:
Presentation’and IAS 1‘Presentation of Financial Statements – Puttable Financial Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation’; and
IFRIC 13‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’.Effective for the Group’s ﬁnancial years commencing on or after 1 January 2010 are IAS 27
(Revised)‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’and IFRS 3 (Revised)‘Business Combinations’.
These new and revised Standards and Interpretations have not been and will not be early adopted by the Group and,with the exception
of the revised IFRS 3,are not expected to have a material impact on the ﬁnancial position and results of the Group.
IFRS 3 (Revised),‘Business combinations’(effective from 1 July 2009) continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations,
with some signiﬁcant changes.These include all payments to purchase a business being recorded at fair value at the acquisition date,with
contingent payments classiﬁed as debt subsequently remeasured through the consolidated income statement.There is a choice on an
acquisition-by-acquisition basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets.All acquisition-related costs should be expensed.The Group will apply IFRS 3 (Revised)
prospectively to all business combinations from 1 January 2010.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial statements comprise the Financial statements of the parent Company (Inchcape plc) and all of its subsidiary
undertakings (deﬁned as where the Group has control),together with the Group’s share of the results of its joint ventures (deﬁned as
where the Group has joint control) and associates (deﬁned as where the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence but not control).The results of
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are consolidated as of the same reporting date as the parent Company,using consistent
accounting policies. 63

38-57
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated using the purchase method of accounting from the date on which control of the net assets
and operations of the acquired company are effectively transferred to the Group.Similarly,the results of subsidiaries disposed of cease to
be consolidated from the date on which control of the net assets and operations are transferred out of the Group.
Where the Group acquires the minority interest in a subsidiary,the excess of the purchase cost over the book value of the minority interest
is recorded as an addition to goodwill.No fair value exercise is performed for the acquisition of the minority interest.
Where the Group acquires a controlling interest in a subsidiary with a contractual obligation to purchase the remaining minority,the
acquired company is accounted for as a 100% subsidiary,with the liability for the purchase of the remaining minority interest recorded as
deferred consideration.Subsequent changes to estimates of the deferred consideration are recorded as additions/reductions to the
amount of goodwill arising on acquisition.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method,whereby the Group’s share of the post-acquisition
proﬁts or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement,and its share of post-acquisition movements in shareholders’equity
are recognised in shareholders’equity.If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its investment in the
joint venture or associate,the Group does not recognise further losses,unless it has contractual obligations or made payments on behalf
of the joint venture or associate.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions included in the results of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the functional currency).The consolidated Financial statements are presented in Sterling,which is Inchcape
plc’s functional and presentational currency.
In the individual entities,transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at
the dates of the individual transactions.Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently retranslated at
the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement,except those arising
on long-term foreign currency borrowings used to ﬁnance or hedge foreign currency investments which on consolidation are taken directly
to shareholders’equity.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average rates of exchange for the period.Exchange
differences arising from 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of shareholders’equity.On disposal of a foreign
operation any cumulative exchange differences held in shareholders’equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Revenue and cost of sales
Revenue from the sale of goods and services is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable,net of rebates and any discounts
and includes lease rentals as well as ﬁnance and insurance commission.It excludes sales-related taxes and intra-Group transactions.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably
measured.In practice this means that revenue is recognised when vehicles or parts are invoiced and physically dispatched or when the
service has been undertaken.Revenue from commission is recognised when receipt of payment can be assured.
Where a vehicle is sold to a leasing company,and a Group company retains a residual value commitment to buy back the vehicle for a
speciﬁed value at a speciﬁed date,the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership are not judged to have been transferred.These vehicles
are retained within property,plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet at cost,and are depreciated to their residual value
over the life of the lease.Total revenue on a leased vehicle comprises the difference between consideration received and residual value.
This sits as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and is released to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease.The residual value commitment,which reﬂects the price at which the vehicle will be bought back,is held
within trade and other payables,according to the date of the commitment.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Cost of sales includes the expense relating to the estimated cost of self-insured warranties offered to customers.These warranties form part
of the package of goods and services provided to the customer when purchasing a vehicle and are not a separable product.
Share-based payments
The Group operates various share-based award schemes.The fair value at the date at which the share-based awards are granted is
recognised in the consolidated income statement (together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’equity) on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period,based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.For equity settled share-based awards,the
services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the awards granted.With the exception of the Group‘Save
as you earn’scheme,the vesting of all share-based awards under all schemes is solely reliant upon non-market conditions therefore no
expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.Where an employee cancels a‘Save as you earn’award,the charge for that
award is recognised as an expense immediately,even though the award does not vest.
Finance costs
Borrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition,construction or production of a qualifying asset,are capitalised as part
of the cost of that asset.All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Borrowing costs are capitalised from the ﬁrst date on which the expenditure is incurred for the asset,borrowing costs are incurred and
activities are undertaken to prepare the asset for its intended use.A Group capitalisation rate is used to determine the magnitude of
borrowing costs capitalised on each qualifying asset.This rate is the weighted average of Group borrowing costs,excluding those
borrowings made speciﬁcally for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. 64
Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
Accounting policies continued
Income tax
The charge for current income tax is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items which are not taxed or disallowed.It is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated Financial statements.
In principle,deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.Such assets and
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference is due to goodwill arising on a business combination,or to an asset or liability,the
initial recognition of which does not affect either taxable or accounting income.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,joint ventures and associates,
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled using
rates enacted at the balance sheet date.Deferred tax is charged or credited in the consolidated income statement,except when it relates
to items credited or charged directly to shareholders’equity,in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in shareholders’equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle
balances net.
Exceptional items
Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items within their relevant consolidated income statement
category.The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business performance.
Examples of events which may give rise to the classiﬁcation of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of businesses,
restructuring of businesses,litigation,asset impairments and exceptional tax-related matters.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business combination over the Group’s share of the fair value of identiﬁable
net assets of the business acquired at the date of acquisition.Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is held in the currency of the
acquired entity and revalued at the closing exchange rate at each balance sheet date.
After initial recognition,goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.At the date of acquisition the goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is tested at least annually for impairment.
Gains and losses on disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold in determining the gain
or loss on disposal,except for goodwill arising on business combinations on or before 31 December 1997 which has been deducted from
shareholders’equity and remains indeﬁnitely in shareholders’equity.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets,when acquired separately from a business (including computer software),are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated
useful life,which in the case of computer software is three to ﬁve years.Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated income statement
within net operating expenses.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (including back orders and customer contracts) are capitalised separately
from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.These intangible assets are amortised over their estimated
useful life,which is generally less than a year.
Property,plant and equipment
Property,plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.Cost comprises the purchase price
and directly attributable costs of the asset and includes,where relevant,capitalised borrowing costs.Depreciation is based on cost less
estimated residual value and is provided,except for freehold land which is not depreciated,on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset.For the following categories,the annual rates used are:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 2.0%
Short leasehold buildings shorter of lease term or useful life
Plant,machinery and equipment 5.0% – 33.3%
Vehicles subject to residual value commitments over the lease term
The residual values and useful lives of all assets are reviewed at least at each balance sheet date.
Impairment
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition,goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested at least annually for impairment.An impairment loss is recognised for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount,the latter being the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs
to sell and value in use.Value in use calculations are performed using cash ﬂow projections,discounted at a pre-tax rate which reﬂects the
asset speciﬁc risks and the time value of money. 65

Governance
38-57
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance
account,and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within‘net operating expenses’.When a trade
receivable is uncollectible,it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off are credited against‘net operating expenses’in the consolidated income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.Cost comprises expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their
present location and condition.Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs
to be incurred in marketing,selling and distribution.Used vehicles are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell,generally
based on external market data available for used vehicles.
Vehicles held on consignment which are deemed in substance to be assets of the Group are included within inventories with the
corresponding liability included within trade and other payables.
Inventory can be held on deferred payment terms.All costs associated with this deferral are expensed in the period in which they
are incurred.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group operates a number of retirement beneﬁt schemes.
The major schemes are deﬁned beneﬁt pension funds with assets held separately from the Group.The cost of providing beneﬁts under the
plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in cost of sales or net operating expenses in
the consolidated income statement.Past service costs are similarly included where the beneﬁts have vested,otherwise they are amortised
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.The expected return on assets of funded deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans and the imputed
interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the post-retirement beneﬁt element of ﬁnance costs and ﬁnance income in the consolidated
income statement.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets,changes in the retirement beneﬁt obligation due to experience and
changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in full in the period
in which they arise.
The Group’s contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are charged to the consolidated income statement in the period to which the
contributions relate.
The Group also has a liability in respect of past employees under post-retirement healthcare schemes which have been closed to new
entrants.These schemes are accounted for on a similar basis to that for deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans in accordance with the advice
of independent qualiﬁed actuaries.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation in respect of a past event,it is more likely than not that an outﬂow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.Provisions are discounted when the
time value of money is considered to be material,using an appropriate risk free rate on government bonds.
Disposal group and assets held for sale
Where the Group is actively marketing the disposal of a business within one year of the balance sheet date,the assets and liabilities of
the associated businesses are separately disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet as a disposal group.Assets are classiﬁed as assets
held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.Both
disposal groups and assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial instruments
The Group classiﬁes its ﬁnancial instruments in the following categories: loans and receivables; available for sale; held at fair value; and
amortised cost.The classiﬁcation is determined at initial recognition and depends on the purpose for which the ﬁnancial instruments
are required.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They are included in current assets,except where the maturity date is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Held at fair value includes derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities,which are further explained below.They are classiﬁed according
to maturity date,within current and non-current assets and liabilities respectively.
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets,and comprise bonds and equity investments.They are classiﬁed
as non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of them within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Amortised cost is the residual category and includes non-derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities which are held at original cost,less
amortisation or provision raised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits.
In the consolidated cash ﬂow statement,cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents,as deﬁned above,
net of bank overdrafts. 66
Inchcape plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Financial statements
Accounting policies continued
Leases
Finance leases,which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased item,are capitalised at the
inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or,if lower,at the present value of the minimum lease payments.Lease payments
are apportioned between the ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability.Finance charges are charged to the consolidated income statement.Capitalised leased assets are
depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
Leases where the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classiﬁed as operating leases.Operating
lease rental payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Offsetting
Balance sheet netting only occurs to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.As such,bank overdrafts are
presented in current liabilities to the extent that there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
An outline of the objectives,policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to its ﬁnancial instruments is set out in the Principal
business risk factors section of the Financial review.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their
fair value.The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument,
and if so,the nature of the item being hedged.The Group designates certain derivatives as:
• hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a ﬁrm commitment (fair value hedge); or
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash ﬂow hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the consolidated income
statement,together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.The Group
only applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging ﬁxed interest risk on borrowings (on its cross-currency interest rate swaps) and future
ﬁxed amount currency liabilities.The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging ﬁxed rate borrowings and
changes in the fair value of those borrowings are recognised in the consolidated income statement within ﬁnance costs.The gain or loss
relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the consolidated income statement within ﬁnance costs.
Cash ﬂow hedge
For cash ﬂow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting,the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that
are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders’equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the
consolidated income statement.When the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or liability then,
at the time the asset or liability is recognised,the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in shareholders’equity are
included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.For all other cash ﬂow hedges,
the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders’equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period
in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedge
The Group uses borrowings denominated in foreign currency to hedge net investments in foreign operations.These are accounted for
similarly to cash ﬂow hedges.Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in
equity; the gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement in net operating
expenses.Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the consolidated income statement when the foreign operation is
disposed of.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires,is sold,terminated,exercised or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge
accounting.At that point in time any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument which have been recognised in shareholders’
equity are kept in shareholders’equity until the forecast transaction occurs.If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the cumulative gains or losses that have been recognised in shareholders’equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement
for the period.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting,any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the
consolidated income statement.
Investments
The Group’s investments are classiﬁed as available for sale or held to maturity (where management has a positive intention and ability
to hold the asset to maturity).
Gains and losses on available for sale ﬁnancial assets are recognised in shareholders’equity,until the investment is sold or is considered
to be impaired,at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in shareholders’equity is included in the consolidated income
statement as part of net operating expenses.
Held to maturity ﬁnancial assets are carried at amortised cost. 67

Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.Where the Group purchases the Group’s equity share capital (treasury shares),the consideration
paid is deducted from shareholders’equity until the shares are cancelled,reissued or disposed of.Where such shares are subsequently sold
or reissued,any consideration received is included in shareholders’equity.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the consolidated Financial
statements until they have been approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.Interim dividends are recognised when
they are paid.
Signiﬁcant accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies,the Directors have made the following judgements,apart from those involving
estimations,which have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated Financial statements.
Revenue recognition on vehicles subject to residual value commitments
Where the Group sells vehicles,sourced from within the Group,and retains a residual value commitment,the sale is not recognised on the
basis that the Group has determined that it retains the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of these vehicles.
Consignment stock
Vehicles held on consignment have been included in ﬁnished goods inventories on the basis that the Group has determined that it holds
the signiﬁcant risks and rewards attached to these vehicles.
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date,that have a signiﬁcant
risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below.
Product warranty provision
The product warranty provision requires an estimation of the number of expected warranty claims,and the expected cost of labour and
parts necessary to satisfy these warranty claims.
Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
The net retirement beneﬁt asset or liability is calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions as detailed in note 5.A number
of these assumptions involve a considerable degree of estimation,including the rate of inﬂation and expected mortality rates.
Tax
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.Some degree of estimation is required in determining the worldwide
provision for income taxes.There are a number of transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during
the ordinary course of business.The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
taxes will be due.Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded,such differences
will impact the current tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
In addition,the recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon an estimation of future taxable proﬁts that will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.In the event that actual taxable proﬁts are different,such differences may impact
the carrying value of such deferred tax assets in future periods.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out above.The recoverable amount of
cash-generating units is determined based on value in use calculations.These calculations require the use of estimates including projected
future cash ﬂows.
Residual value commitments
The Group has residual value commitments on certain leased vehicles.These commitments are an estimate of future market value
at a speciﬁed point in time.The actual market value of vehicles bought back may vary from the committed purchase value. 68

1 Segmental analysis
Primary reporting format – geographical segments
The Group’s primary reporting format is by geographical segments.
The geographical segments disclosed are aligned with the risks and returns associated with different territories.Emerging markets are those
countries in which the Group operates that have started to grow but have yet to reach a mature stage of development and accordingly
are in the growth phase of the development cycle.These currently comprise Russia,China,the Balkans,the Baltics and Poland.
The Group’s geographical segments are based on the location of the Group’s assets.Revenue earned from sales is disclosed by origin and
is not materially different from revenue by destination.
Transfer prices between geographical segments are set on an arm’s length basis.

4 Share-based payments
The terms and conditions of the Group’s share-based payment plans are detailed in the Board report on remuneration on pages 51-57
of this document.
The credit arising from share-based payment transactions during the year is £0.9m (2007 – a charge of £4.5m),all of which is equity-
settled.A revision of the likelihood of non-market vesting conditions being met,on plans other than Save as you earn,gave rise to the credit
in the year.
The Other share plans disclosures below include other share-based incentive plans for senior executives and employees.
The following table sets out the movements in the number of share options and awards during the year:
Weighted average exercise price* Executive Share Option Plan Save As You Earn Plan Other Share Plans

* The weighted average exercise price excludes awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan as there is no exercise price attached to these share awards.
Included in the table above are 184,986 (2007 – 233,748) share options outstanding at 31 December granted before 7 November 2002
which have been excluded from the share-based payments charge in accordance with the IFRS 2 transitional provisions.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding at 31 December 2008 is 6.4 years (2007 – 6.3 years).
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £0.47 to £5.77 (2007 – £0.47 to £5.77).See note 24 for
further details.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model,taking into account the
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.The following table lists the main inputs to the model for shares granted during
the years ended 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007:

5 Pensions and other post-retirements beneﬁts
The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement beneﬁt schemes for its employees in a number of its subsidiaries.
The principal funds are held in the UK and are ﬁnal salary deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.Most of the schemes have assets held in trust
in separately administered funds although there are some minor unfunded arrangements relating to post-retirement health and medical
plans in respect of past employees.There are no material deﬁned contribution schemes in the UK.
The majority of the overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are ﬁnal salary schemes which provide a lump sum on retirement,some of which
have assets held in trust in separately administered funds and others which are unfunded.The overseas deﬁned contribution schemes are
principally linked to local statutory arrangements.
a.UK schemes
The UK has four main deﬁned beneﬁt schemes,namely the Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme,the Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme,
the Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme and the TKM Group Pension Scheme.These schemes are considered below:
Open schemes
Inchcape Group (UK) Pension Scheme
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 on a market-related basis and determined in
accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualiﬁed actuaries based on the projected unit method.The majority of the
scheme’s liabilities are for pensioners and deferred pensioners,and the investment strategy is to hold a broadly balanced portfolio of
equities and bonds.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2006 on a market-related basis and determined in
accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualiﬁed actuaries based on the projected unit method.Whilst a majority
of the scheme’s members are pensioners and deferred pensioners,a sizeable portion of the membership is still accruing beneﬁts and
the investment strategy reﬂects this with the majority of the assets invested in equities.
Inchcape Overseas Pension Scheme
This scheme is managed from Guernsey and is therefore reported in the United Kingdom segment in this note.The latest triennial actuarial
valuation for this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 and determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally
qualiﬁed actuaries based on the projected unit method.A signiﬁcant majority of the scheme’s members are pensioners and deferred
pensioners and therefore the majority of the assets are invested in bonds.
Closed scheme
TKM Group Pension Scheme
The latest triennial actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2007 on a market-related basis and determined in
accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualiﬁed actuaries based on the projected unit method.The scheme has a
prudent investment strategy and,as at 31 December 2008,invested 69% of assets in bonds,cash or gilts.Approximately half the members
are pensioners and half are deferred pensioners and as such no further pension accrual arises.
b.Overseas schemes
There are a number of smaller deﬁned beneﬁt schemes overseas,the most signiﬁcant being the Inchcape Motors Limited Retirement
Scheme in Hong Kong.In general these schemes offer a lump sum on retirement with no further obligation to the employee.These schemes
are typically subject to triennial valuations.
c.Deﬁned contribution plans
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement is £5.5m (2007 – £3.6m).There are no outstanding contributions to
deﬁned contribution schemes at the year end (2007 – £0.1m).
d.Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
As the Group’s principal deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are in the UK,these have been reported separately to the overseas schemes.For the
purposes of reporting,actuarial updates have been obtained for the Group’s material schemes and these updates are reﬂected in the
amounts reported below.
The principal weighted average assumptions used by the actuaries were:
United Kingdom Overseas
2008 2007 2008 2007
% % % %
Rate of increase in salaries 4.7 5.1 4.6 5.0
Rate of increase in pensions 2.8 3.3 – 1.7
Discount rate 6.2 5.8 1.9 4.0
Inﬂation 2.8 3.3 0.5 0.8
Expected return on plan assets 6.1 6.2 7.1 7.2
The rate of increase in healthcare cost is 5.5% (2007 – 5.5%) per annum but with higher increases in the ﬁrst ten years. 82

5 Pensions and other post-retirements beneﬁts continued
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on published statistics and experience.For the UK schemes,the average
life expectancy of a pensioner retiring at age 65 is 20.9 years (2007 – 20.9 years) for current pensioners and 22.5 years (2007 – 22.5 years)
for current non pensioners.Most of the overseas schemes only offer a lump sum on retirement and therefore mortality assumptions are
not applicable.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average expected return on each type of asset (principally equities and
bonds).The overall expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected real rates of return on equities and expected
yields on bonds applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.
The asset/(liability) recognised in the balance sheet is determined as follows:

a.Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to beneﬁt from that
business combination.These are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the
associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.This may be at country,regional or brand level.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the following primary reporting segments as follows:
2008 2007
£m £m
United Kingdom 264.8 265.4
Russia and Emerging Markets 214.6 99.5
Singapore 19.6 14.1
Australia 9.7 5.5
Rest of World 0.2 0.2
Europe – 4.9
508.9 389.6
Goodwill additions in 2008 arise mainly from the acquisition of the minority interest in the Group’s St Petersburg businesses from the
Olimp Group and the acquisition of the Musa Motors group (see note 27).
Goodwill disposed of during the year related to the Group’s operations in France and certain UK businesses.
Goodwill is subject to impairment testing annually,or more frequently where there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired.
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 December 2008.
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs were determined based on value in use calculations.These calculations use cash ﬂow projections
based on ﬁve year ﬁnancial forecasts prepared by management.The key assumptions for these forecasts are those relating to revenue
growth/decline,operating margins and the level of working capital required to support trading,which have been based on past
experience,recent trading and expectations of future changes in the relevant markets.They also reﬂect expectations about continuing
relationships with key brand partners.
Cash ﬂows after the ﬁve year period are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term growth rate for each market.These growth rates
reﬂect the long-term growth prospects of the markets in which the CGUs operate.The growth rates used vary between 1% and 6% and are
consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash ﬂows are discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate.The discount rate assumptions are based on an
estimate of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for a risk premium attributable to the relevant CGU.The discount rates
used vary between 10% and 13%,and reﬂect long-term country risk and local tax rates.
The assumptions used with regards to discount rates and long-term growth rates in those segments with material goodwill balances were
as follows:
Discount Rate Long-term Growth Rate
United Kingdom 11% 2%
Russia and Emerging Markets 11% to 13% 5% to 6%
Singapore 10% 1%
Impairment
During the year ended 31 December 2008,the goodwill in relation to the Group’s businesses in Russia and Emerging Markets was impaired
by £46.8m following a signiﬁcant deterioration in the automotive sector in emerging markets that has adversely affected revenue and
trading proﬁt.The Group has consequently reassessed its short and medium-term forecasts for the relevant CGUs and recognised an
impairment loss of £46.8m relating to the business acquired in Latvia in 2007.The discount rate applied to the value in use calculation
for Latvia was 11% (2007 – 12%).
In addition,acquisition goodwill of £7.4m related to sites in the UK which are to be sold or closed,has been impaired.
Sensitivities
The Group’s value in use calculations are sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used,most notably the discount rate and the long-
term growth rate.With the exception of those CGUs already subject to an impairment charge and the Musa Motors group,a reasonably
possible change in a key assumption will not cause an impairment in any of the other CGUs.
The value in use calculations for the Musa Motors group currently exceeds the carrying value by approximately 10%.A 0.5% increase in the
discount rate or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate would eliminate the headroom available.
b.Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets principally comprise computer software.The amortisation charge is largely included within administrative
expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Other intangible assets also include customer contracts and back orders recognised on the acquisition of a business.These intangible
assets are recognised at the fair value attributable to them on acquisition,and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life
(usually up to one year). 89

In certain jurisdictions management holds bonds to offset future vehicle warranty obligations.To meet this requirement,management
purchases and sells bonds regularly and does not usually hold the bonds to maturity.Accordingly,the maturity proﬁle of the bonds is not
necessarily an indication of when management intends to realise the associated future cash ﬂows.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the bonds classiﬁed as available for sale.These are
government bonds with an A1 credit rating. 92

Management considers the carrying amount of trade and other receivables to approximate to their fair value.Long-term receivables have
been discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base across a number of
geographic regions.

Deferred tax assets 11.5 10.2
Deferred tax liabilities (69.1) (18.5)
(57.6) (8.3)
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £24m (2007 – £18m) relating to tax relief on trading losses.The asset represents
£116m of losses at the standard blended rate of 20.4%.The asset is unprovided as £101m relates to losses which exist within legal entities
that are not forecast to generate taxable income with reasonable certainty in the foreseeable future,and £15m relates to losses in
companies which have closed or are anticipated to be closed.
The deferred tax asset of £1.8m (2007 – £6.7m) relates to trading losses in Belgium and Poland where future proﬁts are anticipated with
reasonable certainty.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of £28m (2007 – £37m) relating to capital losses.The asset represents £135m of losses at the
standard blended rate of 20.4%.The key territory holding the losses is the UK.During the period the Group disposed of the French sub-group.
A liability of £14.7m arose during the year on the acquisition of the Russian and Latvian operations which relates to the requirement to fully
provide for deferred tax of £11.9m on property valuations which do not attract tax allowances and which have been recognised as part of
a business combination,along with other temporal differences of £2.8m.
No deferred tax is recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.The Group controls and manages the
repatriation of the overseas reserves so that they are repatriated at no additional tax cost or alternatively maintains the proﬁts in the
overseas territory where they are reinvested to generate future enhanced proﬁts.If all overseas earnings were repatriated with immediate
effect,tax of £71m (2007 – £39m) would be payable.The increase from 2007 is largely as a result of the Sterling weakness during the year
that enhanced the UK value of overseas unrepatriated reserves.The 2008 Finance Bill has introduced proposals that will allow the
repatriation of overseas earnings by way of a dividend at no additional UK tax cost.The proposals are not as yet substantially enacted and
as such may be open to amendment prior to becoming effective.
Following the 2007 Finance Act,changes to the treatment of industrial buildings allowances and the reduction on the UK standard rate of
corporation tax from 30% to 28%,have now been substantially enacted and an exceptional tax charge of £6.0m has been recognised in
the consolidated income statement in respect of the phased abolition of industrial building allowances.
The £29.9m deferred tax liability for provisions and other timing differences consists of a £45.2m liability in respect of the net book value of
tangible ﬁxed assets that do not qualify for tax allowances and property revaluations and a £15.3m deferred tax asset in respect of
provisions and other temporal differences between the accounts base and the tax base.The key temporal differences are £3.5m for the UK,
£4.1m for Greece,£7.2m for Australia and £0.5m in other territories.

An amount of £48.7m (2007 – £21.3m) has been provided against the gross cost of inventory at the year end.The cost of inventories
recognised as an expense in the year is £4,309m (2007 – £4,278m).The write down of stock to net realisable value recognised as an expense
during the year was £31.5m (2007 – £10.0m).All of these items have been included within cost of sales in the consolidated income statement.

ﬂoating rate was 1.9% (2007 – 4.8%).
£44.0m of cash and cash equivalents is held in countries where prior approval is required to transfer funds abroad.If the Group complies
with the required procedures,such liquid funds are at its disposition within a reasonable period of time.
At 31 December 2008,short-term bank deposits have a weighted average period to maturity of 32 days (2007 – 24 days). 94

Following the Group’s announcement of its intention to dispose of certain non-core franchises in the UK,a number of UK businesses were
classiﬁed in the disposal group in 2007.The disposal of these non-core businesses progressed during 2008 and businesses with net assets
of £20.3m were disposed of during the year.Following the acquisition of the Jaguar and Land Rover franchises by Tata,the Board
decided to retain these brands in the UK and these businesses were therefore removed from the disposal group.
Assets held for sale in 2008 relate to surplus properties that are being actively marketed.

The fair values of the Group’s borrowings are not considered to be materially different from their book value,with the exception of the Private
Placement which includes a £153.1m fair value revaluation.
As in 2007,the Group’s borrowings are unsecured,with the exception of a £3.0m loan which is secured against a property with a book
value of £3.2m.
At 31 December 2008,the Group had drawn £370m of the £500m revolving credit facility which expires in 2013.During the year,the Group
raised £225m in revolving credit facilities which expire in 2011.Of this amount,£185m is a syndicated revolving credit facility and £40m is
a bilateral facility with a relationship bank.
In addition,the Group has a £35m bilateral facility which expires in 2010.
US$475m of the Group’s US$550m Private Placement has been swapped into Sterling (see note 23 for further details).US$350m is repayable
in 9 years and US$200m in 11 years. 97

23 Financial Instruments
The Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities,other than derivatives,comprise bank loans and overdrafts,loan notes,ﬁnance leases and trade and other
payables.The main purpose of these instruments is to raise ﬁnance for the Group’s operations.The Group also has various ﬁnancial assets
such as trade and other receivables,cash and short-term deposits which arise from its trading operations.
The Group’s primary derivative transactions are forward and swap currency contracts,and cross-currency interest rate swaps.The purpose
is to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from the Group’s trading operations and its sources of ﬁnance.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk,currency risk,counterparty risk and liquidity risk.

b.Market risk and sensitivity analysis
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings,deposits and derivative ﬁnancial instruments.The Group is not exposed
to commodity price risk.The following analysis,required by IFRS 7,is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables,being
primarily UK interest rates and the Australian Dollar to JapaneseYen exchange rate.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
• Changes in the carrying value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated as cash ﬂow hedges from movements in interest rates are
assumed to be recorded fully in equity.
• Changes in the carrying value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated as fair value hedges from movements in interest rates have
an immaterial effect on the consolidated income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in the carrying value of debt.
• Changes in the carrying value of ﬁnancial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in the US Dollar to Sterling
exchange rate are recorded directly in equity.
• Changes in the carrying value of ﬁnancial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the consolidated income statement.
• All other changes in the carrying value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on
the consolidated income statement.
c.Interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis
The Group’s interest rate policy has the objective of minimising net interest expense,and protecting the Group from material adverse
movements in interest rates.Throughout 2008 the Group has borrowed at ﬂoating rates only (after taking into account existing interest rate
hedging activities),with the exception of US$75m of debt in the UK and £11.5m in Russia.This approach reﬂects the continuing benign
interest rate environment.If hedging is deemed appropriate by management in the future,the Board has approved the ﬁxing of up to 30%
of gross borrowings.Instruments approved for this purpose include interest rate swaps,forward rate agreements and options.The Group’s
exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates arises primarily from the ﬂoating rate interest payable on the Group’s 10 and 12 year
loan notes,bank borrowings and supplier related ﬁnance.
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates,with all other variables held constant,
of the Group’s proﬁt before tax through the impact of ﬂoating rate borrowings.

d.Foreign currency risk
The Group publishes its consolidated Financial statements in Sterling and faces currency risk on the translation of its earnings and net
assets,a signiﬁcant proportion of which are in currencies other than Sterling.
Transaction exposure hedging
The Group has transactional currency exposures,where sales or purchases by an operating unit are in currencies other than in that unit’s
reporting currency.For a signiﬁcant proportion of the Group these exposures are removed as trading is denominated in the relevant local
currency.In particular,local billing arrangements are in place for many of our businesses with our brand partners.The principal exception
is for our business in Australia which purchases vehicles in JapaneseYen.
In this instance,the Group seeks to hedge forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk using forward foreign currency exchange
contracts.The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to the
extent it is effective and recycled into the consolidated income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects
the consolidated income statement.Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested for the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Hedge of foreign currency debt
The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the forward foreign currency risk associated with US$475m of the US$550m
Private Placement.The effective portion on the gain or loss of the hedge is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the same
time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the consolidated income statement.Under IAS 39 hedges are documented and tested
for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
The Group expects hedges entered into to continue to be effective and therefore does not expect the impact of ineffectiveness on the
consolidated income statement to be material.
Net investment hedging
Consideration is given to the currency mix of debt with the primary objective that interest on such borrowings acts as a hedge on foreign
currency earnings.In accordance with IAS 39 the Group designated US$75m of the Private Placement as a hedge against dollar related
assets in Hong Kong,Saipan and Guam.Under IAS 39 the hedge is documented and tested for hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis.
Foreign currency risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in theYen and US Dollar exchange rates,with

investment hedges).

e.Credit risk
The amount due from counterparties arising from cash deposits and the use of ﬁnancial instruments creates credit risk.The Group monitors
its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where applicable) and through its policy of limiting its exposure to any one
party to ensure that they are within Board approved limits and that there are no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.
Group policy is to deposit cash and use ﬁnancial instruments with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A or better,where
available.The notional amounts of ﬁnancial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the
credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value
of contracts with a positive value.The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other ﬁnancial assets is represented by their
carrying amount.
Credit limits and appropriate limits are reviewed regularly.
The table below shows the credit rating and balances held with major counterparties at the balance sheet date.

No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance
by these counterparties.
At 31 December 2008,total derivative asset balances included £306m which was held with six counterparties and total cash balances
included £173m which was held with eight counterparties.Total cash balances of £458m include cash in the Group’s regional pooling
arrangements which is offset against borrowings for interest purposes.Balance sheet netting of cash and overdraft balances only occurs
to the extent that there is the legal ability and intention to settle net.As such,overdrafts are presented in current liabilities to the extent that
there is no intention to offset with the cash balance.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is very limited due to the Group’s broad customer base.Trade receivables
include amounts due from a number of ﬁnance houses in respect of vehicles sold to customers on ﬁnance arranged through the Group.
An independent credit rating agency is used to assess the credit standing of each ﬁnance house.Limits for the maximum outstanding
with each ﬁnance house are set accordingly.Title to the vehicles sold on ﬁnance resides with the Group until cleared funds are received
from the ﬁnance house in respect of a given vehicle. 101

f.Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufﬁcient cash and marketable securities,the availability of funding through an
adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying
businesses,Group Treasury aims to maintain ﬂexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.

g.Hedging activities
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are carried at their fair values.The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange
swaps represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using
the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2008.
The Group’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise the following:
Assets Liabilities
2008 2007 2008 2007
£m £m £m £m
Cross-currency interest rate swap 155.6 8.0 – –
Forward foreign exchange contracts 151.3 4.9 – 8.3
306.9 12.9 – 8.3
The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of £2.8m
(2007 – a loss of £0.3m).The ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement that arises from cash ﬂow hedges
amounts to a gain of £0.4m (2007 – £0.5m).There was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedges of net investments.
Cash ﬂow hedges
The Group principally uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge purchases in a non-functional currency against movements in
exchange rates.The cash ﬂows relating to these contracts are generally expected to occur within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
The nominal principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts relating to transactional exposures at
31 December 2008 was £464.7m (2007 – £599.9m).
Net fair value gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in shareholders’equity (see note 25) on forward foreign exchange
contracts as at 31 December 2008 are expected to be released to the consolidated income statement within twelve months of the balance
sheet date.
Fair value hedge
At 31 December 2008 the Group had in place 4 cross-currency interest rate swaps totalling US$475m which hedge changes in the fair value
of the Group’s 10 and 12 year loan notes.Under these swaps the Group receives ﬁxed rate US dollar interest of 5.94% on US$275m and 6.04%
on US$200m and pays LIBOR +85bps and LIBOR +90bps for the 10 and 12 year notes respectively.The loan notes and cross-currency interest
rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
Included in borrowings at 31 December 2008 was a borrowing of US$75m (2007 – US$75m),which has been designated as a hedge of
the net investments in Hong Kong,Saipan and Guam and is being used to hedge the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk on these
investments.Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of net
investments in the subsidiaries.
h.Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios
in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.To maintain or adjust
the capital structure,the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders,return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
During 2008 4,460,000 shares were bought for treasury by the Company (2007 – 4,535,000 shares).
The Group monitors group leverage by reference to three tests; adjusted EBITA interest cover,the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the ratio
of net debt to market capitalisation.
2008 2007
Adjusted EBITA Interest cover (times)* 8.0 14.0
Net debt to EBITDA (times)** 1.4 0.7
Net debt/market capitalisation (percentage)*** 227.7% 11.6%
* Calculated as adjusted EBITA/interest on consolidated borrowings
** Calculated as net debt / earnings before exceptional items,interest,tax,depreciation and amortisation
***Calculated as net debt / market capitalisation as at 31 December 103

c.Share buy back programme
At 31 December 2008,the Company held treasury shares with a total book value of £99.4m (2007 – £83.4m).During the year,the Group
repurchased 4,460,000 (2007 – 4,535,000) of its own shares through purchases on the London Stock Exchange.The total consideration paid
was £16.0m (2007 – £18.5m) and this has been deducted from the Retained earnings reserve (see note 25).The shares repurchased during
the year equate to 0.9% (2007 – 0.9%) of the issued share capital.The shares are held as treasury shares and may either be cancelled or
used to satisfy share options at a later date.

Gains and losses on available for sale ﬁnancial assets are recognised in the Available for sale reserve until the asset is sold or is considered
to be impaired,at which time the cumulative gain or loss is included in the consolidated income statement.
Translation reserve
The Translation reserve is used to record foreign exchange rate changes relating to the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries arising
after 1 January 2004.It is also used to record foreign exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency borrowings used to ﬁnance
or hedge foreign currency investments.
Hedging reserve
For cash ﬂow hedges that meet the conditions for hedge accounting,the portion of the gains or losses on the hedging instrument that
are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in shareholders’equity.When the hedged ﬁrm commitment results in the
recognition of a non-ﬁnancial asset or liability then,at the time the asset or liability is recognised,the associated gains or losses that had
previously been recognised in shareholders’equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount
of the asset or liability. 107

27 Acquisitions and disposals
a.Acquisitions
On 8 July 2008,75.1% of the issued share capital of Musa Motors was purchased for a cash consideration of US$200.0m.This US$200.0m
is an initial down payment,with a further payment due which is dependent on 2008 EBITA less acquired debt,subject to a cap of US$250m
in total.The remaining 24.9% is to be acquired in early 2011,with payment dependent on 2010 EBITA,capped at US$250m.Estimates of
these future payments,based on current earnings and forecasts,are set out below.

(i) The intangible assets recognised on acquisition relate to back orders and are recognised at their fair value and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life,which is less
than one year.
(ii) Deferred tax recognised on acquisition includes the recognition of deferred tax on non-qualifying properties in a business combination.
(iii) The provisional goodwill arising on acquisition is attributable to the anticipated future cash ﬂows of the acquired business and synergies expected to arise after the Group’s
acquisition.Speciﬁcally,the goodwill represents the premium paid to expand the Group’s presence in this growth market,achieve regional scale in the premium brand sector and
deliver growth and improved returns far quicker than would have been achievable through organic expansion.
(iv) Prior to acquisition,the book values of the assets acquired were held at recently revalued amounts.Therefore,no further fair value adjustments were necessary upon acquisition.
On 25 March 2008,the Group acquired the remaining 24.9% stake in its St Petersburg business from its joint venture partner,Olimp Group,
for total cash consideration of £28.5m,with goodwill arising on this acquisition of £20.9m.This eliminates the minority interest previously
accounted for.
The remaining goodwill arising in the year is attributable to additional costs incurred relating to acquisitions in the previous year. 109

b.Pro-forma full year information
If the acquisition of Musa Motors had occurred on 1 January 2008,the approximate revenue and operating proﬁt before exceptional
items for the year of the Group would have been £6,690.0m and £259.1m respectively.This information has been estimated based on the
unaudited management accounts as of the date of acquisition.The acquired business contributed revenues of £213.6m and operating
proﬁt before exceptional items of £6.8m to the Group for the period 8 July to 31 December 2008.
c.Disposals
The Group disposed of a number of dealerships and operations during the year,with net disposal proceeds of £27.3m,and a loss on
disposal of businesses of £1.2m,which has not been disclosed as an exceptional item.These disposals include the disposal of the Group’s
business in France for a proﬁt on disposal of £0.4m (after a £2.1m adjustment for historical foreign currency differences recycled to the
consolidated income statement on disposal),satisﬁed by a pre-completion reduction in capital of £18m and disposal proceeds of £7.6m,
and the disposal of various retail outlets in the UK for £18.9m (loss on disposal £2.5m).Additionally,an asset swap in Australia during the
period gave rise to a net gain of £0.8m,recognised in the consolidated income statement.

as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group Financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
responsibilities section of the Corporate Governance report.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).This report,
including the opinion,has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.We do not,
in giving this opinion,accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group Financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group

with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given
in the Directors’report is consistent with the Group Financial
statements.The information given in the Directors’report includes
that speciﬁc information presented in the Operating review and
the Financial review that is cross-referred from the Business review
section of the Directors’report.
In addition we report to you if,in our opinion,we have not received

We review whether the Corporate governance report reﬂects the

irregularity or error.In forming our opinion we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group
Financial statements.

Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These Financial statements are prepared for Inchcape plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 December 2008.The Company
is the ultimate parent entity of the Inchcape Group (the Group).
Accounting convention
These Financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
applicable UK accounting standards.As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985,no separate proﬁt and loss account
is presented for the Company.In addition,the Company is not required to prepare a cash ﬂow statement under the terms of FRS 1–
Cash Flow Statements (revised).
Going Concern
In determining whether the Company is a going concern,the Directors have reviewed the Company’s current ﬁnancial position and have
prepared detailed ﬁnancial projections.These projections reﬂect the recent unprecedented downturn in economic conditions and credit
availability across the Company’s operations,the actions already taken to restructure the business and the plans in place to focus
operations on the ﬁve core priorities of growing market share,growing aftersales,managing working capital and reducing overheads
and capital expenditure (see page 8).
The projections also assume that: new car sales will continue to decline in 2009 and will not begin to recover until the second half of 2010;
the service and parts business will be more resilient to the downturn; lower UK interest rates will continue; key brand partners will remain in
production and supply on normal terms of trade; and there will be no further signiﬁcant downturn in the global economic environment.
These projections,even after allowing for headroom to accommodate a reasonable downside scenario (including weaker trading and
adverse movements in currency and interest rates),indicate that the Company would be able to manage its operations so as to remain
within its current facilities and in compliance with its banking covenants.
Accordingly,after making enquiries,the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue
as a going concern for the foreseeable future.As such,the Company continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at closing rates of exchange and are taken to the proﬁt and loss account.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost,less provisions for impairment.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full (without discounting) based on current tax rates and law,on timing differences that result in an obligation
at the balance sheet date to pay more tax,or a right to pay less tax in the future except as otherwise required by FRS 19 – Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of ﬁxed assets where there is no binding commitment to
sell the asset.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation in respect of a past event,it is more likely than not that an outﬂow
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where the amount can be reliably estimated.Provisions are discounted when the
time value of money is considered material.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares),the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders’
funds until the shares are cancelled,reissued or disposed of.Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued,any consideration
received is included in shareholders’funds.
Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the Financial statements until
they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Share-based payments
The Company operates various share-based award schemes.The fair value at the date at which the share-based awards are granted
is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account (together with a corresponding increase in shareholders’equity) on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period,based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.For equity settled share-based awards,
the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the awards granted.With the exception of the
‘Save as you earn’scheme,the vesting of all share-based awards under all schemes is solely reliant upon non-market conditions therefore
no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.Where an employee cancels a‘Save as you earn’award,the charge for
that award is recognised as an expense immediately,even though the award does not vest.In accordance with the transitional provisions
of FRS 20 – Share-based Payment,no charge has been recognised for grants of equity instruments made before 7 November 2002.
Financial instruments
The adoption by the Company of FRS 29 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures has had no impact as the Company has taken
advantage of the exemption not to apply FRS 29 in its own Financial statements.The Group’s policies on the recognition,measurement
and presentation of ﬁnancial instruments under IFRS 7 are set out in the Group’s accounting policies on pages 62 to 67. 116

19 March 2009 Leading the way for over 160 years
We have chosen the Inchcape lighthouse
as the symbol for this year’s annual report
because of the significance it holds –
both for our Company’s founders and
for us today.
Our leading founder,James Lyle Mackay,
was so inspired by the building of the
lighthouse on the Inchcape Rock – a lethal
submerged reef off the Scottish coast –
that he took the title‘Baron Inchcape of
Strathnaver’and so named the company
that he led.
From our Company’s earliest days as an
intrepid trading pioneer to today’s status
as a leader in the highly competitive
automotive industry,Inchcape has been a
beacon of performance,even in the midst
of the most disruptive economic storms.
Solid,responsive,confident,the qualities on
which Inchcape was founded,are precisely
those that have seen the Company thrive
and prosper through more than 160 often
turbulent years.
As we face challenging times,we too are
inspired by the Inchcape lighthouse.With its
robust structure that stands strong against
the North Sea and the pioneering spirit
of those that built this lasting wonder of the
industrial age that even now continues to
save lives,its guiding light illuminates the
journey ahead.

Report & Accounts 2003
2003 was a year of strong growth
in all of our operating businesses.
Additionally, the Group realised
significant value from the listing
of its former subsidiary, IP2IPO
Group Plc (formerly IP2IPO Group
Limited (“IP2IPO”)). Overall, I am
pleased to report a profit before
tax of £17.9 million (2002: loss
£23.8 million). Total shareholder
return rose 88% during 2003, 48%
ahead of the FTSE Smallcap Index.
Results
Evolution Beeson Gregory Limited
(“EVBG”) had a very good first full
year as a combined business and
our investment banking platform
developed significantly during 2003.
We continued to gain market share
in the small and mid cap sectors in
sales and trading and our
significantly enhanced market
making business performed well
and ahead of our expectations.
Corporate broking remained a
cornerstone of our business with
significant transactions completed
and funds raised for our clients.
Operating income has grown by
264% to £32.1m in 2003 with all
divisions showing extremely strong
growth. Finally, our research
coverage continues to increase in
depth and quality as evidenced by
our improved ratings in key market
surveys such as Extel and
Institutional Investor. Christows Limited (“Christows”), the
Group’s private client stockbroking
and fund management business,
had a second profitable year after
its restructuring in 2001. It
continues to increase its funds
under management, reaching
£477m as at 31 December 2003
(2002: £327m), an increase of 46%.
Strategic funds under management,
on which we receive recurring fees,
now represent 83% of this total
(2002: 77%). This business is
developing to plan and has
increased its geographical coverage
with the opening of a new office in
Bath, strengthening its presence in
the South and South West of
England. 
IP2IPO has made a significant
transformation during 2003.
Following the successful listing on
AIM on 15 October 2003, IP2IPO is
now a separate and independently
functioning operation. The Group
has reduced its holding in this
company to 40.61% following the
sale of 5,460,000 shares upon the
flotation. This process realised
£15m of cash.
Board changes
The Board is delighted to have
announced the appointment of
Nicholas Irens as a Non-executive
director on 1 January 2004. Nick
has a wealth of experience, from
both executive and non-executive
roles, and is a valuable addition to
the Board. 
At the time of the announcement
of IP2IPO’s preliminary results on 18
March 2004, David Norwood, the
Chief Executive of IP2IPO, informed
the Board of his decision to step
down as a Non-executive director of
the Company. I would like to take
this opportunity on behalf of the
Board, employees and shareholders
to thank David for his enormous
contribution both in the creation
and the successful building of the
Group.
Employees
The results of our operating
businesses are determined largely by
the efforts and commitment of our
staff who are one of the principal
assets of the Group. I would like to
thank everyone for their efforts last
year which contributed to a
successful 2003. As highlighted at
the interim stage and in the
subsequent shareholder notice, the
Group implemented an all employee
share incentive plan which has now
been successfully launched, through
which the majority of employees
have taken the opportunity to
purchase Evolution shares every
month, which are then matched by
the Company where individuals
remain in the Group for three years.
Additionally, throughout the Group,
there are other option and share
schemes which we use to provide
equity participation to incentivise
and motivate our key employees.  
Dividend
The Board recommends the
payment of a dividend of 0.25p per
share (2002: Nil). This represents an
acknowledgement of our growth in
confidence in the income growth
and profitability of the Group. It is
anticipated that a progressive
dividend policy will be pursued as
the Group achieves its objectives in
2004.
Outlook
As the first quarter of 2004
comes towards a conclusion, I am
pleased to announce that our
businesses are all continuing to
progress well and your Board is
confident of further success in
2004.

Report & Accounts 2003
Review of the year
The Group made substantial
progress in 2003. All areas of our
business have been strong, and
there has been a significant
increase in revenue generation.
Total revenue in 2003 was £40.8m
(2002: £15.8m), an increase of 159%.
During 2003, the Group was able to
create substantial shareholder value
in separating, by way of flotation,
our intellectual property subsidiary
IP2IPO, and the Group saw a
significant realisation from the sale
of part of the Group’s interest.
The core of the Group’s business
now consists principally of
Institutional Equity broking and
Private client stockbroking and fund
management, and both businesses
have outperformed the respective
budgets for 2003. It has always
been the Group’s strategy to retain
separate brands, and both are
managed as independent businesses
in all respects.

Report & Accounts 2003
EVBG continues to be the largest
operating business within the
Group. Total operating income
increased by 264% to £32.1m (2002:
£8.8m), although conditions in 2003
were mixed. The first half was
dominated by the Gulf War and
difficult equity markets. EVBG was
able to trade profitably through this
period, with the reduced cost
structure that was introduced in
2002. The appetite for risk increased
in the second half of 2003 and
EVBG was able to accelerate its
income generation and profitability.
Corporate broking
Our corporate broking track
record in 2003 has been extremely
encouraging, overall income
increased by 285% to £17.3m
(2002: £4.5m).
During 2003 EVBG advised on 60
transactions. In total, we raised
£271m for our clients. Our ability to
provide these services successfully
for our clients comes from our
knowledge and understanding of
those client companies and the 
in-depth research into these
companies and their business
opportunities. Our retained
corporate client list had increased
to 107 at the year end. The
opportunity is still substantial to
provide integrated advisory services
to small and mid-cap UK companies.
EVBG continues to be innovative in
its thinking to provide equity
finance solutions to our customers.
Equity research and Equity
distribution
In research, EVBG has continued
to increase our sector coverage in
2003, reinforcing EVBG’s aim to be
a research led equity business with
qualified, specialist analysts. At the
year end, EVBG had coverage of in
excess of 190 stocks across sectors,
including: health, pharmaceutical
and biotech, general retail, leisure
and hotels, media and
entertainment, support services,
electronics, software, mining, oil
and gas, construction/building,
materials and infrastructure. The
improved research product is
evidenced by the continued market
share growth in sales and the
improved ratings in surveys such 
as Extel and Institutional Investor.
Sales and distribution have
strengthened throughout 2003.
EVBG has seen an increase in the
flow of secondary sales
commissions. New recruits to the
team have successfully secured new
sales channels into international
institutional investors. This new
dimension has increased
substantially the distribution
platform at EVBG.
Market-making and Trading
In 2003, EVBG made significant
changes to our trading operation.
In April, a new team was recruited
to realign entirely the market-
making direction, increasing the
number of stocks that we make
prices in to over 600 by the year
end. All our market-making and
trading activities across the mid and
the small cap traded profitably in
2003 and EVBG saw a significant
increase in transaction volumes.
Market-making ensures the
operation of an orderly and liquid
market and provides a service to
retail stockbrokers. EVBG has been
able to increase this part of the
business by adding further
electronic connectivity via the Retail
Service Provider (“RSP”) mechanism.
At the year end, we were members
of the London Stock Exchange and
Proquote hubs and have begun the
process of adding a further two RSP
connections.  
In summary, 2003 has seen EVBG’s
businesses develop significantly. 
I believe that, as we approach the
end of the first quarter of 2004, we
are confident of further income and
profitability growth . Chief Executive’s Report

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
In 2003, we set a plan for
Christows of growth in scale and
attaining profitability. I am
pleased to report that both of
these achievements were met.
Total income increased by over
25% to £8.3 million which,
coupled with continued tight
management of costs, produced a
second consecutive profitable year
after the restructuring in 2001.
Transaction based income increased
by 39% from 2002 and included an
exceptional performance from our
contracts for difference team which
doubled its income. Our strategy of
growing funds under management,
particularly those strategic funds
upon which recurring management
fees are received, also proved
successful. Strategic funds under
management increased by 59% over
the previous period to £398m
(2002: £250m) making up 83% of
total funds under management at
the year end (2002: 77%).
Our growth in funds under
management was underpinned by
record sales, for the third
consecutive year, for our
professional intermediary sales
team, leading to Christows winning
new mandates to increase
significantly year end funds under
management to approximately
£477 million, an increase of 46%
over last year. Within our funds
under management we have seen
an extension of our offering to a
wider potential client base via our
OEIC, Multi-Manager Portfolio
Service and the successful Private
Portfolio Account, where we have
seen further growth in the average
portfolio size of our bespoke
discretionary clients. In addition, we
have been successful in recruiting
likeminded individuals who can
attract new clients to supplement
the organic growth from our sales
activities, and have been joined by
new account executives from a
variety of competitors.
During the middle part of the year,
we continued our regional
development by opening a new
branch office in Bath, which we
strongly believe will have
considerable potential in 2004 and
beyond. Finally, as the year came to
a close, we completed the process
of repatriating our OEICs to the UK
from Dublin, which will allow our
Fund Management team to utilise
the flexibility introduced by the new
UCITS legislation to supplement the
excellent performance of the funds
last year.
Christows begins 2004 with a
robust, scaleable platform for
growth and a continuation of the
trends apparent in the second half
of 2003 should contribute to
accelerating profitability in the
current year. IP2IPO operated as a subsidiary 
of the Group until October and
during this period concluded its
third university  partnership, when
in May 2003 it entered into a 25
year partnership with King’s
College London. At this point, it
raised £6.25 million through a
further round of private financing
to develop this relationship. In
September 2003, IP2IPO agreed
terms of a new 25 year partnership
with the University of York’s Centre
for Novel Agricultural Products
(‘‘CNAP’’) which was conditional
upon IP2IPO’s admission to AIM. 
In October 2003, IP2IPO
successfully listed on AIM raising
£31.5 million valuing this group at
£111.8 million. Since then it has
continued to make progress in the
development of spin out companies
from its on-going university
partnerships. At the time of the
admission to AIM, the Group
realised £15m from the sale of its
majority stake, leaving it with
40.61% of IP2IPO at the year end.
IP2IPO now operates as a separate,
independently managed business
and the Group’s interest is
monitored through the position of
Non-executive director, which I hold
on its board.
New Business
In August 2003, trading
commenced in Evolution Securities
China Limited (‘‘ESCL’’). This
company has its principal office in
London and a branch in Shanghai.
It offers investment banking services
to both Chinese and UK institutions
and is well placed strategically to
access the growing Chinese equities
market. ESCL combines a deep
knowledge of China, its economy
and its securities industry with first-
class securities analysis, sales
support and trade execution. ESCL
aims to meet the growing need
from professional investors for
attractive investment opportunities
in China at an acceptable level of
risk. ESCL’s integration within the
Group ensures that its corporate
activities are efficient and well
supported. ESCL is an appointed
representative of Evolution Beeson
Gregory Limited. 
Official List & New Offices
As outlined in the half year results,
the Company completed the move
to the Official List on 26 June 2003.
The head office for the Group and
its investment banking operations
changed to 100 Wood Street in
August 2003. The facilities provided
in this modern office, in the heart
of the City of London, has provided
a strong platform for our trading
and settlement operations and
brought us closer to our clients and
institutional investors.
Both of these achievements were
completed under tight timetables
and cost effectively.
Employees
We continue to recognise the
importance of developing a culture
where the employees’ interests are
aligned mutually with those of the
Group’s shareholders. This is
something that we aim to achieve
for the key performers in all of our
business units. Through the use of
the Group’s principal share and
share option schemes, we are able
to manage this by combining staff
incentivisation with a high degree
of loyalty. The use of such
arrangements resulted in a profit
and loss impact across the Group
during 2003 of £3.0 million,
principally in the form of a charge
for the cost of options (difference
between the market value of each
1p ordinary share and the exercise
price at the time of grant). It is our
firm belief that these arrangements
are extremely effective and that
incentivising and retaining our key
employees are in the interests of the
Group’s shareholders.

Adjusted operating profit
The statutory operating profit for the overall Group is as shown below. The Board believes a truer reflection of the
performance of the Group's on-going operating businesses is afforded by the measure ‘‘adjusted operating profit’’. 
This is calculated so as to exclude items from operating profit that are one-off or non-recurring, are not part of the 
on-going business profitability or, in the case of the cost of options and amortisation, represent non-cash items. 
The following table reconciles these two measures and demonstrates the significant progress made on a combined
Group basis in moving from an adjusted operating loss of £2.5 million in 2002 to an adjusted operating profit of 
£10.6 million in 2003.

progress made in both EVBG and Christows in 2003 from the previous period.
Investment Banking
Turning first to the Investment banking business of EVBG, there has been
significant growth in the scale and profitability of this business turning around
an adjusted operating loss of £0.5m in 2002 into an adjusted operating profit of
£10.6m in 2003.

Revenue analysis
Further analysis of the quality of income achieved within the business shows the
balance of revenue between primary revenue and secondary income from sales and
trading. 
Cost analysis 
The overall cost/income ratio for the investment banking business is 66% 
(2002: 104%). A further examination of the cost structure of the investment
banking business shows that staff costs are 65% of the total cost base in 2003
with significantly more than half of this being entirely performance related.

Private client stockbroking and fund management
Turning to Christows, the Group’s private client stockbroking and fund
manager, 2003 has seen a continuation of the progress made last year with a
second consecutive year with an increase in adjusted operating profit from
£0.2m in 2002 to £0.4m in 2003. This occurred even taking into account the
extreme downturn in the first half of 2003, which saw the business levels in
this sector at an unprecedented low level.

Adjusted operating profit 363 212
Non-recurring and exceptional costs relate to costs of redundancy and search
expenses related to the acquisition of new account executive teams.
Revenue analysis
Christows’ sales commissions have increased significantly in 2003 over 2002, 
in particular due to the doubling of income from the contracts for difference
business. The recurring management fees on its strategic funds under management
have grown marginally over the whole year, with levels significantly reduced in
the first half, as market levels fell, and enhanced in the second half as funds
under management grew through sales and performance.
Cost analysis 
The overall cost/income ratio for Christows has improved to 69% (2002: 75%).
Further examination of the cost structure within Christows shows it remains
tightly managed and highly predictable. We have invested in the business in
2003 by opening a further office in Bath and recruiting a number of account
executives in the other offices. In addition we continue to invest in the systems
and infrastructure to support and further develop this business.

asset investment portfolio has a carrying value of £0.9 million (2002: £6.4
million) and current asset investments held at a carrying value of £0.4m (2002:

IP2IPO
The Group now retains 40.61% of IP2IPO Group Plc following the deemed
disposal of the Group’s interest in May, and the deemed disposal and sale of
shares in October 2003 at the time of its admission to AIM. This investment is
now treated as an associated undertaking within the Group and Company
accounts under FRS 9. As a result of the change in status from being a
subsidiary in 2002 to being an associate from 15 October 2003, the results of
IP2IPO to 15 October 2003 have been treated within continued earnings. In
future periods, the Group will recognise its share of operating profit, interest
and tax in the profit and loss account and its share of the fair value of net
assets in the balance sheet. 
The overall impact of the disposals in 2003 is a total gross profit of £16.9
million from which transaction costs and special bonus awards are deducted
resulting in a net profit of £15.1 million. Under FRS 3, Reporting Financial
Performance, this profit falls within the definition of “exceptional items” and is
thus disclosed separately after operating profit.
Balance sheet strength
The Group remains focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. At the
year end it had net assets of £91.9 million (2002: £76.0 million) including cash
of £53.7 million (2002: £32.0 million). 
Cashflow
The Group generated positive cash inflow of £21.7m in the year (2002:
outflow of £4.0m). This has been achieved principally by operating profitability
and the disposal of IP2IPO.
Dividend
The Board is proposing an inaugural dividend per share for 2003 of 0.25p.
This dividend is payable on 4 June 2004 to shareholders on the register on 
7 May 2004.

Employees
The average and actual number of employees, including directors, employed by the Group and their remuneration is
disclosed in notes 3, 7 and 8. 
Employment Policies
The Group encourages employees to participate in its success through performance based bonus arrangements and
through its use of share based incentive arrangements amongst its key performers within each of the business units. To
further this overall equity participation the Company has introduced an all Employees’ Share Ownership Plan, which was
approved by shareholders at the EGM on 10 October 2003. Following its introduction in February 2004, it allows every
employee to purchase up to £1,500 worth of the Company’s shares per annum on a tax efficient basis. These are purchased
on a monthly basis and held in trust and are matched by shares issued by the Company.
Employees are kept informed of the Group’s progress by half yearly Group results presentations. In addition, there are
monthly Executive Committee meetings from which further information is distributed to employees.
It is the Group’s policy that no employee, or applicant for employment, receives less favourable treatment (including
training and development, recruitment and promotion) by the Group or any other employee, on any grounds, including
disability, nor be disadvantaged by conditions, management attitudes, behaviour or requirements that cannot be justified. Implementation of IFRS
The adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) framework for the year to 31 December 2005 is
applicable to the Company as a listed entity and will be adopted. It is not anticipated that the accounting treatment for
items within the profit and loss account will be materially different under the new regime. There are expected to be
differences in the balance sheet treatment of fixed asset investments under IAS 28, Investments In Associates; goodwill
under IAS 38, Intangible Assets; and employee share awards under IFRS 2, Share Based Payments. The difference in
treatment in these balance sheet items will impact the profit and loss account. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the independent auditors’ report set out on pages 30 to
31, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the
independent auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit
or loss for the financial year.
The directors consider that in preparing the financial statements on pages 32 to 72 that:
• the Company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by
reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and 
• all the accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed, and
• the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company and the Group keep accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group and which enable them to ensure the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
Company and the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and pursuant to section 384 (1) of the
Companies Act 1985, an ordinary resolution re-appointing them as auditors and authorising the directors to determine their
remuneration will be proposed at the 2004 Annual General Meeting. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the
appointment of the external auditors.

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
Compliance
The directors are responsible for the corporate governance of the Group. They support the principles of good corporate
governance and code of best practice laid down by the Combined Code issued in June 1998. Since the Company’s
successful application to the Official List on 26 June 2003 it has been in compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, issued in June 1998, as endorsed by the Financial Services Authority, 
save for the adoption by the Board of a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision. Throughout 2003, such 
items were addressed by the Board as a matter of course but these were not detailed in a formal list of reserved matters. 
This policy was formalised by the Board in February 2004 with the adoption of a formal schedule of matters reserved.
The manner in which the Group has applied the principles of good governance set out in the Combined Code is outlined
below.
Directors
The Board comprises three Executive and four Non-executive directors, whose biographies are set out on page 14 to 15. 
Sir Malcolm Field, the senior Non-executive director, Nick Irens, George Loudon and Oliver Vaughan are independent of
management for the purposes of the Combined Code. 
The Executive Chairman, Richard Griffiths, is responsible for the conduct of the Board and its oversight of the Group’s
affairs and strategy. The Chief Executive, Alex Snow, is responsible for the management of the business, the co-ordination 
of its activities and the development of strategy. In addition, Sir Malcolm Field acts as independent senior Non-executive
director. The Board believes that these arrangements facilitate the effective management of the business and provide a
strong control environment.
The biographies on pages 14 to 15 demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent
judgement on issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct which is vital to the success of the
Group. The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. A statement of the directors’
responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 19 and a statement on going concern is set out below.
The Board has a schedule of 12 meetings per annum to discuss matters arising in the Group’s ordinary course of business.
Additional meetings are arranged as required. The Board is provided with appropriate information on a timely basis to
enable it to discharge its duties. The Board has put in place a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision,
including, inter alia, developing the future direction of the Group’s business, approving material transactions and budgets
and monitoring the Group’s progress. This was presented at the Board meeting in January 2004 and formally adopted on
26 February 2004. All directors receive written reports prior to each Board meeting which enable them to make an
informed decision on the corporate and business issues under review.
Beneath the Board there is a structure of delegated authority which sets out the authority levels allocated to the Executive
Committees of the Group’s three operating subsidiaries: Christows Limited; Evolution Beeson Gregory Limited and Evolution
Securities China Limited. The Executive Committees comprise the CEO and Finance Director and members of the senior
management teams of the three respective entities.
The terms of the directors’ service agreements and letters of appointment are summarised in the Report on Directors’
Remuneration. All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting of shareholders after
their appointment. Thereafter, all directors are required to retire by rotation and one third of the Board will seek re-election
at each future annual general meeting. At the forthcoming AGM in May, Nicholas Irens will be subject to election as this will be the first AGM after his appointment.
Richard Griffiths and Graeme Dell will retire by rotation and, being eligible, seek re-election. Resolutions proposing their
election are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. All directors have access to the services of the Company
Secretary and there are procedures in place for taking independent professional advice at the Group’s expense if required.
The following committees deal with the specific aspects of the Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of independent Non-executive directors. George Loudon, who acts as Chairman of the
Audit Committee, Sir Malcolm Field, Oliver Vaughan and Nicholas Irens. Nicholas Irens joined the Committee upon his
appointment to the Board on 1 January 2004. Nicholas is a chartered accountant with recent and relevant financial
experience. The Audit Committee met three times during the course of 2003. The Committee’s terms of reference include:
reviewing the scope and findings of the external audit at interim and final stage; the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
control procedures; the reporting of results; and the requirement for an internal audit function. The Group’s auditors and
the Executive directors may attend committee meetings by invitation. The Committee has a discussion with the external
auditors at least once a year without Executive directors being present, to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of
concern. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of independent Non-executive directors. The members are Sir Malcolm Field,
who acts as Chairman, George Loudon and Oliver Vaughan. In addition David Norwood sat on this committee as a non-
independent Non-executive member until his resignation in March 2004. Nicholas Irens joined the Committee upon his
appointment to the Board on 1 January 2004. The Remuneration Committee met four times during 2003. The Committee is
responsible for agreeing the remuneration of the Executive directors of the Company and for granting share options under
the Company’s share option schemes. The full Board is responsible for agreeing the remuneration of the Non-executive
directors. The Chief Executive and Executive Chairman attend certain parts of meetings of the Remuneration Committee by
invitation. Further details of the Group’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and share options are given in the
Report on Directors’ Remuneration.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Richard Griffiths, the Executive Chairman, who is joined by all the Non-executive
directors. The Nominations Committee is responsible for proposing candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard
to the balance and structure of the Board. The appointment of Nicholas Irens on 1 January 2004 was considered by the full
Board to improve the breadth and depth of experience of its Non-executive directors. The Nominations Committee met twice
during 2003. No external advertising or external advice was used in connection with this appointment. The Board considered
that the broad knowledge and experience of Nicholas Irens in his past executive positions and current and recent Non-
executive positions across a range of industries and company ownership structures would be an important asset to the Board.
Review of Internal controls and Risks 
The Group operates an on-going process of internal controls which are designed to manage rather than eliminate entirely
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. Therefore these can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.

Report & Accounts 2003 Corporate Governance

22
the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
At the time of the Group’s application to move from AIM to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority on 29 May 2003
(completed 26 June 2003), the Board carried out a review of its financial and management reporting procedures, internal
control systems and risk management. The Board concluded these were sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for it to
make proper judgements as to the financial position and prospects of The Evolution Group Plc in accordance with
paragraph 2.15 of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Group has continued to maintain these procedures
throughout the subsequent period.
The Board is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. At the Board
meeting in March 2004 the Audit Committee reported on a follow up review performed in February and March 2004 which
reviewed the ongoing effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems. The review considered all the controls, including
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. The Group has decided that due to its size and the
relatively limited scope of its operations that it has sufficient monitoring, reconciliation and control procedures in place to
justify not having an internal audit function. This situation will continue to be monitored by the Board. 
The Group has detailed policies and procedures in place in all areas of its operations. Its operations, finance and compliance
staff utilise extensive reconciliation and monitoring to ensure control throughout the reporting of its business operations.
Trading is monitored by the Executive directors daily. The Board considers monthly management accounts and compares
actual performance against budgets and plans and discusses any issues arising therefrom. In addition the Evolution Beeson
Gregory Limited and Christows Limited Executive Committees meet monthly to consider all major operational issues, trading
developments and ad hoc projects in the respective operating businesses.
Evolution Beeson Gregory Limited and Christows Limited are both authorised and regulated by the Financial Services
Authority. Evolution Securities China Limited is an appointed representative of EVBG. The Group therefore has a specialist
compliance department. This department is responsible for maintaining a detailed and up to date understanding and
interpretation of the rules and regulations that each of the entities is subject to and carrying out regular monitoring that
procedures are being implemented in compliance with these rules. The Compliance officers are in regular contact with the
Executive directors and report formally to the Board each month and periodically to the Audit Committee.
The Company has complied with the Turnbull Committee’s guidance for directors. Identifying, evaluating and managing the
Group’s significant risks is an ongoing process which is regularly reviewed by the Board, and which has been in place for
the year ended 31st December 2003 and up to the date of the approval of these financial statements.
The Committee concludes that the risks identified for the year to 31 December 2003 are adequately managed and
mitigated through the robust system of internal controls in place throughout the Group. The report to the Committee in
March 2004 also supported the conclusion that the on-going effectiveness of internal controls remains intact. 
Going Concern
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as the directors have satisfied themselves that, at the time
of approving the financial statements, the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. Auditor independence
The Group has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors of the holding company and all subsidiaries since 2001.
During the year the Audit Committee reviewed the cost effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the auditors. The
auditors disclosed the level of fees received in respect of the various services provided by their firm in addition to audit
during 2003. They confirmed to the Audit Committee that they did not believe that the level of non-audit fees had affected
their independence. The Audit Committee’s policy is to use the most appropriate advisers for non-audit work taking
account of the need to maintain independence.
In addition to their statutory audit responsibilities, the Group will typically use the auditors for other work that they are well
placed to undertake in that role. This includes areas such as: regulatory reviews and other ancillary audit work; work in
respect of acquisitions and disposals; and tax and VAT compliance.
Several firms are considered for other work, including the auditors in some instances. In such cases due consideration is
given to the impact of the assignment on the independence of the auditors and to their qualifications to carry out the role.
Having given consideration to the extra work undertaken by the auditors, and after careful discussion with the responsible
partner in the firm and the Executive directors, the Audit Committee is satisfied as to the independence of the statutory
auditors.
Relations with Shareholders
The Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review in this report and accounts include a detailed
review of the business and future developments as a way of informing shareholders of the Group’s performance and
progress. There is also regular dialogue with institutional investors, and analysts, principally around the time of the
Company’s preliminary announcement of results for the year and also when the interim results are announced. The Board
uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation.
The Chairman aims to ensure that all of the directors are available at Annual General Meetings to answer questions. The
proxy votes cast on each resolution proposed at general meetings are disclosed at those meetings.
The Board recognises the importance of investor relations and communications with shareholders throughout the year as
well as at the time of results. The Group’s website at www.evolution-group.com contains information on the Group, its
operating subsidiaries and the products and services which it offers as well as share price performance and recent
announcements.

Report & Accounts 2003 Remuneration Report

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee the assessment and recommendation of policy on the
remuneration for Executive directors.
The constitution and operation of the Committee comply with the Best Practice Provisions on Directors’ Remuneration in the
Combined Code of the UK Listing Authority.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, which introduced new
statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December
2002. The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and describes how the
Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the Remuneration
Report Regulations, the directors remuneration report will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for approval.
Members of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of independent Non-executive directors. Sir Malcolm Field was the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee throughout 2003. For the entire period he was joined on the Committee by George Loudon and
Oliver Vaughan. David Norwood was appointed to the Remuneration Committee upon his appointment as Non-executive
director on 9 September 2003 until his resignation on 18 March 2004. Nicholas Irens joined the Committee from 1 January
2004, the date of his appointment to the Board.
Remuneration Policy
Throughout the Group there is an overriding philosophy on remuneration to attract, retain and incentivise the best staff.
This is a people business and they are the key to the ongoing success of the business. 
Consistent with this philosophy, the Group’s reward structure for the Executive directors is to provide competitive
employment packages. Executive directors’ rewards comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related
remuneration. A high proportion of total remuneration is to be delivered through performance designed not only to
incentivise directors, but also to adhere to good corporate governance practice. 
During the year the Committee has utilised the services of professional advisors that specialise in matters of executive
director remuneration. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee met with representatives of several institutional
shareholders to outline the Group’s remuneration policy.
Remuneration packages
The Executive directors reward packages are made up of three elements. Firstly, the fixed component is made up of basic
salary and benefits in kind such as medical, life and critical illness and permanent health insurances and car allowance. In
2002 the Board implemented a salary cap throughout the Group of £100,000. This included Executive directors and was
kept in place throughout 2003 and is intended to remain in place going forward. Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis
at the time of the Group performance appraisal process that takes place at the end of each calendar year.
Secondly, there is an annual performance bonus. The Group has implemented an annual bonus scheme as part of the
Group’s overall reward structure in common with general practice in the investment banking and stockbroking sectors. 
The Remuneration Committee has implemented these schemes with regard to the attainment of certain performance goals
from the respective business units to ensure an appropriate share of income between staff and shareholders taking into
account the market conditions and the stage of development of the business units. The annual performance bonus
component of the Executive directors is drawn from these overall bonus schemes. Each director has detailed, demanding
and in some cases different operating business and Group performance criteria against which they are measured. These
performance goals are set by the Remuneration Committee and performance is determined by them. Thirdly, the final element of reward for the Executive directors is the long term incentive plan in the form of the award of
shares in the Company under the 2002 Executive share incentive scheme. The first of these awards was made by the
Remuneration Committee in November 2003 in respect of the services of the CEO, Alex Snow, for the periods 2004 and
2005. The award was conditional upon strict performance criteria that requires a growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings
per share based upon the “adjusted operating profit” measure of the Group over the two periods of 15% per annum from
the level attained in the first half of 2003. This measure has been chosen as it best reflects the Group’s target for growth
appropriate to the sector and the market conditions in which the Group operates, and is therefore appropriately aligned
with shareholders’ interests. These awards will be confirmed at the time of the announcement of the results for these two
years in April 2005 and 2006 respectively.
Special bonuses and awards
The Remuneration Committee made two further elements of special compensation awards to some of the Executive
directors in 2003 in respect of certain special circumstances.
In October 2003 at the time of the admission to AIM of the Group’s former subsidiary company, IP2IPO Group Plc, the
Group was able to crystallise an amount of £15 million upon the sale of a part of its stake alongside the placing by IP2IPO
of new shares to investors. The Remuneration Committee viewed the achievement of this as a significant milestone in the
recognition of value for shareholders of the business acquired at the time of the acquisition of Beeson Gregory in July 2002.
Therefore a special bonus of 10% of the net cash realised was created and awarded amongst the Executive directors and
staff that had made the greatest contribution towards delivering this value to the Group.
In November 2003, the Remuneration Committee made an award under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Scheme to the
CEO, Alex Snow, in recognition of the conclusion of negotiations securing the establishment of an appropriate service
contract. Prior to this Mr Snow’s services were the subject of verbal arrangements made at the time of his joining the Group
in a non-board capacity in May 2000. The new arrangements are in the form of a formal service agreement that is legally
enforceable and contains the appropriate notice clauses and restrictive covenants. The Board considered that the Group’s
interests were served by the establishment of such a contract as a matter of paramount importance given that securing Mr
Snow’s ongoing services is believed to be fundamental to the success of the Group. This was previously announced by an
RNS announcement dated 14 November 2003.
Proportion of fixed and variable remuneration
In line with the reward structure outlined above, the relative proportions of fixed annual remuneration and performance
related pay made for 2003 for the executive directors are as follows:-
Non-Performance related Performance related

Directors’ service contracts
The Combined Code recommends that a one-year notice period or contract terms be set as an objective for Executive
directors. The Remuneration Committee’s policy is that service contracts should not have a notice period exceeding 
12 months and should not contain a liquidated damages clause in the event of termination.
All Executive directors have service contracts with no fixed terms and with notice periods of 12 months or less. The principal
terms extant in these contracts are as set out below. The directors’ service contracts and letters of engagement for Non-
executive directors will be available for inspection at the Company’s AGM.
Contractual
Contract date Notice period termination payments
Alex Snow 13.11.03 12 months None
Richard Griffiths 29.03.01 12 months None
Graeme Dell 03.07.01 3 months None
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts. The dates of their appointment are shown on pages 14 to 15.
The Non-executive directors are each appointed for an initial term of one year and thereafter reviewed at the time of each
AGM. Fees for all Non-executive directors are set by the Chairman and Executive directors. The Non-executive directors are
not involved in the discussions to determine their own remuneration.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Group’s annual bonus arrangements or long-term incentive arrangements. 
David Norwood was granted share options during his time as an Executive director of the Company and participated in
bonuses during 2003 in respect of his services as an Executive director up until 9 September 2003. At this point he took up
full time executive responsibilities with IP2IPO and became a Non-executive director of the Company. David resigned as a
director of the Company on 18 March 2004. 
The above graph shows the total shareholder return (“TSR”) against that of the FTSE Smallcap Index. TSR is calculated
assuming dividends are reinvested on receipt.
Over the last five years, The Evolution Group Plc has significantly outperformed the FTSE Smallcap Index to give a total
shareholder return for the five year period of 407%, compared to a total shareholder return provided by the FTSE Smallcap
Index of 37%.

No options lapsed during the year to 31 December 2003.
Save as set out above, no directors nor members of the immediate family of directors, have any options over shares in the

in the Company.
The market price for an ordinary share in the Company at 31 December 2003 was £1.015 (2002: £0.54). The highest price
throughout the year was £1.025 and the lowest was £0.33.
Summary of schemes for Directors’ options in the above tables
1 These options were granted under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme. Under the terms of this scheme the performance criteria require
that the closing bid of The Evolution Group Plc share price as derived from the Daily Official List published by The London Stock Exchange Plc
must be not less on average than a specified amount for a period of sixty consecutive days before options can be exercised. If the share price is
90p then 25% of the options may be exercised, 110p a further 25% may be exercised, 130p then a further 25% may be exercised and 150p the
remaining 25% may be exercised.
2 These options were granted under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (Unapproved Ordinary). A performance criteria has been set making
the exercise of the option conditional on the middle market quotation of The Evolution Group Plc share price increasing by an average of 50%
above the relevant exercise price over a period of 30 dealing days since the date of the grant.
3 These options were granted under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme (Unapproved Super). No performance criteria are attached to the
exercise of these options.
4 These options were granted outside of any share scheme. No performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these options.
5 These options were granted under the Beeson Gregory Group Executive Share Incentive Scheme 1996. No performance criteria were attached 
to the exercise of these options.  6 These options were granted under the Beeson Gregory Group Deferred Bonus Plan. No performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these options.
7 These options were granted under the Beeson Gregory Group Replacement Options Agreement. No performance criteria were attached to the
exercise of these options. 
8 These options were granted under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Plan. No performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these
options. This award is immediately exercisable but Mr Snow is restricted from selling any shares acquired until the announcement of the interim
results for the period to 30 June 2004.
9 These options were granted under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Plan. The options are granted subject to performance criteria in respect of
the Group’s adjusted earnings per share (based upon the adjusted operating profit figure divided by the weighted average number of shares) for
the full years in 2004 and 2005. To fully vest the Group’s adjusted earnings per share will need to grow by 15% per annum over the annualised
level achieved in the first half of 2003 of 1.34p. This will be confirmed at the time of the announcement of the Group’s results for these periods
in April 2005 and April 2006 respectively. This measure has been chosen as it best reflects the Group’s target for growth appropriate to the
sector, market conditions in which the Group operates, and is therefore appropriately aligned with shareholders’ interests. 
10 These options were cancelled during the year.
11 These options were granted under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme at an exercise price of 41.4p. This award was made in respect of
historic performance and partly in recognition of the cancellation of the previous award. No performance criteria are attached to the exercise 
of these options. 
12 These options were granted under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Plan. This award was made in respect of historic performance.
No performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these options.

Gregory Group schemes are now closed.

Report & Accounts 2003 Independent Auditors’ Report

the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of The Evolution Group Plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 32 to 72 which comprise the profit and loss account, the balance
sheets, the cash flow statement and the related notes which have been prepared under the historical cost convention as
modified by the revaluation of certain assets and the accounting policies set out on pages 36 to 39. We have also audited
the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’ remuneration
report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities. The directors are
also responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion,
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose
hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company and the Group have not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration
and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. The other information
comprises the Chairman's Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, the Financial Review, the outline of the Board, the
Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and the corporate governance statement.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company's compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code issued in June 1998, specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the board's statements on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
The maintenance and integrity of The Evolution Group Plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out
by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may
have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Company's and Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the auditable
part of the directors’ remuneration report are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December
2003 and of the profit and cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the applicable Accounting
Standards of the UK Accounting Standards Board and pronouncements of its Urgent Issues Task Force, under the historical
cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of trading positions at fair values. The movements in the fair value of trading
positions are included in the profit and loss account as described below. The Companies Act 1985 requires certain
movements in the fair value of trading positions to be taken to the revaluation reserve. In so far as the adopted treatment
of trading positions represents a departure from current statutory requirements, the directors consider this necessary for the
financial statements to show a true and fair view. The effects of this departure, which is consistent with industry practice,
have not been disclosed, since the company does not retain records on an historical cost basis, which would provide
reasonable quantification.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings made up to 31 December 2003. Interests in associated undertakings are presented in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 9, Associates and joint ventures. An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the
Group has control over its operating and financial policies.
In accordance with section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 Evolution Group Plc has taken advantage of the legal
dispensation not to present its own profit and loss account. The amount of the profit after taxation for the financial period
dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in note 12.
Operating income
In the opinion of the directors, disclosure of turnover is most appropriately represented for the Company by operating
income, comprising profits from trading activities including dividend income on such trading positions and related foreign
exchange movements, and fees and commissions receivable from corporate finance and asset management activities. Fees
and commissions are recognised in the profit and loss account when the related services are performed and when
considered recoverable. Operating income also includes interest receivable on segregated client money accounts.
This represents an adaptation of the profit and loss account format laid down in Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985
due to the special nature of the Company’s business. 
All operating income is generated in the United Kingdom and Ireland and is principally in sterling and is stated exclusive of
value added tax.
Trading positions
As noted above, proprietary trading and market making positions are stated at market value and profits and losses arising
from this valuation are taken to the profit and loss account.  
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values and are written down to
their estimated residual values over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements Over 5 years
Computers, software and similar equipment Over 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and fittings and other equipment Over 3 to 5 years Goodwill
Goodwill arises under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of cost
over fair value of the Group’s share of net assets acquired. In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10, goodwill is
capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life. The useful economic life of the goodwill is
determined at the time of the acquisition giving rise to it by considering the nature of the acquired business, the economic
environment in which it operates and the period of time over which the value of the business is expected to exceed the
value of the identifiable net assets. 
For acquisitions, goodwill is generally expected to have a maximum useful economic life of twenty years and is subject to
regular impairment reviews.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets and goodwill
Tangible fixed assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment review in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11
if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill may
not be fully recoverable. The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset or
goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of net realisable value and value in use. 
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is
recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments represent equity investments.  Listed and unlisted investments are stated at historical cost less
provision for impairment in value, and are held for long-term investment purposes.
The Companies Act 1985 requires investments where there is significant influence to be treated as associated undertakings
and to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The directors consider that in general the Group’s fixed asset investments do not come within the Companies Act 1985
definition of associated undertakings, since The Evolution Group Plc does not exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of investees.  
The directors consider that as these investments are held as part of the Group’s portfolio with a view to the ultimate
realisation of capital gains, equity accounting would not give a true and fair view of the Group’s interest in these
investments.  The treatment adopted is in accordance with the accounting for venture capital and investment trusts as set
out in Financial Reporting Standard 9, Associates and Joint Ventures.
The Company and Group do not have any other significant interests in fixed asset investments as at 31 December 2003.
Investment in associated undertaking
Following the disposal of shares in IP2IPO in October 2003 this company is treated as an associated undertaking in the
Company and carried at cost less impairment. In the Group accounts associates are equity accounted in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 9.

Report & Accounts 2003
Fixed asset investment impairment provisions
Provisions for fixed asset investments have been calculated in accordance with British Venture Capital Association (“BVCA”)
guidelines issued in August 2003. Early stage investments are valued at cost less any provision considered necessary due to
performance significantly below the expectation on which the investment was based. These provisions are made as a
percentage of cost in 25% bands. Later stage investments continue to be valued at cost less provision until a third party
valuation or earnings multiple basis becomes more applicable. Listed investments are valued at the bid price but may be
discounted further where the holding is significant in relation to the issued share capital.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In the Group’s financial statements, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for under the equity method. 
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Group’s share of this associated undertaking’s losses and the Group’s
share of net assets, excluding goodwill which is written off against reserves, of the associated undertaking is shown in the
consolidated balance sheet.
Own shares
Shares in the Company held by the Share Incentive Trust which are not allocated to specific employees are held as fixed
assets at cost less a provision for impairment in value if appropriate, in accordance with Abstract 13 issued by the Urgent
Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board.
Cash balances held with the Share Incentive Trust to purchase shares in the Company are held at the value advanced and
included within cash in the balance sheet.
For the years ending 31 December 2004 onwards, UITF Abstract 13 will be replaced by UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for
ESOP Trusts, and the amendments to UITF Abstract 17, Employee Share Schemes, will be adopted to reflect the change in
the value attributed to share awards. The consideration paid for own shares will be deducted in arriving at shareholders’
funds rather than being shown as the Company’s assets. These changes in accounting policy will result in a prior year
adjustment on the value attributed to share awards. 
Accounting for share options
Share options issued under employee share schemes by the Group are accounted for in accordance with UITF Abstract 17,
Employee Share Schemes. The intrinsic value of the options at the date an award is granted is charged to the profit and loss
account between the date of grant and the earlier of the options vesting date and the performance period to which the
award relates. The credit entry for the charge is taken to profit and loss reserves.
Pension commitments
The Group makes defined contributions to employees' approved personal pension plans, and the costs of these are
expensed when they are incurred.
Market and client balances
In accordance with market practice, unsettled bought and sold security transactions with clients, stock exchange member
firms and settlement offices are included gross in debtors and creditors respectively.
Operating leases
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all the benefits and risk of ownership remain with the lessor are
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term. Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at historical cost less a provision for any impairment in their value. Details
of the principal subsidiary undertakings are given in note 40.
Non credit risk provisions
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer
of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present
obligation where the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not
recognised, however, they are disclosed unless remote.
Client money
Money held on behalf of clients (other than that required to settle outstanding bargains) by the Group, in accordance with
the Client Money Rules of The Financial Services Authority, and the corresponding liabilities, are not shown on the face of
the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Foreign currency balances
Foreign currency balances in the balance sheet are translated at the prevailing closing rate with the resulting gain or loss
taken to the profit and loss account. Profit and loss transactions are translated at the actual or average rate.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is accounted for under Financial Reporting Standard 19, Deferred Tax (FRS 19). This standard addresses the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses
in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computations.
Deferred tax, provided at anticipated tax rates and on a non-discounted basis, is recognised in respect of all timing
differences, arising from transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay
less tax in the future, which have occurred at the balance sheet date. Assets are recognised on this basis only to the extent
that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will crystallise in the future.
Dilapidation provision
The Group accrues costs for dilapidations on its head office lease over the period of the property lease. The accrual is based
on expected costs to be incurred at the end of the lease period to bring the building back into a suitable state.

There is a potential deferred tax asset at 31 December 2003 of £12,170,000 (2002: £14,500,000), relating to timing
differences arising on capital allowances, provisions against investments and trading losses carried forward. This asset has
not been recognised in the accounts due to current uncertainties as to how the Group will utilise the reversal of the
underlying timing differences.
The deferred tax asset would be recovered if there were future taxable profits from which the reversal of the underlying
timing differences could be deducted.
There is no tax charge on the profit arising on the part disposal of shares in IP2IPO of £15,085,000 as this is an exempt
item under substantial shareholding relief as approved by the Inland Revenue.

holding from 75.24% to 54.04% following the issue of 11,450,000 shares by IP2IPO at a price of £2.75 per share in which the
Group did not participate, giving rise to a profit of £9,135,000, and the successful flotation of IP2IPO on AIM.

performance during the 12 months following the award, as measured within the Group company’s annual appraisal
process.  The level of subsequent awards is also directly related to the individual’s overall performance rating within the
company’s annual appraisal process. In conjunction with the outlined individual performance elements, the basic scheme
target is aggregate growth in earnings (based upon the adjusted operating profit) of Evolution Beeson Gregory Limited of
15% per annum over the vesting period of the award. Additionally, the satisfactory employment by the individual within a
Group company throughout the period following grant of an award is required.

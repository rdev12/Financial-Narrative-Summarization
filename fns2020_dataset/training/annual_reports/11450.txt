Employees
The Company encourages communication with its employees and favours an environment where staff can put forward their ideas, 
suggestions and concerns on any matter that involves them. The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment 
made by disabled people, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Where an employee becomes disabled in the course of 
their employment, where possible, arrangements will be made for appropriate retraining to match their abilities with their duties.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss risk areas. The Corporate Governance Report contains details of the 
Group’s system of internal control. Note 23 to the accounts contains details of financial risks faced by the Group.
The Board is also aware of non-financial risk areas including:
General economic conditions
The Group may be faced with changes in the general economic climate in each territory in which it operates that may adversely affect the 
financial performance of the Group. Factors which may contribute include the level of direct and indirect competition against the Group, 
industrial disruption, rate of growth of the Group’s sectors and interest rates. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by conducting operations 
on a broad geographic basis and by introducing new technologies to remain innovative.
Regulatory risk
The manufacturing, marketing and use of the Group’s products are subject to regulation by government and regulatory agencies in many 
countries. Of particular importance is the requirement to obtain and maintain approval for a product from the applicable regulatory agencies 
to enable the Group’s products to be marketed. Approvals can require clinical evaluation of data relating to safety, quality and efficacy of a 
product. The Group seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its operations within recognised quality assurance systems and undergoes 
external assessment to ensure compliance with these systems.
Acquisition risk
The success of the Group depends upon the ability of the Directors to assimilate and integrate the operations, personnel, technologies and 
products of acquired companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by selecting companies which meet certain selection criteria and by 
conducting a detailed due diligence review.
Donations
The Company made a charitable donation of £130 (2008: £nil) and no political donations (2008: £nil) during the year.
Auditors
The auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution for their reappointment will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on page 20. Having made enquiries  
of fellow Directors and of the Company’s auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:

The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises: one Non-executive Chairman; one Non-executive Director; and two Executive Directors, who are the  
Chief Executive and the Finance Director. David Evans, Non-executive Chairman and Michael Gurner, Non-executive Director are 
considered by the Board to be independent in character and judgement. Michael Gurner is the senior independent Non-executive Director. 
The Board meets at regular intervals and is responsible for setting corporate strategy, approving the annual budget, reviewing financial 
performance, agreeing the renewal of and any new banking/treasury facilities and approving major items of capital expenditure. The Board 
is provided with appropriate information in advance of Board meetings to enable it to discharge its duties effectively. During the financial 
year, the Board met on thirteen occasions. Michael Walker, who resigned as a Non-executive Director on 11 November 2008, attended 
seven out of eight meetings that he was entitled to attend. Andrew Shepherd attended twelve out of the thirteen meetings. The three 
remaining Directors were present at all the meetings held throughout the year.
The Chairman has additional Non-executive Directorships of the following companies:
Bgenuine Tech KK
DxS EBT Limited
Epistem Holdings Plc
Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings plc
Microtest Matrices Limited
Onyx Scientific Limited
Quotient Diagnostics Limited
Scancell Holdings plc
Vindon Scientific plc
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has met on three occasions during the year and once since the year-end. The Committee is comprised of David 
Evans, as Chairman, and Michael Gurner and has primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls, ensuring that the 
financial performance of the Company is properly measured and reported on, and for reviewing reports from the Company’s auditors 
relating to the Company’s accounting and internal controls, in all cases having due regard to the interests of shareholders. The Committee 
shall also review preliminary results announcements, summary financial statements, significant financial returns to regulators and any 
financial information contained in certain other documents, such as announcements of a price-sensitive nature.
The Committee shall consider and make recommendations to the Board, to be put to shareholders for approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s external auditors. The Committee shall also oversee 
the relationship with the external auditors including approval of remuneration levels, approval of terms of engagement and assessment 
of their independence and objectivity. In so doing, they will take into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and 
the relationship with the auditors as a whole, including the provision of any non-audit services. Ernst & Young LLP have been auditors 
to Omega Diagnostics Limited (‘ODL ’) since 2000 and were appointed as Auditors to the Company following completion of the reverse 
takeover of ODL in September 2006.
The Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and has considered the need for an internal 
audit function. At this stage of the Company’s size and development, the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not 
required, as the Company’s internal controls system in place is appropriate for its size. The Committee will review this position on an  
annual basis.
The Committee shall also review the Company’s arrangements for its employees raising concerns, in confidence, about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. The Committee shall ensure that such arrangements allow for independent investigation 
and follow-up action.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has met on one occasion during the year. The Committee is comprised of Michael Gurner, as Chairman, 
and David Evans and has primary responsibility for determining and agreeing with the Board the remuneration of the Company’s Chief 
Executive, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of the Executive management as it is designated  
to consider. The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board. 
No Director or manager shall be involved in any decisions regarding their own remuneration.

Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. Such a 
system can only provide reasonable assurance against misstatement or loss.
The Board monitors financial controls through the setting and approval of an annual budget and the regular review of monthly  
management accounts. Management accounts contain a number of indicators that are designed to reduce the possibility of  
misstatement in financial statements.
Where the management of operational risk requires outside advice, this is sought from expert consultants, and the Company receives this 
in the areas of employment law and health and safety management.
The Company is compliant with industry standard quality assurance measures and undergoes regular external audits to ensure that 
accreditation is maintained.
Communication with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communication with its shareholders. The Company maintains informative websites for Genesis, 
ODL and CNS containing information likely to be of interest to existing and new investors. In addition, the Company retains the services of 
financial PR consultants, providing an additional contact point for investors. The Board encourages shareholder participation at its Annual 
General Meeting, where shareholders can be updated on the Company’s activities and plans.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed the going concern concept for the preparation of financial statements. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, and have 
therefore adopted the going concern basis in the preparation of these financial statements.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial 
position of the Group and Company and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing 
those Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 	 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply 
them consistently;
•	 	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
•	 	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact  
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
•	 	 state that the Group and Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the financial position 
of the Group and Company and enable them to ensure that the Group and Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 27 Audit Report Annual Report and Accounts 2009
www.omegadiagnostics.com
We have audited the consolidated financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 
31 March 2009 and the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, the Consolidated 
and Company Statements of Changes in Equity and the related Notes 1 to 23. These financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ Report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Financial Review that is cross-referenced from the Results and dividends section of the Directors’ Report, and that specific 
information presented in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review that is cross-referenced from the Business review and future 
development section of the Directors’ Report, and that specific information that is presented in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that  
is cross-referenced from the Directors’ interests section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.  
The other information comprises only the Highlights of 2009, Our Strategy, Global Reach, Investing in Technology, Our Key Products, the 
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review, Board of Directors, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the Corporate Governance Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent 
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order  
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,  
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation  
of information in the financial statements.

1 AUTHORISATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC for the year ended 31 March 2009 were authorised for issue by the board of 
directors on 6 July 2009, and the balance sheets were signed on the board’s behalf by David Evans and Kieron Harbinson. Omega Diagnostics 
Group PLC is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the AIM Market.
2 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (‘IFRS’)
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial 
statements of the Group and Company for the year ended 31 March 2009 respectively.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial 
statements. These financial statements are presented in sterling.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Omega Diagnostics Group PLC and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries). 
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved 
through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group 
obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, 
including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. 
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The significant areas of estimation and uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial information are discussed below. Further judgements, assumptions and estimates are set 
out in the Group financial statements.
Valuation of intangible assets
Management judgement is required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets having reference to future economic benefits expected 
to be derived from use of the asset. Economic benefits are based on the fair values of estimated future cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The test considers future cash flow projections of cash generating units that give rise to the 
goodwill. Where the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recognised for the difference. 
Further analysis of the estimates and judgements are disclosed in Note 9.
Deferred tax assets
Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing 
and level of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of the 
deferred tax asset at 31 March 2009 is £107,530 (2008: £124,310). Further details are contained in Note 15.
Earn-out valuation
Management judgement is required to determine the financial liability to be recognised in respect of the earn-out. Management bases 
their estimation on the sales levels expected over the relevant period on historic data, current market conditions and the likelihood of future 
budgets being achieved. At 31 March 2009 the Genesis Earn-out has a carrying value of £131,580 (2008: £329,540). As the earn-out is 
based on 7% of sales of certain products, the earn-out amount may vary depending on the level of sales achieved.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Presentation currency and foreign currencies
The financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling. Transactions in currencies other than sterling are recorded at the prevailing 
rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included 
in the net profit or loss for the year.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes. Sales of 
goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. This will be when goods have 
been dispatched and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue relates to the sale of medical diagnostic kits.
Goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method. Any excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet 
as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for 
impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, usually at 
business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is  
less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition at fair value at the acquisition 
date, the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected 
useful lives, with charges included in administration costs, as follows:
Technology assets – 20 years
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value 
may not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation  
is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives, on a straight line basis 
as follows:
Leasehold improvements – 10 years, straight line with no residual value
Plant and machinery – 8-10 years, straight line with no residual value
Motor vehicles – 5 years, straight line with no residual value
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives are reviewed annually 
and where adjustments are required, these are made prospectively.
Impairment of assets
The Group and Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the Group and Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, and is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable 
amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their net present value, using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. Impairment losses on continuing 
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when it is reasonable to expect that the grants will be received and that all related conditions will be 
met, usually on submission of a valid claim for payment. Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred 
income account and are released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, except in the case of arrangement  
fees for long-term borrowings, where the fee is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is defined as standard cost or purchase price and includes all direct 
costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less 
any further costs expected to be incurred prior to completion and disposal. 
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the shorter 
of their lease period and useful life. The corresponding lease or hire purchase obligation is capitalised in the balance sheet as a liability. 
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all the benefits and risks remain with the lessor, are charged against profits  
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Research and development costs
Expenditure on research, which is incurred up to the point of manufacturing validation, is written off as incurred. Thereafter, expenditure  
on product development which meets certain criteria is capitalised and amortised over its useful life. The manufacturing validation stage  
is when it is probable that the product will generate future economic benefits, and the following criteria have been met: technical feasibility; 
intention and ability to sell the product; availability of resources to complete the development of the product; and the ability to measure 
the expenditure attributable to the product. The useful life of the intangible asset is determined on a product by product basis, taking 
into consideration a number of factors. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a 
subsequent period.
Exceptional items
The group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because 
of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit special presentation to allow shareholders to understand 
better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in 
financial performance.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity  
of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of any outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of original invoice amount and recoverable amount. A provision for doubtful 
amounts is made when there is objective evidence that collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Balances are written off when  
the probability of recovery is assessed as remote. Payment terms vary from payment in advance to 90 days.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
For equity-settled transactions, the group measures the award by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and it 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to 
the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any 
vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions). No expense is recognised 
for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting 
irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009
www.omegadiagnostics.com

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and of the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest or, in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above. 
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding 
entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost 
based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is recognised over 
the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value  
of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised 
if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in  
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation  
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
Pension contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contribution basis are charged to the income statement in the year  
in which they are payable.
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based  
on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
•	 wher e 	 t he 	 t emp or ar y 	 d if f er en ce 	 ari s es 	 fr om 	 t he 	 i n it ial 	 r ecogn it i on 	 o f 	 goo dwi l l 	 or 	 o f 	 an 	 ass e t 	 or 	 l iabi l ity 	 i n 	 a 	 t r an sa ct i on 	 t ha t 	 i s 	 n o t 	 a 	 b usi ness

reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; 
and
•	 de f err ed 	 i n come 	 t a x 	 ass e t s 	 ar e 	 r ecogn i s ed 	 on ly 	 t o 	 t he 	 e xt en t 	 t ha t 	 it 	 i s 	 p r ob able 	 t ha t 	 t a x able 	 p r o fit 	 wi l l 	 be 	 a v ai lable 	 a gai n s t 	 wh i ch 	 t he 	 ded uct i ble	
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity. Otherwise, income tax is 
recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets, liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, less any repayments. Accrued interest is presented as part  
of the loans and overdrafts balances.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing 
liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and recognition  
of the new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised.
Financial liabilities have been recognised at the present value of the consideration expected to be payable by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. At initial recognition, the quantum of liability to be recognised will depend upon management’s 
expectation, at that date, of the amount that would ultimately be payable. Where there is a change to the expectation of an amount of 
deferred financial liability, the change is reflected through the income statement. Any changes to contingent financial liabilities are reflected 
through goodwill. 39 Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009
www.omegadiagnostics.com
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, both in sterling and US dollars. The Group 
does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities 
measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. The fair value of interest rate contracts is determined by reference to market values for 
similar instruments that have similar maturities. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement included in finance costs, due to 
the fact that hedge accounting has not been applied. Under IAS 39, these derivatives are classified as financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
through profit and loss. 
Financial assets and liabilities that are held for trading and other assets and liabilities designated as such on inception are included in this 
category. Financial assets and liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short-term. Derivatives are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedge instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with 
gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Company’s investments in subsidiaries 
The company recognises its subsidiaries in investments at cost. The carrying value of investments is reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.

* The effective dates stated here are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be 
subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism. In the majority of cases this will result in 
an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group’s 
discretion to adopt standards early.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 3 (revised) will apply to business combinations arising from 1 January 2010. This will require recognition of subsequent changes in the 
fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill. In addition, transaction costs will be required to 
be recognised immediately in the income statement. Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Equity-settled share-based payments
Consolidated and Company
The share-based payment plans are described below. There have been no cancellations or modifications to any of the plans since their inception.
EMI Option Scheme and Unapproved Option Scheme:
The plans are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the grant date. Under the above plans, share options are granted to 
directors and employees of the company. The exercise price of the option is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. 
The options vest one year after the date of grant and are not subject to any performance criteria.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The contractual life of each option granted is ten years and there is no cash settlement alternative.
1,833,289 share options were granted on 10 December 2008. All of these are still outstanding, and none are exercisable, at the year end.  
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 15.84p with a remaining contractual life of 9.75 years at 31 March 2009.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year end 31 March 2009.
    2009 2008
Dividend yield    0% –
Expected volatility    84% –
Risk free interest rate    2% –
Expected life of option    10 years  –
Share price at date of grant    19p 
     
The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of the options’ life due to the lack of any historical data on the 
exercise period of these options. The assumption takes into account the experience of employees and directors and is not necessarily 
indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the option is indicative of future 
trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

8 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
On 3 September 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the voting shares of Genesis Diagnostics Ltd (‘Genesis’) and Cambridge Nutritional 
Sciences Ltd (‘CNS’), both unlisted companies based in Cambridgeshire, UK. Genesis is an established business in the medical 
diagnostics industry developing, producing and selling a range of test kits specialising in the areas of autoimmune disease, infectious 
disease and food intolerance. CNS provides a testing service for food intolerance and various other diseases.    
 
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the consolidated financial statements included the 
results of Genesis and CNS in the prior year for the seven-month period from the acquisition date. The fair values of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities of Genesis and CNS at the date of acquisition were:

     6,056,635
     
Cost of the acquisition     
The total acquisition cost of £6,056,635 comprised the following: a cash payment of £3,200,000; 4,461,220 shares in the Company with  
a fair value of £1,427,590 based on the market price at acquisition; loan notes totalling £1,100,000 discounted to a fair value of £959,539;  
an earn-out based on the future performance of certain products, estimated at £400,000 discounted to a present value of £329,540;  
a deferred cash payment of £61,634 payable 12 months after completion; and acquisition costs of £78,332. The earn-out accrues at 7% 
of sales of the relevant products over the three-year period from 1 November 2006 to 31 October 2009, and is payable in three annual 
instalments once relevant amounts are finally agreed.
Funding
To fund the cost of the acquisition, the Group raised £2,200,000 (before expenses of £455,889) via the placing of 7,333,333 new ordinary 
shares at a price of 30p per share. In addition, the Group borrowed £1.2 million under a senior term loan facility from its principal banker, 
repayable over five years. The loan carried interest at 2.5% over base rate for the first year and fell to 2% over base rate thereafter as the 
Group remained within agreed covenants. The vendors of Genesis and CNS were issued loan notes of £1,100,000 repayable in three  
equal instalments on anniversary dates in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Interest accrues at base rate and is payable with the final instalment.

Impairment testing of goodwill      
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill 
is indicated in the table above.     
The recoverable amount of Genesis-CNS has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based 
on the financial budget approved by the Board covering the period to 31 March 2010. The key assumption used for the budget is the 
revenue opportunity for existing products and in particular, the opportunity for microarray and macroarray-based products. The discount 
rate applied to cash flows is 14% reflecting the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the group. The WACC is the weighted 
average cost of pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity financing. Cash flows beyond the budget period are 
extrapolated over the next 4 years using a growth rate of 7% that equates to the current rate of growth seen globally in the IVD industry. 
Thereafter, a nil growth rate has been assumed for prudence. As a result, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill. 
Sensitivity analysis     
Base forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value. Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to assess the impact of any 
reasonably possible change in key assumptions. There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying value to exceed   
the recoverable amount. 
       
The adjustment relating to contingent consideration amounting to £133,297 results from a reassessment of the Genesis/CNS earn out.  
This is further analysed in Note 20. Other than for the adjustment above, there has been no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill. 47 Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009

19 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional administration costs
During the year to 31 March 2009, the Company was involved in the planned acquisition of another company which required the Company 
to raise new funds to complete the acquisition. The funding environment deteriorated throughout the process, due to the turmoil in 
worldwide financial markets and, in early November, the Company concluded that due to these challenging circumstances it was not 
possible to raise sufficient funds to complete the transaction. The Company incurred costs of £265,920 in connection with the aborted 
transaction but it was able to significantly reduce the impact of these costs to 30% of the total by obtaining indemnities from third parties 
for 70% of these costs. Among these third parties were Dr Mike Walker and David Evans who agreed to cover 30% and 10% of the costs 
respectively under an agreement entered into on 3 September 2008. As a result the financial impact of the aborted transaction to the 
Company has been limited to £80,301. Due to the one-off nature and value of these costs, they are separately disclosed and treated  
as an exceptional item in the income statement so that they do not impact on the results from normal trading operations.

22 EARNINGS PER SHARE  
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued 
on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Diluting events are excluded from the calculation when 
the average market price of ordinary shares is lower than the exercise price.

Earnings per share before exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and the expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to 
understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better 
trends in financial performance.
To this end, basic and diluted earnings per share are also presented on this basis using the weighted average number of ordinary shares, 
both basic and diluted.
Net profit before exceptional items attributable to equity holders of the Group is derived as follows:

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise loans, finance leases and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is 
to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The Group has other financial instruments, such as trade receivables and trade 
payables, which arise directly from its operations. The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign 
currency, credit, liquidity and interest rate. These risks are managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
Foreign currency risk
The Group buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of its operations. The Group has US dollar 
and euro denominated bank accounts. Where possible, the Group will offset currency exposure where purchases and sales can be made 
from these foreign currency bank accounts. The Group’s non-sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash flows can be affected by 
movements in exchange rates. It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind. As at 31 March 2009, the Group 
has not entered into any hedge transactions. Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (continued)
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in currency rates on the Group’s profit before tax through the impact 
of sterling weakening against the US dollar, the euro and the Canadian dollar.

Bank loans    5% (29,129)
An increase in currency rate of 5% would have a similar opposite effect. The sensitivity around bank loans above represents the entire 
impact on the Company’s profit before tax and equity.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The Group conducts its operations in many countries, so there is no 
concentration of risk in any one area. In most cases, the Group grants credit without security to its customers. Credit worthiness checks 
are undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers, and credit limits are set as appropriate. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event 
which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
Capital management
An explanation of the Group’s capital management process and objectives is set out in the Capital management section on page 18 of the 
Financial Review.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility of working capital arrangements through the use 
of bank loans. The Group also maintains its available financial assets to ensure continued liquidity.

Interest rate risk
All of the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates of interest. The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk on changes in US dollar and 
sterling interest rates. To manage the interest rate risk, the Group has taken out interest rate hedge instruments relative to the two bank 
loans listed below which will be repaid by September 2012. The change in fair value of these interest rate hedge instruments has been  
taken to the income statement in full. Financial Statements Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Fair values 
The carrying amount for all categories of financial assets and liabilities disclosed on the balance sheet and in the related notes to the 
accounts is equal to the fair value of such assets and liabilities as at both 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008. The monetary value 
attributable to these financial assets and liabilities is the same value that has been disclosed in the related notes to the accounts.
The valuation methods used to fair value the financial assets and liabilities have been disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial 
Statements under the heading of Financial instruments.
The carrying amount recorded in the balance sheet of each financial asset as at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008, including derivative 
financial instruments, represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.

Chairman’ s Message
Results
The results for the year show that
three key objectives were achieved:
sales recovered as our decision to
cease trade loading was vindicated;
costs were reduced in both the
product supply and Group overhead
areas increasing pre-exceptional
operating profit by 52 per cent to
£82 million; and significant free cash
flow was generated, enabling the
dividend to be maintained and fully
covered for the first time since the
merger with Scholl in 1 998.
Our sales in the year grew five per
cent to £624 million, our gross
margin grew to 58 per cent and our
operating margin, before exceptional
items, achieved our target of over 
1 3 per cent. Earnings per share 
were 1 3.1 pence compared 
to a loss of 7 pence last year .
Dividend
Y our Board is recommending 
an unchanged final dividend of 
8.4p, making a total for the year , 
also unchanged, of 12.3p. The final
dividend will be paid on 4 September
2003 to shareholders on the register
on 8 August 2003.
Strategic Development
During the year , the Board completed
a thorough review of the Group’ s
operations, its strengths and
weaknesses, and its opportunities 
for delivering shareholder value
growth in the future. On the basis 
of the review, we concluded that
shareholder’ s interests would best 
be served by focusing resources on
our Consumer healthcare businesses,
which includes the Durex and Scholl
brands, and by divesting our Medical
business, as well as our industrial
gloves business.

We have now completed our second full year

Scholl and our other Consumer healthcare brands. SSL International plc

Directors
In April, Andrew Slater , who became 
a Director in 1999 following the
merger with London International
Group, resigned from his position 
as Managing Director of the
European operations. Andrew 
had been with the Group for nearly
21 years and has held a number 
of senior operational roles in the 
UK and overseas; his contribution
and energy will be missed and we
wish him well in the future.
In May , Alain Strasser our Non-
Executive Director resident in France,
resigned from his non-executive post,
recognising that a recent increase 
in his other international activities
meant that he could no longer give
sufficient time to his duties at SSL.
Alain’ s experience and counsel was 
of great value to the Group and 
he goes with our best wishes 
for future success.
Outlook
The current year presents the twin
challenges of completing the major
disposals and driving forward the
profitability and growth of our
Consumer business. This will involve
both highly creative marketing and
selling and major cost reductions in
corporate overheads. The new year
has begun satisfactorily and we are
confident that these challenges will
be met successfully , in both the
current year and into the future.
Ian Martin, Chairman

Chairman’ s Message continued
The Medical portfolio includes 
Regent surgical gloves, Hibi antiseptic
and the wound management
business; collectively amounting 
to £1 82 million in sales in the year 
to 31 March 2003. This divestment
process is now well underway and
has generated a substantial level 
of interest.
Completion of these disposals will
give management the opportunity 
to focus on the Consumer business.
Here, there are encouraging signs
that the increased flow of new
products backed by strong
advertising is yielding results. 
Greater financial resources resulting
from the divestment will drive 
further development. This, coupled
with a continuing strong focus 
on cost control will, we believe, 
lead to significantly enhanced
shareholder value. SSL International plc

SSL International specialises in premium branded
healthcare products for consumer , community 
and hospital use. Products are distributed all over 
the world via SSL operations in 35 countries.
T urnover by business area
01 Consumer Healthcare — 60%
02 Medical — 29%
03 Marigold — 8%
04 Other — 3%
The transfer of Hibi production 
from AstraZeneca to SSL ’ s flagship
pharmaceutical factory at Peterlee 
is now complete.
Simplified Durex packaging worldwide 
has ensured instant consumer recognition
across the globe.
Customer service has been enhanced 
with a new user website for advice 
on glove performance in industrial
situations.
Medical Division
The Medical division includes 
Regent Biogel surgical gloves, 
Hibi, both global brands, and the 
UK wound management business. 
New product development for
surgical gloves has focused on the
growing synthetic market segment.
Healthcare workers now wear gloves
for prolonged periods and the risk 
for some users of allergic reaction 
to natural rubber latex has been
known for a number of years. SSL
launched Biogel Skinsense PI in
March of this year . This new glove 
is made from the synthetic material,
polyisoprene and addresses the risk
of an allergic reaction by providing 
a non-latex alternative to healthcare
workers with a known or suspected
allergy to natural rubber latex with
the same characteristics of strength
and sensitivity . 
Manufacture of Hibi was transferred
to the pharmaceutical facility at
Peterlee, England from AstraZeneca
during the course of the year . New
distinctive product packaging 
for Hibi has been launched and
marketing initiatives to exploit 
new markets have commenced.
Marigold Gloves
The Marigold brand includes 
two distinct glove types, Marigold
industrial gloves which offers a
comprehensive product range
suitable for all types of requirements,
and Marigold housegloves.
Consumer Healthcare
Durex and Scholl are the core 
global brands within the Consumer
healthcare division. Both brands
enjoy strong market positions 
and combined represent 48 per cent
of Group turnover in the year . New
product development and innovative
marketing have contributed to 
the development of these brands, 
which is covered in more detail in 
the Operating Review.
The OTC portfolio consists of a wide
range of UK products, including oral
analgesics (e.g. Syndol), headlice
treatment (e.g. Full Marks Mousse),
indigestion remedies (e.g. Remegel)
and cough and cold treatments 
(e.g. Meltus). In addition to this, 
the Sauber range of deodorants 
and hosiery and the Mister Baby 
range of baby products are sold
primarily in Italy .

The Asia Pacific division, led by 
Steve Eastwood, Managing Director ,
is primarily Consumer healthcare
focused across a wide geographical
area including the key markets 
of Japan, South East Asia, Hong 
Kong and Australasia. T urnover 
of the division represents 1 1 per cent 
of Group sales and continues to show
solid growth in the core Durex and
Scholl brands. 
Americas
The divisional head office for 
the Americas division is located 
in Atlanta, USA and is led by Stuart
Heap, Managing Director . The division
represents 18 per cent of Group sales
and is the Group’ s largest market 
for surgical gloves. In addition to 
the significant Medical business, 
the divisional team manages the
Durex brand across the region and
the Silipos polymer gel manufacturing
and commercial operations which 
are based in Niagara Falls, USA.
Europe
The European division represents 
71 per cent of Group sales and 
is geographically diverse having
operations in 22 countries. Other
than the UK, which is established
within medical markets, the division 
is predominantly focused on
Consumer healthcare. The
management of Europe has recently
been placed under the control of
Garry Watts, Group Finance Director
with a strategy to focus on brand
contribution to maximise profitable
growth of the core consumer brands.

Joint venture manufacturing 
In the European region, there are seven 
manufacturing facilities in the UK,
including the new pharmaceutical plant 
at Peterlee. These facilities manufacture 
a wide range of products from condoms
to Scholl Flight Socks. In addition, other
manufacturing facilities are in Spain, which
manufactures condoms and in Portugal,
which manufactures industrial gloves. 
The majority of latex based products, 
being condoms, surgical gloves and
industrial gloves are manufactured in 
this region at SSL ’ s own facilities and 
at others with joint venture partners.
The Silipos manufacturing facility is 
based in Niagara Falls and produces 
a gel which is used within a wide range 
of products including footcare and
prosthetic dressings.

Chief Executive’ s Review
A three-pronged marketing strategy
is aiming, first and foremost, 
to capture today’ s youth – 16 –24
year-olds – recruiting new customers
as soon as they become sexually
active. Condom users retain brand
loyalty as long as the product quality
is exceptional – which is the case with
Durex. Advertising has to appeal to
this group, even if it unsettles older
generations. Novel marketing ideas
plus innovation in the area of
‘pleasure-enhancing’ products 
will ensure the brand continues 
to evolve and attract consumers 
to use the brand.
The second strand of our approach 
is to explore ways in which Durex as 
a brand can be ‘stretched’ into other
related categories. For instance, our
previous disparate lubricants range 
is being repositioned as Durex ‘Play’.
Thirdly , we recognise the social
responsibility Durex bears as world
leader in condoms. We continue 
to develop an active social marketing
programme in developing countries,
helping to eradicate sexually
transmitted diseases, unwanted
pregnancies and AIDS. Besides 
the immediate support we can give
to such government or charity-
sponsored education and health
awareness initiatives, longer-term, 
it creates awareness of Durex in
developing marketplaces.
Scholl
For Scholl, there is a significant
opportunity to grow the business
from where we are today , by 
building on the brand’ s heritage 
rooted in Dr Scholl’ s expertise in 
care of the feet, to make the brand
relevant to today’ s consumer needs.
As we have made additional
investment in R&D, we have an 
increasingly healthy new product
development pipeline. We have a
number of recent successes with
innovations in the areas of new
plasters for corns and blisters, new
footcare implements, toiletries and
improvements to our Flight Socks
range. We will re-establish the clear
technological edge and passion for
foot care that initially drove Scholl 
to the reputation it enjoys today . 
As well as new products, we will 
also be working to simplify the
current, sometimes confusing 
range of products, so that the 
choice of the right Scholl product 
is clear and obvious.
Our Medical businesses have
strong brands and talented
people. However , we believe
that a choice is necessary and
that on balance the greater
expertise and potential in 
SSL ’ s case lies with the 
Consumer business.
The Scholl and Durex brands are
extremely well placed within the
Consumer healthcare markets in
which they compete. Relative to
some other consumer categories, 
the family planning and footcare
categories are quite small today 
and require specialist knowledge 
to be successful. SSL already has the
leading share of these categories
across our territories as a whole and
in most individual markets. We start
from a strong position and by being
focused believe we can deepen our
expertise further and deliver stronger
growth as a result. 
Durex
The condom category is fraught 
with taboos, embarrassment and
innuendo and yet it is ultimately 
a category that is dealing with
incredibly serious issues such as
avoiding unwanted pregnancies 
and helping to avoid the transmission
of some of the most serious diseases
affecting the world today .
Brian Buchan
Chief Executive
In March of this year , we announced our intention 
to sell the Medical businesses of SSL. This will allow us
to refocus the Group as a successful global consumer
business, a business which includes two of the best-
known brands in the world – Scholl and Durex.  SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003
07
We see markedly different
development of individual sub-
categories within our Scholl range 
in different geographic markets.
Insoles are very well developed 
in the UK, deodorants in Germany ,
shoes in Thailand. Capitalising upon
these differences and working 
to ensure that we bring all areas 
of the business up to best-in-class
levels provides us with plenty 
of scope for growth.
While job number one is to develop
our ‘crown jewels’, SSL has the
potential to extend its expertise 
in carefully chosen fields. Our OTC
portfolio will also be developed. 
We are exploring new opportunities
within categories in which we excel,
such as headlice treatment,
analgesics and indigestion remedies.
As circumstances allow, we will look
to acquisitions to help develop
market share and extend our range
into new markets. The sale of the
Medical division will free the people
and financial resources needed 
to pursue these opportunities 
more aggressively .
Looking beyond our brands, 
we have continued to achieve our
Group-wide targets in cost saving.
Our cost base has been reduced 
by £18 million over the course of 
the year . There will inevitably be
further significant reorganisation 
and restructuring ahead as a result 
of refocusing on the consumer
marketplace. This will give rise 
to some understandable anxiety
amongst our employees and 
our thanks go to them for all their
undiminished efforts during these
times. We are acting to provide
certainty where this can be done. 
For example, a new management
structure has already been 
announced and rationalisation 
is already underway in some 
other areas.
Our business systems – particularly 
IT – have continued to be streamlined
and enhanced. These systems will
ultimately form the basis of sustained
cash management improvement 
in areas such as inventory and 
trade receivables. We, together 
with PeopleSoft, have recently
brought online new software
modules in the UK business. This
change was needed to start the
process of moving from the large
range of legacy systems the Group
has inherited. Once fully bedded
down our plan over the next two
years is to roll-out these new systems
throughout our European markets.
We are well on the way to achieving
Group-wide world-class standards 
in environmental and quality
management in our manufacturing
processes. We now have 26 of our
sites with ISO 9001 registration and
12 with full ISO 14001 compliance.
T raining and development 
of employees continues at every 
level – creating multi-skilled, flexible
workforces in the factories and
creative, entrepreneurial
management in every geographical
area of our business. The sales 
and marketing initiatives around 
the world demonstrate that local
market knowledge and awareness 
of localised cultures is essential.
The growth achieved by many of 
our markets in Durex and Scholl over
the past year plus the undoubted
potential that remains to be exploited
explains our confidence in the future
as a dedicated global consumer
company . SSL is the world authority
on condoms and footcare, and 
we intend to exploit our skills and
heritage to the full.

Operating Review
Building on the popularity of 
the new ‘Easy-on’ range launched 
in 2002, three new products over
the past year were launched. Based
upon extensive consumer research,
the new product trio was developed
to ‘liven up safer sex’. Durex
‘Performa’ is a condom coated 
on the inside with benzocaine, 
a mild anaesthetic to prolong love-
making for ‘longer-lasting pleasure’;
Durex ‘Sensation’ has raised dots 
for greater stimulation, and Durex
‘Close Fit’ is a narrower condom
giving a firmer hold.
T argeting the youth market – 
16 – 24-year-olds – is a fundamental
element of the current marketing
strategy , recruiting new consumers
at the start of their sexual activity .
Another key element is ‘adding fun’
– enhancing pleasure and building
on the ‘play’ aspect of love-making.
More and more consumers are
moving into the enhanced pleasure
category , buying premium condoms
that offer far more than simple
barrier protection.
An increasing amount of investment
is being put into the new product
development pipeline, encouraging
innovation and creative flair to
differentiate Durex from any other
condom competitor . Among the
new products currently being
developed are a range of ‘Play’
lubricants designed to revolutionise
the lubricant category – plus a
scintillating range of chocolate-
flavoured condoms for added
sensory pleasure!
Durex Marketing and Promotion
Complementing innovative new
product development, the
marketing and promotional support
behind the Durex range is highly
creative, fun-filled and successful 
in building sales and market share. 
The ‘sperm character’ television 
and media advertising has won 
a wide variety of awards at UK 
and European level. Examples 
of localised marketing initiatives
include Hong Kong and T aiwan
organising celebrity-backed Durex
‘Fun Rides; ‘Sperm Men’ characters
making public appearances in New
Zealand, and Durex-branded ‘teen
wear’ merchandise for colleges 
and schools across the Americas.
Durex
Creative Flair
Durex is market leader in branded
condoms worldwide and we intend
to build on our expertise to ensure
Durex becomes the ‘number one’
condom in every possible market
around the globe.
The success of the ‘Perfect 
Product Portfolio’ programme,
which rationalised the global
product range in order to exploit
manufacturing synergies and ensure
brand recognition in every market,
has given us renewed flexibility with
which to develop new products.
Durex sperm characters make striking 
appearances at a huge variety of
promotional events around the world.
Innovation
Innovation is at the heart of every
aspect of our approach to business in
the 21st century – from new product
development to business systems and
market development.
— This willingness to challenge
attitudes and procedures has
helped to sharpen our business
efficiency.
— Innovation in new product
development has played 
a key role in developing 
market share.

Making an eye-catching appearance 
at a carnival in China, this condom 
character broadens the appeal to 
a younger generation.
Educating Everybody
Educating people about safe,
responsible sex and the dangers 
of AIDS and Sexually T ransmitted
Infections (STI’ s) is a responsibility
faced by Durex in a widespread
education programme. Global
programmes have been developed,
such as the Durex.com website 
and local initiatives such as the
‘askdurex.com’ website aimed 
at young people in America. In
China, where condom advertising 
is restricted, a new Chinese Durex
website is not only providing
important educational information
but is a key element of product
marketing in a fast-developing
marketplace.
Durex Social Marketing
As the world’ s leading condom-
maker , Durex accepts its need 
to play a key part in stopping
unwanted pregnancies and
eliminating sexual disease in
developing countries.The Group 
is actively involved in a wide variety
of social marketing programmes,
particularly an educational project 
in Brazil where it has helped local
boys develop their own brand of
condom. Long-term, such work will
help to raise the level of awareness
of Durex and its qualities in
developing marketplaces.
Durex Sex Survey
This year’ s Global Sex Survey – 
the seventh to date – was the most
successful ever , providing a wealth
of useful marketing information 
and a global platform for PR and
promotions. For the first time, 
the survey was carried out on-line,
achieving a record number of 
replies – almost 50,000 – from 
22 participating countries
worldwide. Some countries 
held cybercafe events in order to
encourage response. Carried out 
in tandem with the relaunch of 
the Durex.com website, this global
marketing initiative was a triumph
for all concerned. The new-look
Durex website is one of the largest
of its type in the world, now
featuring 49 localised country 
and language variants.

The key footcare categories 
of blister and corn have seen the
launch of next generation plaster
technology . The new ‘Hydra-gel’
plasters are transparent and 
discreet to wear , using ‘intelligent’
gel, which creates the ideal healing
environment for blisters and softens
skin to aid corn removal. Providing
superior cushioning protection,
Scholl Hydra-gel plasters offer
instant pain and pressure relief.
In addition, re-engineered foot 
files offer ergonomic improvements 
in a stylish design for both the 
new Scholl Callous File and the 
new Scholl Smoothing File.
Scholl Flight Socks
Scholl Flight Socks were a first-to-
market launch for SSL, developed 
in direct response to consumer
concern regarding the risks of 
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) 
on long haul flights and the 
need for preventative solutions.
Launched initially in the UK, where 
it enjoyed immediate success the
product has also enjoyed similar
success throughout its global roll-
out this year .
Building on the success of creating
its own category , the brand now 
has a new generation ‘cotton-feel’
Flight Sock, which was launched 
in March, featuring new innovative
fibre technology , giving improved
look and feel, with anti-microbial
action to keep feet fresh.
The brand is also being extended
with the launch of a new Knee
Highs range, which is specifically
positioned for the female consumer .
Available in black and natural, 
the new Knee Highs range
combines the appropriate level 
of compression with the design
features of female hosiery .
The Scholl Flight/T ravel compression
brand is being supported by SSL ’ s
active involvement in a programme
of research and clinical studies into
the cause, condition and prevention
of DVT . One of the most significant
studies so far , Lonflit 4, concluded
that Scholl Flight Socks reduce the
incidence of DVT and help control
oedema in low-medium risk
subjects on long haul flights.
Continued marketing and
promotion of the brand will 
ensure sales growth worldwide 
as more consumers realise the
benefits of the concept.
The ‘Gelactiv’ range of Scholl
footwear continues to win major
new listings in leading retail outlets
around the world. Australia has
enjoyed particular success recently
with a fashion promotion targeting
summer beachwear .
Scholl
Scholl Innovation
Scholl has an unrivalled heritage 
as the foot specialist. Now the
Group is building on the global
brand’ s pedigree in treating foot
problems to develop a new range 
of consumers loyal to the brand 
for everyday footcare – for health
and beauty .
Much of the existing Scholl 
foot skincare range has been
relaunched. Three new products
complement the portfolio and
capitalise on the latest consumer
trend for ‘express’ footcare for the
woman in a hurry . Scholl’ s launch 
of the ‘Express’ lines for feet meets
the growing trend for convenient,
‘multi-tasking’ solutions, as seen
with other skincare categories. 
The new Scholl Foot Smooth
Shower Scrub is designed for use 
as part of a daily shower regime,
backed by the new Scholl Express
Conditioning Foot Spray , a light
moisturising lotion to soften the 
skin on the feet. The new Scholl 
Deo Compact Spray is a handy-
sized spray deodorant to target
women ‘on the go.’
Scholl’ s range of health and beauty 
products for feet is creating new 
business opportunities for the brand.

a new version of the Ibuprofen
painkiller , specifically for children.
This marks the Group’ s entry into
one of the fastest growing OTC
sectors – children’ s Ibuprofen – 
with the aim of picking up 20 
per cent of the market sector . 
A 150ml size was launched in
January , boosting sales still further ,

SSL also has the number two brand
– Derbac – plus the Natruclear range
to maximise the wet-combing
technique for ongoing detection.
This means the Group can offer 
a complete headlice detection

of the Summer Fruit version in 
all major accounts, is the only
traditional indigestion product
growing in the market. Resolve 
won the Christmas battle to be 
the best-selling hangover cure 
for the second year running and 
is the fastest growing brand in the
stomach upset/hangover market.
Meltus cough syrup received 
heavy promotion in the UK grocery
trade, achieving over 1,500 new
distribution points in the country’ s
largest stores as a result. 
Woodward’ s Gripe Water continues

competitions and appearances 
by movie actors.
OTC
The OTC portfolio is being improved,
developing new products for
categories where SSL has specialist
expertise and taking advantage of
acquisitions to build critical mass 
and expand overseas markets.
Particular successes have been 
in categories where SSL excels –
headlice treatment, analgesics,
indigestion remedies and 
cough syrups.
In the painkiller category , SSL 
now has the two fastest growing
analgesic brands in the UK. One 
of the strongest OTC products on
the market is Paramol, which was
relaunched last April, changing
shape from tablet to capsule to
make it easier to swallow. Sales 
have continued to grow since.
Syndol is a significant brand, 
which is currently seeing success
following a second round of its
television advertising. A pilot
campaign in October saw 
a 20 per cent increase in sales. 
A five-week national television
campaign in March/April this
year exceeded all expectations, 
with sales in Boots peaking at 
400 per cent growth.
Nationwide television advertising in the 
UK for painkiller Syndol has seen sales
increase significantly .
SSL offers a comprehensive headlice 
treatment and prevention product portfolio.

Hibi
The integration of Hibi manufacturing
into Peterlee from AstraZeneca 
is now complete after a longer than
expected transition period, which
involved regulatory procedures 
to bring the product licences up-
to-date. A new range of distinctive
product packaging has been
launched, with the Group maximising
every opportunity to promote itself 
as the hand hygiene expert for the
health professional. New medical
marketing teams have been
established in many countries,
Initiatives have included sponsoring
the first-ever handwashing seminar 
in Hong Kong to promote Hibiscrub;
launching Hibi towelettes for 
the health professional working 
in a domestic environment, and
developing Hibiderm handcream 
for health workers.
A new Regent Antiseptics 
website has been developed 
for health professionals –
www.regentantispetics.com – 
to inform and educate 
a global audience.
Wound Management
Sales of Avance wound dressings 
and Lyofoam have performed very
well over the past year . Sales of
T ubifast – the bandage for wet-
wrapping to control atopic eczema –
have also performed well, thanks 
to new sizes of bandage and an
intensive marketing programme 
to develop a category that SSL has
made its own. 
An exciting new development for
the T ubifast range has been the
recent launch of T ubifast Garments –
a range of ready-to-wear clothing
for children, to enable parents to
avoid the hassle of trying to keep 
a child still for the time it takes to
wet-wrap using bandages. The
design concept was developed and
manufactured in-house at Oldham,
which has the capability to make an
adult range of garments if required.
Marigold
The Marigold brand comprises
housegloves sold through the
consumer distribution channels
alongside our consumer products
and also a comprehensive range 
of industrial gloves used for
protection of workers against
hazards such as heat and chemicals.
Regent Infection Control
Biogel Surgical Gloves
Sales of Biogel surgical gloves have
continued to develop the European
markets, helped by the recent
launch of three new products. The
innovations are set to consolidate
the Group’ s number one position 
in the global surgical glove
marketplace and have been
developed in direct response 
to market demand.
Biogel Skinsense PI., made 
from the latest synthetic material
polyisoprene, is said to be ‘the
nearest there is to natural rubber
latex’, ideal for those with a known
or suspected allergy to natural
rubber latex.
Biogel Optifit ‘Super Sensitive’ 
has a straight cuff for a tighter 
fit, developed in response to 
cuff slippage and roll down 
from increased use of synthetic
surgical gowns.
The third product is for the UK
market, a straight-fingered Biogel
Indicator Underglove, which is
preferred in the UK to the curved
finger format of the USA and
Continental Europe.
Award-winning website consultancies 
are utilised to develop flagship product

Commercial Expansion
Our commercial offices continue 
to develop and exploit new
opportunities. SSL New Zealand 
has celebrated its first birthday ,
growing business for Durex, Scholl,
OTC and Medical. A new SSL
business has opened in T aiwan,
building on the success of the Hong
Kong subsidiary to exploit growing
consumer demand. SSL Poland has
doubled in size, with new teams 
of sales and marketing personnel
replacing the old structure of
commission agents, and SSL France
has seen great success from a
business reorganisation and
development of new channels 
to meet demand. 
Customer Service
The UK and Global customer 
service improvement programmes
have continued apace, with notable
successes including reducing 
stock holding to just-in-time
requirements; reducing lead times
and improving efficiencies from
rationalising the distribution
networks and haulage systems.
Environmental Responsibility
All sites within the Group are 
now operating to consistent 
world-class standards on quality 
and environmental issues. Our 
latest annual Environmental Report
gives detailed accounts of some 
of the successes over the past 
12 months, with local sites taking
ownership of their own
requirements and achievements 
to ensure international standards
are maintained. Our global
approach has simplified systems 
and procedures and avoids
duplication of effort.
Manufacturing
The Group is committed to
maintaining the highest possible
standards of quality and
environmental responsibility at 
all its manufacturing sites, and to
sourcing its manufacturing in order
to achieve maximum productivity
and efficiency .
An on-going manufacturing review
ensures the best possible sources 
of manufacturing are maintained,
providing the flexibility necessary 
to both maintain high standards 
of customer service and support
new product development.
Recent changes to achieve these
ends have included the closure 
of part of the Avanti condom
manufacturing process at
Cambridge in England, transferring
production to SSL ’ s joint venture
condom manufacturer in India,
which has just celebrated a 50 year
partnership with the Group. Some
manufacturing rationalisation 
was also undertaken at Oldham 
in England, and production of the
indigestion remedy Remegel is to be
transferred from the Bootle factory –
which is closing – to SSL ’ s state-of-
the-art pharmaceutical factory in
Peterlee, which opened last year .
Flexible manufacturing facilities 
maintain efficiency and high 
standards of customer service.

Annual Report 2003

The Scholl footwear business
enjoyed a successful spring/summer
2003 season with second half
footwear sales growing at 
5.1 per cent over the previous year
and at 3.1 per cent for the year as 
a whole. The footwear category 
is a complicated business that is
beginning to benefit from improved
focus in range selection and
rationalisation of the supply chain.
The market offers a significant
opportunity for expansion if these
initiatives can be maintained in
future seasons.
The other Consumer businesses
declined overall by 2.4 per cent to
£80.9 million. Gains of 2.8 per cent
in the UK OTC business to £40.2
million and of six per cent in the
Scholl medical compression business
to £11 million were outweighed 
by declines elsewhere, notably 
in Italy where the combination 
of strong competition and a weak
pharmacy market, particularly in the
second half, caused erosion of our
Sauber and Mister Baby ranges.
Financial Review
Overall Results
SSL ’ s results for the year ended 
31 March 2003 are laid out 
on page 36. Sales of £623.9 million
were achieved during the year
(2002: £592.4 million), generating 
a pre-exceptional operating profit 
of £82.0 million (2002: £54.1 million). 
The operating margin before
exceptional items was 1 3. 1 per cent
of sales, compared to 9.1 per cent
last year . Profit before tax was £39. 1
million, a £42 million improvement
against last year and earnings per
share was 1 3. 1 pence against a loss
of 7.0 pence last year . Free cash flow
of £39 million (2002: £7 million)
was generated and net debt at the
year end was £292 million (2002:
£308 million). 
Sales
SSL ’ s sales for the year amounted 
to £623.9 million, five per cent 
ahead of last year’ s reported total. 
After adjusting for the effects of
disposals, currency fluctuations 
and customer inventory loading,
underlying sales are estimated 
to be at the same level as last year .
Gains in the Consumer division
were offset by a decline in our Hibi,
Marigold and other businesses; 
our surgeons’ gloves and wound
management businesses were 
flat overall.
Within the Consumer division,
overall sales grew by three per cent 
on an underlying basis. Family
planning sales totalled £143.8
million, 6.4 per cent ahead of 
last year mainly as the result 
of successful new product
introductions under our Durex
brand in European markets. 
We have programmes in place to
leverage further the strength and
appeal of the Durex brand to the
younger age group, so as to support
growth in the future.
Scholl footcare sales, grew by 
2.7 per cent as successful new
product introductions, improved
marketing and the development 
of emerging markets outweighed
declines in our two principal
markets, the UK and Italy . 
Our continuing programme 
of category reinvigoration and 
new product development is 
aimed at accelerating the growth
rate across the Group.

The Group’ s Consumer business
continues to enjoy favourable
market dynamics in its principal
operating territories of UK, Italy ,
France and, for Durex, the USA.
Both Durex and Scholl compete 
in markets that are growing over
all and in which in almost all cases, 
SSL is maintaining or growing 
its market share. It is the Group’ s
intention to continue to invest 
in new product development,
innovative advertising and
marketing support programmes 
all aimed at delivering both top 
line growth and improved brand
contribution.
Sales in the Medical division
amounted to £182 million
compared with £174 million 
last year , although the growth 
of 4.6 per cent is the result of 
the net effect of adjustments 
to the comparative number for
currency , disposals and customer
loading. Underlying medical sales
declined by an estimated 1.5 per
cent, primarily due to the lower 
Hibi sales resulting from the licence
transfer delays experienced in 
the first part of the year . We expect
Hibi sales to recover from this low
level as we are once again able to
bid for contracts now that licence
approvals have been gained.
Surgeons’ glove sales in the 
US were flat on an underlying 
basis in the year as in-market sales
growth of some six per cent (arising
from volume gains of 11 per cent
offset by price decline of five per
cent) was absorbed by wholesaler
and distributor inventory reductions
driven by healthcare cost
containment measures. The
underlying switch from powdered
gloves continues to support our
future growth expectations, as does
the successful introduction of our
latest generation of ‘latex free’
gloves. This segment continues 
to expand at a rapid rate. Biogel 
has an estimated 60 per cent 
(by value) share of the powder 
free latex market and a 36 per cent 
(by value) share of the synthetic
market. Gradual price erosion
continues in both sectors but with
the synthetic sector maintaining an
approximate 30 per cent premium
to powder-free surgical gloves.
Elsewhere in the world, surgical
glove sales grew by 3.2 per cent as
the result of growth in Continental
European countries and a stable
market in the UK.
The other Medical businesses
comprising wound management
and Silipos, achieved sales of 
£57.8 million comfortably ahead 
of last year’ s number but
representing a decline of 2.5 per
cent on an underlying basis after
adjustment for customer inventory
loading. The wound management
business continues to generate
good profitability and cash flows
from an extensive range of staple
products supplied to UK and
European hospitals, and the Silipos
business has benefited this year
from a significant contract with
beauty retail outlets in the US.
Gross Margin
The Group’ s gross margin improved
in the year by a pleasing 2.7
percentage points to 57.9 per cent.
The improvement arose partly as 
the result of the increased sales in
the year , which the Group estimates
generates a marginal gross return 
of approximately 80 per cent and
partly as the result of stringent 
cost control measures within the
supply chain. We estimate that
approximately £9 million savings
have been generated in this area 
in the year .
Market Development
Expenditure
Group market development 
expenditure of £70.4 million has
been maintained at last year’ s
increased levels in pursuance of the
Group’ s stated policy of growing
brand equity values, particularly 
in Durex and Scholl. The great
majority of the expense is in-market
and aimed at directly influencing
consumer offtake. As the success 
of this approach becomes
established, it is the Group’ s
intention to continue to invest 
in this area.
Brand Contribution
The Group is developing brand
contribution as a key performance
measure. This is defined as gross
margin less advertising and
promotion and variable selling 
costs and is intended as a proxy
measure of brand equity value,
which is a principal component 
of the corporate value of SSL. 
Brand contribution in the year was
£250.6 million, 16 per cent ahead
of last year and the Group aims 
to continue growth ahead of the
rate of sales growth in the future.
Approximately 40 per cent of brand
contribution was generated by the
medical business and 60 per cent 
by the remainder .
Research and Development
Expenditure
Over the last two years the Group
has shown a strong commitment 
to developing new products and
bringing them to market. In the 
past year , we have introduced new
products across our major brands,
including the Performa condom,
Hydra-gel corn and blister plasters
and polyisoprene surgical gloves.
R&D expenditure for the year 
was £13.0 million, compared 
to £11.6 million in 2002.
Financial Review continued SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003

Operating Profit
Operating profit before exceptional
items amounted to £82.0 million
compared with £54.1 million last
year , an increase of 52 per cent
arising from a combination of
increased sales and cost reductions.
The operating margin was 13.1 per
cent compared with 9.1 per cent
last year .
Exceptional costs amounted 
to £20 million, comprising the 
£18 million restructuring charge
announced at the beginning of 
the year and £2 million closure 
costs associated with the transfer 
of part of Avanti manufacturing 
to India from Cambridge. As
anticipated this expenditure has
enabled us to eliminate £1 8 million
from our on-going cost base. 
As the Group continues with its
efficiency programme and adjusts
its operations to reflect the sale of
the Medical businesses, it is likely
that further exceptional costs will 
be incurred in the current year .
Profit before finance charges 
was £61.6 million compared 
with £22.7 million last year .
Financing Costs 
The net interest charge incurred 
in the year was £22.5 million 
(2002: £25.6 million), which 
is covered 3.6 times by operating
profit before exceptional items
(2002: 2.1 times) and 2.75 
times after exceptional items 
(2002: 0.9 times). 
Taxation
The tax charge of £17.9 million 
before exceptional items represents
a rate of 30 per cent, consistent
with the previous financial year .
Exceptional costs generated a 
tax credit of £3.6 million (2002: 
a charge of £1.6 million).
Earnings and Dividends
Profit after tax was £24.8 million
compared with a loss of £13.2
million last year which generated
earnings per share of 13.1 pence
(2002: loss of 7 pence). The
dividends proposed for the year 
are at the same level as last year , 
a 3.9 pence interim and 8.4 pence
final, which are covered 1. 1 times 
by earnings.
Profit before exceptional items
amounted to £41.6 million and
generated earning of 22 pence
(2002: 10.4 pence) which cover 
the dividend 1.8 times.
Cash Flow and 
Investing Activities 
During the year , the Group
generated an increased free cash
flow i.e. before payment of dividend
of £39 million compared with 
£7 million in its previous period.
Operating cash flow, being the 
net of earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation
and working capital movements
amounted to £104.2 million (2002:
£119.7 million); capital expenditure
was £18.2 million (2002: £39.8
million), the cash element of
exceptional items was £16.4 million
(2002: £28.1 million) and interest
and tax payments amounted to
£30.5 million (2002: £44.7 million).
Net working capital at 31 March
2003 was £129.9 million, compared
with £127.9 million previously , it is
made up of receivables £185.5
million, (2002: £181.2 million) plus
inventories £106.9 million (2002:
£110.7 million) less payables 
£162.5 million (2002: £164 million)
and overall represents 20.8 per cent 
of sales, an improvement over last
year (21.6 per cent) but still behind
the Group’ s stated target of 15 per
cent. Continued efforts to reduce
further the receivables days
outstanding, 108 days versus 
1 12 days last year , are being 
made in pursuit of the target.
Cash flow, after dividend payments
of £23 million, was applied to reduce
net indebtedness at 31 March 2003
to £292 million from £308 million at
the previous year end.
Selling, General and
Administration (SG&A) Costs
SG&A costs for the Group
amounted to £159.6 million
compared with £152.1 million last
year and represented 25.6 per cent
of sales. Included in these costs 
are Group IT and insurance costs
amounting to £16.2 million in 
the year , £5.5 million or 51 per cent
ahead of last year . Other SG&A
costs grew by around one per cent,
which, when compared with an
underlying salary inflation of four
per cent across the Group as a
whole, demonstrates an underlying
cost saving of some £4 million in 
the year in this category . The Group
will continue to focus on efficiency
improvements in the future,
particularly following the planned
disposal of the Medical businesses.
Following disposal we estimate 
that approximately £10 million 
of SG&A costs included in the 
£52 million currently allocated 
to these businesses will not 
transfer as part of the disposal.

Interest Rate Exposure
The aim of the Board-approved
policy relating to interest rate risk
management is to reduce the
impact of interest rate fluctuations
on the Group’ s net interest expense
to acceptable levels. This is achieved
through balancing the ratio of fixed
or hedged debt to those financial
liabilities with floating interest rates.
Board-approved instruments
available to hedge this exposure
include interest rate swaps, interest
rate options and forward rate
agreements. Details of the interest
rate analysis are given in note 31.
Liquidity Risk
The primary objective of the Group
T reasury policy is to ensure that 
the Group is able at all times to
meet its financial commitments as
and when they fall due. T o facilitate 
this, the Group T reasury department 
is responsible for the management 
of cash and liquid resources for 
the whole of the Group, and
ensures that the Group has
sufficient headroom in its undrawn
facilities to meet any reasonable
change in funding requirements. 
As detailed in note 31, the Group’ s
central undrawn committed
facilities at 31 March 2003
amounted to £34.2 million. 
Garry Watts, Finance Director
4 June 2003
Financial Condition
Profits retained, after dividend,
amounted to £1.5 million, a 
£38. 1 million improvement on the
previous year . Shareholders’ funds 
at 31 March 2003 were £92 million
compared with £88 million at 
31 March 2002. 
Half-year Performance
Sales in the second half of the year
were £315 million compared with
£311 million for the comparative
period. Operating profit before
exceptional items was £51 million
compared with £41 million. Sales
and operating profit for the first half
of the year were £309 million and
£31 million respectively .
Litigation
In common with most suppliers 
of latex medical gloves, the Group 
is engaged in litigation in the USA 
in relation to allegations regarding
the development of sensitivity to
natural rubber latex. The Board has
confidence in both the high quality
of SSL ’ s surgical gloves and the
Group’ s defences available against
allegations. In recent months, 
a number of cases have been 
settled for nominal amounts, 
and there have been no new 
case filings recently .
The Group is also defendant in a
number of other lawsuits incidental
to its operations, and is involved in
investigations by certain regulatory
authorities. In aggregate, these are
not expected to have a material
adverse financial effect on the
Group. Further details are given 
in note 28.
Capital Structure and 
T reasury Policy
Financial Reporting Standard 13
FRS 13 requires that certain
disclosures relating to financial
instruments are given in the
financial statements, in order to
provide information on the impact
of such instruments on the Group’ s
risk profile, how this may affect the
Group’ s performance and financial
position and how those risks are
being managed. The impact of
financial instruments is considered 
in detail in note 31.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The nature of the Group’ s trading
activities generates transactional
foreign exchange risks. These arise
from the sourcing of raw materials
from different countries, the
location of Group production
facilities throughout the world and
the sale and distribution of finished
goods in many locations. The
Group’ s foreign exchange policy
requires that all trading related
exposures should be centralised 
in accordance with prescribed
procedures and timetables under
the direction of the Group T reasury
function, which hedges the major
exposures using forward contracts
and options, usually for a period 
of 12 months. SSL International plc

Corporate Governance
Combined Code
Listed companies are required to
disclose how they have applied the
principles of Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, which
is appended to the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority (the
Combined Code) and whether they
have complied with the Combined
Code’ s provisions during the year. 
The Group has complied with the
Combined Code, with exception of 
the provisions relating to Directors’
service contracts. This report, together
with the Remuneration Report on pages
29 to 34 explain how the Group has
complied with the Combined Code.
The Board
The Board consists of three Executive
Directors, the Non-Executive Chairman
and four other Non-Executive Directors
1
,
all of whom are considered independent
of management and free from any
business or other relationship which
could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their independent
judgement. Following Rod Sellers’
resignation on 16 July 2002, 
Tim Howden became the Senior
Independent Director. Biographical
details for all current Directors and 
the Company Secretary are given 
on pages 24 and 25. There is a clear
division of responsibility between 
the Chairman, who leads the Board 
and the Chief Executive, who is
responsible for running the business.
Board meetings are scheduled for 
every other month and there is a 
formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its’ approval, which include setting
strategy, annual and interim results,
annual budget and treasury policy,
major acquisitions, disposals, capital
expenditure and the monitoring of
operational and financial performance.
The Board has adopted a Code of
Practice which governs the calling 
of meetings, pre-circulation of papers,
review of Committee membership 
and terms of reference. 
The mix of skills and experience of the
Board ensures that matters are properly
debated and that no one Director or
group dominates the Board’ s decision-
making process. Non-Executive
Directors are appointed for a specified
term. All Directors are subject to re-
election at the first AGM following 
their appointment and at least every
three years thereafter. 
The Company Secretary ensures that
Board procedures are followed and 
all Directors have access to his advice
and services. The Company will also
arrange for appropriate training and
induction for new Directors. From 
time to time updates are provided
covering developments on company
law, corporate governance and other
key areas.
A procedure exists for Directors to take
independent professional advice at the
Company’ s expense in the furtherance
of their duties.
Board Committees
The Board has established four principal
committees. T erms of reference for 
each committee have been agreed 
by the Board. The composition and 
role of each committee is as follows:
The Audit Committee is chaired by 
Eric Anstee and comprises all the Non-
Executive Directors
1
. The Company
Secretary is Committee Secretary. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director, Head of Internal Audit and
other senior members of the finance
function are also invited to attend,
although the Committee meets external
auditors at least once a year without
executives present. This Committee
ensures that financial information
supplied to shareholders provides a
balanced assessment of the Group’ s
position, and it reviews the system of
internal control and the effectiveness 
of the external and internal audit
process. T o perform its’ function, the
Committee receives regular reports 
from both internal and external auditors. 
The Remuneration Committee
comprises all the Non-Executive
Directors
1
and is chaired by Tim Howden.
It is responsible for determining
contractual terms and remuneration 
for the Executive Directors and certain
senior executives. The Group Human
Resources Director attended as
Secretary throughout the year. 
The Chief Executive and Company
Secretary attended by invitation. 
The Company Secretary is now
Committee Secretary.
The Remuneration Report on pages 29
to 34 provides full details on the Group’ s
policy on executive remuneration 
and Directors’ packages. Throughout
the financial year, the Group complied
with the provisions on the design 
of performance-related remuneration 
as set out in Schedule A of the
Combined Code.
The Nomination Committee comprises
the Chief Executive and all the Non-
Executive Directors
1
. The Committee
advises on Board appointments as
necessary and is chaired by Ian Martin.
The Risk Management Committee
(RMC) is chaired by the Director of
Group Treasury with the Head of
Internal Audit attending as Secretary. 
It comprises the Executive Directors 
and selected Group and Divisional
management. The Committee considers
strategic risks to which the Group may
be exposed and proposes appropriate
mitigation strategies to management. 
In addition it receives reports from 
the Head of Internal Audit on the
effectiveness of the risk management 
of process at Divisional level. The 
Audit Committee receives a report on
the operational effectiveness of the
RMC and the Chairman of the Audit
Committee has a standing invitation 
to attend meetings.
In addition to the above, the Leadership
T eam, which comprises the Executive
Directors and certain other senior
executives meets on a regular basis and
deals with day-to-day management 
of the Group including the review 
of monthly financial reports compared
to budget and taking any action 
where necessary.
The number of scheduled Board
meetings attended by each Director
during the year was as follows:

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the
maintenance of internal controls and
reviewing its effectiveness. This includes
financial, operational and compliance
controls, together with risk management.
The controls are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives and can
only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The Board has
established a process for internal control
which was in place throughout the
financial year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts. SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003
27
The Board reviews the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control at least
annually, and is confident that it
complies fully with the internal control
guidance for Directors in the Combined
Code. Key elements of the review include:
— Reviewing the updated Group and
Divisional risk matrices from the
RMC assisted by an ongoing review
of internal controls by the Internal
Audit function in line with the audit
plan agreed by the Audit Committee
and Group Finance Director;
— Ensuring Group policies and
procedures are in place for 
all areas considered at risk;
— Requiring a ‘Letter of Assurance’
from all statutory business units
within the Group, stating
compliance with Group policies,
identification of business risks 
and internal control confirmation;
— Consideration of reports from
internal and external audit on the
system of internal and material
control weaknesses;
— Ensuring each business unit
completes an updated Control Risk
Self Assessment, which are centrally
collated and reviewed; and
— Assessing the year end reporting
process throughout the Group
including visits to selected locations
by the Internal Audit function 
to assist in year end close and 
issue resolution.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
There is Board level responsibility for
CSR matters. A CSR working group 
has been established and reports 
to the Leadership T eam.
Environment: A separate environment
report is being sent to shareholders and
is available on the corporate website.
Health and safety: The Group is
committed to ensuring employees
operate in a health and safety conscious
environment. The Group Health and
Safety department works closely with
management, staff and others.
Ethical: A revised ethics policy was issued
in October 2001 and requires staff to
behave ethically to all stakeholders.
Examples of further progress in the
Group’ s relationships with stakeholders
are given in the Operating Review.
Going Concern
Having made appropriate enquiries, 
the Board is satisfied that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue 
in business for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, the going concern basis
continues to be appropriate in preparing
the financial statements.
Shareholder Relations
The Board recognises the importance 
of open communications with
institutional and private shareholders.
Institutional shareholders, fund
managers and analysts are briefed 
at presentations and regular meetings
with Executive Directors. In addition, 
the Board responds continually to 
ad-hoc requests for information from 
all shareholders. The AGM provides 
an opportunity for shareholders to 
raise questions with the Chairman 
and the Board.
The main source of information 
for the private investor is the Annual
Report and Accounts. Further investor
information, including copies of
previous Annual Reports and Accounts,
press releases, analyst presentations,
share price performance, financial
results and answers to frequently asked
questions are available on the Group’ s
website www.ssl-international.com

Employees and Employment Policies
The Group’ s employment policies 
reflect its’ belief in recruiting and
developing high calibre employees.
Diversity in the work place is valued 
and the Group strongly believes 
in equality of opportunity for all
employees. This ensures that people
with disability are offered the same
opportunities for employment, training
and career progression as others
employees. The Group would make
every effort to continue to employ 
staff who may become disabled while
employed, providing appropriate
training and adapting facilities to allow
them to continue working wherever
possible. The Group has continued 
its programme of tailor-made courses 
with INSEAD in Paris and Manchester
Business School in the UK.
Policies introduced during the previous
financial year such as ‘Freetalk’, a 
Group-wide communications channel
have encouraged a higher level of
employee involvement. 
Profit-related bonus schemes were in
operation during the year for certain
employees and further offers were
made to eligible employees under 
the Save As You Earn Share Option 
and Global Sharesave Schemes.
Creditor Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any specific
external code or standard on payment
practice. Payments to suppliers are
made in accordance with agreed terms.
The Company itself had no trade
creditors at 31 March 2003.
Charitable and Political Donations
The Group made charitable donations
of £0.1 million (2002: £0.1million). 
No political donations were made

willingness to remain in office as auditor
of the Company and a resolution
proposing its re-appointment will be put
to shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. After proper consideration,
the Audit Committee is satisfied that
KPMG Plc continues to be objective 
and independent of the Group.
By order of the Board.

Remuneration Report
Remuneration Report
This report sets out the Company’ s
remuneration policy and practice for
Executive and Non-Executive Directors
for the year ended 31 March 2003, 
as determined by the Remuneration
Committee under power delegated 
to it by the Board.
It is now a requirement of the Companies
Act 1985 that certain parts of this report
are audited. For the sake of clarity those
sections that have been audited are
marked as ‘audited information’.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the
‘Committee’) determines remuneration
policies and practice with the aims of
securing the talent that the Company
needs to meet its business aims and
encouraging superior performance. 
The Committee determines the
individual remuneration packages 
of the ‘Leadership T eam’ (comprising 
of the Executive Directors and certain
other senior executives).
The Committee also has oversight 
of the operation of all the Company’ s
share and share option plans.
The Committee’ s overall objective when
carrying out its duties is to balance the
interests of shareholders, the Company
and its employees.
The Committee comprises all the Non-
Executive Directors of the Company
namely:
— Tim Howden – Committee Chairman
— Eric Anstee 
— Bernd Beetz
— Ian Martin
— Dr Peter Read 
Alain Strasser was a member of the
Committee until he resigned from the
Board on 16 May 2003. Rod Sellers 
was also a Committee member until 
his resignation on 16 July 2002. Robert
Dwyer, Group HR Director, served 
as Committee Secretary throughout 
the year. Brian Buchan (Group Chief
Executive) and Jonathan Jowett
(Company Secretary) attended 
by invitation. Jonathan Jowett is 
now Committee Secretary and 
has also assumed responsibility 
for corporate HR.
During the year the Committee received
advice from the following external
remuneration consultants:
— Mercer Human Resource Consulting
(‘Mercer’) – provided advice on
actuarial matters and pay and
pension provision for the Leadership
T eam; and
— Ernst & Young LLP – provided 
advice on the Group’ s employee
share schemes.
No other services were provided 
to the Company by external advisers 
to the Committee.
Executive Directors 
Remuneration Policy
Remuneration policy is designed to
ensure that remuneration packages 
are competitive but not excessive 
by reference to the relevant market. 
The Committee reviews levels of
compensation against externally-
sourced data from independent
consultants. In the case of UK Directors,
the Committee refers to data provided
by Mercer and comparisons are made
against the ‘IDS Directors Pay Report’
published from time to time. Steve
Eastwood’ s compensation is provided 
in Aus $ and is considered against 
the Australian market place for senior
executives, taking into account his 
Asia Pacific responsibilities. 
In order to motivate executives to achieve
superior performance, the Committee
believes that a significant proportion 
of remuneration should be linked to
individual and Company performance. 
It is the Remuneration Committee’ s
intention to review remuneration policy
during 2003 to ensure all elements 
align with the revised business strategy
following the planned disposal of the
Group’ s Medical business.
Pending the outcome of this review, 
the intention of the Remuneration
Committee for the year to 31 March
2004 is to grant options to certain 
key employees below Leadership T eam
level in June. No options or L TIP interests
will be granted to members of the
Leadership T eam until the policy review
is complete and the Remuneration
Committee has formulated a new 
long-term incentive policy for that group.
Remuneration Constituents
Basic Salary: Basic salaries are
determined annually by reference 
to externally-sourced data, targeting 
a median to upper quartile market 
salary position. 
Annual Bonus Plan: The Committee
agrees annual bonus plan targets for 
the Leadership T eam. These targets 
have historically been based on the
Company’ s budgeted performance 
for the year , specifically the Company’ s
earnings per share performance, organic
sales growth and working capital. 
For the year to 31 March 2004, bonus
plan targets will be based upon a
combination of Company, divisional (for
those Executive Directors with divisional
responsibility) and personal targets.
The maximum bonus payment for 
the Chief Executive is 60 per cent 
of basic salary; for other Executive
Directors the maximum is 50 per cent 
of basic salary, which would be paid
upon achieving 105 per cent of targets.
For achieving targets a bonus of 35 
per cent of basic salary would be 
paid to the Chief Executive with 
the Executive Directors receiving 
30 per cent of basic salary. Pro rata
amounts would be paid for achieving 
a level of performance between the
maximum and minimum targets.
In the event of a change of control, 
the Remuneration Committee retains
absolute discretion as to what, if any,
bonuses are paid.
Long-T erm Incentives: Historically, 
the Company has made annual awards 
of both share options (through the
Executive Share Option Schemes) and
performance shares (through deferred
bonus share matching within the Long-
T erm Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)) in order 
to link rewards with real improvements
in longer-term financial performance 
of the Company. These awards were
also intended to encourage Executive
Directors to hold a significant amount 
of their remuneration in shares.
No changes have been made to the
performance conditions of existing
grants or awards under the schemes.
The Company’ s historical long-term
incentive arrangements are as follows:
LTIP: The Leadership T eam and certain
other senior executives have been
eligible to participate in the LTIP . Under
the LTIP , participants can elect to invest
up to 50 per cent of their annual cash
bonus into Company shares (‘deferred
bonus shares’), and a conditional
matching award of Company shares
(‘performance shares’) is made by 
the Company.
The deferred bonus shares are held 
in trust for a period of three years, 
after which they vest, provided that 
the individual remains in employment 
with the Company. During this deferral
period the participant retains the voting
rights associated with the deferred
bonus shares and the trustees pay over
to the participant any dividends paid 
on those shares. Deferred bonus shares
are at risk should the individual leave 
the Company during the deferral 
period at the discretion of the trustees.
In practice deferred bonus shares are
normally released to ‘good leavers’,
while participants who leave the
Company other than for ‘good leaver’
reasons usually forfeit their deferred
bonus shares. Performance shares 
are normally forfeited in all cases.
The Committee determine the matching
level for the award of performance
shares on an annual basis; their most
recent policy has been to match
deferrals on a one-to-one basis. The
performance shares vest at the end of
the three-year deferral period, subject 
to the satisfaction of a performance
condition. Performance shares awarded
in 2000 will not vest as the criteria have
not been achieved. For the 2002 award,
performance shares vest if the increase
in the earnings per share of SSL exceed
inflation plus two per cent per annum
over the three-year deferral period.
Executive Share Option Schemes:
Grants of options over shares with a
face value on the date of grant equal 
to one times basic salary were made 
to Executive Directors and other senior
executives during 2002 (‘standard
options’). Following the amendment 
of the rules of the unapproved Executive
Share Option Scheme at the 2002 AGM, 
to incentivise the Executive Directors
additional grants of options over shares
with a face value equal to one times
salary were made and a lesser level 
to certain members of the Leadership
T eam (‘additional options’).
T o receive an issue of standard options, 
in subsequent years, the participant 
will be expected to retain 30 per cent 
of shares acquired on exercise.
The Executive’ s ability to exercise
standard options is subject to the
Company meeting a performance
target (see below), with additional
options subject to more stringent
performance conditions.
Performance conditions were as follows
for awards made during 2002:
For standard options, the option may
only be exercised if over a period of
three years commencing on 1 April
2002, the percentage growth in
normalised earnings per share of 
the Company exceeds the percentage
growth in the retail price index by 
at least an average of two per cent per
annum in respect of options granted 
in July 2002, and three per cent per
annum for options granted in
November 2002. These conditions 
may be waived by the Directors in
exceptional circumstances if the
participant ceases to be in employment.
If conditions have not been met in 
full after three years there will be no
retesting and the options will lapse. SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003
30 Remuneration Report continued
For additional options, the option 
is subject to performance conditions 
that must be satisfied over initially a
three-year period although this period
may be extended up to five years. 
The performance conditions are 
in two parts:
— The percentage growth in
normalised earnings per share 
of the Company exceeds the
percentage growth in the retail 
price index by at least an average 
of three per cent per annum; and
— The Company’ s T otal Shareholder
Return shall, when ranked against
the T otal Shareholder Return of
constituent companies of the
FTSE250 have reached at least 
the sixth decile and thereafter 
as shown in the table above.
Limited re-testing is allowed for a
further two years (after the initial three
years) to allow the Executive to benefit
from driving up shareholder value. 
The re-testing is levered and Executives 
will need to perform exceptionally 
well in years four or five to increase the
percentage vesting. The options will
lapse unless exercised within seven years.
On a change of financial control of the
Company, the performance conditions
attached to standard options fall away
and the options vest in full. For additional
options, the treatment depends on the
timing of the change of control relative
to the award of the options. If the
change of control happens within 18
months of the award of the additional
options those options will not vest. 
If the change of control happens more
than 18 months after the date of award
then the vesting of additional options 
is based on performance up to the date 
of the change of control against the
performance conditions attached to 
the option, with the proportion vesting
calculated on a pro rata basis.
On termination, the vesting of 
long-term incentive interests is at 
the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee. Normal practice is as
follows: unvested share options 
will lapse on the day that the Director
ceases to be employed by the Company. 
‘Good leavers’ will be entitled to
exercise mature options for a period 
of 12 months from date of leaving. 
Other Benefits
The Company provides competitive 
non-cash benefits to Executive Directors.
These include use of a company car 
or payment of a car allowance, medical
insurance, life assurance premiums and
Permanent Health Insurance.
The Executive Directors are also eligible
to take part in the Company’ s all
employee share plans, specifically 
the Company’ s UK Sharesave Scheme,
US Stock Purchase Plan (if a Director
worked in the USA) and Global 
Share Savings Plan in the case of 
Steve Eastwood.

Pension
The Company operates a contracted-in
defined contribution scheme (the ‘SSL
UK Pension Scheme’) for UK employees.
For Executive Directors, Company policy
is to contribute 25 per cent of basic
salary (which is subject to income tax
and Inland Revenue limits) and the
individual pays five per cent of basic
salary. The Company investigated
introducing Funded Unapproved
Retirement Benefits Schemes (‘FURBS’)
but none of the Executives sought 
to implement such schemes. Instead 
they receive a cash payment in lieu 
of contribution, to the FURBS.
Brian Buchan’ s pension arrangements
were finalised during the year . Backdated
contributions were made on his behalf
to the SSL UK Pension Scheme and 
a cash payment was made in lieu of
contributions to the FURBS.
Garry Watts received a payment to 
a personal pension plan and a cash
payment in lieu of contributions 
to the FURBS.
Andrew Slater, who resigned as a
Director on 30 April 2003, in addition 
to being a member of the SSL UK
Pension Scheme, is a member of the
London International Group UK Pension
Scheme, a defined benefit scheme. 
In February 2001, this scheme was
closed to new entrants and the accrual
of future years’ benefits was linked 
to future salary growth based on
pensionable service to the date of
closure. Andrew retains preserved
benefits in this scheme.
Steve Eastwood’ s pension contributions
are paid into a personal Superannuation
Scheme in Australia.
Service Contracts
It is intended that future appointments
to the Board will generally be terminable
on one year’ s notice, other than where 
a longer term may be required.
The Executive Directors are subject 
to notice periods as described below. SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003
31
If the employment of Brian Buchan 
or Garry Watts is terminated following 
a change of financial control, or if as a
result of such change their status and
duties materially diminish, each will 
be, entitled to receive the equivalent 
of 1.5 times the value of: basic salary,
bonus based on the average paid over
the preceding three years, pension
benefits and any other benefits in kind.
If the employment of an Executive
Director is terminated by the Company
for any other reason, the Committee’ s
current policy is to calculate a termination
payment based upon an annualised
entitlement. Levels of mitigation 
would be determined by reference 
to the individual circumstances of the
Executive Director. Appropriate external
advice would also be obtained. 
Andrew Slater resigned as a Director 
on 30 April 2003 and left the Company
on 31 May 2003. He had a contract 
of service with a two-year notice period.
A settlement agreement is currently
being negotiated, but it is estimated
that Andrew can receive a payment 
up to a maximum of £811,800, which 
is equivalent to 24 months’ salary and
benefits under his service agreement.
£50,000 of this payment is being paid 
as consideration for Andrew entering
into restrictive covenants. Of the
remainder, 50 per cent is payable 
to Andrew on leaving the Company
although part of this payment would 
be paid into the Company’ s pension
scheme to secure additional benefits 
for Andrew. Under the proposed
settlement agreement, Andrew 
has a duty to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, entitlement to any further
payment from the Company is only
payable after the first anniversary 
of his departure from the Company 
and any remuneration he receives 
from subsequent employment will 
be set-off against it.

Directors’ Responsibilities
Independent Auditors’ report 
to the Members of SSL International plc
Directors are required by UK Company
law to prepare financial statements,
which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs at the end of the financial
year and of the result for the year. The
financial statements must be prepared
in compliance with the Companies Act
1985 and in accordance with applicable
accounting standards.
The Directors are satisfied that the
Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence in 
the foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial
statements. Suitable accounting
policies, consistently applied and
supported by reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates, have been
used in their preparation.
It is the Directors’ responsibility to
maintain proper accounting records
which disclose with reasonable accuracy
the financial position of the Company
and which enable them to ensure that
the financial statements comply with
We have audited the financial
statements of SSL International plc
which comprise the profit and loss
account, the balance sheet, the cash
flow statement and the statement of
total recognised gains and losses and, 
notes 1 to 32. We have also audited 
the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’ s
members, as a body, in accordance with
section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the company’ s
members those matters we are required
to state to them in an auditor’ s report
and for no other purpose. T o the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the
company’ s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of
Directors and Auditors
The Directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report. As
described in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities, this includes
responsibility for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards. Our
responsibilities, as independent
auditors, are established in the United
Kingdom by statute, the Auditing
Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and by our
profession’ s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ Report is not
consistent with the financial statements,
if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law or the
Listing Rules regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions with the
Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance statement reflects the
Company’ s compliance with the seven
provisions of the Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing
Rules, and we report if it does not. 
We are not required to consider
whether the Board’ s statements on
internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’ s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read the other information
contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements. This
other information comprises only the
Directors’ Report, the Chairman’ s
Statement, the Operating and Financial
Review, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the
Corporate Governance statement. 
We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do 
not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance
with Auditing Standards issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial
statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in
the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to
the Group’ s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited are
free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
— the financial statements give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group 
as at 31 March 2003 and of the
profit of the Group for the year 
then ended; and
— the financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the 
Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies are
summarised below. They have all been
applied consistently throughout the
current and preceding year.
(a) Preparation of financial
statements
The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost
convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts include the
accounts of the Company and its
subsidiary undertakings made up 
to 31 March 2003. Unless otherwise
stated, the acquisition method of
accounting has been adopted. Under
this method, the results of subsidiary
undertakings acquired or disposed of in
the year are included in the consolidated
profit and loss account from the date of
acquisition or up to the date of disposal. 
An associate is an undertaking in which
the Group has a long-term interest,
usually from 20 per cent to 50 per cent
of the equity voting rights, and over
which it exerts significant influence. 
The Group’ s share of results of its
associates is included in the consolidated
profit and loss account and its interest 
in their net assets is included in
investments in the consolidated 
balance sheet
In accordance with Section 230(4) 
of the Companies Act 1985 the
Company has elected not to present
its own profit and loss account. 
The profit for the financial year dealt
with in the financial statements of the
parent company, SSL International plc, 
is disclosed in the reconciliation of
movement in shareholders’ funds.
(c) Acquisitions and disposals
Goodwill arising on the acquisition 
of subsidiary undertakings and
businesses, representing any excess 
of the fair value of the consideration
given over the fair value of the
identifiable assets and liabilities
acquired, is capitalised as an intangible
asset and written off to the profit and
loss account on a straight line basis 
over its useful economic life, up to 
a maximum of 20 years. The useful
economic life is determined for 
each separate acquisition giving
consideration to the period over 
which the Group expects to derive
economic benefit from the asset. On 
the subsequent disposal or termination 
of a business acquired since 1 March
1998, the profit or loss on disposal 
or termination is calculated after
charging/(crediting) the unamortised
amount of any related goodwill
(negative goodwill).
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior 
to 1 March 1998 was written off to 
the profit and loss reserve in accordance
with the accounting standard then 
in force. As permitted by FRS 10, the
goodwill previously written off to
reserves has not been reinstated in 
the balance sheet. On disposal or
closure of a previously acquired
business, the attributable amount 
of goodwill previously written off 
to reserves is included in determining
the profit or loss on disposal. 
When the Group has acquired shares 
in other companies by the issue of
shares, and the requirements of Section
131 of the Companies Act 1985 have
been satisfied, the Group has utilised 
the merger relief provisions available 
and the issue of shares has been
recorded at the nominal value, 
any premium being credited to the
merger reserve.
(d) Intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired and
which can be separately identified and
valued are capitalised and amortised
over their estimated useful economic
lives, usually between 10 – 20 years. 
In determining the useful economic life
each asset is reviewed separately and
consideration given to the period over
which the Group expects to derive
economic benefit from the asset.
Acquired trade marks and patents
include the ownership of the Scholl
trade name throughout the world, 
with the exception of the Americas. 
The Scholl trade name is held at cost 
and is subject to an annual impairment
review to identify any diminution in 
the recoverable amount of the acquired
rights. The Directors believe that the
Scholl brand does not have a finite
economic life because of its proven
value over long periods and its position
in the market is sustainable for the
foreseeable future.
Intangible assets that are acquired 
and which cannot be measured
independently of goodwill and brands
are included and accounted for as 
part of goodwill.
(e) T angible fixed assets
No fixed assets have been revalued.
Depreciation is provided to write
tangible fixed assets down to a residual
value over their estimated useful
economic lives at the following 
annual rates:
— Freehold land: no depreciation 
is charged on freehold land;
— Freehold and long leasehold
buildings: two per cent of cost 
or over the life of the lease if 
less than 50 years;
Provision is made at rates expected 
to be applicable when the liabilities 
or assets are likely to crystallise.
(k) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are
recorded using the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction
unless sale proceeds are the subject 
of a forward sale for a predetermined
sum in sterling. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated using the rate
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Gains or losses on transactions are
included in the profit and loss account
to the extent that they are not matched
by binding forward trading contracts.
Profit and loss accounts of foreign
operations are translated into sterling 
at the average rate applicable to the
respective accounting period.
Assets and liabilities of foreign
operations are translated using the rate
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Gains or losses on translations 
of foreign operations and on foreign
currency borrowings, to the extent they
hedge the Group’ s investment in such
operations, are included as a movement
on reserves.
(l) Leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are
charged to the profit and loss account
on a straight line basis over the term 
of the lease.
A finance lease is a lease that transfers
substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Assets acquired under hire purchase
contracts and finance leases are
capitalised and included in tangible
fixed assets. The capital element of
future lease obligations is recorded 
as a liability. Amounts payable are
apportioned between the finance
element, which is charged to the profit
and loss account as interest on a
reducing balance basis, and the capital
element, which reduces the outstanding
obligation for future instalments.
(m) Pension costs
The Group continues to operate both
defined benefit and defined contribution
pension plans. UK defined benefit
schemes are closed to new entrants.
For defined contribution schemes, 
costs are charged to the profit and 
loss account as incurred.
— Motor vehicles: 25 per cent of cost or
net book value according to the type
of vehicle concerned;
— Plant and equipment: seven per cent
to 25 per cent of cost or net book
value according to the circumstances
of the assets concerned; and 
— Assets under the course of
construction: no depreciation 
is charged on assets under the
course of construction.
(f) Associated undertakings
All companies where the Group 
has significant influence, normally
evidenced by both Board representation
and ownership of at least 20 to 50 per
cent of the voting rights on a long-term
basis, are treated as associated
undertakings.
The Group’ s share of the results of
associated undertakings is included 
in the profit and loss account, and the
Group’ s share of net assets is shown 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
(g) Investments
Unlisted investments are stated at 
cost less provisions for any impairment
in value.
(h) Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost
and net realisable value using the FIFO
method. For work in progress and
finished goods, cost is taken as
production cost which includes an
appropriate proportion of overheads.
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research and
development is written off against
profits in the period in which it is
incurred, except for the development
expenditure on new or substantially
improved products which is capitalised
only when future recoverability is
reasonably assured. Provision is made
for any impairment in value.
(j) T axation
The charge for taxation is based on 
the profit for the period and takes 
into account taxation deferred because
of timing differences between the
treatment of certain items for taxation
and accounting purposes.
Credit is taken for advance corporation
tax written off in previous years when 
it is recovered against corporation 
tax liabilities. 
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred 
tax is provided where a taxation liability
will arise as a result of transactions or
events which have occurred by the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets
are recognised to the extent that it is
regarded that they will be recovered. SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003
41 Notes to the 
Financial Statements continued
For defined benefit schemes, the cost 
of providing pensions and other post-
retirement benefits is charged to the
profit and loss account on a systematic
and rational basis over the period 
during which benefit is derived from
employees’ service. The difference
between the charges to the profit 
and loss account and the actual
contributions paid is included as an
asset or liability in the balance sheet.
Note 32 also contains additional
disclosures as required by FRS 17
‘Retirement Benefits’.
(n) Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced value
of goods and services provided during
the year net of trade discounts, value
added and sales taxes. Sales returns 
are recognised as a reduction to
turnover as they arise. Credit note
reserves are provided at the year end 
to account for management estimates
of customer returns.
(o) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial
instruments to reduce exposure to
foreign exchange risk and interest rate
movements. The Group does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments
for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange 
contract to be treated as a hedge the
instrument must be related to actual
foreign currency assets or liabilities or to
a probable commitment. It must involve
the same currency or similar currencies
as the hedged item and must also
reduce the risk of foreign currency
exchange movements on the Group’ s
operations. Gains and losses arising 
on these contracts are deferred and
recognised in the profit and loss
account, or as adjustments to the
carrying amount of fixed assets, 
only when the hedged transaction 
has itself been reflected in the Group’ s
financial statements.
For an interest rate swap to be treated
as a hedge the instrument must be
related to actual assets or liabilities 
or a probable commitment and must
change the nature of the interest rate 
by changing the basis of calculation 
e.g. from fixed to floating rate. Interest
differentials under these swaps are
recognised by adjusting net interest
payable over the periods of the
contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted
for as a hedge, for example because 
the underlying hedged position is
eliminated, the instrument is marked 
to market and any resulting profit or 
loss recognised at that time.
(p) Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of
employee share schemes. The cost 
to the company of making awards in 
the form of shares or rights to shares
under these schemes is charged to the
profit and loss account over the period
to which the employee’ s performance
relates. No charge is taken to the profit
and loss account in respect of awards
made under SAYE schemes under 
the exemptions of UITF 17 ‘Employee 
Share Schemes’.
2. Consolidated Profit and Loss,
Exceptional Items, Discontinued
Operations
Exceptional items
The £20.4 million pre-tax exceptional
charge for the year includes business
processes review and associated
consultancy costs of £7.2 million, net
manufacturing costs of £1.5 million, and
professional fees and other charges of
£3.3 million, including costs relating to
proposed disposals of part of the Group.
The exceptional charge also includes
£8.4 million of merger, restructuring
and redundancy costs, net of profit 
on disposal of fixed assets. 
The prior year exceptional charge
related to restructuring costs (£16.4
million) elimination of trade loading
(£11.9 million) and a write off of an
intangible fixed asset (£8.6 million). 
Profit on disposals of £4.9 million
partially offset these costs.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations in the prior
year ended 31 March 2002 related 
to the Group’ s continence care business.
The profit on disposal of the business
was disclosed as exceptional. See 
note 23(b). SSL International plc

An adjusted earnings/(loss) per share figure has been shown in order to achieve comparability year on year. The calculation uses the basic weighted average number of shares
together with basic earnings /(loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of amortisation of goodwill and intangibles.
The profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated as follows:

28. Contingent Liabilities
Provision has been made in the 
Group financial statements for 
the environmental clean up costs 
in the USA based on the Director’ s 
best estimates of such costs according 
to information currently available. 
It is not possible to estimate with
certainty the extent of any further
liability that may arise.
Litigation
The Group, along with most other
suppliers of medical gloves, is involved
in a number of lawsuits in the USA
alleging the development of sensitivities
to natural rubber latex. The Directors
have confidence in the high-quality
gloves produced by the Group and
believe it has defences available. 
In conjunction with its insurers, SSL
concluded a preliminary settlement 
of the majority of cases involving 
Regent Biogel surgical gloves. This
settlement is not expected to have 
a negative impact on the profit and 
loss account.
The Group believes that a substantial
amount of any defence costs and
potential liability will be covered 
by insurance. Some insurers have,
however, reserved their rights (i.e.
neither admitted nor denied coverage),
and the Group is currently asserting 
its allocation of lawsuits to policy years
in order that insurers can remove such
reservation. Plaintiffs have also alleged
successor liability in respect of claims
against Aladan Corporation for product
manufactured prior to the acquisition 
of a substantial portion of its assets 
by the Group in May 1996. The Group
purchased insurance coverage for a
three-year period to cover such risk,
which expired on 10 May 1999.
At the annual renewal of LIG’ s product
liability insurance cover in 1999, the
insurance market had withdrawn 
cover for first injury/first exposure 
latex allergy claims occurring after 
May 1999. However, the Group had
subsequently negotiated an option 
to take insurance for claims in the 
USA alleging sensitivities and reactions
caused by wearing latex-glove products
manufactured by the Group. The
Directors remain confident of product
quality, and the option was allowed 
to lapse in 2002.
A provision exists as at 31 March 2003 
in respect of the amount of the potential
self-insured element of existing and
continuing claims. The Directors believe
the provision is adequate. However,
depending on the outcome of the
uncertainties described above, the
Group may incur costs in excess of 
the amount provided.
The Group is a defendant in an action
brought by Allegiance Healthcare
Corporation in the USA alleging 
false advertising and unfair business
practices in connection with the sale 
of Regent surgical gloves. The Group
has successfully defended its position 
at trial. Allegiance has appealed the
decision which was vigorously opposed
by the Group. The Appeal Court’ s
decision is expected in Summer 2003.
The legal defence cost funding
arrangement agreed with the 
Group’ s insurers remains in place.
In March 2003 the Group’ s US subsidiary
was named along with other leading 
US condom suppliers in a lawsuit in the
United States which alleges loss suffered
by a class of persons arising out of 
the purchase of spermicidally-treated
condoms. The claim is one of loss 
of bargain, not personal injury, and
results from findings by the WHO 
that the ingredient Nonoxynol-9 may, 
in some instances, increase the risk of
HIV/AIDS. The Company has adopted
increased warnings on packaging, and 
is vigorously opposing the lawsuit.
The Group is also a defendant in a
number of other lawsuits incidental 
to its operations which, in the aggregate,
are not expected to have a material
adverse financial affect on the Group.
In June 2001 it was reported that 
sales and pre-exceptional profits for 
the 25 months ending 31 March 2000 
had been overstated by £22 million 
and £19 million respectively. As a
consequence, a report was sent to 
the Serious Fraud Office, which is 
now conducting its own investigation
into the facts which gave rise to 
the overstatements.
The Group has been assisting the
competition authority in the UK 
with investigations into aspects of the
Group’ s condom pricing strategy. An
investigation initiated in May 2002 by
the Office of Fair Trading into condom
supply to the NHS has been successfully
resolved and the OFT has confirmed 
that it will not be taking the matter
further. The OFT continues to enquire
into the Group’ s UK pricing strategy. 
The Directors believe that the Group’ s
pricing policies comply with the
appropriate legislation. In addition,
while the risk of an adverse finding
cannot be totally excluded, this is
unlikely to lead to a material impact 
on the Group.

Elements of fixed rate debt maturing in less than one year are treated as floating rate debt for interest rate risk purposes. The above table takes account of the effect 
of interest rate swaps on the currency and interest rate nature of the Group’ s exposure. The interest rates on floating rate financial liabilities in material currencies are based 
upon LIBOR.
(b) Currency exposures
The table below shows the Group’ s transactional currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant local operating company 
involved, other than the non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net assets in overseas operations.

32. Pension Costs 
The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans both in the UK and overseas. All UK defined benefit schemes are closed 
to new entrants.
SSAP24 Disclosures
UK pensions
(a) Defined contribution schemes
Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees. It also operates defined contribution executive pension 
plans for senior executives. Employer contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was £1.7 million (2002: £1.9 million).
(b) Defined benefit schemes
The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, 
and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999. All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants and for future service accrual, although a link to final salary
remains. The finances of all schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. The schemes
have provided benefits for employees as outlined below:
(i) Seton
Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees. Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased in August 1995, but existing
benefits at that date are being maintained. The most recent valuation was made by independent actuaries at 28 February 2000. The assumptions which have the most 
significant effect on the results of the valuation are as follows:
— Return on investments per annum 8%
— Salary increases per annum 6%
— Pension increases per annum 3.75%
The actuarial value of the scheme’ s assets were £11.0 million. The valuation showed that the scheme’ s assets were sufficient to cover 100.3 per cent of the benefits that had
accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. There was no pension charge for the year for this scheme (2002: nil) and there is no pension
prepayment or provision in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2003 (2002: £nil). SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003

32. Pension Costs continued
(ii) Scholl
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in August 2000, but benefits accrued to 31 August 2000 continue to be provided from 
the scheme. The most recent valuation by independent actuaries was at 5 April 2000. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation 
are as follows:
— Return on investments per annum 5.30%
— Salary increases per annum 5%
— Pension increases — pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 — closed section 3%
— open section 2.25%
— pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 — closed section 3.25%
— open section 2.75%
The market value of the scheme’ s assets was £25.8 million. The valuation showed that the scheme’ s assets were sufficient to cover 105 per cent of the benefits that had 
accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The surplus is being reduced by a reduction in employer pension contributions. The total 
credit to the Group in respect of this scheme was £0.1 million (2002: £0.1 million). An amount of £1.1 million (2002: £1.1 million) is included in prepayments.
(iii) LIG
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001 continue to be provided 
from the scheme. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 1 April 2000. The actuarial assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the 
valuation are as follows:
— Return on investments per annum (pre-retirement) 6.75%
— Return on investments per annum (post-retirement) 5.25%
— Salary increases per annum 4.25%
— Pension increases:
— Accrued before 6 April 1997 2.00%
— Accrued after 6 April 1997 2.75%
The market value of the assets was £101.5 million, which was sufficient to cover 80 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future
increased in earnings. This represents a deficit of £25.5 million when compared with the scheme’ s liabilities. The deficit is being charged to the profit and loss account over 
the assumed average service life of the members. The pension cost to the Group in respect of this scheme was £3.6 million (2002: £3.5 million) which includes a variation 
charge of £3.5 million (2002: £3.3 million), all of which has been charged against operating profit. An accrual of £0.3 million (2002: £1.1 million) is included in the balance 
sheet at 31 March 2003.
Overseas pensions and similar obligations
The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries both defined benefit and defined contribution. Defined benefit schemes are set up under separate trust 
funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
There are no other significant post retirement benefits payable by any Group company.
FRS17 Disclosures
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’, under FRS 17
‘Retirement Benefits’ the following transitional disclosures are required for the three defined benefit schemes in the UK as disclosed above. Plans in other territories are 
not material.
The most recent valuation for each scheme, as at the dates disclosed above, were updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 March 2003 by independent qualified actuaries.

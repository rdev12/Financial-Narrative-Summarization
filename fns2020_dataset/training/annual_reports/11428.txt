Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to report that o2o has delivered strong results in 2007 against a
backdrop of significant change during the year. Following a review of our sales
and operations, a new management structure was implemented including the
appointment of a new Chief Executive, logistics efficiencies were realised and a
major cost reduction exercise was completed. This restructuring has placed
the Group in a strong position.  
Results
Group revenue increased by 1.2% to
£167.9m, up from £165.9m in 2006. 
Underlying profit before tax at
£11.6m was up from £11.5m in 2006,
before exceptional and non-recurring
costs of £2.3m (2006: £0.4m) and
share option charges of £0.2m (2006:
£0.8m). Profit before tax, after all such
charges, was £9.0m (2006: £10.3m)
and profit after tax was £6.3m (2006:
£7.2m). Basic earnings per share were
17.4p (2006: 20.2p).
Net cash generated from operating
activities, after reflecting cash
payments in respect of exceptional
and non-recurring costs, decreased
to £5.4m (2006: £7.7m). At 31
December 2007, cash and cash
equivalents balances were £7.0m, up
from £6.3m in 2006.
Dividends
The Board recommends a final
dividend of 6.8p per share (2006:
6.4p), which, if approved at the
annual general meeting, will be paid
on 9 May 2008 to shareholders on
the register at the close of business
on 11 April 2008. Combined with the
interim dividend paid in November
2007, this makes a total dividend per
share of 10p (2006: 9.6p) and
amounts to a distribution of £3.6m
(2006: £3.4m) and confirms the
Board’s commitment to a progressive
dividend policy.
Review of operations
The year to 31 December 2007 has
been one of significant change. Our
supply arrangements with two large
public sector customers, Ministry of
Defence (MoD) and The National
Health Service (NHS), were due for
renewal by competitive tender
during the year and we anticipated
pressure on our gross margin
percentage. 
In June, we announced that we had
decided to withdraw from the e-
auction process to supply office and
other products to the MoD under a
new four year supply framework
because we believed that the quoted
selling prices would not generate
acceptable profit margins for o2o.
Product supply ceased in the last
quarter of 2007.
At the same time, we announced
that our arrangements to supply the
NHS had been extended to 31 March
2009 and expanded to include a
broader range of products.
Since the end of the year, we have
received confirmation of a two year
extension through to September
2010 of our supply arrangements
with Her Majesty's Revenue and
Customs.
Although the public sector is now a
smaller part of our overall business,
extension of these supply
arrangements demonstrates our
ability to compete in one of our key
markets. 
Following the withdrawal from MoD
supply, we undertook a thorough
review of our operations. As a result,
we have improved operational
efficiency and reduced the cost base
to more closely reflect the needs of
the business. Significant supply chain
efficiency savings have been
achieved and we seized the
opportunity to reorganise our
warehouses and rationalise the
distribution function. In addition, our
sales and support functions have
been slimmed down, centralised
where possible and consolidated
under common leadership.  o2o plc Annual Report 2007 3
This restructuring is now substantially
complete at a total cost of £2.7m,
comprising £0.4m charged in the
year ended 31 December 2006 and
£2.3m charged in the year ended 
31 December 2007. We expect to
realise the full benefits of the
resultant savings in 2008.
Despite our withdrawal from MoD
supply, our revenue grew during the
period. The anticipated pressure on
gross margin was mitigated by
improved product sourcing that
resulted in a broadly stable gross
margin of 31.9% (2006: 32.0%).
However, we anticipate that higher
energy costs and higher paper prices
will impact our margins in 2008
although, as in this year, our revised
approach to procurement is
expected to help mitigate the
impact. Underlying profit before tax
(prior to exceptional and non-
recurring costs and share option
charges) as a percentage of revenue
was maintained at 6.9%. 
Board changes
Simon Moate joined the Board as
Chief Executive on 30 July 2007. He
has a successful track record in the
support services sector and
significant experience in strategic
planning and acquisitions. Simon’s
appointment follows the resignation
of Ray Peck on 1 February 2007,
whom I would like to thank for his
contribution to the business. 
Prior to Simon Moate’s appointment
and for a short handover period
afterwards, I acted in the capacity of
Executive Chairman.
During the year, the responsibilities
of Mark Cunningham, Finance
Director, were extended to
encompass a major project to
oversee the Logistics and IT
departments, including the
implementation of the supply chain
restructuring.
Peter Bertram, who is due to retire by
rotation at the forthcoming annual
general meeting, has decided not to
stand for re-election. Peter has
decided to resign to allow him to
pursue his other business interests. I
thank him for both his commitment
and contribution to the Board over
the last three and a half years as a
non-executive Director.
Outlook
The new management structure and
the team ethic that has been evident
throughout a difficult period of
restructuring has resulted in a
stronger and more focused Group.
While we envisage a slight drop in
revenue in 2008, due to the
withdrawal from MoD supply,
partially offset by revenue growth
elsewhere, we expect that the full
year impact of our restructuring
savings will more than compensate.
We are confident that there is scope
to further improve the business and
remain committed to the expansion
of our routes to market beyond our
traditional contracted office supplies
base.
We have a dedicated team reviewing
acquisition opportunities and we will
endeavour to expand the Group and
increase shareholder value in 2008.
We look forward to the coming year
with confidence and renewed vigour. 
Annual general meeting
The annual general meeting (AGM)
will be held at the Company’s head
office, St Crispins, Duke Street,
Norwich on 24 April 2008 at 10.30am.
Notice of the AGM, detailing the
ordinary and special business
together with the proxy forms for use
at the AGM, is being circulated with
these financial statements.

Chief Executive’s Review
I am delighted to present my first review as Chief Executive of o2o. Against the
background of a challenging marketplace, o2o has delivered its seventh
consecutive year of revenue growth. I believe that the Group has the ability to
take full advantage of market opportunities and I am privileged to be leading
the business at this exciting time in its development. 
In my role as Chief Executive I have
visited every part of the Group and
met with customers, employees and
investors. This process has confirmed
that o2o is more than a contract
stationer. In fact, it offers a wide
range of business products and
related services, supported by its
capability in managing complex
supply chains.
Prior to my arrival, the Board had
commissioned a review of our
strategies, processes and operational
practices in order to take stock of the
business. The review identified the
necessity for a fundamental
restructuring of the business and, as
a result of this, coupled with the
opportunity afforded by withdrawing
from MoD supply, we have taken
action to improve operational
efficiency and reduce the cost base
of the business to more closely
reflect its needs. 
A changing market
The office and related products
supply market has undergone major
changes over the last few years.
These include the emergence of 
e-auctions, erosion of profit margins
due to product cost increases, public
sector account consolidation and a
succession of competitor mergers
which have contributed substantially
to changing many working practices. 
o2o needs to adapt and innovate
within a market that is highly
competitive and growing steadily.
The market for office products
remains relatively stable and the
opportunities to extend the range of
products and services are significant.
Strategy
Over the last six months we have
built a simplified structure focused
on how we add value as a business,
which will enable us to be quick to
react, flexible in operation and
focused on doing fewer things better.
The Board is confident that there is
scope to drive further improvements
in the coming year. We remain
consistent in our aim to grow the
business by enlarging and
diversifying our customer base. The
key objective for 2008 is to continue
the expansion of our routes to
market beyond our traditional large
contracted office supplies base and
extend our service and product
ranges. It is intended that this will be
achieved both through organic
growth and by taking advantage of
suitable acquisition opportunities
when they arise. 
Organisation structure
Our new organisation is based on:
•
simplicity, clarity and focus to
create value for our customers;
•
sourcing products to optimise
total product cost; and
•
flexible distribution facilities to
deliver on our promises to
customers.
The combination of these elements
firmly positions us as a major player
in the provision of business products
and services to the UK and Irish
markets.  o2o plc Annual Report 2007 5
We have now structured the Group’s
trading operations to reflect our
three complementary core services.
• Banner Business Supplies Limited
(Banner)
Banner is a market leader in the
provision of medium and long-term
contract management and the
procurement of office and business
products for large private and public
sector customers. Banner excels in
the management of complex, 
multi-level business relationships.    
• Supply chain
The Group’s integrated supply chain
activity procures, manages, picks and
nationally distributes over 15,000
office and other business products. It
consolidates our warehousing,
distribution and procurement
activities to drive operating efficiency.
Acquisition of smaller, locally
branded office and other business
product supply companies will create
additional revenue streams to build
critical sales volume to which we will
add o2o supply chain support.    
• Business services 
Although our service offering is still
in its infancy, we believe through our
existing customer base, we can
create a significant presence in the
business services sector, by offering
our customers added-value services
including print management,
document management and storage,
technology and business furniture.       
This revised organisation structure
recognises that o2o is more than a
stationer and promotes its
development as a leading business
supplies, integrated supply chain and
managed services group committed
to delivering on our promises and
adding value at every stage of the
process. 
Expanding our customer base
A core element of our strategy is to
win new customers through organic
sales growth. We already supply
office products and solutions to
businesses and organisations of all
sizes across the UK and Ireland in
what is a relatively fragmented
market and we have teams dedicated
to winning new customers.
Broadening our range of
products and services
The availability of a wide range of
products and services from a single
supplier is important to many of our
customers and we aim to offer just
that. Experience has proved that we
can deliver significant customer
benefits through a rationalised
supplier base and by consolidating
the management of large volumes of
low-value transactions.  
Developing innovative solutions
to meet the changing needs of
customers 
Central to the Group’s performance is
meeting the ever-changing needs of
its customers. Changes in
technology, purchasing patterns,
customer priorities and service
requirements are a feature of our
business. We encourage innovation
and remain flexible to the adoption
of new ideas at all levels.   6
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Growth by acquisition
We continue to monitor and evaluate
potential acquisition opportunities.
Our criteria include the ability to
extract cost or revenue synergies and
the potential for the target to grow
profitability.
Management structure
We have reconfigured our senior
management better to reflect the
growth opportunities identified as
part of the strategic review. 
The senior management comprises a
streamlined team with clearly defined
responsibilities to deliver our growth
plans. They will oversee specific
business functions and teams. 
Mark Cunningham, in addition to the
responsibilities of the Finance
Director role, is currently charged
with the reorganisation of the
logistics, warehousing and operations
functions. It is envisaged that this will
be complete by the end of 2008.
Mark Goddard, Chief Financial Officer,
leads the Group’s finance team and is
providing additional support to the
Finance Director whilst the
reorganisation is implemented. Geoff
Streetley, who leads Banner and is
responsible for growing the contract
office products customer base,
became Chief Commercial Officer.
Steve McKeever, who joined us in
December as Chief Information
Officer, is responsible for delivering
best in class e-commerce and
business processes. 
The Board remains unchanged,
however members of the senior
management team attend meetings
on a regular basis to update on
progress and developments in their
business areas. 
Employees 
We recognise that the success of o2o
is a reflection of the success of our
people and I would personally like to
thank our management and all our
employees for their contribution and
for their patience and perseverance
through a difficult period. 
We aim to recruit and retain the best
people in the business supplies
industry. At o2o, our people have a
broad range of talents and
backgrounds. Our customers rely on
the combined efforts of around 800
people to manage relationships and to
deliver the right products and services
when and where they are needed. 
The Group operates a variety of
schemes to allow employees to
participate directly in the success of
the business. These include a Save-
As-You-Earn share option scheme
with a broad participation in
addition to more targeted schemes
for senior employees. 
I would like to express my thanks to
the Chairman, David Callear, who
stepped in and assumed executive
responsibility after my predecessor
left the business in February 2007.
Many of the initiatives and actions
taken during the ensuing period
strengthened the business for the
challenges faced during the
remainder of 2007.
Future prospects
o2o is a solid business with real
prospects for longer-term growth
both organically and by acquisition.
The strategic review has delivered
clarity of vision and purpose and we
expect future acquisitions to deliver
growth. We believe in getting the
basics right - delivering on our
promises, achieving demonstrable
and consistent growth, a
commitment to sustainable
performance and enhancing
shareholder value. 
We have a growing customer base, a
strong management team, a
passionate and motivated workforce
and a flexible business model proven
to react quickly to market changes.
Our market will remain competitive
but our commitment to contain
operating costs and drive efficiencies
should enable us to deliver our
growth plans.

Financial Review
Revenue and operating profit
Total revenue increased by 1.2% to
£167.9m. Our operating profit, prior to
exceptional and non-recurring costs
of £2.3m and share option charges of
£0.2m, was £11.7m (2006: £11.9m
prior to exceptional and non-recurring
costs of £0.4m and share option
charges of £0.8m). Operating profit
after such items was £9.1m (2006:
£10.7m). The operating profit margin,
prior to exceptional and 
non-recurring costs and share option
charges, decreased to 7.0% (2006:
7.2%). 
Exceptional and non-recurring costs
are those significant items which are
separately disclosed by virtue of their
size or incidence to enable a full
understanding of the Group's
operating performance. Transactions
which may give rise to exceptional
and non-recurring costs are principally
restructuring related charges and
costs in respect of key management
changes. A full analysis of the
exceptional and non-recurring costs is
set out in note 5 to the financial
statements.
Share option charges of £243,000
(2006: £768,000) comprise £232,000 in
respect of Company share schemes
and an £11,000 provision in respect of
national insurance contributions,
which will become payable on share
options when exercised. 
Tax
A full analysis of the tax charge for the
year is set out in note 9 to the
financial statements.
The Group’s effective tax rate in 2007
was 30.4% (2006: 30.4%). The amount
of corporation tax to be paid for the
year is £2.5m (2006: £2.9m).
Shareholders’ return
Fully diluted earnings per share were
17.3p (2006: 19.7p). Basic earnings per
share were 17.4p (2006: 20.2p). 
The total dividend paid and payable
for the year of 10.0p per share
(including the 3.2p interim dividend
paid on 6 November 2007) is covered
1.74 times by earnings. Equity at the
end of the year was £16.9m (2006:
£14.8m).
The middle-market quotation of the
Company’s Ordinary shares at the end
of the financial year was 119.5p with a
market capitalisation of £43.4m
(including shares held by the
employee benefit trust).
Cash flow
As set out on page 33, the Group
continued to generate cash, with net
cash generated from operating
activities of £5.4m (2006: £7.7m). As at
31 December 2007, cash and cash
equivalents amounted to £7.0m
compared to £6.3m at the start of the
year. We continue to focus on our
working capital, although inevitably
over time as we obtain more private
sector customers and source more
goods overseas we will have to make
greater investment in this area. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
Our business is built around a proven
service with reliance on our
warehouses and IT infrastructure.
Following a comprehensive review of
significant risks, the Board considers a
disaster in either of these areas to
have the highest potential impact on
the Group. In order to mitigate these
risks we maintain adequate insurance
cover and have in place and maintain
under review appropriate disaster
recovery plans.
In addition, the Group is inevitably
reliant on its customer base, but as we
have demonstrated by our withdrawal
from MoD supply, we have already
been successful in mitigating a
significant change in our customer
base.
Financial risks and treasury
policies
The Group’s main treasury risks relate
to the availability of funds to meet its
future requirements. At the year end
the Group had an unutilised working
capital facility of £15m. The Group’s
policy with respect to facilities is to
ensure that these are sufficient to
cover the expected needs of the
Group, having reflected the inherent
uncertainty of projections and
forecasts. See note 1 to the financial
statements for further details.
The Group has some foreign currency
risk relating to a balance held in an
Irish euro bank account and small
trading requirements in other foreign
currencies. The overall treasury policy
in this area is to ensure that there are
no material currency risks attached to
any part of the business. 8

Content of the Financial Review
This Financial Review, together with the information contained in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s
Review, has been produced with reference to best practice prescribed in ‘Reporting statement: Operating and financial
review’ published by the Accounting Standards Board, although this Standard is not currently mandatory. The Board
considers there to be no significant areas of non-compliance with this Standard.
M A Cunningham
Finance Director
27 February 2008
The Group has no borrowings other
than £0.6m of finance lease
obligations (2006: £0.7m). The Group’s
policy with respect to interest rate
management will be determined if
and when the Group requires debt
funding in the future. With regards to
cash surpluses, these are placed on
overnight deposit at variable rates, as
appropriate, to maximise the return. 
The Group’s principal financial assets
are bank balances, cash and trade
debtors, which represent the
Company’s maximum exposure to
credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily
attributable to its trade debtors. Credit
risk is managed by monitoring the
aggregate amount and duration of
exposure to any one customer
depending upon their credit rating.
The amounts presented in the
balance sheet are net of allowances
for doubtful debts, estimated by the
Group’s management based on
current circumstances, prior
experience and their assessment of
the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is
limited because the counterparties are
banks with high credit ratings
assigned by international credit-rating
agencies. The Group has no significant
concentration of credit risk, with
exposure spread over a large number
of counterparties and customers.
Going concern
The Directors, having made
appropriate enquiries, consider it
reasonable to assume that the Group
and the Company have adequate
resources to continue for the
foreseeable future and, for this
reason, have continued to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
Key performance indicators
The key performance indicators which o2o regard as important measures for the business are product cost profitability,
operating costs as a percentage of revenue, operating profitability and shareholder return. o2o plc Annual Report 2007 9
Corporate Social Responsibility Statement
Demonstrating our commitment
to responsible business practices
Corporate social responsibility (CSR)
is relevant across all aspects of o2o’s
business and to commit to
responsible business practices is one
of our key objectives. 
o2o’s approach to CSR is
underpinned by our corporate social
responsibility policy.
The Board believes that an important
factor in our long-term success will
be to ensure that the activities of the
Group are carried out in a responsible
way that produces benefits for all our
stakeholders.  
Employees are regarded as
fundamental to the continued
success of the Group and are
provided with a challenging yet
rewarding working environment. The
nature of the Group’s business
activities brings with it environmental
protection obligations that the Group
monitors closely to ensure
compliance with its environmental
management system and ISO 14001
certification at certified sites. 
The Group works in partnership with
certain customers to ensure, as far as
reasonably practicable, that our
sourcing of products meets
minimum standards of corporate
social responsibility, for example,
regarding employment and safety
practices of suppliers and
contractors. 
Health, safety and welfare
o2o is committed to maintaining the
health, safety and welfare of our
employees, customers and others
who may be affected by our business
activities. Managers are responsible
for the effective management of
health and safety which includes
conducting risk assessments and
taking preventative action to provide
a safe environment in which to work
to achieve the best for both our
people and our Group. 
Among the key features are:
•
considering health and safety
issues through the design,
maintenance and operation of our
warehousing and distribution
fleet;
•
supplying safe and reliable
products and services to the
market-place;
•
working to prevent incidents by
engaging with employees and
contractors and educating them in
the implementation of our policy;
and
•
integrating health and safety
considerations into business
decisions from the planning stage
onwards.
During the year, an independent
review of health and safety of the
main warehouses was undertaken
and recommendations were fed back
to the Board and senior management
as part of a health and safety training
programme – see pages 20 to 21 for
details. A risk assessment process is
maintained to ensure that
assessments are prioritised, followed
through and reviewed periodically.
An independent third party has been
appointed to extend risk assessment
and audit to other areas of the
business during 2008.
Employees 
o2o employs approximately 800
people. Their welfare and safety is a
key priority and the Group actively
encourages staff involvement in the
development of our business
activities. 
Employees are treated with fairness
and respect. They are encouraged
and supported in their development
at work and provided with relevant
training. All staff are expected to
maintain high standards of work and
behaviour and to display integrity in
their dealings with customers,
suppliers and each other. A code of
business ethics is applied and
maintained. 
The Board is confident that
employees will continue to rise to
the market opportunities and
challenges that lie ahead.
Environment 
o2o is committed to managing and
reducing any significant
environmental impacts through its
environmental management system,
which is certified to the international
standard ISO 14001. We have 10
maintained the registrations both at
head office and at our Manchester
site, which houses our largest
distribution centre. The key activities,
including the supply chain and
distribution, are within the scope of
our certification. Our intention is to
improve our environmental
performance year on year and
therefore environmental objectives
have been set with periodic progress
reviews. For example, in the Annual
Report for 2006, we reported our
progress with regards to the two
priorities of waste packaging
management and energy
conservation. In addition, for 2007 we
adopted further objectives relating to
environmentally-preferred products.
o2o’s full environmental policy may
be viewed at our web site
(www.office2office.co.uk). The main
highlights are detailed below.
Management of packaging waste
Generation of such waste is
inevitable in our business. However,
our aim has been to reduce volumes
and mitigate the impacts. Incoming
waste cardboard and plastic pallet
wrap continue to be baled for
recycling by approved waste
recycling contractors to divert these
materials from landfill. We have also
instigated processes to collect similar
waste packaging from our outlying
premises. The Group is a member of
the Valpak packaging compliance
scheme and has reduced its
packaging obligation through
improving internal packaging
processes and methods.
Reducing energy consumption
Reducing the rate of climate change
is an acknowledged global priority.
Within o2o, programmes have been
implemented to help reduce our
carbon output through initiatives to
manage our use of fuel by controlling
business travel and by effective fleet
management. Double deck trailers,
logistics software and vehicle
selection continue to be the main
drivers to reduce miles travelled and
emissions. The emissions and fuel
consumption of the delivery fleet are
monitored regularly. Delivery routes
are constantly reviewed both to
reduce costs and optimise mileage.
All vehicles are serviced and
maintained regularly in order to
optimise performance. We continue
to review the use of alternative 
fuel-powered goods vehicles. The
Group continues to back load to
optimise the use of otherwise empty
vehicles. Over 80% of the company
car fleet is now diesel-powered
(exceeding our target of 75%), which
helps to reduce fuel consumption
and certain emissions. The average
carbon dioxide emission per
company car is now 150 g/km and all
cars are below 220 g/km, meeting
our target. The video conferencing
facilities, installed in three of our
main sites, are well used and reduce
business travel, contributing to fuel
savings and reduced emissions. 
Environmentally-preferred
products
To provide customers with a wider
choice of environmentally-preferred
products, we have continued to
extend our Globe & Tick™ range of
products to strict criteria. During
2007, the range was extended further
to over 1,100 products with some
new product categories. We shall
continue to work with suppliers and
customers to identify products that
can be added to the range.
Environmental awards
During the course of the year the
Company was awarded:
•
the British Office Supplies and
Services Federation environment
certificate in recognition of our
commitment to environmental
responsibility; and
•
a major commendation in the
Business Commitment to the
Environment Environmental
Leadership Awards in recognition
of our innovative Globe & Tick™
product range.
In addition, the Company was
granted entry into the prestigious
FTSE4Good Index for meeting
globally recognised corporate
responsibility standards. We have also
joined the May Day Company, a joint
venture between Business in the
Community and the Carbon Trust
formed to help reduce carbon
footprints.
Packaging waste, energy conservation
and environmentally-preferred
products will continue to be our
focus during 2008. Many companies
are now considering their ‘carbon
footprint’ – a way of measuring the
greenhouse gases produced by their
operations. As this is a new area,
standard methods of measurement
are still being developed. o2o is
waiting for the British Standards
Institute to issue standards in order
to be able to ensure consistency
and comparability of measurement.
We will then use our carbon
footprint as a tool for benchmarking
our performance in order to set
targets for reducing our greenhouse
gas emissions.

Mark Cunningham and Jim Cohen

with the Company’s articles of
association, at the forthcoming AGM
and, being eligible, offer themselves
for re-election. The Board considers
that their performance continues to
be effective and that they
demonstrate a strong commitment
to their roles. Simon Moate will offer
himself for election being the first
opportunity to do so since his
appointment.
Peter Bertram, who is also due to
retire by rotation at the forthcoming
AGM, has decided not to stand for 
re-election and has indicated his
intention to resign as a Director in
order to allow him to pursue his
other business commitments.
Directors’ interests
Directors’ interests are detailed in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on
pages 22 to 27.
Donations
No donations were made to any
charitable or political organisation in
the year (2006: £nil).
Employee involvement
The Group has a policy of providing
employees with information through
corporate newsletters and regular
meetings, which are held between
management and employees to
allow a free flow of information and
ideas. 
The Group operates a variety of share
schemes to allow the executive
Directors and employees to
participate directly in the success of
the business. Details are included in
the Directors’ Remuneration Report
on pages 22 to 27.
Employee benefit trust
During the year, the Company
loaned a total of £958,000 to the
employee benefit trust (EBT) to
allow it to purchase shares in the
market with a view to satisfying the
exercise of options under its
employee share-save schemes. A
total of 550,441 shares were
purchased, the highest price paid
being £2.13 and the lowest price
paid being £1.28. As at 31 December
2007, the total number of shares
held by the EBT was 624,248 (1.72%
of the issued share capital of the
Company). Whilst held in trust, the
shares do not attract any payment
of dividends nor do they have any
voting rights attached to them.
Equal opportunities
The Group is fully committed to a
policy that provides all employees
irrespective of background with
equality of opportunity for
employment, training, career
development and selection on the
basis of ability, qualifications and
suitability for the job. Executive
Directors, managers and employees
are required to promote equality of
opportunity and to take full account
of the policy in their day-to-day work.
The aim is to recruit the best staff in
the industry and the Group is
committed to the principle of
maximising every employees'
potential. In selecting, training and
promoting staff, the Group has to
take account of the physically
demanding nature of much of its
work. Employees who become
disabled will be retained and re-
trained, where possible.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to negotiate,
with each of its principal suppliers,
terms of trade appropriate to the
business and to operate within those
terms of payment once agreed. Trade
creditor days based on the year end
figures are 69 (2006: 71) for the
Group. The Company has no trade
creditors (2006: nil).
Environmental policy
The Group ensures that, in satisfying
its customers’ requirements, both the
goods and services supplied and its
own housekeeping comply with
legislation and best practice. The
Group continually reviews its
environmental performance across
the business.
A summary report on the Group’s
policies and objectives in respect of
Corporate Social Responsibility is set
out on pages 9 to 10.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group's operations expose it to a
variety of financial and other risks, a
review of which is provided in the
Financial Review on pages 7 to 8. 
The Board has delegated the
responsibility of monitoring financial
risk management to the Audit
Committee.
Special business to be
considered at the forthcoming
AGM
At the AGM on 24 April 2008, the
Directors will be seeking to renew
their authority to make market
purchases of up to 3,630,898
Ordinary shares of the Company
(being approximately 10% of the
Company’s Ordinary shares in issue)
and a special resolution will be
proposed for this.
In addition, a special resolution to
amend the current articles of
association (the ‘articles’) of the
Company will also be proposed at 14
Directors’ Report continued
the forthcoming AGM. In the main
these changes are to bring the
articles in line with the Companies
Act 2006. A separate special
resolution will be proposed to
amend the borrowing powers of the
Company, which are currently limited
to an aggregate cap of £30million.
Guidance issued by the Association
of British Insurers regarding
borrowing powers provisions
contained in public limited
company’s articles suggest that fixed
limits to borrowing powers should
only be a temporary measure and
that an aggregate cap should be
fixed as a multiple of capital and
reserves. It is proposed that the fixed
aggregate cap is removed and the
cap be changed to a more flexible
and less prohibitive level of three
times capital and reserves.
Details of these special resolutions
are set out in the Notice of AGM,
which is being circulated with the
annual report.
Statement of directors’
responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors
to prepare financial statements for
each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and the Group and of
the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the Company and the
Group financial statements in
accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
as adopted by the European Union.
In preparing those financial
statements the Directors are
required to: 
•
select suitable accounting policies
and then apply them consistently;
•
make judgements and estimates
that are reasonable and prudent;
•
state that the financial statements
comply with IFRS’s as adopted by
the European Union; and
•
prepare the financial statements
on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors confirm that they have
complied with the above
requirements in preparing the
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
that disclose, with reasonable
accuracy and at any time, the
financial position of the Company
and of the Group and to enable them
to ensure that the financial
statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report comply with
the Companies Act 1985 and 2006.
They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the
Company and of the Group and,
hence, for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Company has a website
(www.office2office.co.uk), which
contains up to date information on
Group activities and published
financial results. The maintenance
and integrity of this website is the
responsibility of the Directors.
Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosure of
information to auditors
So far as the Directors are aware,
there is no relevant audit information
of which the Group’s auditors are
unaware and they have taken all
steps that they ought to have taken
as Directors in order to make
themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish
that the Group’s auditors are aware of
that information.
Auditors
The Audit Committee has considered
and recommends the re-appointment
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as
auditors. A resolution proposing the
re-appointment will be put to the
forthcoming AGM.

Corporate Governance Statement
Application of the Combined
Code
The Combined Code on Corporate
Governance issued in June 2006
contains only a limited number of
modifications to the Combined Code
(2003). Following the Financial
Services Authority's (FSA) adoption of
the Combined Code (2006) and the
release of the FSA’s amended Listing
Rules in October 2006, the Combined
Code (2006) (the Combined Code)
takes effect for reporting periods
commencing on or after 1 November
2006.
Statement of compliance with
the Code
The Directors consider that the
Company has complied with the
principles set out in section 1 of the
Combined Code throughout the
period, with one exception as detailed
below. The application of the principles
of the Combined Code in the
composition and operation of the
Board, the remuneration of the
Directors, shareholder relationships and
procedures for financial reporting and
internal control are described below. 
Directors and the Board
The Board comprises the Chairman, the
Chief Executive, the Finance Director
and two non-executive Directors. 
In February 2007, Ray Peck resigned
as Chief Executive. Without an
immediate successor and having
consulted with the Company’s
corporate advisors and major
shareholders, the remaining Board
members agreed to take on
additional responsibilities whilst a
new Chief Executive was sought. 
David Callear assumed the role of
Executive Chairman, becoming
involved with the day to day running
of the business in conjunction with
the senior management team. The
Board accepted temporary non-
compliance with provision A.2.1 of the
Combined Code, which states that the
role of chairman and chief executive
should be separate, as being in the
overall interests of the Group. Simon
Moate's appointment as Chief
Executive was effective from 30 July
2007. After a short handover, 
David Callear relinquished executive
responsibilities and reverted to his role
as Chairman. Mark Cunningham, in
addition to his role as Finance
Director, oversaw the Logistics and IT
functions, and Jim Cohen and Peter
Bertram provided additional
assistance associated with their
existing non-executive responsibilities.
The Chairman is responsible for
leading the Board and ensuring there
is timely and effective
communication to and between
Board members. The Chief Executive
is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Group and, once
agreed by the Board as a whole, the
development and implementation of
strategy. The normal segregation of
responsibilities between the
Chairman and the Chief Executive
has been set out in writing and
approved by the Board. The
Chairman’s other main commitments
are disclosed on page 11.
Simon Moate joined office2office
from a listed company environment
and was already fully versed in the
duties and obligations of a listed
company director. Upon joining, he
was provided with a comprehensive
information pack on the Group and,
during the year, visited all of the
Group’s sites and met with all of the
various functions of the business. In
September, he met with shareholders
at the presentation of the 2007
interim results. 
The non-executive Directors are free
from any business or other
relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their
judgement and have no involvement
with the day-to-day management of
the Group. Notwithstanding the
additional assistance provided during
the year, the Board considers both
non-executive Directors to be
independent and feels that their
diverse experiences and backgrounds
bring a depth of debate and
alternative viewpoint to the Board. Jim
Cohen is the senior independent non-
executive Director. The terms and
conditions of the non-executive
Director’s appointments are available
on request from the Company’s
registered office.
The Board operates formally through
agenda-driven Board meetings which
are held at least monthly, usually at
the Company’s head office. In May,
the Board met on three occasions:
twice prior to the pan-government 
e-auction to discuss the issues of the
e-auction process with the team
directly involved with it and to
approve the pricing proposals; and
once whilst the e-auction was in
progress. The Board were kept
informed at all times and fully
supported all decisions made. In
October, a Board meeting was
convened at the Group’s main
warehouse in Manchester to allow
the Board to review the
improvements in operations and
logistics and for a presentation of a
health and safety audit undertaken
by an independent consultant, which
included a review of the warehouse
operations. See page 20 for details. 
Although the monthly agenda
includes operational and strategic
developments, members of the
Board met on other occasions, with
corporate advisors attending as
required, to review specific
acquisition opportunities and
business improvement plans.
Frequent informal dialogue between
the Directors supplements the formal
Board meetings. On a number of
occasions during the year, the
Chairman met with the 
non-executive Directors without the
executive Directors present to discuss
the performance of individual
executive Directors and other senior
managers. The non-executive
Directors have also met without the
Chairman being present to discuss
his performance.
The Board is responsible to
shareholders for the management and
control of the Group’s activities, its
strategic objectives, its system of
corporate governance and the
stewardship of its resources. This is
achieved by regular review of the key
activities of the Group through the
monthly management accounts,
detailed reports and presentations.
Additionally, the Board receives
analysts’and brokers’reports and is
updated on any movements in major
shareholdings. A Board pack 16
Corporate Governance Statement continued
comprising of information to be
reviewed and discussed is forwarded to
all Board members in advance of the
monthly meetings to allow the
Directors to be fully prepared. There is
also a formal schedule of matters
reserved for consideration and
approval by the Board. Specific
responsibilities have been delegated to
Board committees as described below. 
The Company Secretary reports to the
Board and advises individual Directors
as required on Board procedures and
corporate governance matters. A
procedure also exists for Directors to
take independent professional advice
at the Company’s expense.
Appropriate third party directors and
officers’ insurance is maintained by
the Company.
The Board undertakes a critical
evaluation of itself and its committees
on an annual basis. The Company
Secretary prepared an independent
assessment of the performance of the
Board and its committees during the
year, based on Higgs Performance
Evaluation Guidance, and this was
discussed with the Board in
December 2007. The assessment
recognised that the Board had been
challenged by a number of significant
changes and the Board had
responded by re-organising their
responsibilities and providing
additional assistance, as detailed
above. Having gained considerable
knowledge and experience of the
business since its flotation in June
2004, the Board was able to respond
with immediate effect and offer a
hands-on approach to deal with the
issues facing the business. 
The Board concurred with the
performance evaluation and was
satisfied with the work and support
provided by its committees.
Following a review of the schedule of
matters reserved for the Board and all
of the committees’ terms of
reference, the Board agreed that no
changes were necessary.
As in previous years, the Board met,
formally and informally, with a number
of the senior managers during the year
and intend for this to continue. The
Board felt that this not only improves
communications, both in and out of
the boardroom, but also helps in their
understanding of the business. In order
to provide additional support to the
Board, Mark Goddard, the Chief
Financial Officer, was invited to attend
the monthly Board meetings since
assuming many of the day-to-day
responsibilities for the finance function. 
Health and safety was one of the
areas that the Board had prioritised
for detailed review (see page 20) and,
in order to assist with driving through
the initiatives in this area,
participated in a health and safety
training programme during 2007
which specifically focused on
Directors’ duties and responsibilities
in this area. The senior management
team also participated in the training
programme.
In accordance with the Company’s
articles of association no more than
one third of the Directors are
required to retire at each annual
general meeting and all Directors
are required to submit themselves
for re-election at least once every
three years. Directors appointed by
the Board during the year are
required to retire at the first annual
general meeting after their
appointment and offer themselves
for election. See page 13 for details
of those Directors retiring.
Committees of the Board
Specific responsibilities are delegated
to sub-committees of the Board. The
composition of these sub-
committees is provided below
together with reference to reports on
their activities. All other decisions are
taken collectively by the Board.
The Nomination Committee is
responsible for reviewing the size,
structure and composition of the
Board and making recommendations
to the Board if it considers that any
changes are required. It keeps
succession plans under review and
has a formal procedure for
appointments to the Board and
senior management team. The
Nomination Committee includes
both independent non-executive
Directors and is chaired by David
Callear. During his period as Executive
Chairman, David Callear resigned his
chairmanship in accordance with the
Combined Code and the committee
was temporarily chaired by 
Jim Cohen. A report on its activities is
given on page 19.
The Remuneration Committee
reviews and makes recommendations
on the Group’s overall remuneration
policy, including individual
remuneration packages for executive
Directors, the Chairman and senior
management. It is also responsible for
the review of the Company’s share
schemes and senior incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee is
chaired by Jim Cohen and comprises
the independent non-executive
Directors and, from 4 September
2007, David Callear, following a
relaxation of the rules in the
Combined Code and after he had
relinquished executive responsibilities.
When necessary, non-committee
members are invited to attend by
prior arrangement. A report on its
activities is given on pages 22 
to 27.
The Audit Committee assists the
Board in discharging its
responsibilities effectively for financial
reporting, risk review and internal
control. It comprises the independent
non-executive Directors and is
chaired by Peter Bertram, who is a
Chartered Accountant and has
relevant financial expertise, as
described in his biography on 
page 11. Non-committee members
and the external auditors are invited
to attend by prior arrangement. A
report on its activities is given on
pages 20 to 21. o2o plc Annual Report 2007

meeting if they are unable to attend.
Additionally, minutes of meetings are
circulated to the respective members
of the Board or committee.
Directors’ remuneration
The Directors’ Remuneration Report
on pages 22 to 27 includes details of
remuneration policies and the
remuneration of Directors.
Relationship with shareholders
The Board, led by the Chairman,
recognises the importance of
effective communication and
accountability to all shareholders and
is kept informed of their views
through frequent contact with the
house-brokers and feedback from
direct communications with, and
presentations to, institutional
investors and fund managers.
Each shareholder receives the annual
report and financial statements
containing the full-year results and an
interim report on the half-year results.
Following the announcement of
results, presentations are given to the
investment community in London
and Edinburgh. The full-year and half-
year reports and presentations are
made available on the Company’s
website (www.office2office.co.uk).
The Company’s annual general
meeting takes place in Norwich and
formal notification, together with the
annual report and financial
statements, is sent to shareholders at
least 20 working days in advance of
the meeting. All Board members are
available, formally during the annual
general meeting and informally
afterwards, for questions. Each item of
business is the subject of a separate
resolution. The collection and analysis
of the proxy votes is handled
independently by the Company’s
registrars. The Chairman announces
the results of the proxy votes after
shareholders have voted on a show of
hands. These results are also made
available on the Company’s website.
Details of the 2008 AGM are set out in
the notice of the meeting enclosed
with this report.
The Chairman and the non-executive
Directors are always available to
shareholders on all matters relating
to governance and strategy. They
may be contacted through the
Company’s website.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility
for the Group’s systems of internal
controls and delegates the annual
review of internal control processes
and their effectiveness to the Audit
Committee. The internal control
systems are designed to meet the
Group’s needs and address the risks
to which it is exposed. Such systems
manage, rather than eliminate, the
risks faced by the business and can
only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
mis-statement or loss. Necessary
actions are taken to remedy any
significant failings or weaknesses as
they are identified when the Board
reviews the effectiveness of the
system of internal control. 18
Corporate Governance Statement continued
The key elements of the Group’s
procedures and internal financial
control framework are:
•
the close involvement of the
executive Directors in all aspects
of the day-to-day operations,
including regular meetings with
senior staff from across the Group
and a review of the monthly
operational reports compiled by
the senior management;
•
clearly defined responsibilities and
limits of authority. The Board has
responsibility for strategy and has
adopted a schedule of matters
which are required to be brought
to it for decision;
•
a comprehensive system of
financial reporting, forecasting and
budgeting. Detailed budgets are
prepared annually for all parts of
the business. Reviews occur
through the management
structure culminating in a Group
budget which is considered and
approved by the Board;
•
Group management accounts are
prepared monthly and submitted
to the Board for review. Variances
from budget and prior year are
closely monitored and
explanations are provided for
significant variances. Detailed
expense reports with comparisons
against budget are issued monthly
to cost centre managers to assist
in cost control; 
•
a continuous process for
identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks across
the Group together with a
comprehensive annual review of
risks which covers both financial
and non-financial areas; 
•
an annual review of insurance cover
for the Group including a review of
disaster recovery plans for IT and
the warehouses. The significant risks
facing the business are considered
to be those of a catastrophic nature,
being either a disaster in the
warehouse or IT infrastructure; and
• a risk review committee to oversee
the embedding of internal controls
and risk management into the
organisation. The risk review
committee, chaired by 
Peter Bertram, comprises the 
Chief Executive and the Finance
Director.
In previous years the risk review
committee had met to review
updates to the risk register, initially
compiled after a review of the
Group’s internal controls and risk
management in line with Turnbull
guidance and which scores risks
on the basis of likelihood of
occurrence and impact on the
business. In February 2007, a
reassessment of the risks facing
the business was undertaken and
a number of areas were prioritised
for a review. The key areas are
detailed below. A more proactive
approach was required and, as a
result, steering committees were
set up with a specific focus on
operational, commercial and
strategic issues and matters
including sales strategy and health
and safety were subject to
independent review. These
reviews were extended across the
whole Group, following
withdrawal from MoD supply and
prior to a restructuring of the
business. Although no risk review
committee meetings were
convened during 2007, the
Committee was represented by its
individual members attending
meetings of the steering
committees. 
Corporate social responsibility
Measures to ensure responsible
business conduct and the
identification and assessment of risks
associated with social, ethical and
environmental matters are managed
in conjunction with all other business
risks and reviewed at regular
meetings of the Board and senior
management meetings.
A summary report on the Group’s
policies and objectives for corporate
social responsibility is set out on
pages 9 to 10.

Role of the Nomination
Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-
committee of the Board and is
responsible for all appointments to
the Board, giving full consideration to
succession plans and the leadership
of the Group. It makes
recommendations to the Board of
any changes to the Board and its
committees it considers necessary
and also reviews the senior
management structure. The
committee has a formal procedure
for appointments to the Board and
senior management team, which is
available, together with the
committee’s terms of reference, on
the Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk).
Composition of the Nomination
Committee
The Nomination Committee
comprises the Chairman and the
independent non-executive
Directors. During his period as
Executive Chairman, David Callear
resigned his chairmanship in
accordance with the Combined Code
and the committee was temporarily
chaired by Jim Cohen. The Company
Secretary is secretary to the
Nomination Committee. The
committee meets to deal with
assignments in accordance with
Company needs and best practice in
corporate governance. 
Main activities of the
Nomination Committee
In 2007, the Nomination Committee
met on four occasions.
In January, the committee met twice
to deal with succession plans and
review the structure and
responsibilities of the Board and the
senior management team.
Following the resignation of Ray Peck
in February 2007, the committee met
to discuss how responsibilities would
be covered whilst a replacement
Chief Executive was sought. 
David Callear agreed to temporarily
extend his role to take on the
responsibilities of the Chief Executive
and Mark Cunningham agreed to
extend his role to take on the
responsibility for Logistics and IT, in
addition to that of Finance Director.
In order to facilitate this, the Chief
Financial Officer, Mark Goddard,
assumed a number of the Finance
Director’s day-to-day responsibilities
and the non-executive Directors
offered more of their time to assist as
required. The committee also
appointed recruitment consultants to
search for a replacement Chief
Executive.
In April, the committee met with the
candidates short-listed for the role of
Chief Executive and, acting on their
recommendations, the Board offered
the position to Simon Moate.

Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is a sub-
committee of the Board whose
responsibilities include:
•
reviewing the interim report, the
annual report and accounts,
results announcements of the
Group and any other formal
announcements relating to the
Group’s financial performance and
recommending them to the Board
for approval;
•
reviewing the Group’s systems of
internal financial control, risk
management policies and
procedures; 
•
monitoring and reviewing the
requirement for an internal audit
function;
•
considering the appointment of
the external auditors, overseeing
the process for their selection and
making recommendations to the
Board in relation to their
appointment;
•
monitoring and reviewing the
effectiveness and independence
of the external auditors, agreeing
the nature and scope of their
audit, their remuneration and
considering their reports on the
Group’s accounts and systems of
internal financial control and risk
management; and
•
monitoring the Group’s whistle-
blowing procedures.
Composition of the Audit
Committee
The Audit Committee comprises both
independent non-executive Directors
whose biographical details are
included on page 11 and their
remuneration on pages 22 to 27.
Peter Bertram, Chairman of the Audit
Committee, is a Chartered
Accountant. Non-Committee
members and the Company’s
external auditors are invited to attend
meetings as and when appropriate.
At least once each year,
representatives of the Group’s
external auditors meet the Audit
Committee without any executive
Directors being present. The
Company Secretary is secretary to
the Audit Committee. The
committee’s terms of reference are
available on the Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk).
Main activities of the Audit
Committee
The Audit Committee met on three
occasions in 2007 with other Board
members and the auditors attending
as required. Two of these meetings
were to review the 2006 full-year
results and the 2007 half-year results
prior to recommending them to the
Board for approval. The committee
also reviewed the results
announcements and presentations to
investors and received reports from
the external auditors on their work. In
December 2007, the committee met
the external auditors who set out
their audit approach and procedures,
including matters relating to scope,
auditor independence and fees for
the full year audit. At the same
meeting, the committee reviewed
the whistle-blowing policy and
considered the scope of the work
done by the steering committees
and the need for an internal audit
function.
Review of risk management and
internal control
In February 2007, a number of areas
of potential risk were prioritised for
review and specific steering
committees were established to drive
this forward. These reviews were later
extended across the whole of the
Group prior to restructuring. 
• Loss of a large customer
The impact on the business of
withdrawing from MoD supply was
considered well before the decision
to withdraw from the e-auction
process. A detailed contingency plan
was formulated, quantified and
approved by the Board before the 
e-auction tender process had
commenced. Due to the advanced
nature of the planning the business
was able to respond rapidly to the
withdrawal from the e-auction
process and allowed the cost base to
be reduced with minimal disruption.
This experience with historically our
largest customer, coupled with the
programme to diversify our customer
base, stands us in good stead to react
to any other customer losses that
may arise.
• Warehouse and IT infrastructure
Mark Cunningham took on the
responsibility for the logistics and IT
functions and in conjunction with
the logistics steering committee,
established early 2007, focused on
improving efficiency and achieving
cost savings. The focus during the
second half of 2007 was directed
towards the opportunity to further
reduce the cost base afforded by
withdrawal from MoD supply. The
responsibility for the further
development of our IT infrastructure
has now been handed to Steve
McKeever, our newly appointed Chief
Information Officer.
• Health and safety
Health and safety risk assessment had
previously been conducted by
internal resource. The Board
considered that, in order to maintain
the integrity of these assessments, an
independent review should be
undertaken. This review, which
concentrated on the main
warehouses, was completed in
October and presented to the Board
and senior management, as part of a
health and safety training
programme. Although no major
exposure was unveiled, a number of
improvements were identified and
the Operations Director was given
responsibility for implementing
these. An independent third party
has since been appointed to extend
risk assessment and audit to other
areas of the business during 2008.
In December 2007, the Audit
Committee reviewed the results of
these initiatives and were satisfied
that the proactive approach taken in
identifying risk and resolving control
issues had resulted in many positive
outcomes, not least the forecast that
the full year financial results would be
in line with expectations. As a
consequence, the Audit Committee
were of the opinion that there is
currently no need for an internal
audit function.

Audit Committee Report continued
• Review of whistle-blowing policy
No concerns were reported in the
year and following a review of the
policy, the committee did not
consider that any changes were
necessary. The policy is available on
the Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk).
Independence of external
auditors
The Audit Committee monitors the
independence and objectivity of the
external auditors by keeping under
review the relationship between the
Group and the external auditors and
ensuring Group policy is followed in
relation to the provision of non-audit
services.
The committee meets with the
external auditors to review and
approve audit scope and fees and
obtain written confirmation of their
independence. Following the audit,
the committee meets with the
external auditors without the
executive directors being present
and also discusses the efficiency of
the audit process with the
executive directors.
Company policy on the provision of
non-audit services requires that,
other than for corporate taxation
services, approval is sought from the
Audit Committee in advance of any
engagement. The Audit Committee
will consider, taking into account the
scope of the work and level of fees
involved, whether the provision of
such non-audit services impairs the
independence and objectivity of the
external auditors.

Remuneration Committee and
its terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee is a
sub-committee of the Board and
membership was previously confined
to non-executive Directors who are
independent of management and
free from any business or other
relationship which could interfere
with the exercise of their
independent judgement. During the
year, following a change in the
Combined Code and upon
relinquishing his temporary role as
Executive Chairman, David Callear
became a member of the committee.
The Chairman of the Remuneration
Committee is Jim Cohen. When
necessary, non-committee members
are invited to attend by prior
arrangement. The committee met
five times in the year.
The principal function of the
committee is to make
recommendations to the Board
regarding the Company’s policy on
the remuneration, benefits and terms
of employment of the executive
Directors and the Chairman of the
Company. In addition, the committee
assists the Board in ensuring that the
Group’s executive management are
recruited, developed and
remunerated in an appropriate
fashion. In determining remuneration
packages and policies, due regard is
given to any legal requirements, the
provisions of the Combined Code
(2006), the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002. During the year,
the committee met to discuss
aligning the incentive arrangements
of senior management for 2008.
Following on from this, we consulted
with the major shareholders, the
Association of British Insurers (ABI)
and the Research, Recommendations
and Electronic Voting agency (RREV),
as detailed below. The Committee
uses New Bridge Street Consultants
LLP and Macfarlanes as its
professional advisers on executive
remuneration and employee share
schemes.
The terms of reference of the
committee are available on the
Company’s website
(www.office2office.co.uk). 
Executive Directors’
remuneration
Remuneration policy in respect of
executive Directors is designed to
ensure that the Group achieves its
potential and increases shareholder
value. In respect of basic salary, the
objective is to ensure that the Group
retains and attracts high calibre
executives with the skills, experience
and motivation necessary to direct
and manage the affairs of the Group.
Annual bonuses and long term
incentive schemes are seen as an
important part of each Director’s
total remuneration and are designed
to drive and reward exceptional
performance.
The current remuneration package of
the executive Directors consists of
basic salary, annual bonus, long term
incentive schemes, taxable benefits,
SAYE option schemes and pension
arrangements. These are described in
more detail below.
The executive Directors’ basic salaries
are reviewed annually by the
committee, taking into account the
performance of the individual,
changes in their responsibilities, the
Group’s performance against financial
objectives and, when deemed
appropriate, information from
independent remuneration
consultants’ sources on levels of
salary for similar jobs.
The annual cash bonus scheme for
executive Directors in 2007 was
based on earnings per share
performance against the prior year
and individual personal objectives,
with payment dependent upon the
achievement of pre-agreed targets
and up to a maximum of 60% of
basic salary for exceptional
performance. The actual growth in
earnings per share in 2007 was below
these targets. However, Simon Moate
and Mark Cunningham have each
been awarded a bonus to recognise
their performance in the
restructuring activity. Each year the
committee reviews the arrangements
and may recommend different
targets or performance conditions to
keep the objectives aligned with
shareholder interests. Its current view
is that growth in earnings per share
will provide the best measure for the
target. 
Pension contributions of up to 10%
of basic salary were made to the
personal pension schemes of the
current executive Directors. 
Simon Moate’s service agreement,
dated 8 May 2007 with an effective
appointment date of 30 July 2007, is
terminable on 12 month’s notice by
either party, with the right for the
Company to make a payment in lieu
of salary and benefits, excluding
bonus, for any unexpired period of
notice. It also contains a change of
control clause which removes his
obligation to mitigate following a
change of control of the Company in
the first twelve months of
employment. This clause is valid until
29 July 2008.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’Remuneration
Report Regulations 2002. It outlines the membership and workings of the
Remuneration Committee, together with details of Directors’remuneration in
respect of the year ended 31 December 2007. In accordance with the
Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the
forthcoming AGM.
Directors’ Remuneration Report o2o plc Annual Report 2007

Mark Cunningham’s service
agreement of 23 June 2004 was
amended with effect from 1 January
2008 to reflect a 12 month notice
period by either party, with the right
for the Company to make a payment
in lieu of salary and benefits,
excluding bonus, for any unexpired
period of notice. His other terms and
conditions of employment are
unchanged.
Following his resignation on
1 February 2007 and in accordance
with his service agreement, Ray Peck
received 6 month’s payment of salary
and benefits in lieu of notice. Pension
contributions of 15% of basic salary
were paid over this period. A
payment of £30,000 for loss of office
was also made. Details are provided
on page 26.
Save As You Earn share option
scheme (SAYE)
The Group operates an Inland
Revenue approved SAYE scheme
open to all employees and in which
Mark Cunningham currently
participates. Since joining o2o in
July 2007, Simon Moate has not had
the opportunity to participate in the
scheme. Details are provided on
page 27.
Long term incentive plans
The Company currently operates a
long term incentive plan, the
Performance Share Plan (PSP), as
detailed below. The Company also
has a Deferred Share Bonus Plan
(DSBP) which has been inactive since
inception. Both these plans were
approved by shareholders in
November 2005 following a review
by an independent adviser and
consultation with shareholders and
the ABI. In line with ABI guidelines,
awards granted under this plan are
subject to dilution limits. 
Performance Share Plan
The PSP rules allow awards over
shares, subject to performance
criteria as detailed below and vesting
in three years, to be made to
individuals in any year of a value of
up to 100% of basic salary. In
exceptional circumstances the
Remuneration Committee has
discretion to increase the award to
up to 200% of basic salary. In
accordance with the scheme rules,
the number of shares awarded are
calculated by reference to the three
day average of the closing mid-
market quotation of the Company’s
share price prior to the award date.
The exercise price of options under
the PSP scheme is 0.1p per share.
Mark Cunningham currently holds
awards over 38,011 shares following
grants made in December 2005 and
April 2006, based on an average
share price of 256.0p and 247.67p
respectively. In September 2007,
Simon Moate was granted an award
over 232,907 shares (0.64% of the
issued Ordinary share capital) based
on an average share price of 189.0p,
representing 200% of his basic salary.
Further details of the awards are
given on page 27 and in note 25 to
the financial statements.
The PSP will reward participants by
reference to performance criteria
based, in equal proportion, on (i) a
comparative measure of total
shareholder return (TSR) against the
companies in the FTSE Small Cap
Index and (ii) the Company’s earnings
per share (EPS) growth. The
combined use of TSR and EPS targets
is intended to incentivise participants
to deliver substantial real earnings
growth in addition to generating
above market returns for
shareholders. 
The portion of any award based on
TSR will, other than as discussed
below, vest 25% for median
performance, with full vesting at the
upper quartile level (and the
proportion vesting increasing on a
straight-line basis between these
points). TSR will be measured over a
three year performance period.
The balance of the award will be
based on the Company’s EPS growth.
Other than as discussed below, this
part of the award will vest 25% if EPS
grows by an average of 4% per
annum more than the increase in RPI
over a three year performance
period. If EPS grows by an average of
15% per annum more than the
increase in RPI over the period, this
portion of the award will vest in full.
For EPS growth between these levels,
the proportion vesting will increase
on a straight-line basis. EPS growth
will be measured over a three year
period. 
The PSP award granted to Simon
Moate on joining the Company is
subject to EPS and TSR performance
conditions. That portion based on
TSR will vest 40% for median
performance with full vesting at the
upper quartile. That portion based on
EPS will vest 50% if EPS grows by an
average of 4% per annum more than
the increase in RPI over a three year
performance period. If EPS grows by
an average of 8% per annum more
than the increase in RPI over the
same period, this portion of the
award will vest in full. 
In November 2007, we wrote to the
major institutional investors setting
out the plans for the 2008 PSP
awards. The intention is to provide a
common incentive to the whole of
the new management team which
will have common goals and a
shared responsibility in driving the
Company forward. This will increase
participation in the PSP , but this is
balanced by continuing to hold the
DSBP inactive at least through 2008.
Having taken into account the views
of major   and having advised the ABI
and RREV, the performance targets
will continue to be split 50:50 EPS
and TSR. The EPS element will reflect
those targets applied to Simon
Moate’s 2007 award, as detailed
above, and the TSR element will
remain as before with 25% vesting at
median and full vesting at the upper
quartile.
In the event of a takeover, all awards
granted under the PSP , vest or
become exercisable to the extent
that the performance targets have
been achieved, as determined by the
Remuneration Committee. In the
event of a re-organisation the awards
may be exchanged for options over
shares in the new holding company
on such terms determined by the
committee.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 24
Chairman and non-executive
Directors
The Chairman’s and non-executive
Directors’ service agreements were
renewed during the year following
the expiry of their initial three year
term. The agreements are for a
further three years ending on 
28 June 2010 and are terminable on
three months’ notice by either the
Company or the relevant Director.
The Chairman’s and non-executive
Directors’ remuneration is non-
pensionable. 
The remuneration of the non-
executive Directors is determined by
the Board to reflect the time
commitment and responsibilities of
the role. In 2007, the non-executive
Directors’ remuneration included fees,
for additional services provided.
The remuneration of the Chairman is
determined by the Remuneration
Committee. During his time as
Executive Chairman, David Callear’s
basic salary was increased to reflect
the increased time commitment and
responsibilities. 
The Chairman and non-executive
Directors are not eligible to
participate in any of the Company’s
share option or Group bonus
schemes.

Report of the Independent Auditors
We have audited the Group and
parent Company financial statements
(the ‘‘financial statements’’) of
office2office plc for the year ended
31 December 2007 which comprise
the consolidated income statement,
the consolidated and parent
company balance sheets, the
consolidated and parent company
statements of changes in equity, the
consolidated and parent company
cash flow statements and the related
notes. These financial statements
have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
that is described as having been
audited.
Respective responsibilities of
Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and
the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the
Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and
only for the Company’s members as
a body in accordance with Section
235 of the Companies Act 1985 and
for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the financial statements give
a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and, as regards
the Group financial statements,
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We
also report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with
the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific
information presented in the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review and the Financial
Review that is cross referred from the
Business Review section of the
Directors’ Report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our
opinion, the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance Statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the Combined Code
(2006) specified for our review by the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained
in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. The
other information comprises only the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, the Financial
Review, the Corporate Social
Responsibility Statement, the
Directors’ Report, the Corporate
Governance Statement, the
Nomination Committee Report, the
Audit Committee Report and the
unaudited part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report. We consider
the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent mis-
statements or material
inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It
also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to
the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit
so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material mis-
statement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited.

Principal Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007
The principal accounting policies
adopted in the preparation of these
financial statements are set out
below.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies
applied in the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements are
set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the
years presented, unless otherwise
stated.
The consolidated financial statements
of office2office plc have been
prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by
the EU), IFRIC interpretations and the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to
companies reporting under IFRS. The
consolidated financial statements
have been prepared under the
historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with IFRS
requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires
management to exercise its
judgement in the process of applying
the Group’s accounting policies. The
areas involving a higher degree of
judgement or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the consolidated
financial statements, are disclosed in
note 2.
Standards, amendments and
interpretations effective in 2007
•
IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ , requires
consideration of transactions
involving the issuance of equity
instruments, where the identifiable
consideration received is less than
the fair value of the equity
instruments issued in order to
establish whether or not they fall
within the scope of IFRS 2. This
standard does not have any
impact on the Group or
Company's financial statements. 
•
IFRIC 11, ‘IFRS 2 – Group and
Treasury Share Transactions’ . IFRIC
11 provides guidance on whether
share-based transactions involving
treasury shares or involving group
entities (for example, options over
a parent's shares) should be
accounted for as equity-settled or
cash-settled share-based payment
transactions in the stand-alone
accounts of the parent and group
companies. This interpretation
does not have an impact on the
Group or Company's financial
statements.
•
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments:
Disclosures’ , and the
complementary amendment to
IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial
statements – Capital disclosures’ ,
introduces new disclosures
relating to financial instruments
and does not have any impact on
the classification and valuation of
the Group or Company’s financial
instruments, or the disclosures
relating to taxation and trade and
other payables.
Standards and interpretations to
existing standards that are not yet
effective and have not been early
adopted
The following standards and
interpretations to existing standards
have been published that are
mandatory for the Group’s accounting
periods beginning on or after 1
January 2008 or later periods, but
which the Group has not early
adopted:
•
IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a
defined benefit asset, minimum
funding requirements and their
interaction’ (effective from 1
January 2008). IFRIC 14 provides
guidance on assessing the limit
in IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ on
the amount of the defined
benefit plan surplus that can be
recognised as an asset. It also
explains how the pension asset
or liability may be affected by a
statutory or contractual
minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14
from 1 January 2008, but it is not
expected to have any impact on
the Group or Company's
financial statements. 
•
IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’ . This
standard is effective for
accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2009 and
introduces new rules on the
disclosure of operating results by
business segment. The new
standard requires a "management
approach", under which segment
information is presented on the
same basis as that used for
internal reporting procedures. The
Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1
January 2009. The resultant impact
is still being assessed by
management, but it is not
expected, based upon the present
operations of the Group, that
there will be any significant
impact.
•
IAS 23, ‘Borrowing costs’ as revised.
This standard is effective for
accounting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2009. The main
change from the previous version
is the removal of the option of
immediately recognising as an
expense borrowing costs that
relate to assets that take a
substantial period of time to get
ready for use or sale. The impact of
IAS 23 is dependent upon the
extent of qualifying expenditure
from 1 July 2009 onwards and
hence cannot be quantified at the
moment.
•
IFRS 3, ‘Business combinations’ as
revised. This standard is applicable
to business combinations
occurring in accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
This standard continues to apply
the acquisition method to
business combinations, with some
significant changes. For example,
all payments to purchase a
business are to be recorded at fair
value at the acquisition date, with
some contingent payments
subsequently re-measured at fair
value through income. Goodwill
may be calculated based on the
parent’s share of net assets or it
may include goodwill related to
the minority interest. All
transaction costs will be expensed. 
Standards and interpretations to
existing standards that are not yet
effective and not relevant for the
Group’s operations
The following interpretations to
existing standards have been
published that are mandatory for the
Group’s accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2008
or later periods, but are not relevant o2o plc Annual Report 2007
35
for the Group’s operations:
•
IFRIC 10, ‘Interim financial
reporting and impairment’,
prohibits the impairment losses
recognised in an interim period
on goodwill and investments in
equity instruments and in
financial assets carried at cost to
be reversed at a subsequent
balance sheet date. This standard
does not currently have any
impact on the Group or
Company's financial statements.
•
IFRIC 12, ‘Service Concession
Arrangements’ . IFRIC 12 applies to
contractual arrangements
whereby a private sector operator
participates in the development,
financing, operation and
maintenance of infrastructure for
public sector services, for example,
under PFI contracts. This is not
relevant to the Group as it does
not enter into such contracts.
•
IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty
programmes’ . IFRIC 13 clarifies that
where goods or services are sold
together with a customer loyalty
incentive (for example, loyalty
points or free products), the
arrangement is a multiple-element
arrangement and the
consideration receivable from the
customer should be allocated
between the components of the
arrangement in proportion to their
fair values. This is not relevant to
the Group as it does not operate,
or have plans to operate, any such
loyalty schemes.
•
IAS 27, ‘Consolidated and separate
financial statements’ as revised.
This standard requires the effects
of all transactions with non-
controlling (minority) interests to
be recorded in equity if there is no
change in control. They will no
longer result in goodwill or gains
and losses. This standard also
specifies the accounting when
control is lost. Any remaining
interest in the entity is re-
measured to fair value and a gain
or loss is recognised in profit or
loss. This is not relevant to the
Group as it does not currently
have any non-controlling interests.
Changes in accounting policy -
exceptional and non-recurring
costs
During the period, the Group has
adopted an accounting policy in
respect of the classification of
exceptional and non-recurring costs.
The comparative figures have
therefore been restated accordingly.
The effect of this change in
accounting policy was that
£2,333,000 (2006: £392,000) of
administrative expenses were
classified as ‘exceptional and non-
recurring costs’ and presented
separately on the face of the income
statement. There is no effect on profit
or net assets for the period
presented, the only effect being to
restate the comparative amounts on
a comparable basis. 
Exceptional and non-recurring costs
are those significant items which are
separately disclosed by virtue of their
size or incidence to enable a full
understanding of the Group’s
financial performance. Transactions
which may give rise to exceptional
and non-recurring costs are
principally restructuring related costs
and costs in respect of key
management changes.
Changes in presentation -
provisions
Property dilapidation provisions on
the termination of leases have been
presented as provisions (non-current
liabilities). Previously they were
included in accrued expenses and
deferred income within trade and
other payables due within one year.
The comparatives in relation to trade
and other payables and provisions
have been restated in order to more
accurately reflect the nature of these
balances.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including
special purpose entities) over which
the Group has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies
generally accompanying a
shareholding of more than one half
of the voting rights. The existence
and effect of potential voting rights
that are currently exercisable or
convertible are considered when
assessing whether the Group
controls another entity. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date
on which control is transferred to the
Group. They are de-consolidated
from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting
is used to account for the acquisition
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost
of an acquisition is measured as the
fair value of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange, plus costs directly
attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination
are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any
minority interest. The excess of the
cost of the acquisition over the fair
value of the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets acquired is
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of
the acquisition is less than the fair
value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the income
statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances
and unrealised gains on transactions
between Group companies are
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also
eliminated but are considered for
impairment purposes in respect of
the asset transferred. Accounting
policies of subsidiaries have been
aligned where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies
adopted by the Group.
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of
sales to external customers, exclusive
of VAT.  Revenue is stated after
deducting rebates, returns, other
similar discounts and after eliminating
sales between Group companies.
Revenue is recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred to a
customer, which occurs on delivery of
goods.
Segment reporting
A business segment is a group of
assets and operations engaged in 
Principal Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 36
Principal Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007
providing products or services that
are subject to risks and returns that
are different from those of other
business segments. A geographical
segment is engaged in providing
products or services within a
particular economic environment that
are subject to risks and returns that
are different from those operating in
other economic environments.
Based on risks and returns the
Directors consider that the primary
reporting format is by business
segment. The Directors consider that
there is only one business segment,
being the supply of office and
business products. Therefore the
disclosures for the primary segment
have already been given in the
financial statements. The secondary
reporting format is by geographical
analysis by origin and destination.
Foreign currency translation
The income and cash flow statements
of Group undertakings expressed in
currencies other than Sterling (which
is determined as the primary
economic currency) are translated at
the average rate of exchange for each
period, which is deemed to
approximate to the actual rate ruling
at the date of transaction. Assets and
liabilities of these undertakings are
translated at the rate of exchange at
the end of each period.
The differences between retained
profits of overseas subsidiaries
translated at average and closing
rates of exchange are taken to
reserves, as are differences arising on
the re-translation to Sterling (using
closing rates of exchange) of
overseas net assets at the beginning
of the period.
Foreign currency transactions are
initially recorded at the exchange
rate ruling at the date of the
transaction. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and
from the translation at period end
rates of exchange are recognised in
the income statement.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is
capitalised and is subject to annual
impairment review. Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition of a subsidiary over the
Group’s share of the fair value of
identifiable net assets acquired (at
the date of acquisition).
Goodwill acquired up to 31
December 2003 was capitalised and
amortised over its useful economic
life. As permitted by IFRS1, 'First-time
Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards', the
classification and accounting
treatment of business combinations
made prior to 1 January 2004 has not
been amended on transition to IFRS.
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets, such as
contractual customer arrangements,
are measured initially at fair value and
are amortised on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of assets
Assets that are subject to
amortisation or depreciation are
reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An
impairment loss is recognised in the
income statement for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable amount. For
the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at
the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows
(cash-generating units).
The recoverable amount is the higher
of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset.
In respect of assets other than
goodwill, an impairment loss is
reversed if there has been a change
in the estimates used to determine
the recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is reversed only to
the extent that the asset’s carrying
amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have
been determined, net of depreciation
or amortisation, if no impairment loss
had been recognised. Impairment
losses in respect of goodwill are not
reversed.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is
stated at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
Historical costs include expenditure
that is directly attributable to the
acquisition of the items. The assets’
residual values and useful lives are
reviewed annually for impairment,
and adjusted as appropriate.
Depreciation commences in the
month that the assets are fully
installed and commissioned and is
provided on a straight-line basis at
rates calculated to write off the cost,
less estimated residual value, of each
asset over its expected useful life, as
follows:
Short leasehold land and buildings 
– over the lease term
Plant and machinery 
– over 4 to 15 years
Office equipment 
– over 3 to 10 years
Investments
In the Company’s financial
statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings are initially stated at
cost. Provision is made for any
permanent diminution in the value of
these investments.
Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases, as
defined under IAS 17, ‘Leases’ , are
capitalised and included as part of
property, plant and equipment. They
are depreciated over their useful lives
or the lease term (if shorter). The
capital elements of future obligations
under finance leases are included as
liabilities in the balance sheet. The
interest element of the rental
obligations is charged to the income
statement over the period of the
lease and represents a constant
proportion of the balance of capital
repayments outstanding. Leases in
which a significant proportion of the
risks and rewards of ownership are
retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Rentals payable
under operating leases are charged
to the income statement on a o2o plc Annual Report 2007
37
Principal Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007
straight-line basis over the term of
the lease.
Inventories
Inventories comprise goods held for
resale and are stated at the lower of
cost or net realisable value. Cost
includes all expenditure directly
attributable to bringing each product
to its present location and condition
on a first in first out method. Net
realisable value is based on estimated
selling price less further costs
expected to be incurred to
completion and disposal.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise
cash in hand and deposits with banks
that have a maturity of three months
or less from the date of inception.
Provisions
Provisions for dilapidations represent
the current estimated costs to repair
leased properties which are required
to be made good before the
properties are returned at the end of
the leases. Provision is made on a
property by property basis and the
timing of the utilisation will differ for
each property.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group maintains a defined
benefit pension scheme for former
employees of Her Majesty’s
Stationery Office, which requires
contributions to be made to a
separately administered fund. The
scheme currently has 165 members
and is closed to new members. The
scheme is administered by trustee
Directors of Banner Business Supplies
(Pensions) Ltd, which is a wholly
owned subsidiary of office2office
(UK) plc, a subsidiary company of
office2office plc.
The net surplus or deficit of the
defined benefit pension scheme is
calculated in accordance with IAS 19,
‘Employee Benefits’ , based on the fair
value of the plan assets less the
present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is
calculated annually by independent
actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of
defined benefit obligations is
determined by discounting the
estimated future cash outflows using
interest rates of high-quality
corporate bonds that are determined
in the currency in which the benefits
will be paid, and have terms to
maturity approximating to the terms
of the related pension liability.
The Group has, in respect of IAS19
and IFRS1, adopted the corridor
approach to account for its pension
scheme liability. As a result, all
cumulative actuarial gains and losses
at the date of transition to IFRS (1
January 2004) have been taken
directly to reserves. In respect of
actuarial gains and losses that arise
subsequent to that date, to the
extent that, cumulatively, they
exceed 10 per cent of the greater of
the present value of the defined
benefit obligation and the fair value
of the plan assets, that portion is
recognised in the income statement
over the expected average remaining
working lives of the employees
participating in the plan. Otherwise,
the accumulated actuarial gains and
losses are not recognised.
Where the actuarial valuation of the
scheme demonstrates that the
scheme is in surplus, the recognised
asset is limited to that for which the
Group can benefit in future, for
example, by refunds or a reduction in
contributions.
The cost charged to administrative
expenses in the income statement
consists of current service cost,
interest cost, expected return on plan
assets, past service cost and the
impact of any settlements or
curtailments, as well as actuarial
gains or losses to the extent that they
are recognised.
Since 30 September 1996, all new
employees have been eligible to join
the Group's personal pension
scheme, which is a defined
contribution scheme. Contributions
to defined contribution
arrangements are charged to the
income statement in the period in
which they fall due.
A valuation is performed annually by
an independent actuary. Further
details in respect of the assumptions
used in providing the valuation are
included in note 23.
Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of
share based compensation schemes
including a SAYE scheme which is
open to all employees. The fair value
of the employee services received in
exchange for the grant of options
(approximated by reference to the
fair value of the option granted) is
recognised as an expense. The fair
value of the option is measured at
grant date and spread over the
vesting period through the income
statement with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value of
the share options and awards are
measured using an option-pricing
model taking into account the terms
and conditions of the individual
schemes. The fair value of options
awarded under schemes with market
based performance conditions is
estimated using a Monte-Carlo
model. The fair value of options
awarded under schemes with non-
market based performance
conditions is estimated using a Black-
Scholes model.
Shares purchased through the
employee benefit trust (EBT) are held
at cost and treated as Treasury Shares
and are deducted from shareholders’
equity. The right to a dividend on
these shares has been waived. 
The Group makes charges to the
income statement for any potential
employer’s national insurance liability
on options granted, based on the
Company’s best estimate of the fair
value of the options granted at the
balance sheet date and spread over
the vesting period of the option.
The fair value of the options granted
under the various schemes has been
accounted for in the Group's financial
statements. These amounts are
recharged to Group companies
through the inter-company accounts
in both current and prior years.
At each balance sheet date, the
Group revises it's estimate of the
number of options that are going to
vest. The Group recognises the
impact of any revision to original
estimates, if any, in the income 38
Principal Accounting Policies for the year ended 31 December 2007
statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity. The proceeds
on exercise of options, net of any
directly attributable transaction costs,
are credited to share capital and
share premium.
Current and deferred income tax
The tax charge for the period
comprises both current and deferred
tax. Tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised
in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax
payable on the taxable income for the
period and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous periods.  
Deferred tax is provided in full using
the balance sheet liability method on
temporary differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying value for accounting
purposes.  
Deferred tax is determined on a non-
discounted basis using tax rates (and
laws) that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance
sheet date and are expected to apply
when the related deferred tax asset is
realised or deferred tax liability is
settled. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary
differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries, except where the timing
of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the Group
and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.
Where the intrinsic value of a share
option exceeds the fair value, the
corresponding deferred tax on the
excess is recognised directly in equity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only
to the extent that it is probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be
available to utilise the temporary
difference.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities
are recognised on the Group's
balance sheet when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
•
Trade receivables: Trade
receivables are recognised initially
at fair value, less provision for
impairment. A provision for
impairment of trade receivables is
established when there is
objective evidence that the Group
will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the
original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of
the debtor, probability that the
debtor will enter bankruptcy or
financial reorganisation and
default or delinquency in
payments (more than 60 days
overdue) are considered indicators
that the trade receivable is
impaired. The amount of the
provision is the difference
between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows. The
carrying amount of the asset is
reduced through the use of an
allowance account and the
amount of the loss is recognised
in the income statement within
cost of sales. When a trade
receivable is uncollectable, it is
written off against the allowance
account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously written off are credited
against administration expenses in
the income statement.
•
Financial liabilities and equity
instruments: Financial liabilities
and equity instruments are
classified according to the
substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An
equity instrument is any contract
that gives a residual interest in the
assets of the Group after deducting
all of its liabilities.
•
Interest-bearing borrowings:
Interest-bearing bank loans and
overdrafts are initially recorded at
the proceeds received, net of
associated transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest-bearing borrowings are stated
at amortised cost with any difference
between cost and redemption value
being recognised in the income
statement over the period of the
borrowings.
•
Trade payables: Trade payables are not
interest-bearing and are stated at their
nominal value, which approximates to
fair value.
•
Equity instruments: Equity instruments
issued by the Company are recorded
at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs. Where any Group company
purchases the Company's equity share
capital (treasury shares), the
consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs
(net of income taxes) is deducted from
equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders until the shares are
cancelled or reissued. Where such
shares are subsequently reissued, any
consideration received, net of any
directly attributable incremental
transaction costs and the related
income tax effects, is included in
equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders. 
Dividends
Distributions to equity holders are
disclosed as a component of the
movement in shareholders' equity. A
liability is recorded for a final dividend
when the dividend is approved by the
Company's shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the period
they are paid. 
Use of non-GAAP profit measures
The Directors believe that the use of
underlying profit before income tax
provides a clearer understanding of the
performance of the Group.
Underlying profit is calculated as follows:
2007 2006
£000 £000
Profit before income tax 9,003 10,345

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2007
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk),
credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
The Group operates in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and, accordingly, has limited exposure to foreign
exchange risk. Currency risk is managed by matching, where possible, cash inflows and outflows denominated in Euros.
At 31 December 2007, if the Euro had weakened/strengthened by 10% against Sterling with all other variables held
constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been £6,000 (2006: £6,000) lower/higher, as a result of foreign exchange
gains/losses on translation of the Euro-denominated trade receivables at fair value through profit or loss.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore interest income is sensitive to
movements in interest rates.
The Group does not have significant borrowings and to the extent it has borrowings, these are subject to fixed rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.  
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and
financial institutions and transactions with third party customers.
The credit ratings above are from Standard and Poor's long-term ratings.
Internally, customers are rated according to financial position, history of trading and other factors. Individual credit
limits are based on internal and external ratings, in accordance with limits set by the Board. The utilisation of credit
limits is regularly monitored.
(c) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of
funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow.
The table below analyses the Group's financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Currency risk profile of financial assets
Financial assets relate to cash balances held at financial institutions. They all carry interest at floating rates based on
money market rates. Financial assets are denominated in the currencies shown below:
Fair values of financial instruments
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term
maturity of the instruments. In respect of finance lease liabilities, the Directors consider the difference between book
value and fair value to be immaterial.
Currency exposure and hedges
The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2007 and has not used any instruments to hedge
foreign currency transactions.
Embedded derivatives
Management have undertaken a review of the Group for embedded derivatives and none were found (2006: nil).
Capital risk management
The group does not anticipate any significant future capital expenditure.

Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2007
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and
are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning
the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any
impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy. The
recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been
determined based on value-in-use calculations. These
calculations require the use of estimates (see Note 13).
Income tax
The Group is subject to income tax in both the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Significant
judgement is required in determining the provision for
income tax. There are many transactions and calculations
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain
during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the
income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made (see Note 9).
Assets and liabilities
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis of making judgements about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
Impairment of inventories
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving
and damaged stock. This provision represents the difference
between the cost of the stock and its estimated market value,
based upon stock turn rates, market conditions and trends in
consumer demand (see Note 16).
Allowances for doubtful receivables
Allowances are made for doubtful receivables for estimated
losses resulting from the subsequent inability of customers to
make required payments. If the financial conditions of
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required in future periods (see Note 17).
Pensions
The determination of the pension benefit obligation and
expense for the defined benefit pension plan is dependent on
the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in
calculating such amounts. Those assumptions are described in
note 23 to the financial statements and include, among
others, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of
increase in future compensation levels and expected mortality
rates. A portion of the plan assets are invested in equity
securities. The equity markets have experienced volatility,
which has affected the value of the pension plan assets. This
volatility may make it difficult to estimate the long-term rate
of return on plan assets. Assumptions are based on actual
historical experience and external data regarding
compensation and discount rate trends. While the Directors
believe that the assumptions are to be appropriate, significant
differences in the actual experience or significant changes in
the assumptions may materially affect the pension obligation
and the future expense (see Note 23).
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current
and future periods.
Revenue and profit before tax by geographical area is stated by origin, which is not materially different from the
analysis by destination. Of the capital expenditure of £184,000 (2006: £1,205,000), £184,000 was incurred in the United
Kingdom (2006: £1,093,000).

11. Earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted
average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding Ordinary shares held by the employee benefit
trust.
2007 2006
Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company (£000) 6,270 7,196
Weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue (thousands) 35,975 35,706
Basic earnings per share (pence per share) 17.4 20.2
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding to
assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The Company has one category of dilutive potential Ordinary
shares, being share options. For share options, a calculation is undertaken to determine the number of shares that could
have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company's shares) based
on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares
calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the
share options.

In accordance with IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’ , the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its goodwill. A review
was undertaken at 31 December 2007 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present
value of pre-tax cash flow projections for a five year period. The calculation was based on financial budgets approved by
the Board covering a one year period. Cash flows beyond the one year period are extrapolated beyond one year based on
estimated long term average growth rates (generally 3%). The assumed growth rate does not exceed the long-term
average growth rate for the market in which the Group operates.
The discount rates for the review were based on a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital percentage of 10.4% which
approximates to the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
The impairment review was undertaken by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the recoverable amount of the
cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. Management concluded that no impairment was necessary.
Additions in the year relate to finalising the fair value review of assets and liabilities acquired as a result of Alpha Office
Limited on 3 July 2006.
Other intangibles relate to acquired customer contracts.

All of the above amounts are due within one year.
There is no difference between the amounts disclosed above and their fair values.
Credit risk in respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s customers base being large and public sector
dominated.  As a result, the Directors consider that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal
provision for doubtful receivables.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in “cost of sales’’ in the income
statement.  Amounts charged to the provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering
additional cash. The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets. The maximum
exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The
Group does not hold any collateral as security.

23. Retirement benefit liability
Group
The Group is the contributing employer to a defined benefit pension scheme, The Banner Business Supplies Pension
Scheme (BBS scheme), all the members of which were formerly employed by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office and were
members of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme who first elected to transfer funds accrued to The Stationery
Office Ltd Scheme and subsequently elected to transfer funds accrued to the BBS scheme. 
The BBS scheme commenced on 1 August 2000 when the funds were transferred in by The Stationery Office Ltd. The
scheme is funded by the payment of contributions to a separately administered trust fund.  The scheme currently has
165 members and is closed to new members.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out on 31 July 2004 and updated to 31 December 2007 by Mercer LLC, a
qualified independent actuary.  The pension costs have been determined on the basis of the results of this valuation.  It
was assumed that the investment return would be 7.0% per annum, that salary increases would average 3.2% per
annum and that present and future pensions would increase at the rate of 3.2% per annum.  
The fair value of the BBS scheme assets at 31 December 2007 amounted to £8,542,000. The actuarial value of the assets
of the scheme was sufficient to cover 82% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected
future increases in earnings.
Group contributions in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme for the period were £341,000 (2006: £344,000).
Group contributions in 2008 are expected to be approximately £340,000.
The Group also incurred £693,000 (2006: £454,000) in respect of group personal pension arrangements and employees’
own personal pension arrangements for staff recruited by The Stationery Office Ltd and Group companies since 30
September 1996 at rates varying between 6% and 15% of pensionable earnings.
The outstanding accrual in respect of pension contributions at 31 December 2007 was £463,000 (2006: £450,000).

options, based on a comparative measure of total shareholder return against the companies in the FTSE Small Cap
Index, and the Company’s earnings per share growth.
The SAYE scheme was first introduced on October 2004 and a second invitation was made in 2005.  The exercise price
was at 20% discount of the closing mid-market price on date of invitation for both years. The schemes have either a
three or five year vesting period.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the market price at the date of grant which has been discounted to
reflect the benefit granted to the employee.
On 11 September 2007, Simon Moate was granted an award over 232,907 shares based on an average share price of
189.0p, under the Performance Share Plan.  On 19 December 2007, an award of 189,566 shares based on an average
share price of 121.3p was made to a member of the senior management team, under the Performance Share Plan. 
In addition to the above £71,000 of IFRS 2 charges and £17,000 of national insurance costs have been accrued in respect
of a management bonus award to senior managers, under the Performance Share Plan, which the Company is
committed to granting in April 2008, based on the average share price over the three days preceding the grant. The following valuation assumptions have been applied:

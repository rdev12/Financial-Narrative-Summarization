BETonSPORTS plc
Statistical information This is my first annual report to shareholders since BETonSPORTS plc became a public limited
company. I welcome the many new shareholders who supported our flotation as well as those who
have acquired shares in the market subsequently.
Your company was successfully admitted to AIM on 15th July 2004, raising some $44m net of
expenses. Much has happened since then. The issues that faced the entire USA sports betting
industry in November 2004 (NFL results against the long term trend and unexpected advertising
restrictions) provided a significant challenge for the management team. However, acting
immediately we undertook a stringent review of procedures, people and marketing avenues. We
are confident that these management actions will make BETonSPORTS a stronger company going
forward.
As expected, the results for the full year were affected adversely by these trading problems.
Margins recovered in the final weeks of the year and profit before tax was $13.3m (2004 -$27.0m).
The Chief Executive’s Review on pages 7 to 14 contains a full commentary on the results.
At flotation we raised $44m to fund our planned expansion. Our strategy and objectives were, and
remain to grow the BETonSPORTS business through a mixture of organic growth including product
development (e.g. poker), regional expansion in Central, South America and Asia and well planned
acquisitions of profitable businesses providing greater geographical spread for our activities. 
I am pleased to report that good progress has been achieved organically: BOS Poker was
launched successfully in October 2004 (and earned $0.7m in the period). Our proof of concept
operation in Guatemala, launched in December 2004, is performing satisfactorily and has given us
valuable insight into the issues arising from land based terminals. In Mexico, our partnership with
a regional bingo operator established in March 2005 is already showing strong signs of excellent
future potential.
Our acquisition programme is also beginning to take shape. As envisaged at flotation we
completed our acquisition (for $25.0m) of the 49% balance of the Millennium companies which
BETonSPORTS did not already own. The integration of this business with our main operation is
proceeding well. We continue to review strategically beneficial potential acquisitions. 
The key requirement is to find acquisitions which are compatible with our core business, profit
enhancing, risk reducing and which offer opportunities for cross selling and synergies.
Our business is focused on providing an entertainment experience to our customers. We strive to
offer an exciting and pleasurable experience to the recreational gambler, whether that individual is
interested in sportsbooks, on-line casino games, poker or proposition betting. With an average bet
size of $109 ($72 over the Internet and $201 by telephone) it is clear that most of our customers
meet this description. Such customers are important to us and we direct considerable effort to
retaining them and improving their enjoyment. To help with this process we are undertaking major
enhancements to our technology platform to improve both the playing experience and our
customer relationship management (CRM) procedures.
We believe in promoting ethical and responsible gaming and have campaigned actively for
regulation in the sector. We believe legislation would make it easier to protect the consumer,
prevent crime and deliver valuable economic stimulus to the legislating territories. At the same time
we support many help organisations and charities such as Gamcare based in the UK and 800.org
based in New Jersey, USA. Our own procedures for risk management include rigorous controls to
prevent abuse, money laundering, under age gaming, etc.

BETonSPORTS plc
Chairman’s statement The BETonSPORTS business depends on the goodwill and support of its outstanding team of
people. I take this opportunity to thank them all for their dedication and I look forward to working
with them in the future as the business develops for the combined benefit of both shareholders and
staff. The employee benefit trust and share option schemes have been created to reward loyalty,
commitment and success, and effective use has been made of them already.
We are in an exciting and growing market. We continue to strengthen our management team. The
high profile board appointments of Clive Archer, as Operations and Marketing Director, who will be
responsible for directing day to day activities, and Richard Creed, Commercial Director whose role
will be to assess new business and commercial opportunities are part of this ongoing process.
I am also pleased to welcome Christopher Callaway to the Board as an additional Non-Executive
Director with effect from 24 May 2005.
We are extending our core business into new territories, expanding into new geographical areas,
developing new products and improving our technology for the benefit of our customers. The
opportunities are outstanding and your Board is very confident about the future business and
profitability of BETonSPORTS.

BETonSPORTS plc
Chairman’s statement Overview
The gaming industry continues to move ever more rapidly, embracing the continually increasing
power of the Internet and technology. New ideas, products and methods of sports betting and
gaming arise regularly. Faced with such rapid change the retention of traditional risk management
processes has never been more vital. 
Several countries around the world are striving to put in place regulatory legislation and methods
of taxing and monitoring e-gaming activities. On behalf of your company, I have been involved in
campaigns to encourage governments to regulate the industry and participated actively in the “right
to wager” initiatives in the USA.
I am pleased that we are at the heart of this industry and well placed to assess and take advantage
of the most appropriate opportunities.
A recent significant prediction in Forbes.com stated that “over the next five years, as the gaming
generation ages into its 30s and 40s, expect revenues from traditional online entertainment (such
as games, gambling etc) to exceed those from offline entertainment (like movies, books and
casinos).”
This statement may sound like the heady dot.com days, but the difference is that the e-gaming
financial model is already secure. Furthermore your Group is experienced and well positioned,
following the flotation on AIM, to develop both organically and through acquisition.
Dynamics of the business
Our core dynamics are 
• An established brand reputation;
• Multiple integrated betting platforms, internet, telephone and retail;
• Strong risk management and controls;
• Customer centric service;
• Innovative;
• Proven marketing channels;
• Scaleable and robust IT automated systems; 
• Reliable cash flows.
Business review 
General
As reported to shareholders in November 2004 the results for the year under review were affected
adversely by an unusual run of NFL results and difficulties experienced in placing advertisements
for new customers.
The removal of certain advertising avenues, particularly in radio at the busiest period for acquiring
new customers (during the early part of the NFL season in September), was the major contributory
7
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review factor to the reduction in new customer acquisitions. Acting immediately we decided not to spend
on unproven advertising avenues and consequently reduced our actual spend to $10.6m (2004
-$15.8m) against a forecast of $21.0m. We have now revised our advertising strategies and
developed new alternative advertising mediums which are more focused on the Internet. Early
performance indicators from our revised strategies are encouraging. 
The gross margin in the sportsbook was 5.4% (2004 -6.4 %) and was particularly hit by the
extraordinary run of wins in the regular NFL football season by:
• The New England Patriots (won 14 lost 2), and they also won the Super Bowl;
• Pittsburgh Steelers (won 15 lost 1); and
• Philadelphia Eagles (won 13 lost 3). 
In the 2003/4 season, only the New England Patriots achieved a comparable record.
Sportsbook
During the year, 71,750 (2004 -87,909) customers used our services placing 9.9m bets (2004
-11.5m) with an average bet size of $109 (2004 -$107), generating a monetary volume of
$1,090.3m (2004 -$1,241.8m).
The two main brands, BETonSPORTS and Millennium, together accounted for 81.3% (2004
-77.6%) of the total volume. 
Source: Company information
American football represented 39% (2004 -41%), basketball 36% (2004 -34%) and baseball 22%
(2004 -19%) of total volume. The lock out by owners of ice hockey teams resulted in the season
being cancelled and a loss of $25m in volume or about 2% of annual volume.
We continue to offer a dual betting platform, which allows our customers to place bets on the
phone or through the Internet. We believe strongly that the choice is important and telephone
contact improves our customer retention. Additionally it provides an extra level of control over bets
taken as well as flexibility. In the year, the number of bets placed using the telephone was 2.9m

Chief executive’s review (2004 -3.1m) and using the Internet was 7.0m (2004 -8.4m) with an average bet size over the
telephone of $201 (2004 -$205) and through the internet of $72 (2004 -$71). To ensure effective
risk control all sports bets with stakes of over $2,500 must be placed by telephone. 
Customer retention is as important as gaining new customers. It is pleasing to note that over 30%
of our active customers have been with us for over 2 years and we continue to explore methods
of retaining loyalty.
The advertising restrictions severely dented our new customer acquisition plans with 31,557 (2004
-50,506) new customers registering and placing bets in the year. 
Casino
The number of customers who played in our online casino room in the year was 11,225 (2004
comparative not available). They placed 18.4 m (2004 -21.5m) bets at an average size of $18
(2004 -$19), which resulted in a monetary volume of $332.9m (2004 -$410.0m). 
Source: Company information
The number of sportsbook customers has a direct correlation to the number of players in our
casino room, and the lower casino volume reflects the reduction in sportsbook customers in the
year.
Our improved software and the larger variety of games increased our margin from 1.7% to 1.8%,
which provided a monetary gross margin of $5.9m (2004 -$6.8m).
We continue to pursue methods of improving our casino product and are planning an extensive
advertising campaign focusing on cross-selling to our existing and new customers in order to
promote greater participation. 
Poker
Our poker product was introduced into our BETonSPORTS brand on 8th October 2004 and was
subsequently offered to our Millennium customers in early December and our Infinity and
Wagermall brands in December. We decided to use a phased launch programme to offer our

BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review customers a choice but without obtaining revenues at the expense of sportsbook and casino
revenue streams.
The income is generated by charging a commission for hosting games (rake) and from tournament
fees. 
Source: Company information
We attracted 2,867 customers to our online poker and by the end of the year were averaging over
800 playing customers every week. Our volume per hand was approximately $8 with an average
of over 322,306 hands played per week. 
This generated income of $0.7m in the limited period from October 2004 to the year end.
Player liquidity is a key requirement for a poker room and we now have an active room with strong
controls to prevent collusion. 
Poker is currently riding the crest of the popularity wave and we are encouraging player growth,
but we are conscious of the need to continue to offer new and exciting opportunities to our
customers while maintaining our customers’ use of the sportsbook and casino offerings. We plan
to increase the poker offering to all brands within the Group, by the end of first half of 2005/06 and
to continue with a coordinated expansive marketing campaign to promote greater participation of
our poker offering.
Fee income
Our call centres in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic have a capacity of 894 telephone
capture positions. While the majority deal with customer relations, we continue to develop other
business that requires call centre infrastructure and services such as market research and
telemarketing. 
We successfully increased this activity in the year, utilising spare capacity and in house skills to
generate income of $7.0m (2004 -$3.9m)
Marketing
We monitor closely the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns and dedicate
resources to brand awareness, customer retention and customer acquisition.

BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review We employ a mixture of above and below the line techniques. During the year we spent $10.6m
(2004 -$15.8m), despite the difficulties we encountered in placing advertisements.
We also offer customers a range of incentives such as bonuses and free plays, to encourage
participation and stimulate use. These are monitored closely and require customers to bet the
value of bonuses a number of times before being able to withdraw winnings. In the year these
incentives amounted to $9.7m (2004 -$12.0m)
Source: Company information
Our advertising and marketing spend on customer acquisition is broken down into mailings 31.4%
(2004 -26.1%); magazines 19.1% (2004 -32.5%); radio 16.2% (2004 -24.8%); internet 9.5% (2004
-10.8%) and promotions 20.0% (2004 -5.7%) and TV 3.8% (2004 -nil).
The cost of each new customer was $336 (2004 -$313).
Operating costs
The total operating costs, excluding marketing, were contained at $39.7m (2004 -$35.6m) for the
year. Of this total, payroll related costs (including staff dedicated to fee income) amounted to
$19.8m (2004 -$17.1m), telecommunications cost $4.9m (2004 -$3.5m), payment processing
expenses were $4.2m (2004 -$2.3m) and property related costs were $2.0m (2004 -$1.7m).
We continue to explore more efficient working methods, seek more secure money processing
avenues and monitor the costs of our facility in the Dominican Republic which provides cover in
case our main data processing and call centre facility in Costa Rica suffers disruption. 
Payment processing
Effective payment processing is vital to the business, allowing customers to deposit funds easily
and to trust that winnings will be paid out with reliability. Certain US issuing banks have stopped
accepting online gambling transactions as a result of political pressure, but other suppliers, such
as NETeller are providing this service and filling any supply gap. New secure payment processing
avenues are researched continually and it is hoped that the increasing agreement by European
legislators that sportsbets from North America are acceptable, will increase the involvement of
major financial institutions in this market. We continue to monitor this area for fraud, money
laundering and risk.

BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review Technology
Operational software forms an important aspect of the business and we have commissioned a full
specification of our requirements to:
• Enable the Group to offer a common wallet in any currency to our customers that allows them
to participate in any of our offerings from one source;
• Improve functionality; 
• Automate payment processing;
• Automate base level risk management;
• Provide the ability to personalise automatically the service to customers according to their
specific profile;
• Strengthen the safeguards to protect customers; and
• Better protect our systems against denial of service attacks by saboteurs.
The new platform will offer the ability to introduce further products and address the needs of the
next generation of users, including multi channel distribution systems such as mobile phones or
interactive TV. 
Latin American expansion
Our organic growth plans are centred around Central and South America because of our location
in that region and our knowledge of regional practices, regulations and customs. We embarked on
a proof of concept programme on 14th December 2004, where we started operating a joint venture
sportsbook in Guatemala which provides a virtual casino and sportsbook at a prominent spa hotel.
Business is building as an understanding and acceptance of sports betting improves and the
operation has helped our understanding of the issues involved in developing new territories in
Central and South America. 
On 21st February 2005, we signed a management supply contract to provide sportsbook facilities,
in up to 18 locations throughout Mexico, in association with a bingo operator.
The first location opened on 5th March in Mexico City and comprises a modern 562 seat bingo hall
with ancillary bar and restaurant facilities. We have installed a sportsbook area of 1800sq feet with
24 TV screens showing live sports and full sportsbook service lounge areas managed by
BETonSPORTS. Early indications are positive.
We are progressing on further initiatives in Peru and Argentina.
Strategic acquisitions
We are pursuing value enhancing acquisitions and have established our guidelines as
• Proven profitability;
• Strong local market presence and knowledge;
• Local regulatory compliance and trading licences with an assessment of exposure; 
12
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review • IT integration and compatibility;
• Good financial control systems; and
• Effective risk management procedures.
The current overheated market has led to vendor price expectations being higher than true worth
and being conscious of this fact, we will only consider potential acquisitions which are strategically
important and earnings enhancing. 
We continue to seek opportunities in markets that will 
• Diversify our current business in terms of geographic location of customer base;
• Expand the range of sports events available to customers worldwide and spread the
seasonality bias of the current business;
• Create operational centres in key regions (Europe, Far East and Australasia);
• Increase the product range and services;
• Benefit from cross selling;
• Utilise the current infrastructure to save costs and grow businesses; and
• Increase the IT, marketing, risk management and financial capability.
Regulatory update
We welcome moves by Governments that clarify their regulatory legislation. However, we believe
that progress in this area around the World will continue to be slow and there will be little significant
movement within the next 12 months.
The UK Government’s Gambling Act is a move in the right direction, but there is still considerable
need for clarity on interpretations. At present the Act seems to suggest that a business registering
in the UK will be taxed on its activities in all jurisdictions. If this is correct the desire of the
Government that the UK becomes a major online gambling jurisdiction may not be fulfilled.
The success of Antigua against the USA in the WTO dispute is a triumph for logic and is good news
for the industry as a whole. Hopefully the decision will improve the environment for advertising and
cash transmission from the USA in particular.
Ultimately, we believe that the lure of tax revenues will provide a powerful argument for positive
legislative change as demonstrated by the increasing acceptance of online poker activities.
In the Far East, Singapore is encouraging land based casino operators to operate in the country
and the publicised crack down in China on illegal betting shops has shown an acceptance of the
issue.
Management team
The expansion of the management team has been a key target. I am delighted that Richard Creed
and Clive Archer have joined the team at Board level. We are continually strengthening our
operational procedures and improving the management practices at all levels. There is much to do
13
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review in an industry which is developing at a very fast pace and the strategic and operational skills added
by Richard and Clive are especially valuable. Richard has a track record of worldwide mergers and
acquisitions experience and Clive provides considerable operational and management expertise
with a particular emphasis on marketing.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the gross win margin on the sportsbook has returned to historic trends
and is ahead of forecast.
New customer sign-ups and customer cash deposits are also in line with forecast and slightly in
advance of 2004 levels.
The launch of poker and the repositioning of the on-line casino are progressing well. Despite the
strong seasonality of our business, we are pleased with the results achieved in the first quarter and
look forward with confidence to continuing the development of our business in our core and new
markets across the world.

BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review Accounts preparation
BETonSPORTS plc was incorporated on 13 November 2003 and started trading on 8 July 2004.
On 14 July 2004, the Company acquired the shares of a number of companies operating
interactive licensed betting and gaming operations over the Internet and telephone. These
companies and their activities are listed on page 44.
Following this acquisition, the shares of the Company were admitted onto AIM on 15 July 2004.
Simultaneously, the Company acquired the balance of the shares in the Millennium group of
companies, to bring this wholly owned subsidiary within the Group.
Accounts
The Company has a legal requirement to report its results for the period from incorporation to the
year end. You will see these results for the 29 weeks to 6 February, which have been audited. 
To provide a more meaningful set of figures, we are also reporting results for the 52 weeks ended
1 February 2004 and 53 weeks ended 6 February 2005, which are described as “pro forma”.
Accounting date
The Company selected the Super Bowl as the year end date because a significant number of
pending bets were settled on that day and to ensure that only one Super Bowl fell in every financial
year. This year the Super Bowl was on Sunday 6 February 2005.
Dividend
The Directors have decided that the dividend distribution to shareholders should be declared as
an interim dividend for 2005/06. Although it does not affect the timing of payments to shareholders
or their personal taxation position, it does defer the payment of over $2.3m in UK corporation tax
for twelve months. The Directors confirm, however, that they intend to pay normal interim and final
dividends in respect of the year to 31 January 2006 in addition to this special interim dividend.
Employees
Your Board actively encourages employee participation. All staff in service as at 3 December 2004,
and who had completed 4 or more years service were granted options based on their length of
service. Employees with 4 years service were granted 577 shares, employees with 5 years service
1,443 shares and those staff with 6 or more years service 2687 shares. These options were
granted at a price of £0.90 and are exercisable between 2007 and 2014.
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
Although not required until 2007 your Company is preparing to implement the forthcoming
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and is currently assessing the financial impact
of these changes.
In advance of these changes being mandated, your Company has reviewed its policy on goodwill.
We conducted an impairment review of the goodwill held on the balance sheet. The biggest single
item relates to the purchase of the minority interest in the Millennium Group. This is $20.8m, and
we consider that it is correctly valued. In reviewing the valuations of the minor brands we
concluded that BETaBET was overvalued, while the other minor brands were correctly valued as
15
BETonSPORTS plc
Financial review at the beginning of the year. As a result we have decreased the valuation of this brand to a nominal
value and made no charge for the year for the other brands, as we considered them to be
accurately valued.
The net cost of this during the year was $0.28m. 
Accounting policies
Insofar as sportsbook volume is concerned, volume is the value of wagers placed by customers
that have concluded in a result. It is possible for some wagers to conclude as “no action” where
the game is postponed or cancelled or where the result exactly equals the handicap given. In this
event the monies are refunded to the customer and the amount wagered is not considered to be
volume.
We define the volume deriving from our casino as being the gross win. This is the net difference
between bets placed and winning bets.
The poker websites facilitate games between our customers. They are betting against each other
and not the Company, so we do not consider the value of games played to be your company’s
volume. The rake, the small cut taken from each hand, is considered to be volume.
Taxation
The Company operates through a number of companies throughout the world.
The main operating company is located in Antigua, where the company is licensed to carry out its
main activities. This has a beneficial taxation effect locally where the company has IBC or
International Business Corporation status.
The Group’s operations mostly take place outside the UK where low effective rates of tax apply,
UK tax arises only on dividends remitted to the UK. Additional amounts of UK tax can arise under
so-called “controlled foreign company” (CFC) rules, but the UK tax authorities have accepted that
these rules will not apply for periods up to 6 February 2006 and will be reviewed thereafter.
Cash
To minimise risk, customers are required to deposit funds prior to placing any bets. It is a matter
of policy to keep sufficient liquid resources to meet all customer balances at any time. We believe
that this is a policy that gives our customers greater confidence.
The Company retains the majority of the funds raised at the IPO with which to pursue its expansion
strategy. 
The business is highly cash generative and will pursue a policy of paying shareholders regular
dividends.

BETonSPORTS plc
Directors’ report Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year, which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the
Group for that year. In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
• Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
22
BETonSPORTS plc
Statement of directors’ responsibilities Compliance
As an AIM listed company, the Group is not required to follow the provisions of the revised
Combined Code (the 2003 “Code”) as set out in the Financial Services Authority Listing Rules.
However, the Group recognises the importance of the principles of good corporate governance and
has continued its commitment to such high standards throughout the year and particularly its
voluntary compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2003 Code.
The Board is accountable to the Group’s shareholders for good governance and the statements
set out below describe how the Group applies the principles identified in the Code.
The Board
The Group is controlled through the Board of directors which currently comprises four executive
and three non-executive directors. All the non-executive directors are considered to be
independent of management and free of any relationship which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the working of the Board and ensures that all directors
receive sufficient relevant information on financial, business and corporate issues prior to
meetings. The Chief Executive is responsible for running the Group’s business and for
implementing Board strategy and policy.
A formal schedule of matters is considered by the Board, which meets formally at least 6 times
each year. There are frequent conference telephone calls between meetings to ensure that
communication is maintained while action and progress is monitored. The Board is responsible for
overall Group strategy, acquisition and investment policy, approval of major capital expenditure
projects and consideration of significant financing matters. It reviews the strategic direction of
individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual budgets, their progress towards
achievement of those budgets and their capital expenditure programmes. In addition the board is
responsible for reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of the business.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and all Directors
are able to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties if necessary. All
Directors, in accordance with the Code, submit themselves for re-election at least every three
years. This being the first year as a plc, all directors will submit themselves for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting.
Accountability and audit
The Board seeks to present a clear and balanced assessment of the Group’s position and
prospects through the detailed reviews of the performance and financial position in the Chairman’s
statement (pages 5 to 6), Chief Executive’s review (pages 7 to 14) and the Financial review (pages
15 to 16) together with the Directors’ report (pages 20 to 21). The Directors’ responsibility for the
financial statements is described on page 22.
Directors
The Board aims to maintain a balance of executive and non-executive directors. The Directors
biographies are set out on pages 17 and 18. These demonstrate a wide and diverse range of skills,
business experience and expertise, sufficient to bring independent judgement on issues of
23
BETonSPORTS plc
Corporate governance statement strategy, performance, risk, resources and standards of conduct which are essential to the success
of the Group.
The Directors consider that, given the size of the Board, nominations should be a matter for the
Board as a whole, and accordingly there is no separate nomination committee. This will be
reviewed regularly.
The 2003 Code requires the Chairman to hold meetings with the non-executive directors without
the executive directors being present. Such meetings take place regularly.
Independence is a key issue for the Board. The Board has determined that Clive Parritt, The Lord
Glentoran and Christopher Callaway can all be considered to be independent non-executive
directors.
Directors have a right to ensure that any concerns they have about the running of the Group, which
cannot be resolved, are recorded in the board minutes. In addition, upon resignation, a non-
executive director will be asked to provide a written statement to the Chairman, for circulation to
the Board, if he has any such concerns.
Copies of the terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available on
request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by The Lord Glentoran and consists of all the non-
executive directors. The Committee meets as required during the year to review the Group’s
general policy on executive remuneration, the application of that policy to the remuneration and
benefits of the executive directors and to recommend and monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for senior management.
The Remuneration Committee report (set out on pages 26 and 27) contains a more detailed
description of the Company’s policies and procedures for executive remuneration.
The Committee has formal written terms of reference which are available on request from the
Company Secretary.
Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control and for reviewing their
effectiveness. In a business operating in the interactive licensed betting and gaming arena,
procedures for assessing and managing risk are critical to success.
An ongoing process of identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group, has remained in place throughout the financial year and up to the approval date of the
Annual Report. The process is subject to regular review by the Board directly and through the Audit
Committee. This accords with the Turnbull guidance on internal control for directors.
Although the Board has overall responsibility for internal control it relies on the positive contribution
made by senior management to the operation, monitoring and continuing development of risk
management procedures within the Group.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control, the Board has taken into
consideration a number of key matters addressing financial and investment controls, operating
procedures, management reporting and the work of the various Board Committees.
24
BETonSPORTS plc
Corporate governance statement The role of the Audit Committee includes the review and approval of the procedures to control the
movement of cash; the procedures to ensure that betting risk is within the approved parameters;
customer verification procedures to ensure that they continue to be appropriate and effective; and
internal control systems generally. The Committee is responsible for reviewing the appointment of
external auditors (and their independence and terms of remuneration). Their role is also to alert
the Board to any emerging issues and consider the draft papers prepared for the annual review of
effectiveness of the risk management procedures adopted by the Group, prior to them being
submitted to the Board for approval. The Audit Committee consists of all the non-executive
directors, is chaired by Clive Parritt and the Finance Director (Craig Lapsley) acts as secretary. 
The Group has adopted robust risk management systems, which is natural and necessary for a
financial operation of its size and nature and which operates on a real time 24 hour basis. These
address issues such as money laundering, fraud and exposure to loss.
Risk is inherent in business activity and the Group’s systems of internal control are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Relations with shareholders
The Board believes in communicating with shareholders regularly. Although the primary activities
are conducted outside the UK, the Chief Executive and other executive directors visit the UK
several times a year. During these visits they are always pleased to meet with shareholders.
All public and regulatory announcements are agreed by the Board prior to publication. The
Chairman and non-executive directors are also available to meet with shareholders as necessary.
The Board has sought to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private investors
and encourages their participation.

(a) Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is being designed to attract, retain and motivate individuals of a calibre
that will ensure the successful leadership and management of the Group. Remuneration
26
BETonSPORTS plc
Remuneration Committee report packages are designed to reward the executive directors and members of the senior
management team fairly for their contributions, whilst remaining within the range of benefits
offered by similar companies in the sector. The Remuneration Committee is seeking to create
a salary structure which is transparent, fair, and motivational. Part of this package is a
performance related bonus scheme based on corporate performance, team performance and
at least ten personal KPI’s. This package, will we believe, align the interests of shareholders
and the senior management team, with particular importance being given to the performance-
related elements. The Directors’ and senior management remuneration packages will be the
subject of regular review in accordance with this policy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is first considered by the executive directors
based on the time which they commit to the Group, the financial and reputation risks attached
to non-executives, and the responsibilities of their role. The Remuneration Committee
considers, then determines the level of remuneration appropriate.
(b) Terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee consists of all the non-executive directors and is chaired by
The Lord Glentoran. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee include:
• To determine the executive directors and senior management team salaries, and other
remuneration and benefit packages, including incentive arrangements.
• To agree the targets and scope of any performance-related pay elements of the
remuneration package
• To review the executive directors recommendations on the overall remuneration and
benefits policy of the group, with the power and authority to amend it if appropriate.
• To have regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and associated guidance in its
decision-making.
(c) Service contracts
It is the Group’s policy that the notice period for the duration of all directors’ contracts shall be
no more than one year. This is in accordance with current corporate governance best practice.
(d) Bonuses
The group operates a bonus incentive scheme referred to in paragraph (a) above, which
applies at differing rates for the executive directors and members of senior management. Part
of any payment under this scheme is linked to the annual performance of the business for
which they are responsible; the remainder of such payment is made on a discretionary basis.

BETonSPORTS plc
Remuneration Committee report TO THE MEMBERS OF BETonSPORTS plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the Group Profit and Loss Account, the
Group and Company Balance Sheets, the Reconciliation of Shareholders’ Funds, the Cash Flow
Statement and the related notes. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and
are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises only the Directors’ Report,
the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review, the Remuneration
Committee Report and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
28
BETonSPORTS plc

BETonSPORTS plc
Group statement of cash flows
for the year ended 6 February 2005 1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards
and under the historical cost convention. 
Basis of preparation
The principal operating currency for the Group is US dollars, and accordingly the financial
statements are prepared in US dollars. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company
and all its subsidiary undertakings. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the
year are consolidated from the date of acquisition. At acquisition, fair values are attributed to
the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired. Any excess of consideration over these
fair values is transferred to goodwill. 
The Company takes advantage of the exemption provided by Section 230 of the Companies
Act 1985 not to present its own profit and loss account. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid for a business over the fair value
of the assets acquired. 
The Companies Act 1985 requires goodwill to be amortised over a finite period. The directors
consider that the Group’s goodwill has an indefinite life because the Group is a significant
operator in a well established market with a proven and sustained demand for bookmaking
services. The Group has a track record of successfully renewing its betting permits and
licences.
Consequently, the directors consider that to amortise goodwill would not provide a true and
fair view of the results. Accordingly the financial statements depart from this specific
requirement of the Companies Act 1985. If this departure from the Companies Act 1985 had
not been made the results for the financial period would have been charged with a provision
for amortisation. The amount of this provision cannot be quantified because of the indefinite
life of the assets.
As goodwill is not amortised the balance sheet value is subject to annual impairment review
in accordance with FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets’ and FRS 11 ‘Impairment of Fixed
Assets and Goodwill”

Notes to the financial statements
at 6 February 2005 1. Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are shown at cost less amortisation. Specifically:
i) Software development costs, which lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering
future benefit to the business, are capitalised and are amortised over 3 years.
ii) Purchased software development, which is in the process of being developed, is not
amortised until the software becomes operational.
iii) Business development costs, which represent expenses incurred in assessing the
potential profitability of business in new territories, are capitalised until the business
becomes commercially operational when the costs are then amortised over 3 years.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the cost
over their expected useful lives, as follows: 
Leasehold improvements – over the term of the lease
Fixtures and fittings – 15% per annum 
Computer equipment – 15% to 33% per annum 
Motor vehicles – 20% per annum
Investments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rate of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences, which arise from the
translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, are reflected in reserves.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the rate of exchange ruling
at the date of the transaction. These exchange differences are reflected in the profit and loss
account for the year. 
Operating leases
Lease payments under operating leases, where substantially all the risks and benefits remain
with the lessor, are charged in the profit and loss account on the straight line basis over the
lease term.

Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not
reversed at the balance sheet date. Timing differences arise where gains and losses are
subject to taxation in periods different from those in which the gains and losses are
recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in
which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a
non-discounted basis.
2. Turnover and segmental analysis
Turnover comprises the following:
Sportsbetting: the amount placed in respect of bets on sports and other events which
occurred and completed during the period.
Casino betting: the amount of the net win from customers in the various casino products
Poker: the amount of commissions and fees (rake) generated from poker games

Notice of Annual General Meeting Notes:
1. Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more persons
as his/her proxy to attend and, on a poll, to vote instead of him/her. The proxy need not be a member of the
Company. The appointment of a proxy does not preclude any member from attending and voting in person at the
meeting. 
2. To be valid the instrument appointing a proxy together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under
which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office copy thereof, must be deposited at the Company’s Registrar,
Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex, BN99 6DA, at least 48 hours before the time fixed
for the meeting. A reply-paid proxy form is enclosed with this Annual Report. 
3. Copies of Directors’ service contracts together with a statement of Directors’ interests in the share capital of the
Company will be available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during business hours on any
weekday (excluding Saturdays) from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and will be
available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting for a period of 15 minutes before the commencement until
the conclusion of the meeting.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41(1) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (2001 No 3755), the Company has
specified that only those members registered on the register of members of the Company on 25 June 2005 shall
be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Changes to the register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to
attend and vote at the meeting.
5. Any one of joint holders is entitled to grant a proxy. However, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, either in
person or by proxy, will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, seniority being
determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members.
6. In the case of a Corporation, an instrument appointing a proxy must be completed either under seal or under the
hand of an officer or attorney duly authorised and lodged with the power of Attorney or other authority under which
it is signed, or a notarially certified copy thereof.

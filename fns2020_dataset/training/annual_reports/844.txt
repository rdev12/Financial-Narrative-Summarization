 Highlights AMEC plc annual report 2006  4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   1 4/4/07   09:15:39 	 2006 	was 	the 	end 	of 	one 	era 	and 	the 	beginning 	of 	another 	for 	AMEC. 	We 	said	 farewell	to 	one 	chief 	executive 	and 	welcomed 	another , 	sold 	a 	major 	business	 while	laying 	plans 	for 	future 	investment 	and 	decided 	to 	exit 	former 	important	 markets	in 	order 	to 	focus 	on 	our 	growing 	core 	businesses. 	As 	we 	start 	2007 ,	 AMEC	is 	making 	good 	progress 	as 	it 	executes 	its 	new 	strategy.
This	transition 	has 	taken 	place 	in 	a 	demanding 	time 	frame. 	In 	November	 2005,	we 	announced 	our 	plans 	to 	review 	strategy, 	in 	particular 	that 	we 	would	 dispose	of 	AMEC 	SPIE, 	which 	we 	successfully 	completed 	in 	July 	2006,	 producing	an 	excellent 	return 	on 	our 	investment.	 In	August 	2006, 	we 	announced 	the 	appointment 	of 	our 	new 	chief 	executive,	 Samir	Brikho, 	who 	took 	over 	from 	Sir 	Peter 	Mason 	in 	October . 	By 	the 	year 	end,	 Samir	had 	announced 	his 	strategy, 	begun 	to 	prepare 	for 	the 	sale 	of 	the 	Built	 Environment	businesses 	and 	put 	in 	place 	a 	major 	cost 	cutting 	programme	 to	make 	AMEC 	substantially 	leaner 	and 	fitter 	than 	it 	was 	previously. 	These	 announcements	received 	widespread 	investor 	support. 	At 	the 	same 	time,	 he	successfully 	defended 	the 	company 	against 	an 	approach 	from 	a 	private	 equity	consortium, 	which 	the 	board 	felt 	undervalued 	our 	business.
2006	marked 	the 	 beginning	 of	a 	 new era	for 	 AMEC

Chairman’s statement
4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   2 4/4/07   09:15:42 All	this	speaks	of	Samir’s	energy	and	dedication	to	results	and	I	am	delighted	
that	our	recruitment	exercise	identified	the	right	man	to	take	AMEC	forward.	
He	has	already	laid	the	foundations	for	the	group’s	future	growth	and	success	
and	we	can	expect	to	see	the	new	AMEC	well	established	by	the	end	of	the	
current	year .	
During	2006,	we	said	farewell	to	Sir	Peter	Mason,	who	left	the	company	in	
October	2006,	his	official	retirement	date.	Sir	Peter	played	a	pivotal	role	in	
AMEC’s	development	over	the	last	decade	and	indeed	instigated	the	reshaping	
of	the	group	away	from	its	traditional	construction	markets.	Jean	Monville,	
who	led	AMEC	SPIE	and	was	an	influential	and	much	valued	presence	on	
the	board,	and	Jean-Paul	Jacamon,	another	valued	director ,	left	the	board	
following	the	AMEC	SPIE	sale.	It	was	announced	with	our	2006	results,	
that	James	Dallas	would	retire	from	the	board	after	the	annual	general	
meeting	on	16	May	of	this	year .	James	originally	intended	to	serve	two	terms	
only,	but	he	agreed	to	stay	on	through	a	period	of	major	change	for	which	we	
are	grateful.	On	behalf	of	the	board,	I	would	like	to	thank	all	of	them	for	their	
important	contributions	to	AMEC.
Results	for	2006	were	very	much	as	expected	in	December	2006.	Adjusted	profit 	 from	continuing	operations	of	£64.7	million	was	below	both	2005	(£73.9	million)	
and	original	expectations	for	the	year .	The	loss	before		income	tax	was	
£108.8	million	(2005:	£17 .7	million).	However ,	there	was	a	profit	from	discontinued 	 operations	of	£319.1	million.	Strong	performance	in	Natural	Resources 	and	
Earth	and	Environmental,	together	with	a	substantial	profit	from	the	sale	
of	a	PPP	asset	during	the	year ,	was	not	sufficient	to	offset	reduced	profit	
in	Power 	and	Process	and	continued	Construction	losses.
We	are	confident	about	2007	and	the	future	given	the	strength	in	our	core	
markets	and	the	intense	efforts	being	directed	to	achieving	significant	
reductions	in	cost	and	improved	margin	in	each	of	our	businesses.	This	is	
reflected	in	proposed	dividends	for	the	year ,	which	are	increased	by	6	per	cent	
to	12.2	pence	(2005:	1 1.5	pence).
AMEC	has	a	clear	vision	and	new	strategy	focused	on	providing	value-added	
engineering	services	to	its	core	energy	and	process	clients	worldwide.	
We	have	put	in	place	plans	to	turn	around,	and	will	divest,	the	UK	Construction	
business,	putting	a	stop	to	the	losses	that	have	damaged	AMEC’s	performance	
in	recent	years.	This,	together	with	the	divestment	of	our	profitable	Investments	
and	Building	and	Facilities	Services	businesses,	will	refocus	the	group	
and	increase	resources	available	to	invest	in	the	core	businesses.
Looking	further	ahead,	our	core	markets	are	strong,	and	I	am	confident	
that	the	new	AMEC	will	achieve	its	margin	targets	of	6	per	cent	in	2008	and	
8	per	cent	in	2010,	delivering	performance	and	value.

Chief executive’ s review
2006	has 	been 	a 	year 	of 	considerable 	change 	for 	AMEC. 	Since 	my	 appointment	as 	chief 	executive 	in 	October 	we 	have 	wasted 	no 	time 	in	 streamlining	our 	businesses, 	strengthening 	our 	position 	in 	core 	markets	 and	building 	a 	firm 	foundation. 	We 	are 	now 	in 	a 	much 	stronger 	position	 than	we 	were 	a 	year 	ago 	and 	well 	on 	the 	way 	to 	creating 	a 	more 	focused	 and	profitable 	business 	for 	the 	future.	 Creating a leaner , fitter business
Our	first 	priority 	at 	AMEC 	has 	been 	to 	create 	a 	leaner 	and 	more 	efficient	 business.	To 	do 	this, 	we 	have 	introduced 	a 	major 	cultural 	change 	programme	 known	as 	STEP 	Change, 	with 	a 	focus 	on 	significantly 	reducing 	our 	costs.	 This	was 	well 	underway 	in 	December 	2006 	when 	a 	cost 	savings 	target 	of	 £100	million 	was 	announced. 	Progress 	has 	been 	more 	successful 	than 	we	 anticipated,	with 	all 	of 	us 	who 	work 	for 	the 	company 	taking 	responsibility 	for	 driving	the 	programme 	forward. 	We 	have 	now 	identified 	an 	additional 	£12 	million 	 of	savings, 	involving 	many 	initiatives 	such 	as 	aligning 	our 	benefits 	programme	 with	peers 	and 	reducing 	our 	corporate 	costs. 	This 	will 	deliver 	significant	 benefits	of 	around 	£40 	million 	in 	recurring 	net 	benefits 	from 	2008 	onwards.
4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   4 4/4/07   09:15:46 The	focus 	of 	any 	organisation 	must 	be 	clear 	if 	it 	hopes 	to 	progress 	and 	grow.	 As	a 	result, 	at 	the 	end 	of 	2006 	we 	decided 	our 	focus 	would 	be 	on 	the 	energy	 and	process 	markets 	and 	that 	non-core 	businesses 	in 	Built 	Environment	 would	therefore 	be 	sold. 	We 	have 	already 	successfully 	sold 	the 	rail 	business,	 received	over 	40 	expressions 	of 	interest 	for 	the 	remaining 	businesses ,	and 	we	 expect	the 	sale 	of 	them 	to 	be 	completed 	during 	2007 .	 As	part 	of 	the 	transformation 	of 	AMEC, 	we 	have 	had 	to 	manage 	certain 	issues	 that	have 	prevented 	us 	from 	achieving 	our 	full 	potential, 	including 	the 	legacy	 projects	that 	have 	involved 	litigation 	claims. 	We 	addressed 	this 	issue 	as	 a	matter 	of 	urgency, 	reviewing 	all 	major 	disputes, 	establishing 	clear	 responsibility	for 	the 	management 	of 	the 	legacy 	issues 	and 	adopting 	a 	strategy	 to	settle 	where 	reasonable 	to 	do 	so. 	In 	addition, 	risk 	management 	processes	 have	been 	strengthened.	 A	strong 	balance 	sheet 	is 	always 	important 	and 	following 	the 	sale 	of	 AMEC	SPIE 	in 	July 	2006, 	we 	expect 	to 	have 	£250 	million 	of 	average 	net 	cash	 available	in 	2007 , 	up 	to 	£100 	million 	of 	which 	is 	being 	returned 	to 	shareholders	 in	a 	share 	buy 	back 	programme. 	Conversion 	of 	profit 	to 	cash 	has 	also	 improved	considerably.
Recent successes 
In	2006, 	we 	profited 	from 	successes 	in 	our 	core 	markets 	such 	as 	oil 	sands,	 mining	and 	oil 	and 	gas. 	These 	included 	a 	major 	joint 	venture 	contract 	for 	the	 upgrade	of 	overhead 	power 	lines 	across 	western 	England 	and 	Wales 	for	 National	Grid 	and 	a 	contract 	with 	BG 	Group 	to 	support 	all 	of 	BG’s 	upstream	 natural	gas 	assets 	and 	manage 	the 	development 	of 	the 	Maria 	brownfield 	gas	 project	in 	the 	North 	Sea. 	We 	also 	improved 	the 	market 	position 	of 	our 	Earth	 and	Environmental 	business 	with 	the 	award 	of 	a 	multi-year 	contract 	for 	the	 US	Air 	Force.	 Chief executive’s review AMEC plc annual report 2006 5
We	remain 	fully 	committed 	to 	a 	sustainable 	approach 	in 	all 	that 	we 	do,	 and	our 	success 	has 	been 	reflected 	with 	AMEC 	being 	awarded 	the 	number	 one	position 	in 	the 	2006 	Dow 	Jones 	Sustainability 	Index. 	This 	was 	for 	both	 the	World 	and 	European 	sustainability 	indices 	within 	the 	support 	services	 sector	and 	was 	the 	third 	year 	in 	succession 	we 	have 	achieved 	this.	 AMEC’ s vision for the future
All	the 	work 	we 	are 	doing 	is 	focused 	on 	achieving 	our 	goal 	of 	becoming 	a 	leading	 supplier	of 	high 	value 	consultancy, 	engineering 	and 	project 	management	 services	within 	the 	global 	energy 	and 	industrial 	process 	industries.	 The	next 	stage 	in 	the 	development 	and 	growth 	of 	AMEC 	is 	to 	focus 	on 	the	 achievement	of 	operational 	excellence. 	This 	will 	be 	by 	strengthening 	our	 client	relationships, 	engaging 	to 	a 	much 	greater 	degree 	with 	our 	key 	customers	 and	by 	creating 	simpler 	and 	more 	robust 	management 	processes. 	Everyone	 within	AMEC 	is 	very 	clear 	about 	what 	they 	as 	individuals 	need 	to 	do 	to 	deliver	 the	targets 	we 	have 	set 	for 	the 	business. 	Their 	commitment 	means 	we 	will	 continue	to 	deliver 	on 	 our	promises 	to 	put 	the 	business 	in 	order , 	to 	dispose 	of	 the	non-core 	businesses ,	to 	deliver 	STEP 	Change 	and 	achieve 	targeted 	margin	 improvements.	By 	doing 	so, 	we 	are 	positioning 	ourselves 	as 	an 	organisation	 that	is 	leaner , 	more 	focused 	and 	profitable 	and 	a 	leader 	in 	our 	chosen 	fields.	 14	March 	2007

Innovative	 solutions	to 	some	 of	the 	world’s 	most 	 complex	 engineering	challenges
AMEC	was 	awarded 	a 	£250 	million	 contract	with 	Bruce 	Power 	– 	Ontario’s	 largest	independent 	nuclear 	generator	 –	over 	15 	months 	ago, 	for 	the 	restart	 of	two 	nuclear 	reactors.	 The	plant 	had 	been 	closed 	for 	several	 years,	with 	very 	limited 	maintenance,	 making	it 	an 	extremely 	technically	 challenging	project. 	The 	work 	includes	 a	series 	of 	refurbishments, 	upgrades	 and	enhancements 	to 	the 	two 	reactors,	 improving	safety 	and 	increasing	 generation	capacity.	 Just	over 	a 	year 	into 	the 	project,	 it	remains 	on 	schedule. 	AMEC 	has	 worked	with 	Bruce 	Power 	since 	2001,	 providing	complex 	engineering	 solutions	and 	safety 	consultancy	 services	throughout 	the 	life-cycle 	of	 nuclear	facilities 	in 	Canada, 	the 	UK	 and	Eastern 	Europe.	 AMEC’s	experience 	in 	the 	nuclear	 sector,	its 	expertise 	in 	large 	scale	 project,	contract 	and 	construction	 management	were 	major 	factors	 in	winning 	this 	contract.	 AMEC	is 	a 	market 	leader 	in 	the	 upstream	bitumen 	production 	oil 	sands	 projects	in 	Northern 	Alberta, 	Canada,	 having	worked 	on 	almost 	every 	major	 development	for 	over 	15 	years.	 AMEC’s	relationship 	with 	Syncrude 	–	 the	world’s 	largest 	producer 	of 	crude	 from	oil 	sands 	- 	has 	spanned 	over 	ten	 years,	providing 	project 	management	 services,	together 	with 	design,	 engineering,	procurement, 	construction	 management,	commissioning 	 	and	 training.	The 	projects 	are 	located 	in	 severe	winter 	conditions 	where	 knowledge	of 	cold 	weather 	engineering	 is	mandatory.	 On	the 	Aurora 	mine 	Train 	1 	for 	example,	 Syncrude	introduced 	a 	new 	low-energy	 process	for 	the 	extraction 	of 	bitumen 	for	 the	first 	time, 	together 	with 	the 	first 	use	 of	new 	pipeline 	technology. 	AMEC 	has	 worked	closely 	with 	Syncrude 	in 	the	 implementation	and 	enhancements 	of	 these	new 	technologies 	over 	the 	years.	 AMEC	is 	a 	leading 	provider 	of 	services	 to	Canada’s 	diamond 	industry. 	We 	work	 with	De 	Beers 	as 	their 	alliance 	partner	 and	preferred 	supplier 	for 	engineering,	 consulting,	project 	and 	construction	 management	services 	in 	Canada.	 AMEC	provides 	the 	full 	range 	of	 environmental	services 	for 	both 	Snap	 Lake,	De 	Beers 	first 	diamond 	mine	 in	Canada 	and 	Victor, 	De 	Beers 	first	 diamond	mine 	in 	Ontario.	 The	Victor 	project 	is 	in 	a 	sub-arctic	 location,	where 	access 	is 	only 	possible	 via	land 	for 	less 	than 	two 	months 	a 	year .	 AMEC’s	knowledge 	of 	the 	arctic	 environment	and 	our 	ability 	to 	provide	 a	range 	of 	services, 	from 	permitting	 through	to 	construction 	management,	 means	that 	we 	play 	an 	essential 	role	 in	progressing 	the 	project 	through 	to	 sanction	and 	development.	 Our	environmental 	specialists 	provided	 geotechnical	and 	environmental	 assessment	and 	permitting 	assistance	 during	the 	initial 	stages 	of 	the 	project	 and	are 	now 	delivering 	engineering,	 procurement	and 	construction	 management	of 	the 	site 	infrastructure	 as	well 	as 	working 	with 	De 	Beers 	to	 train	the 	local 	workforce.

AMEC	is	the	only	UK	company	to	offer	
a	complete	range	of	services	across	
all	sectors	of	the	gas	and	electricity	
transmission	and	gas	distribution	
networks.	 	 For	many	years,	AMEC	has	worked	
with	National	Grid	on	both	the	gas	and	
electricity	transmission	networks,	and	
also	on	gas	distribution.	In	2005,	AMEC	
was	awarded	a	£280	million	contract	
to	provide	a	rolling	programme	of	
upgrading	the	gas	infrastructure	along	
the	M1	corridor,	covering	the	cities	of	
Derby,	Leicester,	Nottingham	and	
Sheffield.	
We	are	providing	a	complete	service	
from	refining	the	design,	delivering	the	
replacement	of	the	pipelines	to	testing,	
commissioning	and	handing	over	the	
pipelines	over	an	eight	year	period.	
More	recently,	in	October	2006,	an	
AMEC	joint	venture	won	a	£500	million	
contract	to	upgrade	the	overhead	power	
lines	and	underground	cables	across	
western	England	and	Wales.	
AMEC	provides	long-term	asset	
support	to	international	and	national	oil	
companies,	using	our	experience	in	
offshore	services	to	upgrade	their	
facilities	and	enhance	their

ground-breaking	performance	based	
contract	by	Shell	ONEgas	to	provide	
extensive	support	services	to	over	50	
offshore	gas	production	platforms	and	
two	gas	plants	in	the	North	Sea.
AMEC	created	a	new	joint	venture	with	
a	UK	and	Dutch	company	to	deliver	a	
complete	service	solution	to	Shell.	The	
company	is	responsible	for	the	design	
and	management	of	capital	projects	
and	for	continuous	operational	support,	
including	modifications,	maintenance	
and	supply	of	skilled	personnel.	
Our	experience	in	managing	offshore	
asset	support	operations	in	the	North	
Sea	has	enabled	us	to	improve	the	
reliability	of	existing	facilities	and	
contribute	towards	extending	their	
productive	life	as	well	as	helping	to	
raise	overall	production	levels.	
AMEC’s	Earth	and	Environmental	
business	has	worked	in	the	extreme	
climate	of	North	America	for	more	than	
30	years,	producing	environmental	
impact	assessments	for	major	
exploration	projects.
One	long-term	client	is	Imperial	Oil	
Resources,	for	which	AMEC	has	
provided	assessment,	monitoring	and	
remediation	services	for	both	Upstream	
and	Downstream	projects.	AMEC	is	
currently	working	with	Imperial	on	the	
Mackenzie	Valley	Gas	Project	in	
Northern	Canada.
AMEC	was	chosen	to	conduct	a	wide	
range	of	environmental	services,	
including	a	full	environmental	impact	
assessment,	and	supporting	our	client	
throughout	the	regulatory	review	and	
approvals	process.	This	was	one	
of	the	largest	environmental	impact	
assessments	ever	undertaken	
worldwide.
Our	experience	in	handling,	large-scale,	
complex	projects	is	a	major	factor	for	our	
clients	in	their	choice	to	work	with	us.
With	over	90	years’	experience,	AMEC	
is	a	global	market	leader	in	pulp	and	
paper	projects,	having	designed	and	
constructed	some	of	the	world’s	largest	
and	most	technologically	advanced	
integrated	mills.	
AMEC	has	a	twenty	year	relationship	
with	Kimberly-Clark	–	one	of	the	world’s	
top	producers	of	personal	paper	
products	–	providing	engineering,	
procurement	and	construction	services.	
For	example,	AMEC	provided	
engineering	design	of	a	specialist	
machine	to	increase	production	in	
a	growing	market;	using	new	and	
refurbished	equipment,	a	solution	
which	maximised	Kimberly-Clark’s	
return	on	capital.

Introduction
This	business 	and 	financial 	review 	provides 	a 	broader 	perspective 	of 	AMEC’s	 businesses	to 	enable 	a 	more 	informed 	judgement 	to 	be 	made 	of 	the 	group’s	 financial	performance 	and 	prospects. 	The 	review 	contains 	certain 	forward-
looking	statements 	with 	respect 	to 	the 	financial 	condition, 	operations 	and	 results	of 	AMEC’s 	businesses. 	These 	statements 	involve 	risk 	and 	uncertainty	 because	they 	relate 	to 	events 	and 	depend 	upon 	circumstances 	that 	will 	occur	 in	the 	future. 	There 	are 	a 	number 	of 	factors 	that 	could 	cause 	actual	 performance	or 	developments 	to 	differ 	materially 	from 	those 	expressed	 or	implied 	by 	these 	forward-looking 	statements.
The	review 	is 	provided 	solely 	to 	provide 	additional 	information 	for 	shareholders	 to	assist 	them 	in 	their 	assessment 	of 	the 	group’s 	strategy 	and 	future 	prospects.	 It	should 	not 	be 	relied 	on 	by 	any 	other 	party 	or 	for 	any 	other 	purpose.
Strategy
On	13 	December 	2006, 	AMEC 	announced 	that 	it 	had 	completed 	a 	comprehensive	 review	of 	the 	company’s 	businesses 	including 	consideration 	of 	their 	market	 position,	client 	relationships, 	profitability 	and 	growth 	potential. 	The 	review 	also	 focused	on 	the 	reasons 	for 	AMEC’s 	underperformance 	in 	recent 	years, 	which	 had	included 	a 	complex 	organisational 	structure, 	high 	overhead 	costs, 	a 	lack	 of	business 	focus 	and 	ongoing 	litigation.
AMEC’s	vision 	is 	to 	be 	a 	leading 	supplier 	of 	high 	value 	consultancy, 	engineering	 and	project 	management 	services 	to 	defined 	market 	segments 	within 	the	 world’s	energy 	and 	industrial 	process 	industries.	 Important	goals 	for 	AMEC 	are 	margin 	targets 	of 	6 	per 	cent 	in 	2008 	and 	8 	per 	cent 	 in	2010.	 Business and financial review

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   12 4/4/07   09:16:08 The	review 	resulted 	in 	the 	decision 	to 	retain 	the 	following 	core 	businesses:
■	Natural 	Resources: 	 	 	 Oil 	and 	Gas 	Services
Oil	Sands 	(Engineering 	and 	Infrastructure)
Minerals	and 	Metals 	Mining
■	Power 	and 	Process: 	 	 	 Industrial 	(UK 	and 	North 	America)
Nuclear
■	Earth 	and 	Environmental
In	addition, 	the 	Wind 	Energy 	business 	and 	the 	Incheon 	Bridge 	PPP 	project	 will	be 	retained.	 These	businesses 	generated 	aggregate 	2006 	revenues 	of 	£2.1 	billion	 (2005:	£1.8 	billion).
The	review 	also 	resulted 	in 	the 	decision 	to 	sell 	the 	following 	“non-core”	 Built	Environment 	businesses:
■	Building 	and 	Civil 	Engineering
■	Building 	and 	Facilities 	Services
■	Property 	Developments	 ■	PPP
These	Built 	Environment 	businesses, 	together 	with 	various 	specialist 	activities* 	 generated	2006 	revenues 	of 	£1.1 	billion 	(2005: 	£1.0 	billion) 	and 	losses 	of	 £1 1.6	million** 	(2005: 	profit 	of 	£12.9 	million).
Non-core	businesses 	will 	be 	divested 	as 	quickly 	as 	possible 	during 	2007	 consistent	with 	optimising 	value.
AMEC	also 	announced 	that 	following 	negative 	developments 	on 	several 	major	 disputes	further 	exceptional 	charges 	of 	£68 	million 	would 	be 	made, 	largely	 in	respect 	of 	future 	settlement 	and 	litigation 	costs. 	These 	charges 	reflect 	the	 view	that 	AMEC 	should 	seek 	to 	settle 	these 	disputes. 	Where 	settlement 	cannot	 be	secured 	on 	a 	reasonable 	basis, 	AMEC 	will 	continue 	to 	defend 	its 	position.
STEP Change
In	October 	2006, 	AMEC 	launched 	“STEP 	Change”, 	a 	programme 	of 	change	 in	the 	structure 	and 	culture 	of 	the 	company, 	which 	has 	a 	target 	of 	£1 12 	million	 in	annualised 	savings. 	Of 	this, 	approximately 	£80 	million 	relates 	to 	savings	 in	the 	group’s 	gross 	overhead 	costs 	of 	about 	£450 	million, 	with 	£32 	million	 coming	from 	other 	measures. 	Approximately 	75 	per 	cent 	of 	targeted 	overhead	 savings	are 	in 	the 	company’s 	core 	businesses. 	Although 	not 	all 	savings 	will	 be	retained 	by 	AMEC, 	the 	company’s 	market 	competitiveness 	will 	be 	increased	 by	these 	measures.	 As	at 	14 	March 	2007 , 	annualised 	savings 	of 	about 	£80 	million 	had 	been	 identified	within 	the 	group’s 	businesses. 	Benefits 	in 	2007 	are 	expected 	to 	be	 some	£20 	million, 	with 	costs 	of 	achieving 	these 	benefits 	of 	£20 	million. 	The	 programme	will 	be 	completed 	by 	the 	end 	of 	2007 	and 	recurring 	net 	benefits	 of	around 	£40 	million 	are 	expected 	to 	benefit 	results 	for 	the 	group 	overall	 from	2008 	onwards.
Operational Excellence Programme 
In	December 	2006, 	AMEC 	announced 	that 	it 	would 	be 	launching 	an 	Operational	 Excellence	Programme 	in 	2007 	designed 	to 	strengthen 	process 	assurance	 and	risk 	management, 	improve 	business 	focus 	and 	provide 	better 	staff 	training.	 As	a 	result 	of 	the 	overhead 	cost 	reduction 	programme, 	exit 	from 	non-core	 activities	and 	improvements 	in 	operational 	performance, 	AMEC 	is 	targeting	 improvements	in 	margin 	as 	shown 	in 	the 	chart 	below:

As	a 	result 	of 	the 	above, 	both 	AMEC 	SPIE 	and 	pipelines 	construction 	are	 treated	as 	discontinued 	operations 	in 	2006.
In	accordance 	with 	IFRS 	5*, 	the 	post-tax 	results 	of 	discontinued 	operations	 are	disclosed 	separately 	in 	the 	consolidated 	income 	statement, 	with 	the 	2005	 consolidated	income 	statement 	being 	restated 	for 	the 	same 	presentation.	 The	cash 	flows 	of 	discontinued 	businesses 	are 	fully 	consolidated 	within 	AMEC	 up	to 	the 	date 	of 	sale 	and 	the 	assets 	and 	liabilities 	of 	discontinued 	operations	 that	have 	not 	been 	sold 	at 	the 	year 	end 	are 	shown 	separately 	on 	the	 consolidated	balance 	sheet.
In	accordance 	with 	IFRS 	5, 	neither 	the 	consolidated 	balance 	sheet 	nor	 the	consolidated 	cash 	flow 	statement 	for 	2005 	are 	restated 	to 	exclude	 discontinued	operations.
As	noted 	above, 	this 	review 	is 	based 	on 	continuing 	operations 	only 	and	 reconciliations	to 	the 	reported 	results 	are 	provided 	where 	appropriate.
Following	the 	disposal 	of 	AMEC 	SPIE, 	the 	UK 	rail 	business 	was 	jointly 	owned	 by	AMEC 	and 	SPIE. 	On 	19 	February 	2007 , 	AMEC 	announced 	an 	unconditional	 agreement	to 	sell 	its 	50 	per 	cent 	interest 	in 	the 	business, 	with 	completion	 expected	to 	take 	place 	on 	2 	April 	2007 . 	This 	business 	did 	not 	meet 	the 	criteria	 under	IFRS 	5 	for 	presentation 	as 	either 	held 	for 	sale 	or 	a 	discontinued	 operation	in 	2006.
The	table 	opposite 	analyses 	the 	results 	for 	the 	year 	ended 	31 	December 	2006	 between	continuing 	and 	discontinued 	operations. 	Discontinued 	operations	 generated	a 	post-tax 	profit 	of 	£7 .6 	million 	in 	2006.
The	business 	review 	sets 	out 	descriptions 	of 	each 	of 	the 	group’s 	business	 segments,	their 	markets, 	strategy, 	significant 	factors 	affecting 	performance	 for	the 	year 	ended 	31 	December 	2006 	including 	movements 	in 	the 	income	 statement,	balance 	sheet 	and 	cash 	flow 	statement 	and 	on 	matters 	that 	may	 have	an 	impact 	on 	the 	group’s 	future 	financial 	performance.
Adjusted	profit 	from 	continuing 	operations 	of 	£64.7 	million 	in 	2006 	was 	below	 both	2005 	(£73.9 	million) 	and 	the 	board’s 	original 	expectations 	for 	the 	year .	 The	result 	was 	in 	line 	with 	the 	board’s 	expectations 	following 	AMEC’s 	trading	 update	in 	December 	2006. 	Strong 	performance 	in 	Natural 	Resources 	and	 Earth	and 	Environmental, 	together 	with 	a 	substantial 	profit 	from 	the 	sale	 of	a 	PPP 	asset 	during 	the 	year , 	was 	not 	sufficient 	to 	offset 	reduced 	profit	 in	Power 	and 	Process 	and 	continued 	Construction 	losses.
There	was 	a 	pre-tax 	exceptional 	charge 	of 	£169.9 	million 	(2005: 	£87 .1 	million)	 and	intangible 	amortisation 	of 	£3.6 	million 	(2005: 	£4.5 	million), 	resulting 	in 	a	 pre-tax	loss 	of 	£108.8 	million 	(2005: 	loss 	of 	£17 .7 	million).
Profit	for 	the 	year 	from 	discontinued 	operations 	was 	£319.1 	million	 (2005:	£22.1 	million).
Basis of preparation and discontinued activities
The	business 	and 	financial 	review 	is 	based 	on 	the 	reported 	results 	for 	continuing	 operations	before 	intangible 	amortisation 	and 	pre-tax 	exceptional 	items 	but	 including	joint 	venture 	profit 	before 	tax 	(“adjusted 	profit”). 	The 	results 	as 	presented 	 in	the 	business 	and 	financial 	review 	are 	reconciled 	to 	those 	presented 	in 	note 	2	 to	the 	consolidated 	accounts 	on 	pages 	42 	and 	43 	of 	this 	review.	 On	27 	July 	2006, 	AMEC 	SPIE 	was 	sold 	to 	PAI 	partners 	for 	a 	cash 	consideration	 of	 b1	billion. 	The 	results 	of 	AMEC 	SPIE 	for 	the 	period 	to 	27 	July 	2006 	are	 consolidated	in 	these 	accounts. 	During 	2006, 	AMEC 	decided 	to 	exit 	from	 pipeline	construction 	as 	a 	line 	of 	business. 	AMEC’s 	pipeline 	construction	 business	comprised 	three 	companies 	which 	were 	actively 	marketed 	during	 2006.	One 	of 	these 	companies, 	US 	Pipelines 	Inc, 	was 	sold 	in 	September 	2006,	 and	the 	sale 	process 	of 	the 	remaining 	two 	companies 	is 	ongoing.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   16 4/4/07   09:16:13 Major oil and gas company plans point to an investment increase of over 57 per 
cent in 2006-2010 compared to 2001-2005. If those plans are fully implemented 
and their spending forecasts prove accurate, oil and gas investment would rise 
from US$340 billion in 2005 to US$470 billion in 2010. The upstream sector 
will absorb almost two-thirds of total capital spending of which two-thirds will 
go towards maintaining or enhancing production from current fields. Beyond 
the current decade, higher investment in real terms will be needed to maintain 
growth in production capacity, with future projects likely to be more complex 
and remote, involving a higher unit cost. Slowing production declines at mature 
giant fields will require increased investment and enhanced recovery. (Source: 
IEA World Energy Outlook).
Offshore operational expenditure, which includes maintenance and brownfield 
projects, is expected to outstrip capital spending by 2010 (Source: Douglas-
Westwood).
In recent years, the industry has seen the emergence of national oil companies 
and independents, which in 2006 controlled some 90 per cent of global 
reserves. This group of companies is expected to account for an increasingly 
large proportion of investment (2006: 20 per cent), often in frontier regions.
In mature regions, the focus is on asset support and brownfield projects, 
which develop marginal fields and extend the lives of current assets. 
Brownfield project margins can be attractive, as operators seek to minimise 
downtime of their operating facilities. AMEC is the market leader in brownfield 
projects in UKCS.
Oil Sands 
Based in Calgary, Canada, this business is the market leader in engineering 
services and provision of infrastructure to the upstream surface mining oil 
sands sector . In early 2007 , AMEC was working on various stages of nine out 
of 10 oil sands projects, with total capital costs in excess of US$19billion.
Markets
Two main extraction techniques are used in the oil sands: surface mining, 
which currently accounts for the majority of production, and in-situ, which is 
expected to increase its share of the market over the next 10 years. In surface 
mining, the oil-bearing sand is extracted, mixed with water to form a slurry 
and piped to the separation facility, where the bitumen is extracted, and then 
upgraded to a synthetic crude oil. In-situ methods utilise steam injected into 
shallow reservoirs to mobilise the oil. 
The oil sands market has been historically tied to oil prices. More efficient 
extraction methods, stronger oil prices and domestic security of supply have 
made investment in the oil sands more attractive. Strong growth in output 
is expected over the next 10 years. By 2014, the oil sands may produce more 
oil than any OPEC country except Saudi Arabia (source: EIA; RJ Research 
estimates and analysis). The pace of development is uncertain; the market 
is currently resource constrained, with operators curtailing the speed of 
development owing to escalating project costs.

Financial performance 2006
Natural Resources reported good overall performance in 2006, being 
driven by strength in the Oil and Gas Services, Oil Sands and Mining and 
Metals businesses in the Americas, together with UK asset support activities. 
Growth in international oil and gas services markets in 2006 was tempered 
by project deferrals.
The Natural Resources business has withdrawn from lump-sum fabrication. 
This activity, with sales of £102.9 million and £244.1 million in 2006 and 2005 
respectively, generated no trading margin in either year . Substantially all 
monies due to AMEC from lump sum fabrication projects have now been 
paid. Commentary below excludes this activity.
Revenue for the period increased by 31 per cent to £818 million. 
Adjusted profit increased by 17 per cent to £55.0 million (2005: £47 .0 million). 
Margin of 6.7 per cent (2005: 7 .5 per cent), reflected lower than expected 
incentive payments on a Russian project and compared with strong 
performance in 2005, which benefited from favourable project completions.
During 2006, the business employed an average of 6,766 employees 
(2005: 5,733). 
The Natural Resources order book was increased despite strong growth 
in sales during 2006, being up 5 per cent on the position at the end of 2005, 
standing at £1.03 billion. 
Minerals and Metals Mining 
AMEC offers consultancy (including ore resource estimation and feasibility 
studies), design and project management services to clients producing 
commodities including gold, diamonds, base metals, potash and uranium. 
The business occupies a top-tier position in international consulting; a leading 
position in the North American EPCM (Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction Management) market and is developing its position in 
South America. 
Markets
Demand in the global mining industry has been strong, reflecting high mineral 
commodity prices and strong economic growth in countries including China 
and India. This has resulted in the release of a backlog of projects and high 
levels of activity in 2005 and 2006.
The market in North America is mature, but further growth in activity is 
expected in 2007 . High levels of investment are planned in South America 
and Australia as new deposits are developed.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   18 4/4/07   11:49:02 During the year , new awards included a three-year contract with BG Group plc  
to provide asset support services to all of BG’s UK upstream assets and to 
manage the development of the Maria brownfield gas project in the UKCS, 
together with a three-year extension to the oil and gas asset support services 
contract from Shell Philippines Exploration for the Malampaya gas field 
(Philippines). In China, AMEC was appointed project management contractor 
by Ningxia Coal Industry Group for a coal-to-chemical complex and by 
PetroChina Guangxi Petrochemical Company for a grassroots refinery. The 
backlog in Oil and Gas Services also reflected scope changes on pre-existing 
contracts in asset delivery and support.
In Oil Sands, an AMEC joint venture was awarded a major contract for the Shell 
Albian Sands Upstream Expansion Project, whilst in Metals and Mining, AMEC 
was awarded the preliminary basic engineering for a copper and gold project 
in Chile, and a leading EPCM role for a new zinc smelter in Peru.
Outlook 2007
The market outlook for Natural Resources remains good. 
In Oil and Gas Services, activity levels in UKCS are expected to remain high, 
with continued strength in brownfield developments and other asset support 
services. Major opportunities are being pursued in frontier regions and some 
successes are anticipated during 2007 . 
The Canadian oil sands market for engineering services is expected to remain 
strong, being driven by increasing levels of investment. Performance in the Oil 
Sands Infrastructure business, which peaked in 2006, is expected to temper 
overall growth in the Oil Sands division.
Good growth is expected to continue in the North American mining sector . 
This, together with increased activity in South America is expected to result 
in another strong year for the Mining business in 2007 . 
Taken together , the board expects Natural Resources to make good progress 
in 2007 .
STEP Change
As a result of the STEP Change and Operational Excellence programmes, 
the Natural Resources business is targeting a 2008 margin of 7-8 per cent.
Strategy
The Oil and Gas Services business aims to build a leadership position as 
supplier of upstream asset development and asset support services to 
targeted customers (international operators, national oil companies and 
smaller independents) in selected geographies, with focus on complex 
solutions and frontier regions.
The business will leverage existing capability, deploy brownfield expertise 
outside of UKCS and focus on global execution using the AMEC supply chain 
management delivery model.
The business will build capability organically, through alliances and 
acquisitions in the following areas: 
■ Increased capacity in North and South America
■ Increased capability in frontier regions including Kazakhstan, 
Sakhalin and China
■ Engineering centre in Malaysia/South East Asia
The Oil Sands business aims to maintain its leadership position in the surface 
mining sector , to strengthen its capabilities and to invest in the in-situ market.
In Minerals and Metals Mining, the business aims to maintain its top tier 
position in international consulting, to strengthen its leadership position as 
a North American EPCM contractor and to invest in major markets including 
South America and Australia.

 4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   20 4/4/07   11:49:05 North American Industrial
This business designs, delivers, enhances and maintains plant for the power 
sector and process industries such as pulp and paper , food, alternative fuels 
and cement. Engineering services are also provided for public and private 
sector facilities including hospitals and universities together with defence, 
transportation, water and waste infrastructure.
The business has major locations in Atlanta, Vancouver and Toronto and 
operates from some 60 offices across North America.
Markets
The business serves a range of power and process markets across North 
America and internationally. Principal markets include:
Power generation
Spending is expected to remain high, being driven by high energy costs 
and environmental legislation. Over 200 new coal units have been 
announced in the US and significant increases in spending on renewable 
energy are expected.
Pulp and paper
The North American market is mature, with growth in capital spending 
being driven by Asia and to a lesser extent, South America and 
Eastern Europe.
Process industrials (includes food, cement, alternative fuels, facilities)
 –  Food: The US market is expected to remain flat, with capex shifting from 
Americas to Central and Eastern Europe.
 –  Cement: Old plants/technology is being replaced due to high operating 
costs and environmental legislation. This, coupled with supply shortages 
is expected to result in good growth in this sector for the next three 
to five years.
 –  Alternative fuels: Strong growth is expected to continue in the ethanol 
and bio-diesel markets. 
 –  Facilities: Significant levels of spending on public and private sector 
hospitals, research and development facilities and universities are 
expected to continue. 
Infrastructure
The market outlook is strong in both the US and Canada. 
The total available market to AMEC’s North American Industrial business in 
its chosen sectors is worth in excess of US$2 billion per annum. Most of the 
business’s key markets are forecast to have capital expenditure growth in 
excess of 8 per cent per annum over the next three years (source: AMEC).
Nuclear
AMEC is the UK and Canada’s leading private sector supplier of project 
management and engineering services to the nuclear industry and also 
provides services in the Americas, South Africa, Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union. Services are provided throughout the life of nuclear assets, from 
programme management and project delivery, operations support for existing 
assets to decommissioning and waste management. Specialist design, 
engineering, technical and consultancy services are also available.
AMEC has a proprietary waste vitrification technology, Geomelt
®
, which uses 
an electric current to vitrify nuclear waste into a solid, glass-like material. 
Geomelt
®
 could be used in the clean-up of nuclear facilities around the world.
In January 2006, AMEC formed an alliance with the United Kingdom Atomic 
Energy Authority (“UKAEA”) and CH2MHILL to target selected opportunities 
in the emerging nuclear decommissioning and clean-up market, which is 
expected to be worth approximately £2 billion a year . In June 2006, AMEC and 
UKAEA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Korean Power 
Engineering Company to win work in the multi-billion pound South Korean 
nuclear market, and in January 2007 , AMEC signed a two-year , general 
service agreement with China’s Third Qinshan Nuclear Power Company, 
owner/operator of two CANDU nuclear power stations.

Financial performance 2006
Revenue for the period increased by 36 per cent to £817 .4 million (2005: 
£602.9 million), with revenue from US Industrial doubling and a 26 per cent 
increase in UK Industrial. Power and Process also benefited from a full year 
of sales from the nuclear engineering services business NNC, which was 
acquired in July 2005. 
Growth in these areas was offset by the expected reduction in revenues 
from joint venture activities in Iraq, which fell from £163.0 million in 2005, 
to £63.4 million. All joint venture contracts were substantially complete 
by the end of 2006. 
Adjusted profit for the period was £30.4 million (2005: £36.7 million) and margin 
3.7 per cent (2005: 6. 1 per cent). The decline in margin principally reflected lower 
margin on contracts secured during 2004/5, together with low profit take 
on the high volume of sales associated with early stages on industrial projects. 
Performance also reflected the expected significant reduction of joint venture 
earnings in Iraq during 2006, which fell from £13.6 million in 2005, to £7 .0 million.
In the UK, gas and electricity markets remained buoyant. During the year , 
AMEC worked on new facilities including gas storage and distribution, flue gas 
desulphurisation systems and refurbishment or replacement of gas mains 
and overhead power transmission lines. In North America, the power 
generation, cement and alternative fuels markets were particularly strong. 
In Nuclear , the NNC business, acquired in July 2005, performed ahead of 
expectations. The major project to restart two reactors for Bruce Power in 
Canada completed its first year on schedule and on budget, with no lost time 
incidents, whilst the UK engineering services business had a good year . 
Performance in the UK capital projects business was below expectation 
as a number of projects were deferred. 
Markets
Over the next 30 years, of 400 civil reactors worldwide, a significant 
number will be either decommissioned or receive life extensions, providing 
major opportunities for AMEC. In the UK alone, the market for decommissioning 
is valued at some £70 billion (Source: UK Department of Trade and Industry). 
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (“NDA”) has published a competition 
schedule for decommissioning which runs to 2012, (subject to any changes 
in government policy).
The focus of this business is to continue to invest and enable AMEC to win 
a major share of contracts from across the expanding global nuclear sector .
AMEC’s programme management and technical expertise is already playing 
a key role in power generation, both in operating reactor support and in reactor 
re-start programmes, while also positioning itself within the growing new 
build programme across the world.
AMEC is supporting the NDA as it creates a competitive market in the multi-
billion pound management and operation of UK nuclear sites, coupled with 
an ongoing decommissioning programme, in addition to undertaking major 
decommissioning work in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   22 4/4/07   11:49:08 Net liabilities at 31 December 2006 were £19.9 million (31 December 2005: net 
assets of £41.3 million) reflecting good cash performance in North America 
and reduced levels of capital employed associated with joint venture 
activities in Iraq.
The Power and Process order book grew strongly in 2006, increasing by 36 per 
cent to £1.46 billion, reflecting strength in power and process markets on both 
sides of the Atlantic. During the year major contracts were won in joint venture 
to fit flue-gas desulphurisation systems in the Kilroot power station, Northern 
Ireland, and the Longannet power station, Scotland, together with contracts in 
the US for LNG and power generation facilities. Since the year end, an AMEC 
joint venture signed a major framework contract with National Grid (value to 
AMEC £237 million) for the upgrade of overhead power lines and underground 
cables across the western half of England and all of Wales over the next five 
years. In Nuclear , AMEC was awarded a two-year decommissioning contract 
for redundant research facilities at the AWE site at Aldermaston, England and 
an initial contract was awarded by UKAEA for a new decommissioning facility 
in Dounreay, Scotland. 
Outlook 2007
Power and Process end markets are strong. 
The industrial businesses in UK and North America are expected to deliver 
strong growth in 2007 . With the strong growth in order book during 2006, 
the industrial business is now more selective in new projects and sets a 
gross margin threshold of 8 per cent on new contracts. This, coupled with 
higher profit take on contracts as they pass key milestones is expected to 
lead to improved margin performance in 2007 .
Continued growth is expected in Nuclear , being driven by the refurbishment 
project at Bruce Power in Canada. In the longer term, significant opportunities 
are emerging in the UK from which AMEC expects to benefit.
Overall performance in Power and Process will be tempered by the cessation 
of joint venture activities in Iraq in 2007 .
STEP Change
As a result of the STEP Change and Operational Excellence programmes, 
the Power and Process business is targeting a 2008 margin of 5-7 per cent.
Strategy
The key challenge for the Power and Process businesses is to improve 
margins. As detailed above, the business is now operating in a stronger market 
environment and is being more selective in new work taken on. The STEP 
Change programme is also expected to improve performance during 2007 . 
Pending improvement in margin, stand alone acquisitions in this area will be 
a lower priority than for other core activities where margins are stronger .
The UK Industrial business aims to maintain its position as a leading supplier to 
the gas and electricity sectors and to develop a strong position in the provision 
of engineering services to the renewables sector and in emissions controls.
In the Americas, the business aims to increase its share of the available 
market and to expand the pulp and paper business into South America.
The Nuclear business aims to strengthen its position as the leading private 
sector supplier of project management and engineering services to the 
nuclear industry in the UK and Canada. With its alliance partners UKAEA 
and CH2MHILL, AMEC is well placed to compete in the emerging market 
in decommissioning and clean-up, where it expects to bid for selected NDA 
contracts over the next five years. Longer term, AMEC intends to develop a 
leading position in the new-build market in the UK.

Revenue increased for the period by 4 per cent to £281.7 million (2005: 
£270.9 million). 
Adjusted profit increased by 8 per cent to £15.2 million (2005: £14.1 million) 
with margin up to 5.4 per cent (2005: 5.2 per cent). The strength of Sterling 
tempered reported results in this business, which is predominantly carried 
on in North America. Performance reflected growth in the US Federal sector 
and continuing strength in the natural resources sectors in North America. 
Outlook 2007
North American markets for environmental services are expected to remain 
good and the Earth and Environmental business is expected to deliver another 
strong performance in 2007 . 
STEP Change
As a result of the STEP Change and Operational Excellence programmes, the 
Earth and Environmental business is targeting a 2008 margin of 6-8 per cent.
Strategy
Earth and Environmental aims to improve margin through its continued 
shift towards higher margin services, with a target of 70 per cent consulting 
services. Growth through the regional services business model will be 
achieved organically and through continued bolt-on acquisitions, which 
will both enhance capabilities and facilitate selective regional expansion.
2006 results were tempered by the 
strength of Sterling

■  Education: The UK is committed to its largest schools capital investment 
programme for 30 years, with spending rising to £8 billion in 2008. 
■  Manufacturing: The UK market is stable, but growth opportunities exist 
with key clients as they invest overseas. Annual spending c. £3-4 billion.
■  Transport: Growth in AMEC’s available market in this sector is expected 
to be tempered as a result of the completion of the large terminal 5 project 
at London Heathrow Airport in 2007 . AMEC has exited lump-sum roads 
contracts as this procurement route is unattractive.
Financial performance 2006
During the year the business continued to exit certain markets in the UK and 
US, as previously announced.
Revenue increased by 8 per cent to £1,150.8 million (2005: £1,063.7 million), 
reflecting activity associated with the 2004/5 order book. 
Performance in Building and Facilities Services was good, though results 
for the year were dominated by other construction activities where adjusted 
losses of £35 million (2005: £7 million) were reported. These results reflected 
poor performance on a number of current contracts and overhead under-
recoveries, as previously disclosed. Significant actions have been taken 
in the UK Building and Civil Engineering business to improve performance: 
a new management team is in place; the business has become more selective 
in work performed, resulting in the order book declining by 23 per cent in the 
second half of 2006; and controls have been reinforced. 
Net liabilities of £283.4 million (2005: £1 14.4 million) reflect the exceptional 
charges made in 2006 of £144.5 million, including £90 million in respect of 
future litigation and settlement costs, largely relating to the North American 
activities which are being closed.
The overall order book in Construction at 31 December 2006 was down 20 per 
cent at £1.18 billion (2005: £1.48 billion), reflecting AMEC’s planned exit from 
certain markets and the changed focus of the continuing business. Major 
contract awards during the year included construction work associated with 
the South Lanarkshire Schools PPP project, a seven-year FM contract 
renewal on the Tate Gallery, London, contracts worth £85 million to deliver 
new further education colleges in eastern England, a £28 million contract to 
refurbish the main runway at Stansted Airport, UK, and refurbishment works 
at Victoria Station, London and Waverley Station, Edinburgh.
Outlook 2007
The outlook across Building and Facilities Services markets is generally good. 
Progress in 2007 is expected to be tempered upon completion of the large 
Terminal 5 project at London’s Heathrow Airport. 
The focus of the UK Building and Civil Engineering business will be on improving 
the quality of work and decreasing risk.
As a result, the business is expected to deliver a small profit in 2007 .
Strategy
On 13 December 2006, AMEC announced that UK Building and Civil 
Engineering and Building and Facilities Services were no longer part of 
AMEC’s core activities. These businesses are the subject of a divestment 
process during 2007 .

The UK Government will continue to use PPP as a procurement route for 10- 15 
per cent of its total investment in public services over the next 5 years (source: 
Strengthening Long Term Partnerships document, March 2006). The National 
Health Service is planning to continue its multi billion pound capital investment 
programme with a substantial part of this to be delivered via PPP . Significant 
opportunities are also expected in education, where the government is aiming 
to improve all secondary school buildings in England under the Building 
Schools for the Future programme within 10- 15 years. 
Property Developments
Property Developments is a property development/urban regeneration 
business. It offers services from land assembly, remediation and planning 
through to financing and project management, and has particular expertise in 
mixed-use urban regeneration projects. Property Developments participates 
in two particularly important strategic partnerships, with ECf, to regenerate 
inner city locations and ISIS, to redevelop British Waterways’ large portfolio of 
non-operational sites across the UK canal network. The business generates

AMEC is a leading player in the UK wind farm development market. Services 
include identifying sites, undertaking environmental studies and developing 
planning applications, site engineering and design, wind resource assessment 
and economic modelling and stakeholder management. The onshore portfolio 
of around 1,100MW is outlined below. Offshore, AMEC is leading the 
development of a 75MW development near Aberdeen, and is providing 
development and environmental services to Centrica on projects with a 
potential output exceeding 1,000MW.
Planning committee approval (subject to conditions and a legal agreement) 
was received in March 2007 for the 18 turbine Edinbane project, and decisions 
are anticipated on Clashindarroch, Ray and possibly the Isle of Lewis during 
the remainder of 2007 . The business is hopeful for planning decisions on Kyle, 
currently the subject of a public inquiry, and three other developments before 
the end of 2008, with decisions on the remainder of the current portfolio, 
including the Aberdeen offshore development, during 2009.

Financial performance 2006
Overall, the Investments business performed strongly in 2006. 
Adjusted profit increased by 28 per cent to £21.3 million (2005: £16.6 million). 
Performance in both 2005 and 2006 was dominated by substantial profits 
arising from the sale of two PPP assets. In addition, 2006 saw increased 
profits from concessions. 
In June 2006, financial close was reached on the South Lanarkshire Schools 
project in which AMEC has a 33 per cent equity stake. Also in June, Essex 
Rivers NHS Trust unexpectedly announced the cancellation of the Colchester 
General Hospital PFI scheme where AMEC, in joint venture, was preferred 
bidder . The project had been expected to reach financial close during 2006. 
A claim in respect of the costs AMEC incurred has been submitted to Essex 
Rivers NHS Trust and discussions with the NHS are progressing.
In Property Developments, good progress has been made on major mixed 
use urban development schemes, with a start on site on the 1m sq ft scheme 
at Chatham Place, Reading, and development agreements on similar sized 
schemes at Lewisham and Stockton.
AMEC’s two multi-project partnerships continue to make progress, although 
ISIS suffered from delays in planning during the year . ECf made progress on 
St Paul’s Square in Liverpool and Plymouth, and was selected as preferred 
partner in Central Salford and on an extension to the Liverpool scheme.
The only overseas development in the Property Developments portfolio, 
in Leipzig, Germany, was sold to a 50:50 joint venture in September 2006, 
resulting in a £33.8 million reduction in financial guarantees provided 
by AMEC.
The Wind Energy business continued to develop its portfolio and recorded a 
loss of £4 million arising from the development costs that have been incurred. 
The business is expecting significant progress in securing planning consents 
during 2007 and 2008. 
The PPP portfolio valuation in 2006* 
increased to £1 32 million

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   32 4/4/07   11:49:26 PPP portfolio valuation
The PPP portfolio valuation at 31 December 2006 was £132.1 million 
(2005: £109.5 million), based on a weighted average discount rate of 9.1 per 
cent (2005: 10.6 per cent). Net book value of the portfolio at the same date 
was £69.8 million.
The valuation is sensitive to discount rates, which have been improving in the 
UK. For illustrative purposes, a discount rate of 6 per cent would value the UK 
portfolio at around £140 million. This is illustrated in the chart below. 
Details of the valuation methodology are set out in the financial review 
on page 40.
Outlook 2007
The PPP and Property Developments businesses are expected to make 
satisfactory progress in 2007 , but profits from the sale of PPP assets are 
expected to be at a lower level than in 2006. 
Progress in Wind Energy remains subject to the planning process, but the 
business remains confident that after a long period of gestation, momentum 
will increase during 2007 .
Strategy
On 13 December 2006, AMEC announced PPP and Property Developments 
as being non-core activities. These businesses are the subject of a divestment 
process during 2007 . 
Wind Energy and the Incheon Bridge concession remain core business 
activities and will be retained by AMEC.

Changes arising from corporate activity 
On 27 July 2006, AMEC completed the sale of AMEC SPIE to PAI partners for a 
cash consideration of approximately b1 billion (£684 million). This disposal has 
strengthened the balance sheet and generated a post-tax exceptional gain of 
£31 1 million.
On 5 September 2006, AMEC completed the disposal of its Houston-based 
pipelines company, US Pipeline, Inc. to Dearborn Resources, Inc., a company 
owned and managed by its previous president for a consideration of £1 1 million.
On 19 February 2007 , AMEC announced that an unconditional agreement 
had been reached for the sale of its 50 per cent interest in AMEC SPIE Rail 
to the French infrastructure company Colas SA. Completion is expected 
on 2 April 2007 .
AMEC made two small acquisitions during 2006. In January, 50.2 per cent of 
the Romanian nuclear company Stevenson & Associates SRL was acquired 
and in July, AMEC acquired Coastal Ocean Associates, based in Nova Scotia, 
a company specialised in professional oceanographic, numerical modelling 
and scientific technical services.
Basis of preparation of the accounts
The 2006 annual report and accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the EU 
as at 31 December 2006. 
The directors have identified the policies for accounting for construction 
contracts and retirement benefits as the most critical because they involve 
high levels of judgement and estimation.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   34 3/4/07   15:35:10 Construction contracts
A significant amount of the group’s activities are undertaken via long-term 
contracts. These contracts are accounted for in accordance with IAS 1 1 
“Construction contracts” which requires estimates to be made for contract 
costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the 
latest available information, which includes detailed contract valuations. In 
many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual 
obligations which span more than one reporting period. Contract costs and 
revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome 
of future events and often need to be revised as events unfold and uncertainties 
are resolved. The estimates are updated regularly and significant changes are 
highlighted through established internal review procedures. In particular , the 
internal reviews focus on the timing and recognition of incentive payments 
and the age and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to the 
contract scope or claims. The impact of the changes in these accounting 
estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
Retirement benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with 
the advice of independent qualified actuaries, but significant judgements 
are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension 
increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that underpin 
their valuations. For AMEC, these assumptions are important given the relative 
size of the scheme that remains open.
Key performance indicators
The board and executive management monitor a range of financial and non-
financial performance indicators, reported periodically, to measure the group’s 
performance over time. Of these, the key performance indicators (“KPIs”) are 
shown in the table below.
■  Safety KPIs show how successful AMEC has been in protecting its 
employees from harm.
■  Operational KPIs indicate the volume of work for which orders have been 
received and the profitability of activity undertaken.
■  Balance sheet indicators focus on the financial efficiency and balance sheet 
strength of the business.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   35 3/4/07   15:35:13  www.amec.com
Results of continuing operations 
Revenue for the year increased by 14 per cent to £3,229.2 million (2005: 
£2,843.8 million), with growth throughout the core businesses, but in 
particular Power and Process, with revenue from US industrial activities 
doubling and a 26 per cent increase in UK industrial activity. Power and 
Process also benefited from a full year of sales from the nuclear business 
NNC, acquired in July 2005. Revenue from UK and US lump-sum Building 
and Civil Engineering activities was 9 per cent higher than in 2005, as the 
planned exit from certain markets continued and the existing order book 
was worked through.
Adjusted pre-tax profit was £64.7 million, a £9 .2 million shortfall on the previous 
year (2005: £73.9 million). Natural Resources and Earth and Environmental 
performed well and there was a significant profit from disposal of a PPP asset. 
However , this was not sufficient to offset continued losses in Construction 
and reduced profit in Power and Process, where there was reduced joint 
venture activity in Iraq, low margin on industrial projects in the early stages 
of completion, and project deferrals in UK nuclear capital projects.
There was a pre-tax exceptional charge of £169.9 million (2005: £87 .1 million) 
and intangible amortisation of £3.6 million (2005: £4.5 million), resulting in 
a pre-tax loss of £108.8 million (2005: loss of £17 .7 million).
Diluted earnings per share* from continuing operations were 3.0 pence lower 
than in 2005 at 14.5 pence (2005: 17 .5 pence).
The board is recommending a final dividend of 8.0 pence per share (2005: 7 .5 
pence) which, together with the interim dividend of 4.2 pence per share (2005: 
4.0 pence), results in a total dividend of 12.2 pence per share (2005: 1 1.5 pence) 
an increase of 6 per cent. 
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses increased by £45.3 million to £239.1 million reflecting 
the full year impact of acquisitions made during 2005 and growth in 2006, and 
remain at around 7 per cent of revenue.
The impact of the STEP Change programme will have a significant impact on 
the level of overheads in the group from 2008 onwards as discussed earlier .
Corporate costs, which represent the costs of operating the head office of 
AMEC and certain regional overheads were slightly higher than in 2005, with 
costs rising in-line with inflation. Actions taken as a result of the STEP Change 
programme should result in a lower level of corporate costs in the future.
Share of joint ventures and associates results 
The share of results of joint ventures was £9.8 million (2005: £1 1.0 million), 
reflecting reduced contribution from the UK Rail businesses, which are 
now accounted for as associates, offset by growth in contributions from 
Developments and Urban Regeneration activities and the Project Equity 
Investments business.
Net financing costs
Following the receipt in August 2006 of the proceeds from the disposal of 
AMEC SPIE, the group has been in a net cash position. Around £500 million 
of bank borrowings were repaid, and there was an early pre-payment of its 
Private Placement note obligations with a face value of £1 12 million. 
The net finance charge for the year reduced to £4.2 million (2005: £16.9 million), 
with a benefit of approximately £17 million from the AMEC SPIE proceeds 
including the interest on inter-group borrowings. As a consequence of the 
substantial reduction in outstanding debt, AMEC terminated early all related 
interest rate swaps. The total cost of unwinding all fixed rate liabilities, 
including the Private Placement notes amounted to approximately £3 million. 
This is included as a cost of the disposal transaction and offset against the 
total gain on disposal.

committed facilities of £465 million.
Net interest payable was covered 14 times (2005: 5 times) based on profit 
before taxation, intangible amortisation and exceptional items and excluding 
AMEC’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates. AMEC remains 
in compliance with its interest cover ratio banking covenant where profit to 
net interest payable must be not less than 3: 1*.
The ratio of average weekly net debt to earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) was 1.1 times for the continuing 
group for 2006 (2005: 2.5 times). However , following the sale of AMEC SPIE in 
July 2006, AMEC has held average net cash balances of £190 million and net 
cash as at 31 December 2006 was £354.9 million. The maximum level of debt 
permitted by banking covenants remains at 3.5 times EBITDA*.
T axation
The group’s effective tax rate in 2006 for the continuing businesses before 
exceptional items (including tax attributable to joint venture interests) was 
30.1 per cent (2005: 27 .5 per cent). After excluding intangible amortisation, 
the underlying tax rate was 28.6 per cent (2005: 26.0 per cent). The tax rate, 
whilst still benefiting from the use of overseas tax losses, has increased 
overall due to restrictions on the ability of the UK operations, post exceptional 
costs, to claim full relief for overseas branch taxes suffered. A tax credit 
of £23.8 million is attributable to exceptional charges of £169.9 million. 
At 31 December 2006, the group has deferred tax assets of £16.4 million 
(2005: £70.9 million) primarily arising from tax losses and short-term 
timing differences. At year end, the continuing businesses had in excess 
of £150 million of carried forward tax losses and a deferred tax asset 
of £22.3 million has been recognised on these tax losses as shown below:

UK 72.0  18.0
US 38.0   –
Canada 22.0  4.3
Australia 25.0   –
 157.0  22.3
The group also has deferred tax liabilities of £10.3 million (2005: £47 .1 million), 
mainly arising on liabilities provided for future payments for the use of 
consortium relief losses and pension surpluses.
The 2005 comparatives include deferred tax assets and liabilities associated 
with the AMEC SPIE operations now sold/discontinued. 
Intangible amortisation 
Intangible amortisation relates to capitalised software and intangible assets 
acquired as part of the acquisitions of NNC and Paragon in 2005. The 2006 
charge of £3.6 million is £0.9 million lower than last year , with the reduction 
being due to the timing of the write off of certain assets related to the acquisition 
of Paragon in 2005.
In line with IAS 36 “Impairment of assets”, annual impairment reviews have 
been performed on the goodwill carried on the balance sheet. The results 
of these reviews confirmed that the carrying value of the assets is supported 
the results of the underlying business.

Balance sheet highlights
In line with IFRS 5, the 2005 balance sheet is not restated to exclude 
discontinued operations. Accordingly, movements in balance sheet captions 
need additional explanations. 
Key movements in the balance sheet are discussed below:
Fixed assets
The fall in net book value of fixed assets as at 31 December 2006 to £73.3 
million (2005: £158.3 million) reflects mainly the sale of AMEC SPIE. 
Additions of £35.6 million were broadly in line with the depreciation charge 
for the year of £35.1 million.
The depreciation charge for the year includes a full charge in respect of the 
businesses held for sale as at 31 December 2006 and seven months of AMEC 
SPIE, which was sold in July 2006. As a result, the depreciation charge will 
fall in 2007 .
Exceptional items
Exceptional provisions were made in 2005 relating to AMEC’s exit from lump 
sum fabrication work in the upstream (Natural Resources) and other markets 
(Power and Process). In 2006, further provisions (£25 million) were made, 
reflecting settlement of the major final accounts for upstream fabrication and 
the ongoing arbitration on a completed overseas Power and Process project.
In 2005, exceptional provisions were also made for the costs of withdrawing from 
certain loss making construction markets in the UK and US. In the first half of 2006, 
AMEC made additional provisions for the completion of ongoing construction 
projects, litigation and other costs totalling £57 million (Construction).
In the latter part of 2006 and following negative developments on several major 
disputes, AMEC made further provisions of £68 million, largely, in respect of 
future settlement and litigation costs. These provisions reflect the view that 
AMEC should seek to settle these disputes. Where settlement cannot be 
secured on a reasonable basis, AMEC will continue to defend its position.
Details of the material legal actions are set out in note 30 to the accounts on 
page 99. The balance sheet includes no debtors or work in progress related 
to these contracts.
In addition, impairment and other provisions associated with a concrete 
segments business of £15 million were made, together with costs of £4 million 
associated with the potential separation of the Energy and Process activities 
from the Built Environment activities.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   38 3/4/07   15:35:18 Intangible assets
The net book value of intangible assets as at 31 December 2006 was £197 .6 
million (2005: £477 .9 million), including goodwill £187 .9 million, software 
£3.0 million and other intangibles £6.7 million.
The reduction in goodwill relates to the disposal of AMEC SPIE. Other 
intangibles and software have reduced from £42.7 million as at 31 December 
2005 to £9.7 million, with a reduction of £27 .6 million from the disposal of 
AMEC SPIE and amortisation of £3.6 million. 
Interests in joint ventures and associates
Interests in joint ventures and associates at £85.2 million are in line with 
2005 (£85.0 million). 
Additional investments in AMEC’s PPP portfolio and certain Property 
Development activities have been offset by the disposal of joint ventures 
held by AMEC SPIE.
Following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, the 50 per cent interest in the 
UK rail business is accounted for as an associate.
Working capital
Days sales in stock/wip and receivables are as follows:
   2006  2005 2004
   Days Days Days
Group 82 118 117
UK Building and Civil Engineering 58 79 84
Energy and Process 84 96 100
The reduction in UK Building and Civil Engineering reflects settlement on 
several contracts which had been completed in previous years together with 
reduction in carrying values of other projects where settlements had not 
been secured. 
Days sales in stock/wip and receivables for Energy and Process continued 
to decline in 2006, as final accounts were settled in lump-sum fabrication 
and other activities. Since the year end, final accounts for substantially all 
lump-sum fabrication activities have been settled, reducing days sales to 
about 77 days.
Derivative financial instruments
As at 31 December 2006, there were derivative financial instruments with a net 
value of £7 .1 million (asset) (2005: £15.5 million (liability)) on the balance sheet. 
This net asset represents the fair value of foreign exchange contracts used to 
hedge the cash flows of foreign currency contracts, and cross currency swaps 
used to hedge the net investment in overseas subsidiaries. 
Distributable reserves
As at 31 December 2005, the distributable reserves of AMEC plc stood at 
£1 10 million. Following the disposal of AMEC SPIE by a subsidiary company 
a dividend of £400 million was received by AMEC plc, this being the principal 
reason for the significant increase in distributable reserves to £455 million 
as at the year end:

PPP portfolio valuation methodology
A directors’ valuation of the PPP portfolio has been carried out as at December 
2006 on a consistent basis with past practice. However , in view of reductions 
in discount rates used to value PPP portfolios in recent UK transactions, the 
directors have reduced the discount rate applicable to UK PPP concessions 
by 1.5 per cent since their previous valuation. 
The valuation is derived by applying discounted cash flow analysis to future 
forecast cash flows to which AMEC is entitled either as shareholder or holder 
of subordinated debt for each project in the portfolio. The forecast cash flows 
are derived from the detailed financial models for each of the 12 projects 
in the portfolio.
The models are approved and updated by the project company in line with 
operational experience and lenders’ requirements. Copies of the models are 
given by the project companies on a six monthly basis to lenders and investors. 
Typically, the project models are audited on behalf of the funders at financial 
close and also when there are major changes to the scope of each project such 
as a refinancing. The models have been analysed to determine forecast future 
cash flows to AMEC. A discounted cash flow exercise is then applied to cash 
flows which are post-tax to the project company but pre-tax to AMEC. No value 
is attributed to preferred bidder positions in the portfolio valuation, neither is 
any recognition made for additional future cash flows that are not contractually 
certain, for example potential refinancings. The portfolio valuations include the 
benefit of UK consortium relief where applicable, discounted at 9 per cent.
Pensions
The IAS19 pre-tax surplus of principal UK pension schemes at the end of 2006 
of £105.6 million was higher than in 2005 (2005: £74.7 million) due mainly to the 
assets achieving a return higher than the expected increase in the value of the 
liabilities and additional contributions made by the company.
The regular triennial valuation of the UK schemes took place during 2005, and 
at that time updated mortality assumptions, which incorporate an allowance 
for additional longevity improvements in future, were agreed with the 
schemes’ trustees. These assumptions were chosen with regard to the latest 
available tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the 
schemes’ membership. For the main UK pension plans, the tables adopted are 
part of the PA92 series of tables, taking into account each member’s year of 
birth adjusted by an age rating of +3 years, and allowing for “medium cohort” 
improvements in longevity. For a male/female aged 60 in 2005, these tables 
show a life expectancy of 23.8/26.8 years. For a male/female aged 40 in 2005, 
the tables show a life expectancy from age 60 of 25.0/27 .8 years.
In association with the Trustees of the Schemes, AMEC will continue to monitor 
scheme mortality experience and will revise assumptions as appropriate.
In order to maintain the relatively strong funding position of the schemes, 
AMEC increased its cash contributions during 2006 and at the same time 
offered employees the choice of either increasing their own contributions 
to maintain current benefits or accepting a lower benefit scale. Company 
contributions of £31.4 million were paid during the year (2005: £22.8 million) 
including special contributions agreed with the schemes trustees of 
£4.5 million (2005: £5.0 million).
The principal financial assumptions are set out in note 15 of the accounts. 
At the end of 2005, there was a liability of £56.2 million in respect of an 
unfunded defined benefit scheme for certain employees in France. Following 
the disposal of AMEC SPIE, this liability is no longer included in the 
consolidated balance sheet.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   40 3/4/07   15:35:22 The discount rate utilised is 8 per cent (previously 9.5 per cent) for availability-
based projects and 9 per cent (previously 10.5 per cent) for volume risk-based 
projects. A premium of 4 per cent is added to project cash flows in the 
construction phase and a premium of 2 per cent is added for the ramp-up 
phase, being 2 years from the start of operations. A discount rate of 15.5 per cent 
has been used for overseas projects in the construction phase. 
The weighted average discount rate for the portfolio is 9.1 per cent (2005: 
10.6 per cent). 
Investments in joint ventures
AMEC’s interests in PPP concession companies and several property 
development companies are accounted for using the equity method. These 
joint ventures are all stand alone businesses where AMEC is in partnership 
with others, and are independently funded with only limited support from 
the shareholders.
AMEC’s share of net bank debt in PPP companies was £624.9 million as at 
31 December 2006 (2005: £541.2 million).The net debt in PPP joint ventures 
is without recourse to AMEC. As at 31 December 2006, financial support 
was limited to equity commitments of £26.2 million (2005: £25.1 million) 
and contingent equity of £34.2 million (£34.2 million). AMEC believes that 
the circumstances under which it will be called upon to invest the contingent 
equity are remote.
Cash flow and current liquidity
At 31 December 2006, AMEC had net cash of £354.9 million (2005: net debt of 
£385.1 million excluding AMEC SPIE). The year end cash position is not a good 
representation of the group’s average cash position. As a result, the group 
focuses on the weekly average level of net cash/net debt throughout the year .
Average weekly net cash for the period following the receipt of AMEC SPIE 
disposal proceeds (£684 million) in August to the year end was £190 million. 
During 2007 , the directors expect weekly average net cash to be around 
£250 million before the impact of the ongoing share buy back programme, 
acquisitions and disposals.
The group’s cumulative cash flow* of £306.5 million for the 1 1 years from 1996 
was well in excess of cumulative retained profit** plus provision for future 
litigation costs of £179.4 million over the same period.
The group’s cash conversion charge for the 1 1 years from 1996 is shown below.

AMEC’s principal activities are in project management, construction and 
engineering services to clients in energy and process and public sector markets.
The maintenance of high standards of safety and service remain important 
in securing repeat business from customers.
Principal business opportunities include continued high oil and gas and 
commodity prices, which would result in continued strength in AMEC’s Energy 
and Process businesses, and continued strength in government spending on 
public sector assets, which would provide continued opportunities in the Built 
Environment businesses. 
AMEC has invested £3-4 million per annum in developing its portfolio of wind 
energy projects. Should any of the major projects receive planning approval, 
this business is expected to begin to make a contribution to the group.
The price of oil and gas, commodity prices and levels of business confidence 
across power and process markets are key drivers for AMEC’s businesses. 
A sustained and significant reduction in oil and gas or commodity prices and/or 
a reduction in business confidence could have an adverse impact on the level 
of client spending in AMEC’s core markets.
The UK Building and Civil Engineering business has been the subject of major 
restructuring (as described on pages 26-27). AMEC is not aware of any issues 
within projects under construction that are likely to have a material impact 
on the company. 
In the US, AMEC has exited certain construction management activities. The 
company is involved in ongoing litigation relating to these former activities and 
other construction related activities and has made provisions which are 
believed to be adequate, but the outcome of litigation is not certain, as 
summarised in note 30 on page 99.
In recent years, AMEC has moved away from certain construction activities 
and the level of lump-sum at risk work across the company has been 
significantly reduced, but not eliminated. 
AMEC operates in over 30 countries around the world, serving a broad range 
of markets and customers. As such, the company is subject to certain general 
and industry-specific risks. Wherever practicable, the company seeks to

transfer of risk to insurers, where possible and cost-effective. AMEC uses 
a risk management process which is described in the directors’ report on 
page 57 .
Geopolitical and economic conditions
AMEC operates predominantly in the UK and North America and is therefore 
particularly affected by political and economic conditions in those markets. 
The company is not dependent on any one area of economic activity. Where 
AMEC works outside these markets, it seeks to mitigate exposure to political 
risk through insurance where possible and cost-effective. 
Changes in general economic conditions may influence customers’ decisions 
on capital investment and/or asset maintenance, which could lead to volatility 
in the development of AMEC’s order intake.
Environmental issues
AMEC’s operations are subject to numerous local, national, and international 
environmental regulations. Breaches of, or changes in environmental or health 
and safety laws or regulations, could expose AMEC to claims for financial 
compensation and adverse regulatory consequences, as well as damaging 
corporate reputation.
Legislation or other action
AMEC is subject to a broad range of laws, regulations and standards in each 
of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Failure to comply with these laws, 
regulations or standards could damage the reputation of the company. 
Certain legal liability risks, such as product liability and employer’s liability, are 
transferred to insurers, subject to policy limits and conditions. However , the 
company and its subsidiaries have been in business for many years and there 
is a risk of latent injury claims which may not be fully covered by insurance.
Customer concentration
AMEC is not dependent on any one customer , with its largest being Shell, 
which in 2006 accounted for around 10 per cent* of core business revenues. 
Were dependence on key customers to increase significantly, this could have 
direct consequences on AMEC’s financial development. 
Business continuity
Because of the broad spread and scope of its operations, AMEC’s risk from 
natural catastrophe and terrorist action is varied. Inability to supply against 
contractual commitments is a risk, which could be material in relation to 
larger contracts. These risks are mitigated through business continuity 
planning, which is being developed throughout the group and, where 
practicable, by transferring risk through business interruption insurance.
Information technology (“IT”)
AMEC is exposed to the risk that the IT systems upon which it relies fail. 
This risk is mitigated through the business continuity planning, which is 
being developed throughout the group.
Security of employees
The personal security and the safety of employees and contractors can 
be compromised due to their either being based, or travelling extensively 
on business, overseas. This is mitigated by security reviews in each location 
and the hiring of a local specialist security company where appropriate.
Credit
AMEC is exposed to credit risk in relation to customers, insurers and banks. 
Credit control practices throughout the tender and project execution phases 
aim to mitigate this risk in relation to customers. Where appropriate, AMEC 
seeks to insure business risks with insurers of good standing. The insurance 
industry is, however , subject to credit risk, particularly in the event of 
catastrophe or where an insurer has substantial exposure to a specific risk. 
*Excluding lump-sum fabrication sales

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   45 3/4/07   15:35:28  www.amec.com
T reasury risks
The group’s treasury department manages funding, liquidity and the risks 
arising from interest rate and foreign currency movements within a 
framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board. Derivatives and 
conventional financial instruments are used with the aim of limiting financial 
risk. The treasury department does not operate as a profit centre and the 
undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted. 
Funding and liquidity risk
The group finances its operations from retained profits and from committed 
and uncommitted borrowing facilities provided by a syndicate of relationship 
banks. Committed facilities at 31 December 2006 totalled £465 million with 
an average duration of 28 months (2005: 40 months). Headroom under these 
facilities at 31 December 2006 was £439 million. The group’s policy aims to 
ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably 
priced funding to meet both current and future requirements consistent 
with the group’s budget and strategic plans. Borrowings under these 
facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and are unsecured. 
Interest rate risk
AMEC would suffer a reduction in interest income on surplus cash if interest 
rates fall. For example, if cash balances average £250 million during 2007 
a 1 per cent movement in rates would impact interest income by £2.5 million. 
This is not considered to be significant in the context of the group. 
Foreign exchange risk
The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and 
conducts business in a range of foreign currencies, including Euro and US 
dollar or currencies linked to US dollar . As a result, the group is exposed to 
foreign exchange risks, which will affect transaction costs and the translation 
of the results and the value of underlying assets of its foreign subsidiaries. 
Transaction exposures
A significant proportion of the group’s trading income is denominated in the 
local currency of the business operations and therefore provides a natural 
match with the currency of its cost base. Where commercial contracts are 
undertaken, which result in a mismatch between currencies the group seeks 
to mitigate the foreign exchange risk through the use of forward currency 
arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options. As stated 
earlier , contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties 
that depend on the outcome of future events. This can give rise to exposures 
if the cash flows are denominated in foreign currency. Judgements are made and 
hedging decisions are implemented based on the best available information at the 
time and estimates are subsequently updated regularly. There are currently no 
material transaction exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged. 
AMEC recognises that having taken out forward contracts in respect of underlying 
commercial transactions an exposure would arise if the forward contracts had to 
be unwound as a consequence of the anticipated cash flows under such contacts 
being cancelled or otherwise not being received. The total gross nominal value 
of all outstanding forward contracts is approximately £137 million. At 31 December 
2006 the mark-to-market value of these contracts that were out of the money was 
a liability of £2 million. AMEC has no reason to believe that any material outstanding 
forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial 
transactions. 
Translation exposures
A portion of the group’s earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies. 
Such overseas profits are translated into Sterling at the average exchange 
rate prevailing throughout the year . In the past, a portion of Euro denominated 
profits were hedged as this represented a significant proportion of total group 
profits. Following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, this hedging is no longer required. 
There is currently no hedging in place for profits generated in North America 
but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis. 
Business risks and opportunities

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   46 3/4/07   15:35:30 Pensions
AMEC operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes, where careful 
judgement is required in determining the assumptions for future salary and 
pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity. There 
is a risk of underestimating this liability and the pension schemes falling into 
deficit. This risk is mitigated by:
■  maintaining a relatively strong funding position over time; 
■  taking advice from independent qualified actuaries and other professional 
advisers; 
■  agreeing appropriate investment policies with the schemes’ trustees; 
■  close monitoring of changes in the funding position, with reparatory action 
agreed with the trustees in the event that a sustained deficit emerges.
Controls failure
AMEC operates policies and processes as described in the corporate 
governance section on pages 56 to 57 . Failure in these control processes may 
have a material impact on the company. Control weaknesses were identified 
within the UK Building and Civil Engineering business as outlined in the directors’ 
report; steps have been taken to rectify these weaknesses and an appropriate 
control environment had been re-established within the business by 
the year end.
In addition, the group has various assets denominated in foreign currencies, 
principally US dollars and Canadian dollars. Consistent with the group’s policy 
a proportion of these assets including unamortised goodwill have been hedged 
by using cross currency swaps. At 31 December 2006, these net investment 
hedges amounted to approximately £120 million covering approximately 
40 per cent of overseas assets. 
Counterparty risk management 
Cash deposits and financial transactions give rise to credit risk in the event 
that counter parties fail to perform under the contract. The group’s treasury 
department regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counter parties and 
controls the amount of credit risk by adhering to limits approved by the board. 
As a consequence of these controls the probability of material loss is 
considered to be low. 
Litigation
AMEC is subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of 
business and makes provision for expected costs based on appropriate 
professional advice. 
The outcome of legal action is always uncertain and there is a risk that it 
may prove more costly and time consuming than expected. There is a risk 
that additional litigation could be instigated in the future which could have a 
material impact on the company. In some liability cases, legal expenses are 
covered by insurance.

Why a sustainable approach? 
This section looks at why shareholders should be thinking about sustainability 
from the perspective of AMEC’s business and why ensuring a sustainable 
approach to all projects worldwide is important to AMEC. In addition, there is a 
review of AMEC’s performance indicators and of the businesses performance 
against them. 
Growing influence of sustainability
Sustainability can be defined as AMEC’s ability to generate shareholder value 
today without compromising its ability to deliver in future years and for future 
generations. More and more, AMEC is seeing the marketplace evolve to reflect 
goods and services which offer more sustainable solutions in design, delivery 
and support. AMEC must be well positioned to support current and future 
clients in delivering their sustainable goals. 
Clients are asking more questions about how AMEC manages sustainability 
issues such as ethical conduct, community investment and carbon 
management. There is an increasing emphasis on the wider social and 
environmental impact of projects with which AMEC is associated. 
Market place opportunities
The Stern Review, published in November 2006, examined the economic 
implications of climate change on the global economy. Its conclusions were 
clear and simple: the benefits of strong early action outweigh the costs. The 
current level of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is equivalent to around 430 
parts per million (“ ppm”) CO
2 compared to only 280ppm before the industrial 
revolution. Emission of greenhouse gas is rising at an increasing pace with the 
emergence of fast growing economies investing in a high carbon infrastructure. 
The review estimates that to stabilise carbon emissions at 500-550ppm CO
2 
equivalent by 2050 would cost one per cent of annual global GDP . The monies 
would be spent on:

■  Reducing demand for emission intensive goods and services
■  Increasing efficiency, which can save both money and emissions
■  Action on non-energy emissions, such as decontamination of land
■  Switching to low carbon technologies for power , heat and transport
With AMEC’s range of skills, technical ability and knowledge, it is well placed 
to succeed in the growth of sustainability related business. For example, 
AMEC has significant capabilities in environmental, wind and nuclear energy 
services. In addition, AMEC continues to research and develop many other 
sustainability related innovative technologies, such as carbon sequestration, 
satellite monitoring and low carbon materials. It ensures that AMEC 
is in a strong position to manage both sustainability related market place 
opportunities and risk. 
An important aspect of AMEC’s work is helping to conserve finite natural 
resources such as designing efficient, safe oil and gas technologies, reducing 
the environmental impact of how resources are used, such as emission 
desulphurisation for coal fired power stations as well as looking towards 
tomorrow’s energy sources and infrastructure including nuclear and bio fuel. 
AMEC’s experience is helping clients to deliver projects with long-term 
sustainable benefits as well as contributing to minimising the impacts 
of resources essential to today’s economy and lifestyle. 
Sustainability in the workplace
AMEC manages and monitors the impact of business activities through 
its company-wide sustainability programme, which continued to evolve 
throughout the year . For a full account of AMEC’s sustainability management 
and performance please refer to the on-line sustainability report at 
www.amec.com
Board commitment and leadership
The board receives regular updates and briefings on significant sustainability 
issues such as safety, health, environmental management and human 
resources. Performance is monitored and action taken as necessary. 
Samir Brikho, chief executive, has responsibility for leading and driving 
the sustainability programme throughout the business.
To help drive improvement, sustainability objectives were part of the 2006 
executive directors’ bonus scheme.
Continuous improvement
AMEC’s minimum requirement is to ensure the effective management of its 
sustainability impacts by integrating sustainability into day-to-day business 
processes. In addition to this, each business is required to define and deliver 
improvement programmes, known as AMEC Agenda 21s. These programmes 
are a direct response to the UN Agenda 21 call for business and industry to 
implement action within their sphere of influence to address sustainable 
development priorities. (UN Agenda 21 Chapter 30, paragraph 30.1)
During 2006, a further series of sustainability workshops and forums were 
held across the business with the aim of sharing knowledge and information. 
These forums also tracked progress against individual business Agenda 21s. 
AMEC has developed an interactive intranet facility for sustainability 
co-ordinators across the group, to help them share resources, information 
and ideas. This has been an efficient way of making best use of AMEC’s 
resources, with the additional benefit of improving the network of sustainability 
co-ordinators, bringing them closer together .
AMEC has continued to promote sustainable behaviour and business 
performance through brochures and news networks and reached a wider 
employee base during the year . There are opportunities for improvement to 
ensure that people have a clear understanding of their personal sustainability 
responsibilities and to support AMEC businesses in understanding the 
evolving global sustainability agenda.

Sustainability performance indices
Taking part in sustainability performance indices provides AMEC with excellent 
learning opportunities through benchmarking its performance and engaging 
with its peers. The indices in which AMEC participates provide an in-depth 
analysis of its sustainability performance.
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (“DJSI”)
DJSI results influence the investment decisions of asset managers in 
14 countries for a variety of sustainability driven portfolios, including mutual 
funds, segregated accounts, structured products, as well as two exchange 
traded funds. 
During 2006, AMEC achieved a strong performance in both the World and 
Pan- European Dow Jones Sustainability Indices. AMEC was listed as the 
support sector leader in both. This is AMEC’s third year as a participant of the 
index and its third year as sector leader .
Business in the Community
For the last three years, AMEC has been ranked in the Top 100 “Companies 
That Count” index, published annually in the Sunday Times, and has achieved 
year-on-year improvement in its management score.
In 2006, AMEC continued to participate in the Corporate Responsibility, 
Environment and Community indices and all results and confidential feedback 
is included in the on-line sustainability report at www.amec.com.

4155 AMEC_front_06_LH_CS2.indd   50 3/4/07   09:28:41 Future priorities
In years to come, the only truly successful businesses will be those that 
achieve a sustainable balance between their own interests, and those of 
society and the natural world. It is only possible to achieve this through 
wholly integrating sustainability into the way AMEC performs on a daily 
basis, upholding its principles and striving for improvement across the 
“triple bottom line”. 
AMEC’s challenge for 2007 will be to continue to engage its people and 
communicate clearly the ways in which they can support the drive towards 
a more sustainable future. AMEC will continue with its key themes:
■  Ensuring open communication with all stakeholders
■  Improving leadership and employee engagement
■  Continued alignment of the businesses to sustainability goals 
AMEC will continue to use the Agenda 21 approach with the aim of achieving 
more challenging sustainable targets.

Report of the directors 
The directors have pleasure in presenting the annual report and 
accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006. 
Business review 
Information fulfilling the requirements of the business review is 
contained in the business and financial review on pages 12 to 51, 
which includes details of AMEC’s development and performance 
during the year, its position at the year end, and the outlook for  
the future, and is included in this report by references.
Key events 
On 22 May 2006, AMEC announced that it had entered into an 
agreement with PAI Partners for the sale of AMEC SPIE for a cash 
consideration of approximately €1 billion (£684 million). The disposal 
was approved by AMEC shareholders at an extraordinary general 
meeting held on 6 July 2006 and was completed on 27 July 2006, 
generating an exceptional gain of £311 million after tax.  
AMEC SPIE is now treated as a discontinued operation and  
the income statement has been restated accordingly.
On 16 June 2006, AMEC announced pre-tax exceptional charges  
of £79 million. These costs and provisions related to AMEC’s 
withdrawal from certain construction markets in the UK and US,  
oil and gas upstream lump-sum fabrication and other activities,  
and provision for future legal and other costs of disputes.
On 5 September 2006, AMEC disposed of US Pipeline Inc. to Dearborn 
Resources Inc., a company owned and managed by the previous 
president of US Pipeline Inc., for a cash consideration of £11 million.
During the year AMEC made a number of small acquisitions in the 
Earth and Environmental and Nuclear businesses, details of which  
are set out in the business and financial review.
On 13 December 2006, AMEC announced that it had completed  
a comprehensive review of the company’s businesses including 
consideration of their market position, existing client relationships, 
profitability and growth potential. The review also focused on the 
reasons for AMEC’s underperformance in recent years which had 
included a complex organisational structure, high overhead costs,  
a lack of business focus and ongoing litigation.
The review resulted in the decision to retain the following businesses 
as “core”, being Oil and Gas Services, Oil Sands (Engineering and 
Infrastructure), Minerals and Metals Mining, Nuclear, Industrial,  
Earth and Environmental and Wind Energy. Significant potential 
opportunities for investment have been identified to develop the  
core businesses.
The review also resulted in the decision to sell the Built Environment 
businesses, being Building and Civil Engineering, Building and 
Facilities Services, Property Developments and Project Investments, 
together with various specialist activities, as quickly as possible  
during 2007 consistent with optimising value.
AMEC also announced that a review of completed projects in businesses 
or activities which had been exited where it was involved in litigation 
and/or where material final account settlements have been outstanding 
had been undertaken. Following this review, and reflecting recent 
negative developments on three major North American disputes, 
additional pre-tax exceptional charges of £68 million were required. 
These further provisions reflected the board’s view that AMEC should 
seek to settle the disputes, but where settlement could not be secured 
on a realistic basis, AMEC would continue to defend its position.

Directors
Details of the directors of the company as at the date of this report, 
together with membership of the principal board committees,  
are set out on pages 52 and 53. 
Mr J A Monville resigned from the board on 27 July 2006 to 
concentrate on running AMEC SPIE under its new owners. 
Non-executive director Mr J-P Jacamon resigned from the board  
on 31 August 2006. 
Sir Peter Mason stepped down as chief executive of AMEC plc  
on 30 September 2006 and retired from AMEC on 31 October 2006, 
having reached his normal retirement age.
Mr S Y Brikho was appointed to the board on 1 October 2006 as chief 
executive of AMEC plc. Mr Brikho has an employment contract with 
the company with a notice period which was initially set at two years 
on the part of the company, reducing progressively by one month each 
month during the first year of employment to one year after the first 
year of employment. On the part of Mr Brikho, the notice period was 
initially set at one year, reducing progressively to six months after the 
first year of employment.
In accordance with article 91 of the articles of association of the 
company, Mr Brikho will retire from office at the forthcoming annual 
general meeting and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election. 
Mr J M Green-Armytage, Ms M O Hesse, and Mr S J Siddall retire  
in accordance with article 85 of the articles of association of the 
company and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Neither 
Mr Green-Armytage nor Ms Hesse has an employment contract with 
the company. Mr Siddall has an employment contract with the 
company terminable by one year’s notice by either party.
Mr J A Dallas has declared his intention to stand down as a non-
executive director of the company at the conclusion of the annual 
general meeting on 16 May 2007.
Finally, as more fully set out in the business and financial review,  
AMEC announced two further initiatives, being “STEP Change”,  
a programme of change in AMEC’s structure and culture with a target 
of £112 million in annualised overheads savings, and an “Operational 
Excellence” programme designed to strengthen process assurance 
and risk management, improve business focus and provide better 
staff training. 
On 19 February 2007, AMEC reached an unconditional agreement  
to dispose of its 50 per cent interest in AMEC SPIE Rail Systems 
Limited (”ASRSL “) to Colas SA, with completion set for 2 April 2007.
Dividends 
The directors have proposed a final ordinary dividend in respect  
of the year ended 31 December 2006 of 8.0 pence per share. This  
final dividend will be payable on 2 July 2007 to shareholders on  
the register at the close of business on 11 May 2007. 
Dividends paid during the year comprised an interim dividend  
of 4.0 pence per share and a final dividend of 7.5 pence per share  
both in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005.
Share capital 
The authorised and issued share capital of the company as at  
31 December 2006 and movements during the year are set out  
in note 25 on pages 94 and 95. 
A resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting to  
extend authority to the directors to make market purchases of up  
to 10 per cent of the company’s shares within prescribed limits.
On 13 December 2006 the directors announced their intention, 
pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s annual general 
meeting, to return up to £100 million via on-market share repurchases 
during 2007. The directors consider that a share buy back is in the 
best interests of shareholders generally and is expected to result in  
an increase in earnings per share. The share buy back programme is  
not dependent upon receipt of the expected net proceeds from AMEC’s 
strategic disposal programme referred to above. Furthermore, the 
directors will retain sufficient financial flexibility to be able to progress 
AMEC’s strategic growth plans in its core businesses. Repurchased 
shares will be held in treasury.
On 11 January 2007, AMEC announced that it had purchased 350,000 
shares in the market to be held in treasury at a price of approximately 
420 pence per share. No further purchases were made up to the date 
of this report. 
Authority was granted to the directors at the 2002 annual general 
meeting to allot up to £49,790,640 of ordinary share capital, of which 
up to £7,204,249 could be allotted for cash other than by way of  
a rights issue. This authority extends until 8 May 2007. Resolutions 
will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting to further 
extend this authority through to May 2012. The revised Section 80 
amount will be £55,938,640 and the revised Section 89 amount will  
be £8,390,796.
The directors have no present intention of issuing any shares other 
than in respect of the exercise of share options. No issue will be made 
which will effectively alter the control of the company without the prior 
approval of shareholders in general meeting.

their powers, duties and responsibilities as directors of the company, 
any of its associated companies or any other company that the 
director serves as a director at the request of the company. These 
indemnities are Qualifying Third Party Indemnity Provisions as defined 
in Section 309A-B of the Companies Act 1985 and copies are available 
for inspection at the registered office of the company during business 
hours on any weekday (except public holidays).
Employees
AMEC employed on average 21,479 people in continuing activities 
worldwide in 2006. Details are given in note 6 on page 78. On average 
25,450 people were employed by discontinued operations. 
The development of employees, to ensure that AMEC has the 
necessary skills and behaviours to deliver its strategic business 
objectives and to provide for management succession, is given high 
priority. In addition, recognising the importance for the future  
of bringing new people into the group, all businesses have well 
established programmes for recruiting and developing graduates  
and other trainees.
Respect for cultural diversity and equal opportunities are included 
among AMEC’s Guiding Principles which are incorporated into 
management policies and processes worldwide. AMEC’s policy  
is to recruit from the widest labour market, determining the careers  
of all employees solely on merit and making judgements about 
employees free from the effects of bias and prejudice.
It is AMEC’s policy to consider for employment suitably qualified 
disabled people and to assist them in overcoming handicaps at work. 
AMEC recognises that special arrangements are necessary, in view  
of the nature of its main activities, to ensure that disabled employees 
are properly trained for the tasks they perform. AMEC endeavours  
to retrain any employee who develops a disability during employment, 
wherever practicable.
Internal communication is a priority for AMEC, as employees carry 
forward AMEC’s knowledge, brand and reputation. AMEC provides 
numerous direct or electronic opportunities for employees to raise 
issues and discuss matters of concern with management.
Employees share knowledge and are kept informed of developments 
within AMEC through various means, including a weekly letter from 
the chief executive, its intranet AMECnet, internal publications, best 
practice groups, news bulletins and announcements. A global 
conference of senior managers is normally held each year to discuss 
developing issues. 
The company operates an HM Revenue & Customs approved savings 
related share option scheme which is open to eligible UK employees. 
The International Savings Related Share Option Scheme was 
introduced in 2005 and launched in North America and certain 
European countries during that year .
Annual general meeting
As special business, resolutions are being proposed at the annual 
general meeting to authorise the company to make market purchases 
of shares in the company within prescribed limits, to authorise the 
directors to allot shares in the company for a further period of five 
years and to allot a proportion of those shares for cash.
In addition, a resolution is being proposed to amend the articles of 
association of the company to incorporate changes consequent upon 
the enactment of the Companies Act 2006.
Further details of these proposals are outlined in the circular which 
accompanies this annual report and accounts.
Corporate governance
The board is responsible to shareholders for the management of the 
company and for the protection of its assets. As such, it is ultimately 
responsible for implementing AMEC’s systems of internal control  
and for reviewing their effectiveness. These systems are designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and consequently can provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material mis-statement or loss.
The board, through the committees described below and at its regular 
meetings, has a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing significant risks faced by AMEC, including strategy, major 
projects to be undertaken, significant acquisitions and disposals,  
as well as entry to and exit from different markets. Where appropriate, 
business decisions are reached following a structured and 
documented review of potential opportunities and threats, taking 
steps designed to manage or mitigate any residual risk exposure. 
Principal business risks are set out in the business and financial 
review on pages 44 to 47.
Report of the directors
continued
4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   56 4/4/07   10:58:09  Report of the directors AMEC plc annual report 2006 57
AMEC uses a risk management process which is incorporated into  
the AMEC Management and Policy Framework described below.  
The process involves the identification of risks at the gross and current 
level by each business and each corporate function. The risks are 
recorded in separate risk registers for each business unit and each 
function to enable the net positions to be pro-actively managed. The 
highest risks, based on probability and impact, are then consolidated 
into an overall risk register for AMEC plc, which is reviewed in detail 
by the board on an annual basis. 
The risk management process is coordinated via the risk management 
forum, which consists of risk managers/sponsors for the businesses 
and heads of corporate functions. It reports to the risk review 
committee of the board at least annually and also reviews progress 
made in embedding risk management throughout AMEC, 
dissemination of best practice and communication of lessons learned.
The risk management and internal control processes are 
complemented by an annual control risk self-assessment exercise 
carried out by the principal businesses. This covers major risks, 
particularly safety, health and environment, legal, commercial and 
contractual, financial, information technology and human resources. 
The results are reviewed by the board, through both the audit 
committee and the executive directors, and as part of the ongoing 
internal audit process. 
In 2005, AMEC reported that certain established control processes 
were not being followed in the UK construction business. The board 
reviewed the method by which risk management was embedded 
within that business, which highlighted the fact that whilst processes 
were generally sound, there had been, in this case, a failure by 
business management to apply the controls in a consistent manner .
Measures were taken to improve compliance in that business 
including new management appointments, staff training, improved 
project selection processes and closer monitoring of higher risk 
contracts. The new management team has reinforced controls  
to ensure increased compliance and, although improvements have 
been slow to take effect, the board considers that an appropriate 
control environment had been re-established within the business  
by the year end.
Consequently, the risk management processes were in place 
throughout 2006, and up to the date of approval of the accounts,  
and satisfy the requirements of the Turnbull guidance. 
As noted above, AMEC sold its French subsidiary, AMEC SPIE to  
PAI Partners during the year, with completion taking place on 27 July 
2006.  AMEC SPIE continued to comply with AMEC’s policies and 
procedures and controls continued to be reviewed by Internal Audit  
up to that date.
AMEC has interests in a number of joint ventures, associates and joint 
arrangements. Controls within these entities may not be reviewed as 
part of AMEC’s formal corporate governance process because of the 
joint management responsibilities but are reviewed by the joint 
venture boards and as part of AMEC’s normal internal audit process.
Consequently, AMEC complied with the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance throughout 2006.
Management and Policy Framework 
AMEC’s businesses are managed on a decentralised basis. Whilst  
the board has retained reserve powers, the day-to-day management 
has been passed to the business leaders within defined authority 
limits. The management philosophy is to empower the business 
leaders to take the actions necessary to deliver the company’s 
operational business objectives within the AMEC Management  
and Policy Framework, which establishes the standards AMEC 
employees and contracting staff are expected to meet.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders 
Mr Green-Armytage, chairman, wrote to all major shareholders  
in April 2006 informing them that he and the senior independent 
director, Ms Airey, were available for meetings or telephone calls  
with them if required. The chairman attends preliminary and interim 
results presentations. Ms Airey is available to attend, if requested, 
one-on-one meetings with major shareholders. The chairman had  
a number of such meetings with major shareholders during 2006.  
No meetings were requested with Ms Airey. Since his appointment,  
Mr Brikho has met with a number of shareholders.
An in-depth annual perception study of investors’ views, prepared  
by an independent third party, is presented to all board members,  
who also receive unexpurgated feedback reports following 
shareholder meetings or events together with all material brokers’ 
research notes on the company. 
The board 
The board currently comprises the non-executive chairman, three 
executive directors and five independent non-executive directors. 
The company does not combine the role of chairman and chief 
executive. The chairman is responsible for the running of the board, 
with the chief executive being responsible for running the group  
and implementing board strategy and policy. This ensures a clear 
division of responsibilities at the head of the company, so that no 
individual has unfettered powers of decision. The independent non-
executive directors review the relationship between the chairman  
and chief executive each year to ensure that the relationship is 
working effectively. 
The non-executive directors are all considered to be independent  
by the board. They are not employed by the company in any capacity, 
nor have they been in the past. Ms Airey has acted as the board’s 
senior independent director since 21 January 2004. 
The company secretary is responsible for ensuring that board 
procedures are followed and all directors have access to his advice 
and services. 
The board has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval, 
covering areas such as company strategy, the appointment of key 
executives, approval of accounts, approval of the business plan, 
budget and financial policies, review of operating results, risk 
management strategy, ensuring the effectiveness of governance 
practices, succession planning and significant capital expenditure.  
The board is supplied in a timely manner with information which 
enables it to discharge its duties. 
An internal review of the effectiveness of the board and its committees 
was carried out during the year by the chairman, Mr Green-Armytage, 
by way of a review of questionnaires completed at his request by 
individual directors. Findings were considered by the board as part of  
its review of overall board performance. Opportunities for improvement 
in a number of areas were noted, each of which is being addressed. 
The independent non-executive directors also met privately both  
with and without the chairman present and also with both the 
chairman and chief executive together to consider management 
performance and succession issues. A formal process exists for  
the directors to take independent professional advice and receive 
appropriate training in the course of their duties, at the company’s 
expense, organised by the company secretary. 
Board committees
Under AMEC’s Management and Policy Framework, the board  
has formally delegated specific responsibilities to various board 
committees, all of which have written terms of reference. 
4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   57 4/4/07   10:58:09  58 AMEC plc annual report 2006 Report of the directors www.amec.com Report of the directors AMEC plc annual report 2006 59
The remit of each committee is set out below. The quorum is three 
directors, save for the audit and remuneration committees where  
the quorum is two directors. Full details of the constitution and remit 
of the audit, nominations and remuneration committees can be found 
under “corporate governance” on www.amec.com.
The committees chaired by non-executive directors are as follows:
n	 	Audit committee – Reviews the integrity, including the material 
financial reporting judgements, of the company’s accounts, 
including the annual and interim results, related report and 
accounts and Stock Exchange announcements and any other  
formal announcements in connection with the company’s financial 
performance, and recommends their approval to the board. 
 It also reviews the company’s internal financial controls and,  
in conjunction with the risk review committee, the internal control  
and risk management systems. 
 The committee has unrestricted access to company documents  
and meets with the internal and external auditors, and any other 
member of staff, without the executive directors being present, 
as required. The head of internal audit formally reports to the 
committee chairman. 
 It reviews the head of internal audit’s regular reports and  
carries out an annual assessment of the internal audit function’s 
effectiveness. In 2006, this exercise was carried out on behalf  
of the committee by the head of internal audit. This followed  
an independent review of the function by PricewaterhouseCoopers  
in 2005. No material changes were identified as being necessary  
as a result of this exercise. 
 The committee considers the appointment, re-appointment, 
removal, remuneration and terms of engagement of the external 
auditor and makes recommendations to the board. It discusses the 
scope and planning of the external audit and reviews the outcome of 
the external audit and any formal communications from the external 
auditors, including internal control reports. 
 The committee also formally reviews and monitors the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the 
audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional 
and regulatory requirements and makes recommendations to the 
board. During 2006 a review, co-ordinated on behalf of the 
committee by the head of internal audit, was carried out. The audit 
committee has also monitored the implementation of the policy on 
the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
This policy follows the guidelines set out by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and clearly defines 
what work can and cannot be performed by any group company’s 
statutory auditor . It also sets out the necessary approval process for 
those non-audit services that are acceptable. 
 All non-statutory audit or non-compliance tax services provided  
by the auditor are reported to the audit committee. During 2006,  
the fees paid to the company’s auditor, KPMG Audit Plc and its 
associates, for non-audit work were £1.1 million (2005: £1.2 million),  
which comprised £0.8 million relating to taxation and £0.3 million 
for other work (2005: £0.7 million and £0.5 million). 
 KPMG also received fees of £4.9 million which related to the sale  
of AMEC SPIE (£3.3 million) and to the potential separation of the 
group (£1.6 million).
 All additional KPMG fees were approved in accordance with 
AMEC’s policy covering non-audit services. As a result of the 
application of this policy and additional discussions with the 
external auditors, the directors do not believe that KPMG’s 
independence has been compromised as a result of their 
additional work on behalf of the company.
n	 	Nominations committee – Makes recommendations to the board 
concerning the appointment or termination of a director or the 
company secretary and, in the case of a non-executive director  
and the chairman, the extension of an existing appointment. 
	 	The committee also regularly reviews board succession planning,  
in conjunction with reports from the chief executive and group 
human resources director on senior management succession 
planning, so as to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills  
is maintained both within AMEC and on the board. 
 During 2006, the committee, with the assistance of external search 
consultants, conducted the recruitment process that led to the 
appointment of the new chief executive. The outgoing chief executive 
took no part in this process.
n	 	Remuneration committee – Sets, and reviews as necessary,  
the overall contractual and remuneration framework for the 
chairman, the executive directors and the company secretary, 
including pension rights and annual bonus incentives. 
	 	It considers and determines such other matters relating to the 
engagement of the chief executive and other executive directors, 
including matters relating to the enforcement of their service 
contracts and payments on termination, as the chairman and  
chief executive respectively refer to the committee. 
 It agrees the terms to be offered to a proposed new chairman  
or executive director . 
 It reviews the salaries of executive directors annually and the 
chairman biennially, or more frequently as is deemed necessary  
by the committee chairman. It agrees the performance targets  
of executive directors and the levels of bonus to be paid to them  
under the annual bonus incentive scheme. 
 It determines and agrees with the chief executive the remuneration 
policy and structure, including annual bonus, for corporate 
functional executives and senior operational executives immediately 
below board level. 
 It approves performance targets, participation and level of awards  
for any executive share-based incentive scheme.

contractual commitments that fall outside the delegated authority 
limits of the executive directors and other senior management. 
Going concern 
The directors, having made enquiries, consider that the company  
and the group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, therefore, it is appropriate  
to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
Creditor payment policy 
Businesses are responsible for agreeing terms and conditions under 
which transactions with their suppliers are conducted. It is group 
policy that payments to suppliers are generally made in accordance 
with these terms and conditions, provided that the supplier complies 
with all of its obligations in this regard. 
The company had 31 days’ purchases outstanding as at 31 December 
2006 (2005: 30 days) based on the average daily amount invoiced by 
suppliers during the year . 
Donations 
Donations to United Kingdom charities amounted to £186,000 for the 
year ended 31 December 2006 (2005: £108,000). 
Auditors 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this directors’ 
report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware  
of that information.
A resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting for  
the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors of the company.

n  medium and long-term incentives which align the interests  
of shareholders and senior executives by offering the latter  
the opportunity to accumulate significant capital over a period  
but only if stretching shareholder value targets are met; 
n  whilst accepting that within this policy there will be occasions  
when higher or lower levels of remuneration will be appropriate  
in particular circumstances. 
Executive directors’ base salaries and annual bonuses 
The base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually, having 
regard to personal performance, company performance, competitive 
market practice as determined by external research and pay levels 
more broadly within the company. The following salaries have been 
approved from 1 January 2007, representing an annualised increase  
of no more than 4 per cent: 
S Y Brikho £656,500
J D Early £300,116
S J Siddall £393,120
All executive directors participate in the AMEC executive annual bonus 
plan which generates bonus payments calculated by reference to each 
of the following: 
n   the profit achievement of the group, with a target level of bonus 
payable for achieving budget and the maximum pay-out requiring 
achievement of a more stretching target;
n  the achievement of other specific business targets, including  
cash flow and, where relevant, divisional profit; and 
n  individual performance objectives (for example, in relation to safety, 
strategy, business development and organisational issues). In 2007, 
the achievement of the STEP Change plan will be the main or only 
objective for executives.
A separate amount of bonus attaches to each of these components. 
The proportions vary between individuals depending on their specific 
executive roles. The maximum potential annual bonus is 125 per cent 
of base salary for the chief executive and normally 80 per cent for other 
executive directors. In every case, the profit and other business target 
components represent more than half of the potential total. 
In order to recruit the new chief executive, it was necessary to 
guarantee, as part of his joining arrangements, a minimum bonus for 
the first twelve months of his employment. The guarantee for the part 
of 2006 after his joining is set out in note (ii) of the table on page 63.  
For 2007, the guarantee is 62.5 per cent of his salary earned in the 
first nine months of the year . 
Reflecting the planned sale of the Built Environment business,  
Mr Early’s 2007 bonus payment will reflect the achievement of the 
disposals in terms acceptable to the board, the price achieved and 
performance of the constituent businesses up to disposal. In certain 
circumstances, the level of 80 per cent of his rate of salary for the year 
may be exceeded.
In the senior management group, no executive has a base salary  
or total remuneration higher than any executive director . 
Executive directors’ long-term incentives 
AMEC’s principal long-term incentive arrangement is the 
Performance Share Plan 2002 (“PSP”). AMEC’s policy is to make annual 
awards to executive directors, and to a small number of other senior 
executives just below board level, of restricted shares with a value  
at the time of award of up to 175 per cent of base salary. In addition, 
participants are offered a further award, up to a maximum of 25 per cent 
of base salary, of five restricted shares for every three acquired by the 
executives, generally purchased from their previous year’s post-tax 
bonus and held on their behalf as investment shares for the full three 
year performance period. Awards are also made to a wider group, 
with lower levels of face value to reflect seniority and contribution. 
Directors’ remuneration 
report
This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive 
directors and related matters, including long-term incentive awards. 
Remuneration committee membership and advisers 
During the year, the members of the remuneration committee 
comprised Mr J A Dallas (chairman up to 24 August 2006),  
Mr T W Faithfull (chairman from 25 August 2006), Ms E P Airey,  
Ms M O Hesse (until 5 December 2006), Mr P J Byrom (until 5 
December 2006) and Mr J-P Jacamon (until his resignation as a 
director on 31 August 2006). The quorum was reduced from three  
to two members with effect from 5 December 2006. The chairman  
of the board, Mr J M Green-Armytage, attends meetings by invitation 
but is not a member of the remuneration committee. The committee’s 
terms of reference can be found under “corporate governance” on 
www.amec.com or on request from the company secretary. 
In considering the matters within its remit, the committee takes 
account of recommendations from the chairman in respect of  
the chief executive and from the chief executive in respect of other 
executives and is advised by the group human resources director . 
During 2006, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (“New Bridge 
Street”) continued to provide standing advice to the committee  
in connection with its responsibilities. New Bridge Street does  
not carry out material additional work for the company. The terms  
of engagement between the company and New Bridge Street  
are available from the company secretary. 
Remuneration policy 
The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive 
directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration 
packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives 
are based and which: 
n  allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high  
calibre; and
n  incentivise senior executives to achieve superior short-term 
performance and increase the medium and long-term value  
of AMEC for its shareholders and encourage executives to build  
and retain a significant shareholding in AMEC. 
More specifically, the policy is to set: 
n  base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary 
practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering  
and construction comparator companies and other companies 
regarded as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, 
revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation and/or 
geographic coverage;
n  annual bonuses which incentivise the achievement of stretching 
business and individual performance targets and offer the 
opportunity to achieve upper quartile annual cash earnings if these 
targets are achieved;

4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   60 4/4/07   10:58:10 These restricted shares will only vest if pre-determined performance 
conditions are met. For awards made up to and including 2006, the 
requirement for full vesting is for AMEC to be ranked in the top 
quartile of total shareholder return, measured over a three year 
period, of a comparator group. This currently comprises the 
companies that, at the time of grant of each award, are in the FTSE 
Business Support Services, Heavy Construction and Oil Equipment 
and Services sub-sectors, and whose market capitalisations lie in a 
range (as may be agreed from time to time) spanning that of AMEC. 
For the 2006 awards, the range was £350 million to £3,200 million and 
comprised 33 companies including AMEC. If AMEC’s performance is at 
the median, 25 per cent of the award will vest. 100 per cent of the 
award will vest at upper quartile. Between the median and the upper 
quartile, the award will vest on a straight-line basis. No awards will 
vest if AMEC’s performance is below median. However, to ensure that 
AMEC’s underlying performance is properly reflected, no awards will 
vest if AMEC’s earnings per share have grown by less than the rate of 
inflation plus six percentage points over the three year period. 
For the awards made in 2006 and subsequently, the definition  
of earnings per share has been changed to reflect underlying 
performance more accurately in the light of the new International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
Lists of the comparator companies for the awards that lapsed during 
the year and those awards currently subsisting can be obtained on 
request from the company secretary. 
Awards are normally made in April following the publication of the 
annual result. In 2006, awards were delayed because of the sale of 
AMEC SPIE until September, following the publication of the interim 
results. It is intended to revert to the normal pattern of April awards 
for 2007 and subsequent years. 
Following the new chief executive’s strategic review of the business, 
the remuneration committee has decided that the performance targets 
attached to PSP awards should be modified for grants made in 2007 
and future years to create an incentive for executives to deliver the 
strategic plan and to improve the line of sight between performance 
and award. In particular, earnings per share should play a greater role 
in determining the level of vesting of future PSP awards to reflect the 
objective of increasing operating margins.
Accordingly, the remuneration committee will apply the existing total 
shareholder return condition to 50 per cent of a future award. No 
awards will vest under this part unless there has been sustained 
financial growth of the company. The other 50 per cent will be subject 
to an earnings per share growth target. The intended policy is that  
the vesting range will be RPI plus 3 per cent per annum (25 per cent  
of that part of the award vests) to RPI plus 10 per cent per annum  
(100 per cent of that award vests). 
However, for the 2007 awards, taking account of the plans that are being 
implemented to improve the margins and reduce overheads in the ongoing 
business, applying this RPI plus 3 to 10 per cent earnings per share  
growth range is not considered to be sufficiently stretching. Consequently, 
the earnings per share required in 2009 for maximum vesting of the 
relevant portion of these 2007 awards will be 38 pence and the level at 
which 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest will be 26 pence.
Earnings per share will be calculated on a consistent and normalised 
basis by the remuneration committee, having sought appropriate 
external advice on the method of calculation and any adjusting and 
potentially adjusting items. 
The remuneration committee also ensures that, for any performance 
conditions affected by the transition to International Financial Reporting 
Standards, measurement for remuneration purposes will be, as far  
as practicable, consistent year on year . Performance against the total 
shareholder return targets is calculated independently and reviewed 
by the remuneration committee.
The company has a second scheme in place – the Executive Share 
Option Scheme 2002. AMEC’s policy is to grant share options under  
this scheme only selectively and in exceptional circumstances such as 
recruitment. No awards have been made under this scheme since 2004. 
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all 
employee share plans which provide options, without performance 
conditions, related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit  
of £250 savings per month. 
The AMEC Performance Share Plan 2006
On 2 October 2006, Mr S Y Brikho was awarded 785,712 restricted 
shares in AMEC plc under the AMEC Performance Share Plan 2006 
(“Recruitment Plan”) which was adopted in October 2006 specifically 
to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Brikho as chief executive of AMEC 
plc on 1 October 2006. The terms of the awards generally mirror those 
under the Performance Share Plan 2002, which was approved by 
shareholders in May 2002. The award consists of two distinct 
elements; Part A and Part B:
n  Part A is in respect of 241,019 shares and will vest in three tranches 
on 8 December 2006, 10 December 2007 and 3 February 2009 
respectively, subject to continued service but no other vesting 
conditions. This element of the award is designed to compensate  
Mr Brikho for the value of the share incentives he held with his 
previous employer, which lapsed or were forfeit on cessation.
n  Part B is in respect of 544,693 shares and will vest subject to the 
satisfaction of the same performance conditions applying to the awards 
made in 2006 under the 2002 plan, which are described above. 
No further awards may be made to Mr Brikho under the Recruitment 
Plan and no new issue shares or treasury shares will be used  
to satisfy the award.
The award will normally lapse if Mr Brikho leaves AMEC before  
it vests, except where he leaves for certain specified reasons including 
disability, injury, death, ill health, redundancy and retirement. On  
a change in control the award will vest under Part A in total and under 
Part B to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.
The number and/or nominal amount of shares may be adjusted by  
the board on certain variations in AMEC’s share capital and the board 
may require written agreement of any such adjustment by the auditors.
The awards are not pensionable and are not transferable.
Share Ownership Guidelines
It is intended to introduce during 2007, guidelines requiring executive 
directors to build up over a three year period and retain a holding of 
AMEC shares received from incentive plans. A level of one times 
salary is being targeted for executive directors with lower levels for 
less senior executives.
Executive directors’ pension entitlements and benefits 
The executive directors, except for Mr J D Early, are members of  
the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided 
through the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme. The schemes are both 
defined benefit schemes registered with HMRC and also provide for life 
assurance cover and dependants’ pensions. These executive directors 
accrue pension rights which are linked to the length of pensionable 
service and to final pensionable salary and have a normal pension age 
of 60. However executive directors who remain in employment beyond 
60 are able to continue to accrue further pension rights. 
The company is currently consulting with members and trustees  
of the Staff and Executive Pension Schemes over proposals to move 
from final salary to career average revalued earnings (“CARE”)  
in respect of benefits accrued from 1 January 2008 onwards.
The benefits of Mr Brikho and Mr S J Siddall are restricted to a 
scheme earnings cap which is set at £112,500 for the 2006/7 tax year 
(£120,000 for 2007/8) and they receive a taxable supplement to their 
 Directors’ remuneration report AMEC plc annual report 2006 61
4155 AMEC_mid_06.indd   61 4/4/07   10:58:11  www.amec.com
salaries in relation to earnings above the cap. Mr Brikho also has the 
benefit of additional life assurance in respect of earnings above the 
cap. There are no unregistered pension arrangements in force for 
executive directors. 
Executive directors are able to opt-out of further pension accrual, 
particularly if this would provide benefits in excess of the Life Time 
Allowance, in which case they will receive a non-bonusable salary 
supplement of 20 per cent of basic salary in lieu of further pension 
accrual. This applies to Mr Early who ceased to be a member of the 
AMEC Staff and Executive Pension Schemes on 31 October 2005 and 
consequently is not accruing further benefits under either scheme.
If individuals do accrue benefits in excess of the Life Time Allowance, 
the payment of the associated tax liability will be the responsibility  
of the individual and not AMEC. 
Employment related benefits, principally the provision of a company 
car or car allowance, long-term disability and private medical 
expenses insurance, are also provided to executive directors.  
Mr Brikho also receives a temporary accommodation allowance  
that reduces over his first three years of employment.
Executive directors’ employment contracts 
AMEC’s policy is that on appointment, executive directors will 
normally be employed with a notice period of one year . In the event  
of employment being terminated with less notice than this, damages 
will be determined at the time taking account of the circumstances 
leading up to the termination and the individual’s duty to mitigate  
his loss. Executive directors are required to give six months’ notice  
of resignation. Since 1 October 2006, executive directors have  
a contractual retirement age of 65.
Mr Brikho was employed initially with a notice period of two years  
from the company, reducing by one month each month during the first 
year of employment to one year after the first year of employment.  
On the part of Mr Brikho, the notice period was initially set at one year, 
reducing progressively to six months after the first year of employment.
Mr Siddall has an employment contract with a notice period of one 
year but with provision that if the company terminates employment 
(other than for gross misconduct), rather than receiving notice, he will  
be entitled to one year’s remuneration (less tax) as liquidated damages 
in full and final settlement. For this purpose and, as a reasonable 
estimate of loss, remuneration is defined as 1.75 times basic  
annual salary to take account of salary, bonus potential, pension 
arrangements, the value of benefits and compensation for loss  
of office. This recognises that he previously had a notice period  
of two years which was reduced by agreement to one year from  
1 January 2003 without compensation, following the change  
in policy on notice periods.
Mr Early has a contract which terminates on 31 December 2007.  
It may be terminated earlier than this by Mr Early giving six months’ 
notice of resignation.
Service contracts for executive directors do not provide for extended 
notice periods in the event of a change of control. It is not the 
remuneration committee’s intention to introduce such provisions.
External directorships 
Executive directors are not permitted to accept external directorships 
without the prior approval of the board. 
Mr Early is a director of G-Mex Limited for which he receives  
no remuneration.
For the period during the year when he was a director of AMEC,  
Sir Peter Mason was a non-executive director of BAE Systems plc.  
He retained the fee of £73,000 per annum which he received in relation  
to this appointment.
Chairman
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining  
the remuneration and other terms of employment of the chairman  
of the board. The contract of the chairman, Mr Green-Armytage,  
runs to 20 January 2008. It may be terminated earlier than this on six 
months’ written notice of resignation or with payment of six months’ 
fees if the board withdraw their agreement to his continuing to serve 
as chairman, other than for gross misconduct. The chairman’s current 
fee is £200,000 per annum and he is provided with life assurance cover  
of four times the pensions earnings cap. 
Non-executive directors 
The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the 
chairman and the executive directors under delegated authority from 
the board. The non-executive directors receive fees for their services 
and do not participate in any of the incentive or benefit schemes  
of the group. Fees were reviewed with effect from 1 January 2007.
The current fee is £47,500 per annum plus a further £5,000 per 
annum in respect of chairing committees of the board other than  
the audit committee, where the additional fee is £12,500 per annum, 
and the remuneration committee, where the additional fee is  
£7,500 per annum. There is an additional fee of £7,500 per annum  
paid to the senior independent director . The policy with regard  
to fee structure is to reflect time commitment and responsibility  
of the various roles.
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees for other 
duties undertaken on behalf of the company. 
The board’s policy is that non-executive director appointments  
are normally for three consecutive three year terms, subject to  
review after the end of each term. The non-executive directors  
as at 31 December 2006 have fixed-term contracts which run  
until the dates set out below: 
  Date of contract Service review date
E P Airey 26 May 1999 25 May 2008

P J Byrom 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
T W Faithfull 10 February 2005 9 February 2008
The contracts of non-executive directors may be terminated by  
the individual at any time and there are no specific provisions for 
compensation in the event of early termination by the company. 
In accordance with the articles of association of AMEC, all directors 
are required to seek re-election by shareholders every three years. 
 * Mr Dallas will be standing down as a non-executive director at the 
conclusion of the annual general meeting on 16 May 2007.

Notes 
(i)  Sir Peter Mason, Mr Siddall and Mr Brikho received a taxable supplement of 20 per cent of salary above the pension earnings cap.  
Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary in lieu of further pension accrual. 
(ii)  The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of  
80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 20 per cent, Mr Early 21.2 per cent and Mr Siddall 36 per cent. (Sir Peter Mason’s bonus is calculated on base 
salary for the 10 months of the year that he worked, including October when he was no longer a director .) No bonus has been paid this year 
in respect of the AMEC plc profit element which was below the threshold target. The awards made reflect varying degrees of achievement 
against other specific business targets and personal objectives (which included AMEC plc cash flow, the SPIE disposal and the strategic 
review in the case of Sir Peter and Mr Siddall, and profit and cash flow of the Investments business in the case of Mr Early). 
 As outlined in last year’s report, the figure for Mr J A Monville relates to a special incentive geared to both the proceeds of the sale of AMEC 
SPIE, which exceeded original expectations, and the maintaining of budgeted financial performance up to the point of sale. This replaced 
his normal annual bonus for the year . Mr Brikho’s bonus represented the maximum 125 per cent of base salary for the three months of  
the year after joining AMEC, reflecting his excellent performance since his appointment. As part of his joining arrangements, he had been 
guaranteed a minimum payment of 75 per cent of this maximum for the balance of 2006. 
(iii)  The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling 
expenses and private medical expenses insurance. Unemployment insurance was also made available to Mr Monville in accordance  
with French practice. 
(iv) As a one-off arrangement, non-executive directors other than the chairman each received additional fees of £20,000 to recognise the 
exceptional time commitment resulting from the company’s strategic review and sale of SPIE. Ms Airey received £1,667 for chairing  
the trustee boards of the main UK pension schemes up to 1 March 2006. Ms Hesse received US$ 10,000 for chairing the North America 
Advisory Board.

Notes 
(i)  For the performance share awards made in April 2003, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the 
awards lapsed in April 2006.
(ii)  A proportion of Sir Peter Mason’s performance share awards lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portions of the 
relevant performance periods. The performance conditions relating to Mr Monville’s share awards were tested at the time of leaving.  
The minimum conditions were considered not to have been met and as a result the awards lapsed.
(iii)  The awards made to Mr Brikho under the Recruitment Plan that vest in Dec 2006, Dec 2007 and Feb 2009 are not subject to performance 
conditions. These replaced share awards made by his former employer which were forfeit on joining AMEC.
(iv)  The first portion of Mr Brikho’s award under the Recruitment Plan vested on 8 December 2006 at a vesting price of 415.5 pence, being  
the closing market price for the previous day.
(v)  The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan 2002 have not been varied during the year .
(vi)  The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2006 was 421.50 pence (2005: 343.50 pence).
(vii)  The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 271.25 pence to 439.50 pence.
(viii)  The register of directors’ interests, which is open to inspection at the company’s registered office, contains full details of directors’ 
shareholdings, share options and awards under the performance share plans. 
(ix)  Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2006 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for 
each of the current directors would have been: Mr Brikho, £2,933,000; Mr Early, £1,352,000 and Mr Siddall, £2,079,000. These hypothetical 
figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.

(i)  Gain on exercise £1,153,296 (2005: £1,362,000).
(ii)   All awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are subject to performance conditions which require a minimum level of 
earnings per share growth for any vesting and a higher level of growth for full vesting. The minimum performance condition which applies 
to the awards made in 2002 was not met at the second time of testing. These awards are subject to a further retest in 2007. The minimum 
performance condition which applies to the awards made in 2003 was not met at the first time of testing. These awards are subject  
to further retests in 2007 and 2008. Executive Share Option Scheme awards made from 2004 onwards are not subject to retest.
(iii)   A proportion of Sir Peter Mason’s award made in 2004 lapsed on his retirement to take account of the unexpired portion of the performance 
period. The performance conditions relating to Mr Monville’s options were tested at the time of leaving. The minimum conditions were 
considered not to have been met and as a result the awards lapsed. 
(iv)   Had the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2006, the approximate latent gain before appropriate 
taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Mr Early, £434,000 and Mr Siddall, £528,000. These hypothetical figures assume 
that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.
(v)   The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year and all subsisting awards were made at nil cost.

Notes 
(i) Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year .
(ii) Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
(iii)  The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption 
service terminated at the year end. It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the director’s contribution.
(iv)  The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company 
and directors, such as stockmarket movements. It is calculated after deducting the director’s contribution.
(v)  Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
(vi)  Sir Peter Mason retired on 31 October 2006 and elected to take a lump sum of £178,803 and residual pension of £28,987 per annum.  
The figures in the table include allowance for these amounts. If allowance for the lump sum is excluded, in accordance with Companies  
Act Regulations, the year end value reduces to £655,540. The change in value during the period also reduces by the same amount, such 
that the transfer value at the end of the period is actually £96,053 less than the transfer value at the beginning.

Notes to the consolidated accounts
1 Significant accounting policies
AMEC plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
Statement of compliance
The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc (“AMEC”) and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year, and the group’s 
share of the profit after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the EU as at 31 December 2006 (“adopted IFRS”) and those parts  
of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts  
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“UK GAAP”); these are presented on pages 102 to 107.
IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosure” was available for early adoption but has not been applied by the group in the consolidated accounts.  
The application of IFRS 7 in 2006 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned only with 
disclosure. The group plans to adopt IFRS 7 in 2007.
During 2006 IFRIC 12 on service concession arrangements was issued. This interpretation is effective from 1 January 2008, but has yet to be 
adopted for use in the EU. In view of this, the directors consider that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in Application Note F  
of the UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 “Reporting the substance of transactions” in determining the accounting model to be applied to 
AMEC’s PPP activities. This involves applying a “risks and rewards” test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model 
should be followed. The directors do not expect this accounting policy to be significantly different to that under IFRIC 12.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  
consolidated accounts.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that 
derivative financial instruments and retirement benefit assets and liabilities are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of 
judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 “Employee benefits” and for long-term 
contracts under IAS 11 “Construction contracts”.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements 
are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that 
underpin their valuations.
A significant amount of the group’s activities are undertaken via long-term contracts. These contracts are accounted for in accordance with  
IAS 11 which requires estimates to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the latest available information, which includes detailed contract 
valuations. In many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual obligations which span more than one reporting 
period. Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events and often need to be 
revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved. The estimates of contract costs and revenues are updated regularly and significant 
changes are highlighted through established internal review procedures. In particular, the internal reviews focus on the timing and recognition 
of incentive payments and the age and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to the contract scope or claims. The impact of the 
changes in accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
On 27 July 2006, AMEC SPIE was sold to PAI partners. The results of AMEC SPIE for the period to 27 July 2006 are consolidated in these 
accounts. During 2006, AMEC decided to exit from pipeline construction as a line of business. AMEC’s pipeline construction business comprised 
three companies which were actively marketed during 2006. One of these companies, US Pipelines Inc, was sold in September 2006, and the 
sale process of the remaining two companies is ongoing.
As a result of the above, both AMEC SPIE and Pipelines are treated as discontinued operations in 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement,  
with the 2005 consolidated income statement and notes 2 to 8 being restated for the same presentation. The results and other disclosures  
in respect of discontinued operations are shown in note 9.
The cash flows are fully consolidated within AMEC up to the date of sale and the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that have  
not been sold at the year end are shown separately on the consolidated balance sheet.
In accordance with IFRS 5, neither the consolidated balance sheet nor the consolidated cash flow statement are restated to exclude 
discontinued operations.

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, the UK rail business was owned by AMEC and SPIE. AMEC SPIE retained a controlling interest and  
the results of the rail business were therefore equity accounted as an associate in 2006, with SPIE’s 50% share of its results presented as 
discontinued. The 2005 consolidated income statement has been restated for the same presentation.
In the 2005 consolidated cash flow statement, the cost of acquisition of shares by trustees of the Performance Share Plan 2002 of £8.7 million 
was offset against the income statement charge of £7.9 million and the net amount presented as a cash flow from operating activities. In the 
2006 consolidated cash flow statement the cost of acquiring these shares has been presented separately as a cash flow from financing activities.
Basis of consolidation
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC. Control is achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the financial and operating policies  
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that 
control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities AMEC has joint control, established by contractual agreement. An associate is an entity  
in which AMEC has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated accounts include the  
group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis. The results  
of joint venture entities and associates are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that joint control or significant influence 
commences until the date that it ceases.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised only to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint venture or associate, unless the 
group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for  
by including the attributable share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it incurs and its share of the income measured according  
to the terms of the arrangement.
Bid costs
Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is appointed as the preferred bidder . Subsequent to appointment as preferred bidder,  
bid costs are capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate 
sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs. Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are applied first 
against the balance of costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional amounts treated as deferred income and released to profit  
over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill
The purchase method is used to account for all business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent  
liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are 
indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves. Under IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards” and IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves. Goodwill arising  
on acquisitions made in the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised and amortised under UK GAAP . This goodwill  
is carried at the UK GAAP carrying value at the date of transition to IFRS and is subject to impairment reviews as described above.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of AMEC’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Construction and other long-term contracts
As soon as the outcome of a construction or other long-term contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised 
in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys  
of work performed. When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that it is probable will be recovered, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. An expected loss on a contract is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope and claims is recognised when it is probable that it will be received and is capable of being 
reliably measured. Incentive payments are recognised when a contract is sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the required conditions 
will be met and the amount of the payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under construction and other long-term contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits,  
less provision for recognised losses and progress billings. These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale
A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations that has either been disposed of or is held for 
sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. An operation is classified as a discontinued operation when the above criteria 
are met, and the comparative income statement is restated to show the operation as discontinued from the start of the comparative period.

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Non-current assets (or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than 
through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or components of a disposal 
group) are remeasured in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets (or disposal group) are measured at 
the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then 
to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and 
retirement benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial 
classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised  
in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present 
value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA rated 
corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified 
actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the year in which they arise.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value. Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value  
is recognised immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. 
No quoted market prices are available for the forward exchange contracts that AMEC enters into. Consequently, fair value is estimated by discounting 
the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, any gain or loss on the effective part of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging 
reserve. The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or 
exercised. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. Where the 
hedged item is a non-financial asset, the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the 
asset is recognised. In other cases the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the 
hedged item affects profit or loss.
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an 
unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying 
value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost 
or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
When hedge accounting ceases, any adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a consequence of the fair value hedge 
relationship, is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Trading results are translated at average rates for the year . Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of trading results 
and monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms  
of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward contracts used 
to hedge those investments, are taken to a translation reserve. They are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal or closure  
of a business. The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to adopted IFRS.
Impairment
The carrying values of all of the group’s assets other than inventories, balances on construction contracts and deferred tax assets are reviewed 
at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying 
value then the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. For goodwill and assets not yet available for use,  
the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

1 Significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired by the group, which include software, customer relationships, trademarks and order backlogs are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is fair value at date of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they 
are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 31 December 2006 are as follows:
Software Three to five years 
Customer relationships Three to ten years 
Tradenames Five years
Inventories
Inventories, including land held for and in the course of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of the development.  
Cost includes cost of acquisition and development to date, including directly attributable fees and expenses net of rental and other  
income attributable to the development.
Leases 
Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income  
and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment, until the relevant 
assets are brought into operational use. The only material projects where this has occurred are those held in the group’s investments in joint 
ventures which are involved in PPP projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and 
equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost,  
less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life. Reviews are made annually of the  
estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual assets.
The estimated lives used are:
Freehold buildings Up to 50 years
Leasehold land and buildings  The shorter of the lease term or 50 years
Plant and equipment  Mainly three to five years
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied  
to external customers. It includes the group’s share of revenue from work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, as set out in the 
accounting policy for construction and other long-term contracts.
Revenue from developments activities is recognised on completion of a signed sale agreement after all material conditions have been met.
Share-based payments
There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares; these awards are granted by AMEC.  
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at  
grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award. The fair value of the award is 
measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted. The amount recognised  
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not achieving the 
threshold for vesting. 
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using statutory tax rates, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect  
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recognised in the accounts and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

2 Segmental analysis of continuing operations – Class of business
On 31 August 2006, AMEC announced a new segmental analysis of activities, which reflects the revised management structure of the continuing 
businesses following the disposal of AMEC SPIE, which was considered to be a separate segment.
As the group’s management and internal reporting are now structured by class of business, this has become the basis for the group’s primary 
segment reporting.
The business and financial review is based on the reported results before joint venture tax, intangible amortisation and pre-tax exceptional 
items, but including joint venture profit before tax. The results as presented in the business and financial review are reconciled to those 
presented in this note in the tables on pages 42 and 43.
The segmental analysis of discontinued operations is shown in note 9. The pipelines construction businesses which were previously included  
in Power and Process are now shown in discontinued operations.

Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of AMEC and also certain regional overheads. These are not directly related  
to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the group’s activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally. 
The unallocated net assets and liabilities principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes, and liabilities relating to dividends and 
taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
Goodwill is not directly attributable to business segments and there is no reasonable basis for allocation of goodwill to business segments.

Natural Resources and Power and Process 
Exceptional provisions were made in 2005 relating to AMEC’s exit from lump-sum fabrication work in the upstream (Natural Resources)  
and other markets (Power and Process). In 2006, further provisions (£25 million) were made reflecting settlement of the major final accounts  
for upstream fabrication and the ongoing arbitration on a completed overseas Power and Process project. This further provision is included  
in exceptional charges in the income statement under litigation and separation costs (£18 million in cost of sales) and costs of exiting  
businesses and markets (£4 million in cost of sales and £3 million in loss on business disposals and closures).
Construction 
In 2005, exceptional provisions were also made for the costs of withdrawing from certain loss making construction markets in the UK and US.  
In the first half of 2006, AMEC made additional provisions for the completion of ongoing construction projects, litigation and other costs totalling 
£57 million. In the latter part of 2006 and following negative developments on several major disputes, AMEC made further provisions of £68 million, 
largely in respect of future settlement and litigation costs. These provisions reflect the view that AMEC should seek to settle these disputes. 
Where settlement cannot be secured on a reasonable basis, AMEC will continue to defend its position. These additional provisions are included 
in exceptional charges in the income statement under litigation and separation costs (£11 million in cost of sales and £46 million in loss on 
business disposals and closures) and costs of exiting business and markets (£10 million in cost of sales and £58 million in loss on business 
disposals and closures). 
Details of the material legal actions are set out in note 30. 
In addition, impairment and other provisions associated with a concrete segments business of £15 million were made together with the cost of  
£4 million associated with the potential separation of the Energy and Process activities from the Built Environment activities. The charges 
associated with the concrete segments business of £15 million are included within cost of sales as exceptional costs of exiting businesses  
and markets. The cost of £4 million associated with the potential separation of activities is included within cost of sales as exceptional  
charges arising from litigation and separation costs.
Other
The exceptional gain of £311.5 million relates to the profit on disposal of AMEC SPIE.

9 Profit for the year from discontinued operations
On 27 July 2006, AMEC SPIE was sold to PAI partners. The results of AMEC SPIE for the period to 27 July 2006 are consolidated in these 
accounts. During 2006, AMEC decided to exit from pipeline construction as a line of business. AMEC’s pipelines construction business 
comprised three companies, one of which was sold in 2006 and the sale process of the remaining two is ongoing.
As a result of the above, both AMEC SPIE and the pipelines construction businesses are treated as discontinued operations in 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement,  
with the 2005 consolidated income statement being restated for the same presentation.
The results of their operations were as follows:
      2006 2005
      £ million £ million
Revenue      1,324.0 2,022.3

13 Interest in joint ventures, associates and other investments continued
Following	 the	 sale	 of	 AMEC	 SPIE,	 the	 group’s	 UK	 rail	 businesses	 are	 owned	 50	 per	 cent	 by	 AMEC	 plc	 and	 50	 per	 cent	 by	 SPIE.	 In	 accordance	 	 with	 IAS	 28	 “Investments	 in	 Associates”,	 AMEC’s	 ongoing	 interest	 has	 been	 accounted	 for	 as	 an	 associate.	 The	 income	 statement	 for	 2005	 	 has	 been	 restated	 to	 present	 the	 UK	 rail	 business	 as	 an	 equity	 accounted	 associate,	 with	 50	 per	 cent	 included	 in	 continuing	 operations	 and	 	 50	 per	 cent	 presented	 as	 discontinued	 operations.	 The	 group’s	 share	 of	 the	 results	 of	 other	 joint	 venture	 interests	 held	 by	 AMEC	 SPIE	 has	 	 also	 been	 restated	 as	 discontinued.	 The	 balance	 sheet	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2005	 has	 not	 been	 restated	 and	 therefore	 the	 carrying	 value	 of	 associates	 on	 that	 date	 includes	 no	 amounts	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 rail	 business,	 which	 are	 included	 within	 additions	 in	 2006.
An	 analysis	 of	 the	 group’s	 interests	 in	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 joint	 ventures	 and	 associates	 is	 as	 follows:

The	 joint	 ventures	 have	 no	 significant	 contingent	 liabilities	 to	 which	 the	 group	 is	 exposed.	 AMEC	 had	 provided	 guarantees	 in	 respect	 of	 committed	 bank	 facilities	 granted	 to	 certain	 property	 joint	 ventures.	 These	 facilities	 were	 renegotiated	 during	 2006	 with	 AMEC	 no	 longer	 providing	 such	 guarantees.	 In	 addition,	 there	 are	 commitments	 to	 invest	 equity	 in	 certain	 joint	 venture	 projects.	 These	 guarantees	 and	 commitments	 are	 set	 out	 in	 note	 30.

15 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities
The	 group	 operates	 a	 number	 of	 pension	 schemes	 for	 UK	 and	 overseas	 employees.	 Substantially	 all	 UK	 members	 are	 in	 funded	 defined	 benefit	 schemes,	 the	 main	 schemes	 being	 the	 AMEC	 Staff	 Pension	 Scheme	 and	 the	 AMEC	 Executive	 Pension	 Scheme.	 The	 majority	 of	 overseas	 members	 are	 in	 defined	 contribution	 schemes.	 Contributions	 by	 the	 group	 into	 defined	 contribution	 schemes	 are	 disclosed	 in	 note	 6.
Defined benefit schemes
The	 valuations	 used	 have	 been	 based	 on	 the	 most	 recent	 valuations	 of	 the	 two	 major	 UK	 schemes	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2004	 and	 1	 April	 2005,	 and	 updated	 by	 the	 schemes’	 actuaries	 for	 the	 requirement	 to	 assess	 the	 present	 value	 of	 the	 liabilities	 of	 the	 schemes	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2006.	 The	 assets	 of	 the	 schemes	 are	 stated	 at	 their	 aggregate	 market	 value	 as	 at	 31	 December .
The	 principal	 assumptions	 made	 by	 the	 actuaries	 in	 relation	 to	 the	 main	 UK	 schemes	 are	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 	 	 2006	 2005
	 	 	 	 	 	 Per cent	 Per 	 cent
Rate	 of	 discount	 	 	 	 	 	 5.1	 4.9
Rate	 of	 inflation	 	 	 	 	 	 3.0	 2.8
Rate	 of	 increase	 in	 salaries	 	 	 	 	 	 4.0	 3.8
Rate	 of	 increase	 in	 pensions	 in	 payment	 	 	 	 	 	 3.0	 2.8
Expected	 rate	 of	 return	 on	 scheme	 assets:
	 Equities	 	 	 	 	 	 7.7	 7.6
	 Bonds	 	 	 	 	 	 4.4	 4.4
	 Property	 	 	 	 	 	 6.2	 6.1
	 Other	 	 	 	 	 	 4.5	 4.5
For	 the	 main	 UK	 pension	 schemes,	 the	 assumed	 life	 expectancy	 is	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 	 	 Male	 Female
	 	 	 	 	 	 years	 years
Member	 aged	 60	 (current	 life	 expectancy)	 	 	 	 	 	 23.8	 26.8
Member	 aged	 40	 (life	 expectancy	 at	 60)	 	 	 	 	 	 25.0	 27.8
The	 assumptions	 used	 by	 the	 actuaries	 are	 the	 best	 estimates	 chosen	 from	 a	 range	 of	 possible	 actuarial	 assumptions,	 which,	 due	 to	 the	 timescale	 covered,	 may	 not	 necessarily	 be	 borne	 out	 in	 practice.
To	 develop	 the	 expected	 long-term	 rate	 of	 return	 on	 assets	 assumption,	 the	 company	 considered	 the	 current	 level	 of	 expected	 returns	 on	 	 risk	 free	 investments	 (primarily	 government	 bonds),	 the	 historical	 level	 of	 risk	 premium	 associated	 with	 the	 other	 asset	 classes	 in	 which	 the	 portfolio	 is	 invested	 and	 the	 expectations	 for	 future	 returns	 of	 each	 asset	 class.	 The	 expected	 return	 for	 each	 asset	 class	 was	 then	 weighted	 based	 on	 the	 target	 asset	 allocation	 to	 develop	 the	 expected	 long-term	 rate	 of	 return	 on	 assets	 for	 the	 portfolio.

The	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 are	 as	 follows:

23 Financial instruments
Details	 of	 the	 group’s	 financial	 risk	 management	 objectives	 and	 policies,	 together	 with	 its	 policies	 for	 hedging	 are	 provided	 in	 the	 business	 and	 financial	 review	 on	 pages	 46	 and	 47.
Hedging of interest rate risk
The	 group’s	 policy	 has	 been	 to	 use	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 to	 convert	 a	 portion	 of	 its	 floating	 rate	 debt	 to	 fixed	 and	 vice	 versa.	 Following	 repayment	 of	 substantially	 all	 of	 its	 debt	 during	 2006,	 the	 group	 has	 no	 need	 to	 hedge	 interest	 rate	 risk	 at	 31	 December	 2006.	 The	 notional	 contract	 amount,	 carrying	 amount	 and	 fair	 values	 of	 swaps	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges	 and	 fair	 value	 hedges	 are	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 2006 2005 2006 2005
    Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying	 amount
    contract amount contract	 amount and fair value and	 fair	 value
    £ million £	 million £ million £	 million
Interest	 rate	 swaps	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges:
Non-current	 liabilities	 	 	 	 –	 226.0	 –	 (10.2)
Interest	 rate	 swaps	 designated	 as	 fair	 value	 hedges:
Non-current	 liabilities	 	 	 	 –	 17.5	 –	 (1.9)
Hedging of foreign currency risk – forecast transactions
The	 group	 looks	 to	 mitigate	 the	 foreign	 exchange	 risk	 typically	 arising	 where	 contracts	 are	 awarded	 in,	 or	 involve	 costs,	 in	 non-local	 currency.	 Forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 and	 foreign	 exchange	 swaps	 are	 used	 for	 this	 purpose	 and	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges.	 The	 notional	 contract	 amount,	 carrying	 amount	 and	 fair	 values	 of	 forward	 contracts	 and	 swaps	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges	 are	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 2006 2005 2006 2005
    Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying	 amount
    contract amount contract	 amount and fair value and	 fair	 value
    £ million £	 million £ million £	 million
Current	 assets	 	 	 	 10.7	 79.3	 0.7	 0.4
Assets	 classified	 as	 held	 for	 sale	 	 	 	 18.3	 –	 1.4	 –
Current	 liabilities	 	 	 	 80.2	 64.9	 (1.8)	 (2.0)
Non-current	 liabilities	 	 	 	 –	 13.7	 –	 (0.9)
	 	 	 	 109.2	 157.9	 0.3	 (2.5)
The	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 and	 foreign	 exchange	 swaps	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges	 mature	 predominantly	 over	 the	 next	 twelve	 months,	 in	 line	 with	 the	 hedged	 cash	 flows.
Certain	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 and	 foreign	 exchange	 swaps	 are	 not	 designated	 as	 cash	 flow	 hedges	 and	 changes	 in	 their	 fair	 value	 are	 recognised	 through	 the	 income	 statement.	 The	 notional	 contract	 amount,	 carrying	 amount	 and	 fair	 values	 of	 these	 forward	 contracts	 and	 swaps	 are	 as	 follows:

Credit risk
Trade	 receivable	 exposures	 are	 typically	 with	 large	 publicly	 quoted	 companies	 and	 government	 backed	 organisations,	 and	 the	 credit	 ratings	 of	 these	 organisations	 are	 monitored.	 Credit	 risks	 are	 minimised	 through	 the	 use	 of	 letters	 of	 credit,	 parent	 company	 guarantees,	 insurance	 instruments	 and	 forward	 funding	 where	 achievable.
The	 maximum	 exposure	 to	 credit	 risk	 is	 represented	 by	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 each	 financial	 asset,	 including	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 recorded	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.
There	 are	 no	 significant	 concentrations	 of	 credit	 risk	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.

The	 fair	 value	 of	 interest	 rate	 swaps	 is	 estimated	 by	 discounting	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 based	 on	 the	 terms	 and	 maturity	 of	 each	 contract	 and	 using	 market	 interest	 rates.
The	 fair	 value	 of	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	 contracts	 is	 estimated	 by	 discounting	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 contractual	 forward	 price	 and	 the	 current	 forward	 price	 for	 the	 residual	 maturity	 of	 the	 contract	 using	 a	 risk	 free	 interest	 rate.
Bank	 loans	 and	 bonds	 are	 valued	 based	 on	 discounted	 expected	 future	 principal	 and	 interest	 cash	 flows.

In	 January	 2005,	 the	 group	 raised	 £89	 million	 by	 way	 of	 a	 placing.	 In	 line	 with	 counsel’s	 opinion,	 the	 excess	 of	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 placing	 over	 the	 nominal	 value	 of	 the	 shares	 issued	 created	 a	 merger	 reserve	 which	 was	 subsequently	 transferred	 to	 retained	 earnings	 and	 is	 available	 	 for	 distribution	 to	 shareholders.
The	 hedging	 reserve	 comprises	 the	 effective	 portion	 of	 the	 cumulative	 net	 change	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 cash	 flow	 hedging	 instruments	 related	 	 to	 hedged	 transactions	 that	 have	 not	 yet	 occurred.
The	 translation	 reserve	 comprises	 all	 foreign	 exchange	 differences	 arising	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 the	 accounts	 of	 foreign	 operations,	 	 as	 well	 as	 from	 the	 translation	 of	 liabilities	 and	 the	 cumulative	 net	 change	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 instruments	 that	 hedge	 the	 company’s	 net	 investment	 in	 foreign	 subsidiaries.
A	 qualifying	 share	 ownership	 trust	 (“the	 Quest”)	 was	 established	 on	 26	 August	 1999.	 The	 Quest	 holds	 shares	 issued	 by	 the	 company	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 savings	 related	 share	 option	 scheme.

Share-based payments
In	 1985,	 the	 group	 established	 the	 Savings	 Related	 Share	 Option	 Scheme,	 which	 entitles	 employees	 of	 the	 group	 to	 buy	 shares	 in	 the	 company.	 Grants	 of	 share	 options	 under	 this	 scheme	 are	 offered	 to	 employees	 periodically,	 and	 options	 are	 exercisable	 at	 a	 20	 per	 cent	 discount	 	 to	 the	 market	 price	 of	 shares	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant.
Under	 the	 Executive	 Share	 Option	 Scheme	 2002,	 directors	 and	 senior	 employees	 of	 the	 group	 have	 been	 granted	 share	 options,	 which	 carry	 	 a	 non-market	 based	 performance	 condition.
Until	 September	 2004,	 the	 Performance	 Share	 Plan	 2002	 was	 operated	 alongside	 the	 Executive	 Share	 Option	 Scheme	 2002,	 but	 since	 then	 awards	 have	 been	 made	 under	 the	 Performance	 Share	 Plans	 only.	 Under	 this	 plan,	 share	 awards	 are	 made	 to	 directors	 and	 senior	 employees	 	 of	 the	 group,	 subject	 to	 both	 market	 and	 non-market	 based	 performance	 tests.
All	 of	 the	 share-based	 payment	 arrangements	 operated	 by	 the	 group	 are	 equity-settled.	 Options	 are	 granted	 with	 a	 maximum	 term	 of	 ten	 years.
The	 number	 and	 weighted	 average	 exercise	 price	 of	 share	 options	 under	 the	 Savings	 Related	 Share	 Option	 Scheme	 and	 the	 Executive	 Share	 Option	 Scheme	 2002	 are	 as	 follows:

27 Acquisitions and disposals
A	 number	 of	 immaterial	 acquisitions	 were	 made	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2006	 for	 £5.5	 million	 in	 cash	 with	 the	 assumption	 of	 overdrafts	 of	 £9.5	 million.	 The	 aggregate	 book	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 net	 liabilities	 was	 £2.6	 million	 excluding	 overdrafts	 assumed	 and	 the	 aggregate	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 the	 acquisitions	 was	 £17.6	 million.	 All	 acquisitions	 in	 the	 year	 have	 been	 accounted	 for	 under	 the	 purchase	 method	 of	 accounting.	 An	 assessment	 of	 the	 fair	 value	 to	 the	 group	 of	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 acquired	 on	 all	 acquisitions	 has	 been	 made.
The	 contributions	 of	 the	 acquired	 businesses	 to	 revenue	 and	 profit	 were	 not	 material	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	 group.
Goodwill	 has	 been	 recognised	 on	 these	 acquisitions	 as	 a	 result	 of	 skilled	 workforces	 which	 did	 not	 meet	 the	 criteria	 for	 recognition	 as	 intangible	 assets	 at	 the	 dates	 of	 recognition.
The	 acquisition	 cost	 of	 joint	 ventures	 and	 other	 investments	 amounted	 to	 £23.5	 million	 (2005:	 £25.0	 million)	 and	 principally	 related	 to	 investments	 in	 public	 private	 partnership	 projects.
The	 only	 material	 disposal	 was	 the	 sale	 of	 AMEC	 SPIE	 for	 a	 cash	 consideration	 of	 e1	 billion	 (£684	 million)	 which	 was	 completed	 on	 27	 July	 2006.
The	 carrying	 value	 of	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 sold	 and	 the	 profit	 on	 sale	 were	 as	 follows:

On	 20	 January	 2005,	 the	 group	 acquired	 all	 the	 shares	 in	 Paragon	 Engineering	 Services	 Inc.	 (“Paragon”)	 for	 £22.3	 million.	 Paragon	 is	 an	 oil	 and	 gas	 engineering	 services	 company	 based	 in	 Houston,	 US.
The	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 identifiable	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 relating	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Paragon	 were	 as	 follows:

	 	 	 	 	 	 	 22.3
In	 the	 period	 from	 acquisition	 to	 31	 December	 2005,	 Paragon	 contributed	 £45.5	 million	 to	 the	 consolidated	 revenue.	 Its	 profit	 contribution	 was	 not	 material	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	 group.
Goodwill	 has	 been	 recognised	 on	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Paragon	 as	 a	 result	 of	 its	 skilled	 workforce	 and	 specialist	 engineering	 expertise	 that	 did	 not	 meet	 the	 criteria	 for	 recognition	 as	 an	 intangible	 asset	 at	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition.
On	 3	 July	 2005,	 the	 group	 acquired	 all	 the	 shares	 in	 NNC	 Holdings	 Limited	 (“NNC”)	 for	 £26.1	 million	 in	 cash	 and	 net	 debt	 of	 £13.7	 million.	 NNC	 provides	 consultancy	 and	 engineering	 services	 across	 the	 life	 of	 nuclear	 facilities	 in	 the	 UK,	 Canada	 and	 across	 the	 former	 Soviet	 Union.	 The	 amounts	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 identifiable	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 relating	 to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 NNC	 were	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 	 	 Fair 	 value	 Recognised

27 Acquisitions and disposals continued
In	 the	 period	 from	 acquisition	 to	 31	 December	 2005,	 NNC	 contributed	 £50.6	 million	 to	 the	 consolidated	 revenue.	 Its	 profit	 contribution	 was	 not	 material	 to	 the	 results	 of	 the	 group.
Goodwill	 has	 arisen	 on	 the	 acquisition	 of	 NNC	 primarily	 because	 of	 its	 skilled	 workforce	 which	 did	 not	 meet	 the	 criteria	 for	 recognition	 as	 an	 intangible	 asset	 at	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition.
A	 number	 of	 smaller	 acquisitions	 were	 made	 in	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2005	 for	 an	 aggregate	 consideration	 net	 of	 cash	 acquired	 of	 £8.7	 million	 (of	 which	 £4.3	 million	 was	 paid	 in	 2004).	 The	 aggregate	 book	 value	 of	 the	 identifiable	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 was	 £0.2	 million	 and	 the	 aggregate	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 the	 acquisitions	 was	 £12.4	 million.

As	 at	 31	 December	 2006,	 there	 was	 a	 commitment	 to	 invest	 a	 total	 of	 £56.8	 million	 (2005:	 £47.4	 million)	 in	 various	 PPP	 and	 regeneration	 partnership	 projects.	 In	 addition,	 there	 are	 commitments	 to	 purchase	 land	 for	 a	 developments	 project	 of	 up	 to	 £15	 million	 (2005:	 £15	 million)	 over	 the	 next	 ten	 years.
29 Operating leases

AMEC	 enters	 into	 the	 following	 types	 of	 lease:	 short-term	 plant	 hires;	 leases	 for	 motor	 vehicles	 and	 office	 equipment	 with	 lease	 periods	 of	 two	 	 to	 five	 years;	 and	 longer	 term	 property	 leases.	 None	 of	 the	 leases	 includes	 any	 contingent	 rentals.
30 Contingent liabilities
Guarantees and indemnities
The	 borrowings	 of	 joint	 ventures	 are	 generally	 without	 recourse	 to	 AMEC	 other	 than	 for	 normal	 performance	 obligations	 which	 are	 usually	 	 given	 on	 a	 several	 basis.	 AMEC	 had	 provided	 guarantees	 in	 respect	 of	 committed	 bank	 facilities	 granted	 to	 certain	 property	 joint	 ventures.	 	 These	 facilities	 were	 renegotiated	 during	 2006	 with	 AMEC	 no	 longer	 providing	 such	 guarantees	 (2005:	 £33.8	 million).
The	 company	 and	 certain	 subsidiaries	 have	 given	 counter	 indemnities	 in	 respect	 of	 performance	 bonds	 issued,	 on	 behalf	 of	 group	 companies,	 	 in	 the	 normal	 course	 of	 business.
As	 at	 31	 December	 2006,	 AMEC	 had	 actual	 commitments	 to	 invest	 £56.8	 million	 (2005:	 £47.4	 million)	 in	 various	 existing	 Public	 Private	 and	 regeneration	 partnership	 projects	 (note	 28).	 There	 are	 further	 commitments	 of	 £3.1	 million	 (2005:	 £17.2	 million)	 relating	 to	 projects	 at	 the	 preferred	 bidder	 stage.
AMEC	 has	 also	 provided	 guarantees	 on	 certain	 existing	 projects	 to	 invest	 further	 amounts	 of	 up	 to	 £34.2	 million	 (2005:	 £34.2	 million).	 	 AMEC	 believes	 that	 the	 circumstances	 under	 which	 it	 will	 be	 called	 upon	 to	 invest	 this	 contingent	 equity	 are	 remote.
Legal claims and actions
AMEC	 has	 taken	 internal	 and	 external	 legal	 advice	 in	 considering	 known	 legal	 claims	 and	 actions	 made	 by	 or	 against	 the	 company.	 Consequently,	 it	 carefully	 assesses	 the	 likelihood	 of	 the	 success	 of	 a	 claim	 or	 action	 including	 those	 identified	 in	 this	 note.	 AMEC	 makes	 an	 appropriate	 provision	 for	 those	 legal	 claims	 or	 actions	 against	 the	 company	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 likely	 outcome,	 but	 makes	 no	 provision	 for	 those	 which	 are,	 in	 its	 view,	 unlikely	 to	 succeed.	 Provisions	 of	 £85.3	 million	 (2005:	 £22.4	 million)	 are	 shown	 in	 note	 24	 in	 respect	 of	 these	 claims.	 	 It	 is	 not	 practicable	 to	 quantify	 the	 remaining	 contingent	 liability	 because	 of	 the	 range	 of	 possible	 outcomes	 and	 the	 progress	 of	 the	 litigation.
The	 information	 below	 indicates	 the	 quantum	 of	 claims	 against	 AMEC	 or	 where	 we	 are	 unable	 to	 quantify	 the	 claim,	 an	 indication	 of	 the	 gross	 contract	 value	 or	 the	 amount	 in	 dispute.	 As	 the	 list	 below	 involves	 actions	 by	 third	 parties	 against	 AMEC,	 the	 timing	 of	 settlement	 cannot	 	 be	 determined	 although	 AMEC	 is	 endeavouring	 to	 settle	 as	 soon	 as	 practicable.	 Due	 to	 the	 litigation,	 there	 is	 no	 work	 in	 progress	 or	 other	 receivable	 recognised	 in	 respect	 of	 these	 contracts.	 Whilst	 AMEC	 believes	 that	 certain	 claims	 may	 be	 covered	 by	 insurance,	 it	 is	 not	 currently	 practicable	 to	 assess	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 AMEC’s	 insurance	 policies	 will	 respond	 in	 the	 event	 of	 a	 settlement.
–	 During	 1994	 and	 1995,	 AMEC	 Construction	 Management	 Inc.	 (“ACMI”),	 a	 wholly	 owned	 subsidiary	 of	 AMEC	 plc,	 entered	 into	 various	 contracts	 with	 the	 United	 States	 General	 Services	 Administration	 (“GSA”)	 for	 the	 construction	 of	 courthouses	 in	 Missouri	 and	 California	 and	 for	 the	 refurbishment	 and	 seismic	 upgrade	 of	 a	 US	 Customs	 House	 in	 California.	 The	 total	 value	 of	 these	 contracts	 at	 point	 of	 signing	 was	 in	 the	 order	 of	 US$290	 million.	 Due,	 inter	 alia,	 to	 unforeseen	 site	 conditions,	 client	 delays	 and	 numerous	 design	 and	 scope	 changes,	 ACMI	 suffered	 significant	 cost	 overruns	 and	 submitted	 substantial	 recovery	 claims.

30 Contingent liabilities continued
In	 June	 1999,	 GSA	 terminated	 the	 right	 of	 ACMI	 to	 complete	 one	 contract,	 which	 at	 that	 stage	 was	 85	 per	 cent	 complete.	 ACMI	 contested	 	 the	 termination	 and	 sued	 the	 GSA	 for	 recovery	 of	 all	 claims	 on	 this	 contract.	 The	 GSA	 submitted	 its	 claim	 against	 ACMI	 for	 reprocurement	 	 and	 other	 costs	 totalling	 US$32	 million.
The	 United	 States	 Department	 of	 Justice	 filed	 a	 counterclaim	 alleging	 false	 claims	 on	 the	 GSA	 contracts	 and	 sought	 to	 argue	 that,	 as	 a	 result,	 ACMI	 had	 forfeited	 its	 rights	 to	 recovery	 of	 all	 claims.
ACMI,	 upon	 legal	 advice,	 pleaded	 guilty	 in	 December	 2000	 and	 November	 2001	 to	 two	 federal	 felonies	 and	 paid	 two	 fines	 totalling	 approximately	 US$1.2	 million.	 AMEC	 also	 agreed	 to	 introduce	 additional	 ethical	 processes	 and	 procedures,	 both	 for	 the	 North	 American	 workforce	 and	 	 for	 those	 staff	 employed	 by	 AMEC,	 whose	 responsibilities	 caused	 them	 to	 have	 regular	 business	 contact	 with	 AMEC	 Americas	 and	 thus,	 	 the	 US	 Government.
The	 GSA	 subsequently	 filed	 a	 motion	 for	 summary	 judgement	 seeking	 an	 order	 declaring	 that	 ACMI	 had	 forfeited	 its	 claims	 on	 all	 the	 projects.	 ACMI	 opposed	 the	 motion	 and	 oral	 argument	 was	 held	 in	 February	 2004.	 During	 2005,	 the	 US	 Court	 of	 Federal	 Claims	 ruled	 that	 ACMI	 had	 violated	 the	 US	 Anti-Kickback	 Act.	 The	 Court	 stated	 that	 it	 intended	 to	 issue	 	 an	 order	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 Government’s	 counter	 claims	 and	 the	 issues	 relating	 to	 the	 Anti-Kickback	 Act	 in	 April	 2006.	 The	 court	 ruled	 in	 January	 2007	 that	 ACMI	 claims	 must	 be	 forfeited	 and	 damages	 in	 respect	 of	 false	 claims	 and	 Anti-Kickback	 legislation	 would	 be	 payable.	 Further	 hearings	 are	 due	 to	 take	 place	 in	 April	 2007.
In	 2001,	 ACMI	 entered	 into	 a	 contract	 with	 a	 value	 of	 US$103	 million	 to	 build	 a	 development	 in	 Miami,	 Florida,	 which	 was	 subject	 to	 significant	 changes	 and	 design	 delays.	 In	 January	 2006,	 the	 client	 terminated	 ACMI’s	 contract	 despite	 having	 taken	 possession	 of	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 facility.	 Both	 parties	 are	 now	 in	 litigation	 in	 pursuit	 of	 various	 claims	 and	 counter	 claims.	 ACMI’s	 claim	 amounts	 to	 US$11.5	 million,	 of	 which	 approximately	 half	 represents	 the	 claim	 of	 a	 subcontractor .	 The	 client’s	 claim	 amounts	 to	 a	 sum	 in	 excess	 of	 US$31	 million.
The	 parties	 have	 met	 to	 mediate	 their	 differences,	 with	 some	 success.	 All	 but	 two	 issues	 between	 AMEC	 and	 the	 client	 have	 been	 resolved.	 	 The	 client	 has	 recently	 quantified	 their	 remaining	 claims	 and	 indicated	 they	 believe	 AMEC	 are	 responsible	 for	 US$5	 million.	 AMEC	 continues	 	 to	 work	 with	 insurers	 and	 the	 client	 in	 an	 effort	 to	 resolve	 these	 issues.
–	 In	 2000,	 ACMI	 entered	 into	 a	 contract	 with	 a	 value	 of	 US$115	 million	 to	 design	 and	 build	 a	 jail	 for	 the	 City	 and	 County	 of	 San	 Francisco	 (“CCSF”).	 Due	 to	 unforeseen	 conditions,	 delays	 and	 interference	 with	 ACMI’s	 design,	 procurement	 and	 execution	 of	 the	 work,	 ACMI	 suffered	 large	 cost	 overruns.	 In	 2005,	 lawsuits	 were	 filed	 by	 both	 parties.	 CCSF	 further	 alleged	 that	 ACMI	 made	 false	 claims	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 project	 and	 also	 failed	 to	 properly	 maintain	 its	 California	 contractor’s	 licence	 throughout	 the	 project	 term.	 The	 litigation	 is	 at	 the	 pleading	 stages	 with	 an	 initial	 trial	 date	 set	 for	 November	 2007.	 AMEC	 plc	 has	 been	 joined	 in	 this	 action	 on	 the	 basis	 that	 it	 is	 allegedly	 the	 alter	 ego	 of	 ACMI	 or,	 alternately,	 that	 ACMI	 is	 merely	 the	 agent	 of	 AMEC	 plc	 and	 thus	 AMEC	 plc	 is	 liable	 for	 ACMI’s	 actions.	 AMEC	 plc	 is	 vigorously	 defending	 its	 position.	 The	 court	 recently	 rejected	 CCSF’s	 request	 for	 summary	 judgement	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 licencing	 issues	 referred	 to	 above.
–	 In	 1999,	 AGRA	 Monenco	 Inc.	 (a	 predecessor	 company	 of	 AMEC	 Americas	 Limited,	 a	 wholly	 owned	 subsidiary	 of	 AMEC	 plc),	 in	 joint	 venture,	 entered	 into	 a	 contract	 with	 Jordan	 Magnesia	 Company	 Ltd.	 (“ Jormag”)	 to	 design	 and	 construct	 a	 magnesium	 plant	 in	 Jordan	 with	 a	 contract	 value	 of	 US$84	 million.	 The	 joint	 venture	 experienced	 delays	 in	 completing	 its	 work	 under	 the	 contract	 and	 Jormag	 terminated	 the	 contract	 when	 work	 was	 approximately	 95	 per	 cent	 complete.	 The	 joint	 venture	 commenced	 an	 action	 against	 Jormag,	 who	 counter	 claimed	 for	 damages	 it	 claims	 it	 suffered	 from	 the	 alleged	 default	 of	 the	 joint	 venture.	 The	 dispute	 has	 been	 referred	 to	 arbitration	 under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 contract,	 and	 the	 matter	 has	 only	 been	 part	 heard,	 with	 a	 final	 hearing	 date	 set	 for	 May	 2007.	 Substantial	 claims	 were	 made	 by	 the	 client	 against	 AMEC.	 An	 arbitration	 hearing	 in	 2006	 awarded	 damages	 in	 the	 order	 of	 US$25	 million	 against	 AMEC.	 A	 further	 hearing	 is	 scheduled	 for	 May	 2007	 	 to	 consider	 potential	 remediation	 issues	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 plant.	 Mediation	 is	 scheduled	 in	 April	 2007	 to	 address	 all	 outstanding	 issues.
–	 After	 the	 terrorist	 attacks	 in	 September	 2001,	 ACMI	 was	 one	 of	 four	 construction	 managers	 hired	 by	 the	 City	 of	 New	 York	 to	 carry	 out	 the	 	 clean	 up	 and	 debris	 removal	 work	 at	 the	 World	 Trade	 Center	 site.	 The	 client	 was	 responsible	 for	 procuring	 insurance	 to	 protect	 the	 construction	 managers	 and	 various	 contractors	 from	 lawsuits	 arising	 out	 of	 the	 work.	 The	 World	 Trade	 Center	 Captive	 Insurance	 Company	 (the	 “WTC	 Captive”)	 was	 formed	 and	 was	 funded	 with	 US$1	 billion	 in	 Federal	 money	 to	 provide	 coverage	 for	 the	 City,	 the	 construction	 managers	 and	 	 the	 contractors	 who	 performed	 the	 work	 on	 site.	 Pursuant	 to	 the	 insurance	 policy	 that	 was	 issued,	 the	 WTC	 Captive	 is	 providing	 a	 minimum	 	 of	 US$1	 billion	 in	 insurance	 coverage.	 This	 amount	 can	 increase	 depending	 upon	 investment	 returns	 on	 the	 US$1	 billion.	 The	 WTC	 Captive	 	 is	 providing	 a	 defence	 and	 indemnification	 for	 claims	 against	 ACMI	 arising	 out	 of	 this	 work.
–	 AMEC	 Civil	 Engineering	 Limited	 was	 awarded	 a	 contract	 to	 refurbish	 the	 existing	 Thelwall	 viaduct	 which	 carries	 the	 M6	 motorway	 over	 	 the	 Manchester	 Ship	 Canal.	 Shortly	 prior	 to	 the	 expiry	 of	 the	 six	 year	 latent	 defects	 liability	 period,	 the	 Highways	 Agency	 advised	 AMEC	 that	 	 a	 number	 of	 bearings/bearing	 plates	 had	 failed.	 Subsequently	 the	 Highways	 Agency	 decided	 to	 replace	 all	 the	 316	 bearings	 and	 has	 raised	 	 a	 claim	 against	 AMEC	 for	 £37	 million.	 The	 client	 has	 instigated	 a	 dispute	 under	 the	 contract	 which	 is	 now	 the	 subject	 of	 court	 proceedings.	 	 The	 hearing	 is	 not	 anticipated	 until	 January	 2008.
AMEC	 Group	 Limited	 (“AGL ”)	 is	 currently	 the	 subject	 of	 certain	 ongoing	 Health	 and	 Safety	 Executive	 investigations,	 in	 respect	 of:	 (i)	 separate	 incidents	 involving	 fatalities	 of	 subcontractors,	 namely:	 two	 separate	 fatalities	 to	 subcontractors	 at	 the	 Leftbank	 Apartments	 project	 in	 Manchester	 in	 April	 2004	 and	 April	 2005;	 and	 (ii)	 a	 fatal	 accident	 on	 the	 Clipper	 platform	 in	 the	 North	 Sea.	 If	 AGL	 is	 to	 be	 prosecuted	 in	 the	 Crown	 Court	 for	 any	 of	 these	 cases,	 it	 could	 be	 liable	 to	 unlimited	 fines.	 A	 prosecution	 for	 AGL	 in	 relation	 to	 fatal	 accidents	 in	 relatively	 quick	 succession	 (such	 as	 those	 at	 the	 Leftbank	 Apartments)	 could	 have	 an	 impact	 on	 the	 amount	 of	 any	 penalty.

4155 AMEC_back_06.indd   102 4/4/07   15:28:44 1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The	 accounts	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 historical	 cost	 convention,	 modified	 to	 include	 the	 revaluation	 of	 certain	 land	 and	 buildings	 	 and	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 accounting	 standards	 and	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.
During	 2006,	 amounts	 owed	 to	 subsidiaries	 falling	 due	 after	 one	 year	 have	 been	 reclassified	 under	 the	 caption	 creditors	 falling	 due	 after	 	 one	 year	 as	 there	 was	 no	 legal	 right	 to	 set	 off	 the	 liabilities	 against	 the	 investment.	 In	 2005,	 these	 items	 were	 offset	 against	 investments	 	 in	 subsidiaries	 and	 the	 2005	 balance	 sheet	 has	 been	 restated	 accordingly.	 This	 results	 in	 an	 increase	 of	 £975.2	 million	 in	 investments	 	 in	 subsidiaries	 and	 an	 increase	 of	 £975.2	 million	 in	 creditors	 falling	 due	 after	 one	 year	 and	 there	 is	 therefore	 no	 impact	 on	 net	 assets.
The	 company	 has	 not	 presented	 its	 own	 profit	 and	 loss	 account,	 as	 permitted	 by	 section	 230(4)	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 Depreciation
Depreciation	 is	 provided	 on	 all	 tangible	 assets,	 other	 than	 freehold	 land,	 at	 rates	 calculated	 to	 write-off	 the	 cost	 or	 valuation,	 less	 estimated	 residual	 value,	 of	 each	 asset	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 its	 estimated	 useful	 life,	 as	 follows:
Freehold	 buildings	 50	 years
Leasehold	 land	 and	 buildings	 the 	 shorter	 of	 the	 lease	 term	 or	 50	 years
Plant	 and	 equipment	 mainly 	 three	 to	 five	 years
Financial instruments
Financial	 instruments	 are	 initially	 recorded	 at	 fair	 value.	 Subsequent	 valuation	 depends	 on	 the	 designation	 of	 the	 instruments.	 Cash,	 deposits	 and	 short-term	 investments	 are	 held	 at	 amortised	 cost.	 Derivative	 financial	 instruments	 are	 accounted	 for	 as	 described	 in	 note	 1	 to	 the	 consolidated	 accounts.
The	 company	 is	 exempt	 from	 the	 disclosure	 requirements	 of	 FRS	 25	 “Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure	 and	 Presentation”	 as	 the	 financial	 instruments	 disclosures	 of	 IAS	 32	 “Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure	 and	 Presentation”	 are	 included	 in	 the	 notes	 to	 the	 consolidated	 accounts.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where	 the	 company	 enters	 into	 financial	 guarantee	 contracts	 to	 guarantee	 the	 indebtedness	 of	 other	 companies	 within	 the	 group,	 the	 company	 considers	 these	 to	 be	 indemnity	 arrangements,	 and	 accounts	 for	 them	 as	 such.	 In	 this	 respect	 the	 company	 treats	 the	 guarantee	 contract	 	 as	 a	 contingent	 liability	 until	 such	 time	 as	 it	 becomes	 probable	 that	 the	 company	 will	 be	 required	 to	 make	 a	 payment	 under	 the	 guarantee.
Foreign currencies
Monetary	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 denominated	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 rates	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Exchange	 differences	 arising	 on	 the	 translation	 of	 foreign	 currency	 net	 investments	 and	 foreign	 currency	 borrowings,	 or	 forward	 exchange	 contracts	 used	 to	 hedge	 those	 investments,	 are	 taken	 directly	 to	 reserves.	 Other	 exchange	 differences	 are	 taken	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 	 in	 the	 year .
Interest 
Interest	 income	 and	 payable	 is	 recognised	 in	 profit	 or	 loss	 on	 an	 accruals	 basis	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 method.
Leases 
Operating	 lease	 costs	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 lease.
Pensions
Contributions	 to	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes	 in	 respect	 of	 employees	 of	 AMEC	 plc	 are	 charged	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss	 account	 as	 incurred.
Defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes	 are	 operated	 by	 the	 group	 but	 the	 company	 is	 unable	 to	 separately	 identify	 its	 share	 of	 the	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 of	 those	 schemes	 or	 any	 details	 of	 the	 surplus	 or	 deficit	 in	 the	 scheme	 and	 the	 implications	 of	 that	 surplus	 or	 deficit	 for	 the	 company.
Details	 of	 the	 disclosures	 required	 under	 FRS	 17	 “Retirement	 Benefits”	 can	 be	 found	 in	 the	 accounts	 of	 AMEC	 Group	 Limited,	 a	 subsidiary	 company.
Share-based payments
There	 are	 share-based	 payment	 arrangements	 which	 allow	 AMEC	 employees	 to	 acquire	 AMEC	 shares;	 these	 awards	 are	 granted	 by	 AMEC.	 	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 awards	 granted	 is	 recognised	 as	 a	 cost	 of	 employment	 with	 a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	 equity.	 The	 fair	 value	 is	 measured	 at	 	 grant	 date	 and	 spread	 over	 the	 period	 during	 which	 the	 employees	 become	 unconditionally	 entitled	 to	 the	 award.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 award	 is	 measured	 using	 a	 valuation	 model,	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 upon	 which	 the	 awards	 were	 granted.	 The	 amount	 recognised	 	 as	 an	 expense	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 the	 actual	 number	 of	 shares	 that	 vest	 except	 where	 non-vesting	 is	 due	 only	 to	 share	 prices	 not	 achieving	 the	 threshold	 for	 vesting.	 Taxation
The	 charge	 for	 taxation	 is	 based	 on	 the	 results	 for	 the	 year	 and	 takes	 into	 account	 taxation	 deferred	 because	 of	 timing	 differences	 between	 	 the	 treatment	 of	 certain	 items	 for	 taxation	 and	 accounting	 purposes.
Deferred	 tax	 is	 recognised,	 without	 discounting,	 in	 respect	 of	 all	 timing	 differences	 between	 the	 treatment	 of	 certain	 items	 for	 taxation	 and	 accounting	 purposes	 which	 have	 arisen	 but	 not	 reversed	 by	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date,	 except	 as	 otherwise	 required	 by	 FRS	 19	 “Deferred	 tax”.

The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 the	 annual	 report	 and	 the	 group	 and	 parent	 company	 accounts,	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations.	 Company	 law	 requires	 the	 directors	 to	 prepare	 group	 and	 parent	 company	 accounts	 for	 each	 financial	 year .	 Under	 that	 law	 the	 directors	 are	 required	 to	 prepare	 the	 group	 accounts	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 EU	 and	 have	 elected	 to	 prepare	 the	 parent	 company	 accounts	 in	 accordance	 with	 UK	 Accounting	 Standards.	 The	 group	 accounts	 are	 required	 by	 law	 and	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 	 the	 EU	 to	 present	 fairly	 the	 financial	 position	 and	 performance	 of	 the	 group;	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 provides	 in	 relation	 to	 such	 accounts	 that	 references	 in	 the	 relevant	 part	 of	 that	 Act	 to	 accounts	 giving	 a	 	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 are	 references	 to	 their	 achieving	 a	 fair	 presentation.
The	 parent	 company	 accounts	 are	 required	 by	 law	 to	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 of	 the	 state	 of	 affairs	 of	 the	 parent	 company.	 In	 preparing	 each	 of	 the	 group	 and	 parent	 company	 accounts,	 	 the	 directors	 are	 required	 to:	 n	select 	 suitable	 accounting	 policies	 and	 then	 apply	 them	 consistently;	 n	make 	 judgements	 and	 estimates	 that	 are	 reasonable	 and	 prudent;	 n	for 	 the	 group	 accounts,	 state	 whether	 they	 have	 been	 prepared	 	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 EU;	 n	for 	 the	 parent	 company	 accounts,	 state	 whether	 applicable	 	 UK	 Accounting	 Standards	 have	 been	 followed,	 subject	 to	 any	 	 material	 departures	 disclosed	 and	 explained	 in	 the	 parent	 	 company	 accounts;	 and	 The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 keeping	 proper	 accounting	 records	 that	 disclose	 with	 reasonable	 accuracy	 at	 any	 time	 the	 financial	 position	 of	 the	 parent	 company	 and	 enable	 them	 to	 ensure	 that	 its	 accounts	 comply	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 They	 have	 general	 responsibility	 for	 taking	 such	 steps	 as	 are	 reasonably	 open	 to	 them	 	 to	 safeguard	 the	 assets	 of	 the	 group	 and	 to	 prevent	 and	 detect	 fraud	 and	 other	 irregularities.	 Under	 applicable	 law	 and	 regulations,	 the	 directors	 are	 also	 responsible	 for	 preparing	 a	 directors’	 report,	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 and	 corporate	 governance	 statement	 that	 comply	 with	 	 that	 law.	 The	 directors	 are	 responsible	 for	 the	 maintenance	 and	 integrity	 of	 	 the	 corporate	 and	 financial	 information	 included	 on	 the	 company’s	 website.	 Legislation	 in	 the	 UK	 governing	 the	 preparation	 and	 dissemination	 of	 financial	 statements	 may	 differ	 from	 legislation	 	 in	 other	 jurisdictions.
4155 AMEC_back_06.indd   108 4/4/07   15:28:46 Independent auditors’ report to the members of AMEC plc
We	 have	 audited	 the	 group	 and	 parent	 company	 accounts	 (the	 “accounts”)	 of	 AMEC	 plc	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2006	 which	 comprise	 the	 group	 income	 statement,	 the	 group	 and	 parent	 company	 balance	 sheets,	 the	 group	 cash	 flow	 statement,	 the	 group	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense	 and	 the	 related	 notes.	 These	 accounts	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 accounting	 policies	 set	 	 out	 therein.	 We	 have	 also	 audited	 the	 information	 in	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 that	 is	 described	 as	 having	 been	 audited.	 This	 report	 is	 made	 solely	 to	 the	 company’s	 members,	 as	 a	 body,	 	 in	 accordance	 with	 section	 235	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985.	 Our	 audit	 work	 has	 been	 undertaken	 so	 that	 we	 might	 state	 to	 the	 company’s	 members	 those	 matters	 we	 are	 required	 to	 state	 to	 them	 in	 an	 auditor’s	 report	 and	 for	 no	 other	 purpose.	 To	 the	 fullest	 extent	 permitted	 by	 law,	 we	 do	 not	 accept	 or	 assume	 responsibility	 to	 anyone	 other	 than	 the	 company	 and	 the	 company’s	 members	 as	 a	 body,	 for	 our	 audit	 work,	 for	 this	 report,	 or	 for	 the	 opinions	 we	 have	 formed.	 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The	 directors’	 responsibilities	 for	 preparing	 the	 annual	 report	 and	 the	 group	 accounts	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 law	 and	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (“IFRS”)	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 European	 Union,	 and	 for	 preparing	 the	 parent	 company	 accounts	 and	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 in	 accordance	 with	 applicable	 	 law	 and	 United	 Kingdom	 Accounting	 Standards	 (United	 Kingdom	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice)	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 statement	 of	 directors’	 responsibilities.	 Our	 responsibility	 is	 to	 audit	 the	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 in	 accordance	 with	 relevant	 legal	 and	 regulatory	 requirements	 and	 International	 Standards	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland).	 We	 report	 to	 you	 our	 opinion	 as	 to	 whether	 the	 accounts	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view	 and	 whether	 the	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 and	 whether,	 in	 addition,	 	 the	 group	 accounts	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	 Regulation.	 We	 also	 report	 to	 you	 whether	 in	 our	 opinion	 the	 information	 given	 in	 the	 directors’	 report	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 accounts.	 The	 information	 given	 in	 the	 directors’	 report	 includes	 that	 specific	 information	 presented	 in	 the	 operating	 and	 financial	 review	 that	 is	 cross	 referred	 from	 the	 business	 review	 section	 	 of	 the	 directors’	 report.	 In	 addition	 we	 report	 to	 you	 if,	 in	 our	 opinion,	 the	 company	 has	 not	 kept	 proper	 accounting	 records,	 if	 we	 have	 not	 received	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 we	 require	 for	 our	 audit,	 or	 if	 information	 specified	 by	 law	 regarding	 directors’	 remuneration	 	 and	 other	 transactions	 is	 not	 disclosed.	 We	 review	 whether	 the	 Corporate	 Governance	 Statement	 reflects	 	 the	 company’s	 compliance	 with	 the	 nine	 provisions	 of	 the	 2003	 Combined	 Code	 specified	 for	 our	 review	 by	 the	 Listing	 Rules	 of	 the	 Financial	 Services	 Authority,	 and	 we	 report	 if	 it	 does	 not.	 We	 are	 not	 required	 to	 consider	 whether	 the	 board’s	 statements	 on	 internal	 control	 cover	 all	 risks	 and	 controls,	 or	 form	 an	 opinion	 on	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 group’s	 corporate	 governance	 procedures	 	 or	 its	 risk	 and	 control	 procedures.	 We	 read	 other	 information	 contained	 in	 the	 annual	 report	 	 and	 consider	 whether	 it	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 audited	 accounts.	 	 The	 other	 information	 comprises	 only	 the	 chairman’s	 statement,	 	 the	 chief	 executive’s	 review,	 the	 directors’	 report,	 the	 unaudited	 	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report,	 the	 operating	 and	 financial	 review	 and	 the	 corporate	 governance	 statement.	 We	 consider	 the	 implications	 for	 our	 report	 if	 we	 become	 aware	 of	 any	 apparent	 misstatements	 or	 material	 inconsistencies	 with	 the	 accounts.	 	 Our	 responsibilities	 do	 not	 extend	 to	 any	 other	 information.	 Basis of audit opinion 
We	 conducted	 our	 audit	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Standards	 	 on	 Auditing	 (UK	 and	 Ireland)	 issued	 by	 the	 Auditing	 Practices	 Board.	 An	 audit	 includes	 examination,	 on	 a	 test	 basis,	 of	 evidence	 relevant	 	 to	 the	 amounts	 and	 disclosures	 in	 the	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited.	 It	 also	 includes	 	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 significant	 estimates	 and	 judgments	 made	 	 by	 the	 directors	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 the	 accounts,	 and	 of	 whether	 	 the	 accounting	 policies	 are	 appropriate	 to	 the	 group’s	 and	 company’s	 circumstances,	 consistently	 applied	 and	 adequately	 disclosed.	 We	 planned	 and	 performed	 our	 audit	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 all	 the	 information	 and	 explanations	 which	 we	 considered	 necessary	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 us	 with	 sufficient	 evidence	 to	 give	 reasonable	 assurance	 that	 the	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 are	 free	 from	 material	 misstatement,	 whether	 caused	 by	 fraud	 or	 other	 irregularity	 or	 error .	 In	 forming	 our	 opinion	 we	 also	 evaluated	 the	 overall	 adequacy	 of	 the	 presentation	 of	 information	 	 in	 the	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 	 to	 be	 audited.	 Opinion 
In	 our	 opinion:
n	the 	 group	 accounts	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view,	 in	 accordance	 	 with	 IFRS	 as	 adopted	 by	 the	 EU,	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 group’s	 affairs	 	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2006	 and	 of	 its	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 then	 ended;	 n	the 	 group	 accounts	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985	 and	 Article	 4	 of	 the	 IAS	 Regulation;	 n	the 	 parent	 company	 accounts	 give	 a	 true	 and	 fair	 view,	 in	 accordance	 with	 UK	 Generally	 Accepted	 Accounting	 Practice,	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the	 parent	 company’s	 affairs	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2006;	 and	 n	the 	 parent	 company	 accounts	 and	 the	 part	 of	 the	 directors’	 remuneration	 report	 to	 be	 audited	 have	 been	 properly	 prepared	 	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Companies	 Act	 1985;	 and
n	the 	 information	 given	 in	 the	 directors’	 report	 is	 consistent	 with	 	 the	 accounts.

4155 AMEC_back_06.indd   112 4/4/07   15:28:47 Investor relations report
Overview
AMEC	 investor	 relations	 is	 committed	 to	 improving	 the	 understanding	 of	 AMEC	 and	 its	 business	 activities	 in	 the	 financial	 community,	 enabling	 financial	 markets	 to	 place	 an	 appropriate	 valuation	 on	 	 the	 company.
This	 report	 provides	 an	 overview	 of	 AMEC’s	 investor	 relations	 strategy,	 the	 investor	 relations	 programme	 in	 2006	 and	 other	 information	 of	 interest	 to	 shareholders.
AMEC’s	 investor	 relations	 strategy	 reflects	 the	 company’s	 guiding	 principles	 (available	 at	 www.amec.com)	 and	 its	 responsibilities	 to	 shareholders,	 which	 are:
n	to 	 seek	 to	 achieve	 the	 best	 returns	 on	 investment	 that	 markets	 will	 allow	 and	 provide	 accurate	 and	 timely	 information	 on	 the	 company’s	 performance;	 and	 n	to 	 manage	 the	 affairs	 of	 the	 company	 through	 responsible	 and	 effective	 corporate	 governance,	 identifying	 and	 managing	 the	 risks	 inherent	 in	 our	 activities	 on	 an	 ongoing	 basis.
The	 strategy	 is	 focused	 on	 three	 key	 areas	 which	 are:
n	Compliance 	 with	 all	 regulations	 relating	 to	 the	 conduct	 of	 companies	 listed	 on	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange.	 This	 includes	 ensuring	 that	 all	 market	 sensitive	 information	 is	 issued	 first	 through	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange	 and	 as	 soon	 as	 possible	 thereafter	 is	 made	 available	 to	 the	 financial	 community	 through	 various	 channels	 including	 AMEC’s	 corporate	 website	 at	 www.amec.com;	 n	Understanding 	 the	 shareholder	 base	 and	 market	 sentiment	 towards	 AMEC.	 This	 is	 achieved	 through	 close	 working	 relationships	 with	 advisers,	 regular	 share	 register	 analysis	 and	 non-attributable	 feedback	 from	 analysts	 and	 investors;	 and	 n	Delivery 	 of	 a	 comprehensive	 programme	 of	 investor	 relations	 activity	 involving	 effective	 communication	 and	 consultation	 with	 current	 and	 potential	 investors	 and	 analysts.
AMEC	 investor	 relations	 controls	 and	 coordinates	 the	 company’s	 programme	 of	 investor	 relations	 activity	 in	 line	 with	 this	 strategy.	 	 In	 support	 of	 its	 objectives,	 AMEC	 has	 put	 in	 place	 a	 management	 	 and	 policy	 framework	 for	 investor	 relations	 which	 includes	 mandatory	 policies	 on	 contact	 with	 the	 financial	 community,	 stock	 exchange	 announcements	 and	 published	 information.	 These	 documents	 are	 available	 to	 employees	 on	 the	 company’s	 intranet.
Review of 2006
Key	 events	 in	 AMEC’s	 investor	 relations	 programme	 are	 the	 company’s	 preliminary	 and	 interim	 results	 announcements,	 annual	 general	 meeting	 and	 related	 trading	 updates.	 In	 the	 year	 ended	 14	 March	 2007,	 these	 events	 took	 place	 on	 the	 following	 dates:	 Annual	 general	 meeting	 trading	 update	 	 17	 May	 2006
Trading	 update	 	 16	 June	 2006
Interim	 results	 announcement	 	 31	 August	 2006
Strategy	 and	 trading	 update	 	 13	 December	 2006
Preliminary	 results	 announcement	 	 14	 March	 2007
On	 the	 days	 the	 preliminary	 and	 interim	 results	 were	 announced,	 AMEC’s	 chief	 executive	 and	 finance	 director	 made	 presentations	 to	 analysts,	 institutional	 investors	 and	 banks	 in	 London,	 with	 their	 slides	 being	 published	 at	 the	 time	 of	 delivery	 on	 AMEC’s	 website.	 Interviews	 were	 also	 given	 to	 journalists	 from	 leading	 newswires	 and	 the	 national	 and	 regional	 press.
Following	 both	 the	 preliminary	 and	 interim	 results	 announcements,	 major	 shareholders	 were	 offered	 one-on-one	 meetings	 with	 management,	 with	 other	 institutional	 shareholders	 being	 offered	 	 the	 opportunity	 to	 attend	 group	 meetings	 hosted	 by	 the	 company’s	 brokers.
During	 the	 course	 of	 2006,	 AMEC	 met	 with	 a	 total	 of	 97	 institutions	 (2005:	 85),	 predominantly	 from	 the	 UK	 and	 US.
Analysts	 and	 investors	 value	 opportunities	 to	 meet	 operational	 management	 and	 to	 undertake	 site	 visits.	 In	 May	 2006,	 analysts	 	 and	 institutional	 investors	 visited	 Azerbaijan,	 where	 they	 received	 presentations	 on	 the	 Natural	 Resources	 business	 and	 visited	 AMEC’s	 facility	 in	 Baku.	 The	 event	 was	 announced	 in	 advance	 to	 the	 London	 Stock	 Exchange,	 with	 all	 slides	 being	 published	 on	 www.amec.com.	 Non-attributable	 feedback	 from	 the	 event	 was	 extremely	 positive.
AMEC	 recognises	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 internet	 in	 financial	 communications	 and	 closely	 follows	 developments	 in	 best	 practice	 	 in	 investor	 communications	 on	 the	 internet.	 Starting	 with	 the	 2006	 preliminary	 results,	 AMEC’s	 results	 presentations	 are	 now	 webcast	 and	 are	 available	 on-demand	 at	 the	 company’s	 website.

Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
During 2008, Vernalis has been able successfully to implement
a far-reaching restructuring of its operations, including a major
headcount reduction and the divestment and realisation of
several assets. Since the year end Vernalis has announced
a fully underwritten £22.1 million (net of expenses) equity
fundraising. These successes have placed the Group on a robust
ﬁnancial platform with a signiﬁcantly extended cash runway.
In parallel, the Group has achieved further important progress
with its innovative clinical development pipeline, and also with
its discovery operations, which although reduced in size, have
progressed two novel late-stage programmes, one of which has
entered pre-clinical development since the year end.
Peter Fellner Chairman
The Vernalis clinical pipeline was strengthened further
with the reacquisition of V85546 in 2008 and the entry of
V158866 into pre-clinical studies in early 2009. The Group’s
broad pipeline, with four product candidates in Phase II
development, three further products in Phase I and two
programmes in pre-clinical is exceptional for a company
the size of Vernalis. This novel pipeline represents the key
element underpinning the Group’s capacity to create new
value. Three of the pipeline products are partnered with two
major companies, and further partnerships will be pursued
during 2009.
We have also put in place an outstanding new management
team. The restructuring and subsequent reorientation of the
Group has been very effectively led by our Chief Operating
Ofﬁcer, John Slater. A new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Ian Garland,
who has an excellent track record in the biotechnology
sector, joined the Group at the end of 2008, and we have
also recruited a highly qualiﬁed, new Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,
David Mackney. Both Ian and David recently oversaw the
successful refocusing of Acambis plc, leading to its
acquisition by Sanoﬁ-Aventis in September 2008.
I believe that this new management team will substantially
reinforce the Group’s ability to build value from its strong
development pipeline, and also enable it to pursue a robust
and realistic business strategy.
During 2009, there will be a number of changes to the
Vernalis Board as a consequence of these appointments
and to streamline its structure at a time when tight control
of costs is paramount. I will be transitioning to non-executive
chairman and we will be reducing the number of non-
executive directors.
Finally, throughout the extensive changes which have
been implemented during the past year, our employees
and shareholders have given us very valuable support,
and on behalf of the Board I wish to thank them for this.
Dr Peter Fellner
Chairman
Chairman’s statement
04 Review 05
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Why did I join Vernalis?
Like many in the biotech sector, both in the UK and
internationally, I was familiar with Vernalis’ history and in
particular its 2007 failure to gain approval of Frova
®
in the
US for the additional indication of menstrual migraine prevention.
Upon closer review, however, with a broad pipeline and a
number of existing collaborations it was clear that there
remained tremendous potential and signiﬁcant unrecognised
value within the Group despite the Frova
®
disappointment.
That closer review also highlighted two key challenges that
the Group faced: insufﬁcient cash to deliver the potential
value in the pipeline and an unsustainable cash burn.
In the midst of a global recession and a continuing credit
crisis it was always going to be difﬁcult to attract new
investment into Vernalis, particularly because of the recent
Frova®disappointment, but I felt the upside potential
justiﬁed taking on these challenges and four months into
the role I have no regrets.
Future strategy
Our strategy to re-build signiﬁcant value for shareholders
is to take a risk-based approach to investment in high
potential value novel medicines while maintaining a tight
control of costs.
Partnering will be a key component of our strategy both in
the near and midterm, and we will endeavour only to develop
programmes that are of interest to potential partners. Some
programmes will be partnered with no further investment
by the Group. These will be the programmes where the risk
and level of investment required is greater than could be
taken on by a company of our size. We will, through such
partnering, build a portfolio of development programmes
in which we retain an economic upside without requiring
signiﬁcant further involvement or investment from the Group.
We will continue to invest in the remaining programmes
potentially up to proof-of-concept to increase their value
to the Group. We will partner these programmes when the
value we can achieve from partnering provides a substantial
return on our investment or when the risk and cost of
continued in-house development is inappropriate for a
company the size of Vernalis.
Our pipeline of development programmes will be sourced from
both internal investment in research and through in-licensing
or acquisition of early stage programmes that meet our tight
criteria for investment. The costs of maintaining an in-house
research capability are substantial so we will seek to fund
the majority of our research infrastructure through external
collaborations. We will size our research activities based
upon the number of active collaborations so as to maintain
its affordability to the Group.
Chief Executive’s review
Ian Garland Chief Executive Ofﬁcer Review
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Chief Executive’s review continued
06
2008 review and recent progress
During 2008, the Group implemented an extensive
restructuring of its business under which it settled its loan
with Endo, raised ﬁnance with Paul Capital Healthcare
from its European frovatriptan royalty stream, sold Apokyn®
and the Group’s US Operations to Ipsen, closed its
Winnersh-based research and downsized from 210 to
90 heads. Restructuring was concluded in the second
half of 2008 and achieved its goal of refocusing the
Group on delivering shareholder value from its research
and development activities.
The Group expanded its pipeline during 2008 with the
October 2008 reacquisition from Merck Serono of exclusive
worldwide rights to V85546, a Phase II-ready novel selective
anti-inﬂammatory that targets MMP12 and has in-vivo efﬁcacy
in pre-clinical models of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and liver ﬁbrosis.
Since the end of the year the pipeline has been expanded
further with the selection of a pre-clinical candidate, V158866,
from our late-stage research programme targeting FAAH,
a novel target with potential application in a wide range
of chronic pain conditions. In December 2008 the Group
commenced recruitment of patients into a Phase IIb study
of V3381 in neuropathic pain. We anticipate full recruitment
of the 150 patients in this study by the end of 2009 and
data becoming available in 2010.
Final study data from the V10153 Phase II open label stroke
study has now been received and conﬁrms that 5 mg/kg is
the appropriate dose to take forward into future studies.
We will review the ﬁnal data from this study with key opinion
leaders during 2009 to determine the most appropriate path
for further development of this compound. We will not make
any further investment in V10153 in-house and instead will
seek to progress this programme in collaboration with a
partner. Our CB1 antagonist, V24343, is being evaluated
in an ongoing dose ranging Phase I study which is expected
to report during the ﬁrst half 2009. During late 2008,
the class-leading CB1 receptor antagonist marketed by
Sanoﬁ-Aventis was withdrawn from the market in the EU
following the decision by the EMEA that the beneﬁts of
the drug no longer outweighed its risks. Other companies
with CB1 receptor antagonists in development have halted
their programmes because of the uncertain path to
marketing approval. We will not undertake any further
in-house investment in V24343 and this programme
will be discontinued.
The Group’s partnering activities in 2008 were focused
on V1512, our treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Despite
a signiﬁcant effort and very broad interest in this late-stage
programme, partnering has not yet been concluded with
the commercial opportunity, timeline and cost of pursuing
a Phase III programme all being cited as key considerations.
To address these issues, we have evaluated an alternative
505(b)(2) ﬁling strategy in the US and are exploring
partnering on this revised approach. The Group acquired
rights to this programme through its acquisition of Cita,
which had licensed it from Chiesi and, consequently, the
Group’s potential economic interest in the programme
is substantially lower than for other programmes in its
pipeline because of milestone and revenue shares payable.
Two of the Group’s programmes are being developed
by partners. V2006, which is partnered under the name
BIIB014 with Biogen Idec, is in clinical development for
Parkinson’s Disease and NVP-AUY922, which is partnered
with Novartis, is currently in a Phase I oncology study. Since
the end of the year, Biogen Idec has highlighted favourable
top-line data from its two Phase IIa studies of V2006 and
has noted that it is now developing a package to support
registrational studies. Neither we nor Biogen Idec has
publicised a target date for full study data becoming
available nor the planned timing of progressing the
programmes into later-stage studies. We expect an update
from Novartis on progression of NVP-AUY922 in 2009.
Excellent progress has been made in 2008 in our late-stage
research programmes where, since the year end, one
pre-clinical candidate (V158866) has been selected from
our FAAH programme, and during 2009 we plan to select
a pre-clinical candidate from our Chk1 programme.
We have also made good progress against our stated goal
of substantially funding our research infrastructure with
collaborations. In October 2008 we earned a €0.5 million
milestone under our existing three-year collaboration
with Servier against two undisclosed oncology targets.
This collaboration provides staff funding, research and
development milestones and royalties.
V3381
Looking forward to 2009, a key priority will be V3381 Review
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
07
During 2008, a signiﬁcant headcount reduction was
implemented that consolidated research into Cambridge
and reduced the size of the corporate infrastructure. A key
element of our strategy to rebuild shareholder value is to
maintain a tight control on costs and to be as efﬁcient as
possible. Since the end of the year we have reviewed further
the size of the corporate infrastructure, including the costs
of being a public company. The outcome of that further
review is that some additional heads will be eliminated from
our corporate functions, savings will be made in external
costs and as noted in the Chairman’s statement we will
reduce the size of our Board. We will continually evaluate
the size of our infrastructure and adapt it to the business
needs as necessary.
In April 2009 we announced a £22.1 million fundraising
(net of expenses) through a fully underwritten placing and
open offer of 799,112,129 ordinary shares at 3 pence
per share. The proceeds from the equity ﬁnancing, which
are dependent upon approval by shareholders at a meeting
on 18 May 2009, coupled with our cost containment
efforts provide us with sufﬁcient cash resources for the
foreseeable future.
Looking forward to 2009, a key priority will be V3381 where
we aim to complete recruitment of the Phase IIb neuropathic
pain study by the end of the year and to make data available
in 2010. We plan to partner V3381 following that Phase IIb
data becoming available but will explore partnering options
in parallel with the ongoing study. The other key programmes
for in-house investment in 2009 are V158866, our novel pain
compound targeting FAAH, and our late stage Chk1 oncology
research programme where we expect to announce a pre-
clinical development candidate during this year.
Our 2009 partnering efforts will focus on V85546 and
V1512 where we see the greatest potential to secure deals.
We will also seek to partner V10153 but partnering this
programme will be challenging.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group in 2009 is transformed from that
faced at the end of 2008. We have a new management
team, a strong cash position and a clear strategy to re-build
shareholder value. The 2009 goals and priorities are clear
and we are focused on executing the plan to achieve them.

The Group expanded its pipeline during 2008 with the reacquisition
from Merck Serono of exclusive worldwide rights to V85546 08 Review
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Overview
There has been tremendous change in Vernalis’ business
during 2008 following the failure to gain approval of Frova®
for menstrual migraine in 2007. That change was essential
if Vernalis was to survive the Frova®disappointment and
12 months on the beneﬁts are now clear to see.
During the ﬁrst half of 2008, the Group negotiated
settlement of its US$56 million outstanding loan balance
with Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc, raised €18.4 million from
the sale of its European Frovatriptan royalties to Paul Capital
Healthcare and sold its US business and marketed product
Apokyn®to Ipsen SA. Also during the second half of 2008,
a substantial restructuring of its UK research, development
and corporate infrastructure was completed, resulting
in a reduction in total headcount from 210 to 90.
Entering the second half of 2008, the Group was
successfully repositioned as a development stage company.
Since the year end we have further reﬁned the Group’s
strategy, identifying those programmes which will be
partnered and those where further investment will be
made by the Group. This strategy is set out in more detail
in the Chief Executive’s review.
Our strategy is to seek validation from potential partners
of their interest in our programmes at an early stage, but
not necessarily to partner programmes at that time if the
terms could be improved substantially following further
modest investment at modest risk in-house. Taking this risk
balanced approach, we aim to build a growing portfolio of
programmes that are partnered and in which we retain an
economic participation but with limited in-house involvement
and investment. In this way we will be able to maintain
a tight control of costs, minimise overheads and retain
ﬂexibility to adapt to the inherent uncertainties in
developing novel medicines.

V3381 (Indantadol) – Neuropathic pain (Unpartnered)
Indantadol (V3381) is a novel small molecule with a dual
mechanism of action in development for the treatment of
neuropathic pain. It is both an NMDA antagonist and MAOA
inhibitor, which gives it the potential to moderate pain at
both central and peripheral sites by two different but
complimentary mechanisms. Indantadol has successfully
completed a Phase IIa trial in patients suffering neuropathic
pain from long-standing diabetes. A Phase II trial (the IN-
STEP study) to evaluate further the safety and efﬁcacy of
indantadol in patients with neuropathic pain due to diabetes
has been initiated. The study, which is being conducted
at sites in the US, Canada, UK and Czech Republic, is
scheduled to enrol 150 patients by the end of 2009
and report data in 2010.
V85546 – Inﬂammation (Unpartnered)
V85546 is a selective MMP 12 (macrophage elastase)
inhibitor which has been developed by Serono under
a collaboration initiated in 2000. Following the merger
of Serono with Merck KGA exclusive worldwide rights to
the MMPI programme have been reacquired by Vernalis.
V85546 has completed Phase I studies and is supported
by an extensive pre-clinical toxicology and pharmacology
package. There are several high value potential indications
for V85546, including COPD, MS and rheumatoid arthritis
and Vernalis is determining the optimal indication in which
to take it forward. In addition to the lead molecule, there
is also a back-up candidate ready to enter pre-clinical
development. It is likely that further development would be
conducted in collaboration with a partner, although options
for adding value by conducting a focussed proof-of-concept
study in one or more indications are being evaluated.
V1512 (Levodopa methyl ester/carbidopa) – Parkinson’s
disease (Unpartnered)
The cornerstone of Parkinson’s disease treatment is the
oral administration of L-dopa. Parkinson’s disease sufferers
experience impaired functioning of the gastrointestinal tract
which worsens as the disease advances and this causes
erratic absorption of L-dopa into the bloodstream.
V1512 is the same active drug substances as L-dopa/
carbidopa, the most widely prescribed form of L-dopa therapy
in the US, but is fully soluble in water and therefore should
be better absorbed by Parkinson’s disease sufferers with
impaired gastrointestinal motility. V1512 combines the
methyl ester of L-dopa, a pro-drug of L-dopa with signiﬁcantly
enhanced solubility, with carbidopa in a patented effervescent
formulation. It is expected that this product could provide
a valuable clinical advantage in patients with advanced
Parkinson’s disease, many of whom suffer from
gastrointestinal dysfunction and, as a result, experience
unreliable absorption of L-dopa. Data from a pharmacokinetic
study in patients with Parkinson’s disease have demonstrated
the improved reproducibility and reliability of L-dopa absorption
from V1512 compared with standard L-dopa therapy.
As a result of a detailed commercial assessment, Vernalis
has re-evaluated the strategy for V1512 and has determined
that the original plan, which was to conduct two Phase III
superiority studies comparing V1512 with Sinemet, was
not commercially optimal. Instead, Vernalis is undertaking
a commercial and partnering review with a view to using
the existing data package to ﬁle for early approval in the
US using the 505(b)(2) ﬁling process.
V2006 (BIIB014) – Parkinson’s disease (Partnered)
V2006 is an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist in
development as a novel treatment for Parkinson’s disease.
V2006 has been licensed to Biogen Idec which is conducting
the development programme. Vernalis will receive milestones
as V2006 progresses through development and, subsequently,
royalties on future sales. Since the end of the year Biogen
Idec has highlighted favourable top-line data from Phase IIa
studies. In a study of late-stage Parkinson’s disease patients
in combination with L-dopa, top-line data showed V2006 to
be well tolerated and to have a dose-dependent clinically-
relevant effect on “off” time and “on” time from the symptoms
of the disease, including tremor, slowness, stiffness and
difﬁculty walking. In a monotherapy, placebo-controlled
study in early Parkinson’s disease patients, top-line data
also showed V2006 to be well tolerated and to cause
a dose-dependent clinically-relevant decrease in the
Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Score Part III (Motor).
Biogen Idec is now developing a data package to support
registrational studies.

NVP-AUY922 – Cancer (Partnered)
NVP-AUY922 is a novel Hsp90 inhibitor for the treatment
of a range of cancers and is being developed by Novartis.
It is the ﬁrst compound from a collaboration with Novartis
to enter clinical testing and is currently being evaluated
in a Phase I programme in patients in solid tumours and
haematological cancers. Vernalis will receive milestone
payments, as it progresses through development and
royalty payments upon commercialisation.
In addition to the intravenous agent NVP-AUY922, Novartis
is also advancing an oral Hsp90 inhibitor through pre-clinical
development as part of the collaboration on which Vernalis
is also entitled to milestone payments and royalties.
V158866 FAAH inhibitor – Pain (Unpartnered)
Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) has been the target
for a late-stage research programme for the management
of pain and has resulted in a lead molecule, V158866,
advancing into pre-clinical development in March 2009.
FAAH is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of the
endocannabinoid anandamide and its inhibition results
in elevated anandamide. Anandamide is a central and
peripheral neurotransmitter which, amongst other actions,
can interact with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors.
Key performance indicator:

These studies are being undertaken by partners who
do not disclose target dates.
In man, stimulation of these receptors has been shown
to relieve chronic pain in patients with spinal cord injuries
and multiple sclerosis. As FAAH inhibitors are thought to
selectively increase anandamide in tissues mediating pain
responses, they cause a powerful analgesic response
in the absence of the side effects associated with more
widespread cannabinoid receptor activation.
The Group anticipates V158866 will enter clinical
development in 2010 and Phase I is expected to include
evaluation of the effects of the compound in one or more
experimental models of pain.
V10153 – Ischaemic Stroke (Unpartnered)
V10153 is a novel, recombinant human thrombolytic
protein which is being developed for the treatment of acute
ischaemic stroke. Current therapeutic options for stroke
sufferers are limited since the only approved drug therapy,
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), must be
administered within three hours of a stroke occurring.
V10153 has been evaluated in a Phase IIa safety study
in 49 patients. This trial was a dose escalation safety study,
designed to identify an appropriate dose to take forward into
future trials. The study was discontinued at a dose of 7.5
mg/kg following the occurrence of several bleeding events and
consequently the previous dose level (5 mg/kg) was identiﬁed
as the appropriate dose to study in the next series of studies.
Plans are being developed for additional studies to assess
V10153 in a broader range of patients, including patients
in the early time window who currently receive rt-PA, since
V10153 has potential clinical advantages over rt-PA. These
advantages include a prolonged plasma half-life which may
reduce the re-occlusion rate and allows administration
by bolus injection rather than infusion. Partners are being
sought for this programme and further studies with V10153
will only be conducted in collaboration with a partner,
but partnering of this programme will be challenging.
V24343 – Obesity (Unpartnered)
V24343 is a cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) antagonist
which is a potential treatment for obesity, diabetes and
related disorders. V24343 has successfully completed
a series of Phase I studies which showed that V24343
NVP-AUY922

Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
produced signiﬁcant weight loss in overweight and mildly
obese volunteers while being generally well tolerated and
without any serious adverse events. A further Phase I study
to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy of lower doses is ongoing
and will complete in H1 2009. The pre-clinical and clinical
data indicate a wide safety margin and suggest that
the centrally mediated side effects seen with other CB1
antagonists may be less problematic with V24343. Following
the withdrawal of rimonabant in Europe late in 2008
and cessation of active programmes by other companies
developing CB1 antagonists for obesity, we will not undertake
any further in-house investment in V24343 and this
programme will be discontinued.
Discovery programmes
The Vernalis Research team has established a track record
in innovation in drug discovery by building and applying
a proprietary structure and fragment-based platform which
has not only underpinned the Group’s research by delivering
drug candidates but also formed the basis of a number
of collaborations. Currently the Group is actively involved
in an ongoing multi-target collaboration with Servier in
oncology for protein-protein interactions.
The platform employs leading fragment-based hit identiﬁcation
strategies together with structure-guided medicinal chemistry
to generate novel compounds for optimisation as drug
candidates. This process has successfully delivered clinical
candidates to a number of internal and collaboration
programmes. Current internal research effort is centred
on a range of oncology targets, exploiting the inherent
structure-based drug design expertise and chemical
templates. Targets include established protein kinases
as well as protein-protein interactions and metabolic
targets critical to cancer cell growth.
Key late-stage discovery programmes
Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitors – Cancer
Some cancer cells use the Chk1 pathway to increase cell
survival by pausing DNA replication and allowing repair of
the damaged DNA before completing cell division. Inhibition
of Chk1 blocks this pathway, forcing cells to undergo cell
division (mitosis) with substantial DNA damage that results
in their death. The aim of this programme is to identify
product candidates that increase the anti-tumour efﬁcacy
FAAH
V158866, selected as a pre-clinical candidate from
our late-stage research programme targeting FAAH
of current cytotoxic agents without increasing their toxicity
to non-cancerous tissues. A pre-clinical development candidate
is expected to be declared in 2009, subject to the satisfactory
outcome of a range of in-vivo efﬁcacy models.
Other discovery programmes
Vernalis research has established a portfolio of new
programmes and expects that two of these will have
reached the lead optimisation stage during the year.
Marketed products
Frovatriptan – Acute Migraine
Vernalis maintains a partial economic interest in frovatriptan,
a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, which is approved
as an acute oral treatment for migraine headache and its
associated symptoms. Commercialisation rights to frovatriptan
are licensed to Endo for North America and to Menarini for
Europe and Central America.
From 1 January 2008, pursuant to a loan settlement with
Endo, Vernalis will only earn royalties on sales of Frova®
(frovatriptan) in the US above US$85 million per annum.
Endo reported that North American net sales of Frova®
in 2008 were US$58.0 million (2007: US$52.4 million).
From 1 January 2008, Paul Capital Healthcare acquired an
interest in 90 per cent of Vernalis’ revenues under Vernalis’
collaboration with its European partner, Menarini. In Europe
and Central America, Menarini reported net sales for 2008
of €28.9 million (2007: €22.1 million).
SK Chemicals, with whom Vernalis signed an agreement
to distribute frovatriptan in South Korea in September 2004,
ﬁled for approval with the Korean FDA in July 2008 and
approval is expected mid-year in 2009.
Apokyn® – Advanced Parkinson’s disease
In June 2008, the Group announced the sale of Apokyn® ,
the only acute, intermittent therapy available in the US for
the treatment of “off” episodes (re-emergence of Parkinson’s
disease symptoms) associated with advanced Parkinson’s
disease, together with the Group’s US commercial
operations to Ipsen. 12 Review
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Vernalis had out-licensed the marketing rights to Frova®
in North America to Endo for US$60 million in 2004,
retaining royalties on future sales whilst also entering
into a loan agreement with Endo, borrowing US$50 million.
On 19 February 2008 Vernalis reached agreement with
Endo for an early settlement of this loan, making a
US$7 million payment as well as foregoing future
royalties on annual US net sales until US sales exceed
US$85 million per annum.
Soon after this agreement was signed, Vernalis announced
a business restructuring which included the divestment
of Apokyn®together with its US commercial operations
to Ipsen SA. The sale was for an initial consideration of
US$6.5 million with up to a further US$6 million of
milestones payable. Since the sale completed the Group
has received US$1 million of the additional milestones
but there is uncertainty at this time as to whether more
of these milestones will be received because they are
dependent upon performance-related activities. Ipsen
also subscribed for US$5.0 million of Vernalis shares
at a 20 per cent premium as part of this divestment.
The sale and restructuring were completed as scheduled
by the third quarter, reducing the Group headcount
from 210 to 90.
On 20 April 2008, Vernalis also realised its European income
stream from frovatriptan, via an agreement with Paul Capital
Healthcare. €18.4 million was received from Paul Capital
Healthcare in return for the rights to 90 per cent of the income
due from Menarini under the collaboration agreement. The
Group has ongoing obligations to supply Menarini with active
pharmaceutical product, the cost of which will approximate
to the 10 per cent of income retained by the Group.
As a result of these actions Vernalis has managed to
strengthen its balance sheet as well as reduce its ongoing
operating expenditure but has had to sell its income streams
from its two marketed products, Apokyn®and frovatriptan
to achieve this goal.
Income statement
Revenue from continuing operations for the year was
£54.8 million (2007: £19.8 million) which included
£44.6 million of exceptional revenue (2007: nil) as a result
of the Endo loan settlement. £24.2 million of the exceptional
revenue was recognised as an advance payment of royalties
which effectively discharged the balance of the loan that was
still owed to Endo. The remaining £20.4 million related to the
release of deferred income from the initial US$60 million
payment received from Endo for the rights to Frova.
This deferred income was being recognised in the income
statement on a straight line basis over the life of the
patent to 2014.
Financial review
Vernalis has been substantially restructured during the year
following the decision by the FDA not to approve Frova
®
for the
short-term prevention of menstrual migraine in September 2007.
At the end of 2007 the Group had cash resources (being cash
and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets)
of £20.5 million but a business that was burning signiﬁcant
amounts of cash each year. The Group also had a US$56 million
outstanding loan balance from Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. that
was due to be repaid in full in September 2009. As a consequence
Vernalis was forced to restructure the business during 2008 as well
as raise cash from product divestments and licensing arrangements.
David Mackney Chief Financial Ofﬁcer Review 13
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Pre-exceptional revenues from continuing operations for the
year were £10.2 million (2007: £19.8 million) and included
£6.3 million (2007: £9.4 million) in respect of European
revenues from the supply of frovatriptan to Menarini and
£3.9 million (2007: £6.5 million) in respect of collaboration
income and deferred revenue. The supply of frovatriptan
in 2007 included a stock build of active pharmaceutical
product as a result of Menarini taking the dosage manufacture
and packaging of frovatriptan in-house. Previously, Vernalis
had been responsible for the manufacture and supply of
packaged drug product for each European market. The 2007
collaboration income included £3.2 million of deferred
revenue arising on the initial licensing of Frova®to Endo for
the US market. In 2007, Vernalis also received £3.9 million
in respect of North American royalties from Frova®but this
income stream was used to settle the Endo loan at the
start of the year and so no income was recognised in 2008.
Cost of sales from continuing operations for the year
amounted to £15.6 million (2007: £5.8 million) and
comprised £13.6 million of exceptional cost (2007: nil)
in respect of the accelerated amortisation of the US Frova®
marketing rights as a result of the transaction with Endo.
Of the remaining costs of sales, £0.6 million related to the
supply of frovatriptan to Menarini (2007: £1.8 million) and
£1.4 million related to amortisation of intangible assets
(2007: £3.5 million).
Research and development expenditure from continuing
operations, before exceptional items, reduced to £16.1
million (2007: £21.6 million) and comprised £14.0 million
(2007: £17.1 million) of internally funded research and
development costs and £2.1 million (2007: £4.5 million) of
external costs associated with development of the product
portfolio. The decrease in external costs is due to lower
clinical costs on V24343 and V10153 in the year. The
exceptional charge of £11.3 million (2007: £16.3 million)
reﬂects the write down of the intangible assets relating to
V1512 and Pin1 of £9.9 million and £1.4 million of staff
related restructuring expenses. The 2007 exceptional
charge was a result of changes made to the product
portfolio development plan following the non-approvable
letter from the FDA in respect of Frova
®
for menstrual migraine.
General and administrative expenditure from continuing
operations, before exceptional items, was £4.7 million
(2007: £6.2 million). The reduction was due to lower
levels of staff and infrastructure costs following the 2008
restructuring. The exceptional credit of £5.3 million (2007:
charge of £1.5 million) comprises the release of the liability
for deferred consideration of £10.3 million in relation to the
acquisition of Cita, partially offset by a £3.3 million increase
in the vacant lease provision and £1.8 million of staff-related
restructuring expenses. The 2007 exceptional costs resulted
from a goodwill impairment of £3.0 million offset by a
reduction in the vacant lease provision of £1.5 million.
Staff-related restructuring costs of £3.2 million within
research and development expenditure and general and
administrative expenditure resulted in cash outﬂows of
£2.5 million with the remainder being an accelerated
share-based payment charge.
The operating loss for the year from continuing operations,
before exceptional items, was £12.5 million (2007:
£13.8 million). The total operating proﬁt for the year from
continuing operations was £12.4 million (2007: operating
loss £31.7 million) reﬂecting the exceptional proﬁt created
on the settlement of the Endo loan release of the deferred
consideration on the Cita acquisition of £10.3 million
only partially offset by 2008 restructuring costs and the
£9.9 million write down of V1512 and Pin1.
Finance income decreased to £1.4 million (2007:
£2.3 million). The reduction is primarily due to lower
average cash balances during the year, lower interest
rates and a translational exchange gain in 2007 due
to the strengthening of sterling against the dollar during
that year.
Finance expense increased to £11.2 million (2007:
£2.2 million). The increase included £3.3 million in relation
to the ﬁnance cost of the Paul Capital Healthcare loan,
a £3.1 million translational exchange loss on the Paul
Capital Healthcare loan and a £2.8 million exchange
loss on contingent deferred consideration. This was
offset by a reduction in the interest relating to the
loan agreement with Endo of £1.4 million.
The tax credit of £1.3 million (2007: £2.6 million)
represents amounts that are expected to be received under
current legislation on research and development tax credits.
Discontinued operations
The loss for the year from discontinued operations amounted
to £3.9 million (2007: £16.5 million). The discontinued
operations comprise the Group’s commercialisation and
development activities on Apokyn®and the revenues and
expenditures of the US commercial operation.
£17 .2 million
Cash resources at 31 December 2008 14 Review
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Financial review continued
Balance sheet
Non-current assets decreased to £17.3 million (2007:
£40.7 million) due principally to the reduction of intangible
assets from £39.5 million to £16.4 million. In addition to
the regular annual amortisation charge, an additional charge
of £13.6 million was recognised as accelerated amortisation
on the sale of future royalties following the sale of the US
marketing rights to Endo and £9.9 million in relation to the
write down of V1512 and Pin1. These charges were offset
by an exchange gain of £1.8 million on the retranslation
of balances denominated in foreign currencies.
Current assets decreased to £23.5 million (2007:
£29.3 million). Cash resources, comprising held-to-maturity
ﬁnancial assets of £2.5 million (2007: £0.4 million) and
cash and cash equivalents of £14.7 million (2007: £20.1
million) decreased by £3.3 million. The remainder of the
decrease in current assets is principally due to a lower tax
receivable of £1.6 million (2007: £2.4 million) reﬂecting
lower spend on research and development in the year,
and a lower trade and other receivable of £4.4 million
(2007: £6.0 million) due to the timing of shipments of
active pharmaceutical product to Menarini.
Total liabilities decreased to £34.1 million (2007: £72.6
million). Borrowings decreased due to the repayment of the
Endo loan, which was in part replaced by the loan with Paul
Capital Healthcare (a net decrease of £10.1 million). The
reduction of deferred income of £21.8 million was principally
due to the release of £20.4 million of deferred income on
the Endo initial licensing agreement. The provision for vacant
property increased by £2.7 million (2008: £7.1 million,
2007: £4.4 million) due to the 2008 restructuring of
operations and the opening returns and rebates provision
of £0.6 million was utilised and released. The deferred
consideration liability was released in the year, a reduction
of £7.0 million. The remaining trade and other liabilities
decreased by £1.4 million, due to a decrease in accruals
resulting from a reduction in external research and
development activity as well as a reduction in the overall
operational cost base. This was partially offset by an
increase in the royalty payment due to GSK as a result of the
retranslation of this foreign currency denominated balance.
Cash ﬂow
Cash resources, comprising held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets
and cash and cash equivalents decreased by £3.3 million
to £17.2 million (2007: £20.5 million). £14.7 million was
received from Paul Capital Healthcare. The sale of Apokyn®
and the US operations generated £5.2 million net of
expenses including proceeds from the issue of shares
to Ipsen as part of this transaction. Restructuring costs
of £2.5 million were paid in the year and £3.5 million
(US$7 million) was also paid to Endo as part of the early
settlement of the loan. £3.5 million of cash outﬂows also
related to discontinued operations.
Outlook for 2009
On the 29 April the Group announced that it is to raise
approximately £22.1 million (net of expenses), by way of
a fully underwritten Placing and Open Offer. This fundraising,
which is subject to shareholder approval, together with
existing cash resources, will successfully fund the business
for the foreseeable future, allowing management to deliver
data from the V3381 Phase IIb neuropathic pain study,
to progress V158866 and the Chk1 candidate through
pre-clinical studies and to execute its out-licensing strategy
for V85546 and V1512 in particular. Efﬁciency and cost control
will be paramount to ensure that cash is very tightly managed.

Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Principal risks and uncertainties facing
the business – risk factors
1 The Group may require additional funding in the longer
term (being not less than 12 months from the date of
this document).
2 Vernalis has a high degree of product concentration and
the failure of any one product could have a signiﬁcant
impact on the Company’s share price.
3 Failure by Vernalis Development Ltd, a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Group, to meet its obligations under the
Paul Capital Healthcare Agreements relating to frovatriptan
could adversely impact the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
4 The Group’s success will continue to be highly dependent
on collaborators.
5 The Group cannot guarantee that its collaborators
will devote sufﬁcient resources to collaborations
with the Group or that the Group’s drug candidates
can be developed and commercialised without
these collaborators.
6 If the Group fails to maintain existing research
collaborations, or sign future research collaborations,
it will reduce its research activities appropriately.
7 The Group has a history of operating losses and
negative cash ﬂow and may never become proﬁtable.
8 The Company does not expect to pay dividends in the
near future.
9 The Group may be unable to retain certain important
employees which could weaken the Group’s scientiﬁc
and management capabilities.
10 No assurance can be made that the Group will be able
to bring any of the drug candidates it is developing
to market.
11 The drugs that the Group brings to market may not be
commercially successful.
12 There can be no assurance that the Group’s products will
receive and maintain regulatory approval. The complexity
and multi-jurisdictional nature of the applicable regulatory
processes could result in delays in achieving such
regulatory approval.
13 Even if the Group’s products are approved, they may
still face later regulatory difﬁculties.
14 The Group’s business faces intense competition from
major pharmaceutical companies and specialised
biotechnology companies engaged in the development
of drugs directed at the conditions and disorders that
are the focus of the Group’s drug programmes.
15 Technological changes could overtake the products
being developed by the Group.
16 The Group may not be able to sell its drugs proﬁtably
if reimbursement from third party payers, including
government and private health insurers, is unavailable
or limited.
17 The Group may be unable to successfully establish and
protect its intellectual property which is signiﬁcant to
the Group’s competitive position.
18 The Group may incur substantial costs as a result
of disputes relating to intellectual property.
19 Foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations may adversely affect
the Group’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
20 The Group is dependent on single sources of supply
for its compounds in research and development and
for frovatriptan and some of their components.
21 The Group’s suppliers may encounter unexpected
difﬁculties in the design and construction of
manufacturing processes and the scale-up of production
to viable commercial levels.
22 If the Group fails to maintain its computer hardware,
software and related infrastructure, progress in research
and development could be delayed and revenues lost.
23 Investors should consider the Group’s business
and prospects in light of the heightened risks and
unexpected expenses and problems the Group may
face as a business in an early stage of development
in a rapidly evolving industry.
24 The Group may be unable to secure adequate insurance
at an acceptable cost.
25 Competition regulation may have an impact on the way
the Group conducts its business and its dealings with
private counterparties and government collaborators.
26 The use of hazardous materials may subject the Group
to additional compliance costs and/or liability in the
event of a hazardous waste spill or other accident.
27 The Group may face product liability claims. The Group
may become subject to shareholders’ action.
28 The Group may be subject to special interest groups
and adverse public opinion. 16 Management and governance

Key events
Key events during the past year are referred to in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the business review
and the ﬁnancial review. These events include the following:
> On 20 February, Vernalis announced it had agreed terms for the early settlement of the amount due to Endo Pharmaceuticals
Inc under the loan agreement between the companies. The US$56m outstanding balance on the loan has been discharged
in full. Key terms of the settlement were: immediate cancellation of the loan, Vernalis paid Endo US$7 million (approximately
£3.5 million) in cash; Vernalis to forego future royalties on US sales of Frova®until annual US net sales exceed a threshold
of US$85 million (for sales in excess of US$85 million and for all other terms, the licence agreement remains unchanged);

Corporate governance report
The Combined Code
The Group is committed to practising good corporate governance of its affairs as part of its management of relationships
with its shareholders and other stakeholders. The Group seeks to uphold and to report on compliance with best practice
in corporate governance.
Compliance statement
The directors are satisﬁed that, unless disclosed otherwise within this report, the Group has complied with the provisions set out
in section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in June 2006 and was compliant throughout the ﬁnancial
period under review. During the current ﬁnancial year, the Board will continue to assess its practices to ensure compliance with
the Combined Code on an ongoing basis and will continue to monitor any changes required to be made to further develop and
enhance its governance policies. A copy of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance is publicly available on the FRC website
at www.frc.org.
The principles set out in the Combined Code cover four areas: the Board, directors’ remuneration, accountability and audit and
relations with shareholders. With the exception of directors’ remuneration (which is dealt with separately in the remuneration report)
the following section sets out how the Board has applied such principles.
The Board
The Board of the Company is responsible for the Group’s system of corporate governance. As at 31 December 2008, the Board
comprised eight directors: an Executive Chairman, Dr P J Fellner; a Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Mr I R Garland; one other executive
director, Mr J A D Slater, who was promoted to Chief Operating Ofﬁcer on 20 February 2008; and ﬁve non-executive directors.
On 2 February 2009 Mr D Mackney joined the Board as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. At least half the Board comprised independent
non-executive directors, in compliance with Combined Code provision A.3.2. The role of non-executive directors is to ensure that
independent judgement is brought to Board deliberations and decisions. The non-executive directors possess a wide range of
skills and experience relevant to the development of the Group, which complement those of the executive directors.
The Chairman operates in an executive capacity although management responsibility for the running of the business resides with the
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,
which have been set out in writing and agreed by the Board. Following the resignation of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (on 29 February
2008) and prior to the appointment of the new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer on 29 December 2008, the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer and Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer (until his resignation on 14 November 2008) reported directly to the Chairman. These positions now report to the
new Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. All non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent. Mr G M Kennedy, the Deputy
Chairman, is currently the Group’s Senior Independent Director.
Appointment and re-election of directors
All directors are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at the ﬁrst AGM after appointment and, thereafter, at least every
three years. Subject to their re-election and Companies Act provisions, the non-executive directors are appointed for speciﬁed terms.
The Board has agreed procedures for directors to follow if they believe they require independent professional advice in the
furtherance of their duties and these procedures allow the directors to take such advice at the Group’s expense. In addition,
all the directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary, who is also one
of the executive directors, is accountable to the Board through the Chairman on governance matters. It is the responsibility of the
Company Secretary to ensure that Board procedures are followed and all rules and regulations are complied with. Under the direction
of the Chairman, the Company Secretary’s responsibilities include facilitating induction and professional development of the directors
and ensuring the smooth ﬂow of information within the Board and its Committees and between non-executive directors and senior
management. Any new director receives a comprehensive, formal and tailored induction into the Group’s operations. Appropriate
training is provided to new directors and is also available to other directors as required. The Group has arranged directors’ and
ofﬁcers’ insurance on behalf of all the directors.
As part of its leadership and control of the Group, the Board has agreed a list of items that are speciﬁcally reserved for its
consideration. This list was reviewed in March 2009. These include business strategy and management, ﬁnancial reporting and
control, including approval of the annual budget, material acquisitions and divestments, major capital expenditure projects, Group
policies, corporate governance matters and establishing and monitoring internal controls. At each meeting, the Board reviews the
strategy and progress of the Group towards its objectives, particularly in respect of research and development projects, and monitors
ﬁnancial progress against budget. The Board typically has six scheduled meetings per year (approximately every two months), with
additional meetings when circumstances and urgent business dictate. In the ﬁnancial period under review, there were ﬁve scheduled
meetings of the full Board and ﬁve additional Board committee meetings were held. Of these, apologies for Board meetings were
received from: Dr Baxter on 20 March, Mr Clark on 31 January and 18 September, and Mr Kennedy on 18 September. Otherwise,
meetings were attended by all directors. All directors receive an agenda and Board papers in advance of meetings to help them
make an effective contribution at the meetings. Management and governance 2
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
In addition, the executive directors ensure regular informal contact is maintained with non-executive directors. The Board
makes full use of appropriate technology as a means of updating and informing all its members.
While the Board retains overall responsibility for, and control of, the Group, day-to-day management of the business is
conducted by the executive directors. Review of the Group’s principal business activities is the responsibility of the senior
management (comprising the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer, the Director of
Human Resources, the Research Director, the Development Director and the VP of Business Development) who meet weekly.
Board performance and appraisal
The Board has agreed a process of establishing a formal and rigorous process for the annual evaluation of its own performance
and that of its Committees and individual directors including the Chairman. In line with the practice in previous years, a
questionnaire was issued to all Board members to facilitate a Board review covering: the responsibilities and the roles of
individual directors and the Board as a whole; the separate roles of non-executive directors and executive directors; the conduct
of Board meetings and committees of the Board; the Board’s role in monitoring the performance of the Group; the Group’s
leadership and culture; and corporate governance practices. Noting the changes of executive directors during the year, it was
agreed that a more detailed review be undertaken during 2009 once the revised Board, including the newly recruited executive
directors, had been established.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to meet without the presence of executive directors as appropriate.
Board committees
In accordance with best practice, the Group has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination and Corporate Governance
Committees with written terms of reference for each that deal with their authorities and duties. The full terms of reference of
all the Committees have been published on the Group’s website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent non-executive directors. During the ﬁnancial period under review it was
chaired by Ms Ferguson, who the Board considers has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The other current members are
Mr Kennedy, Dr Read, Dr Baxter and Mr Clark. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group’s annual accounts and
interim reports prior to their submission for approval to the full Board. This Committee also monitors the Group’s accounting
policies and the effectiveness of the internal ﬁnancial control systems and ﬁnancial reporting procedures. The Audit Committee
provides a forum through which the Group’s external auditors report to the Board. The auditors attend their meetings and have
the opportunity to meet privately with Committee members in the absence of executive management. In addition, the Audit
Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment and removal of the auditors and agrees the level of audit fees.
The Committee also monitors the scope and results of the audit, the independence and objectivity of the auditors and their
performance. In order to safeguard the auditors’ objectivity and independence, the Audit Committee pre-approves any non-audit
services to be performed by the auditors and has done so throughout the term of ofﬁce. These include services relating to tax, the
issue of investment circulars, accounting and auditing-related advice. The independent auditors continue to operate procedures
to safeguard against the possibility that the auditors’ objectivity and independence could be compromised. This includes the use
of quality review partners, use of a technical review board (where appropriate) and annual independence procedures, including
conﬁrmations by all staff. The auditors’ report to the Audit Committee on matters including independence and non-audit fees on
an annual basis. In addition, the role of the audit partner is rotated on a periodic basis. The Audit Committee held two meetings
during the period under review. Of these, an apology was received from Dr Baxter for 20 March. Otherwise, meetings were
attended by all members.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee were reviewed in March 2009 and include the following responsibilities:
> To review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls and risk management systems and ﬁnancial reporting
procedures.
> To review the internal management of ﬁnancial matters.
> To review annually the need for an internal audit function.
> To consider and make recommendations regarding the appointment of the Group’s external auditors, including the
pre-approval of non-audit services.
> To establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting
control and auditing matters.
> To review the consistency and application of accounting policies.
> To review annual ﬁnancial statements, interim announcement and interim management statements before submission
for Board approval. 24 Management and governance
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is made up entirely of independent non-executive directors and, during the ﬁnancial period
under review, was chaired by Dr Read. The other current members are Dr Baxter, Ms Ferguson, Mr Kennedy and Mr Clark. The
Remuneration Committee determines the terms of service and remuneration of the executive directors and senior employees.
It also determines overall remuneration policy for all other employees and targets for performance-related pay schemes operated
by the Group. The Remuneration Committee held four meetings during the period under review. Of these, apologies for meetings
were received from Dr Baxter on 20 March and Mr Clark on 31 January, 20 March and 10 July. Otherwise, meetings were attended
by all members.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed in March 2009 and include the following responsibilities:
> To determine the framework and policy and the individual packages for the remuneration of the executive directors, Chairman
and other senior executives.
> To determine targets for the performance-related pay schemes.
> To approve overall remuneration policy.
> To review employee beneﬁt structures.
> To produce an annual report of the Committee’s remuneration policy.
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee is chaired by Mr Kennedy. The other members are Dr Fellner, Mr Sturge
(until his resignation on 29 February 2008), Dr Read and Mr Clark. The Committee is responsible to the full Board for determining
the qualities and experience required of the Group’s executive and non-executive directors and for identifying suitable candidates.
In appropriate cases, recruitment consultants assist in the process. For the appointment of Messrs Garland and Mackney,
no external consultants were involved. They were both introduced to the Board by the Chairman who had personal contact with
both individuals whilst employed at Acambis plc. The Committee is also responsible for succession planning and for reviewing,
and making recommendations in relation to, the Group’s corporate governance procedures. All nominations and corporate
governance issues were addressed by the full Board during the year and no separate meetings of this Committee were held.
The terms of reference of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee were reviewed in March 2009 and include the
following responsibilities:
> To review the structure, size and composition of the Board.
> To prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment.
> To identify and nominate candidates to ﬁll Board vacancies as and when they arise.
> To satisfy itself with regard to succession planning.
> To keep the effectiveness of the corporate governance under regular review.
Accountability and audit
The Board is responsible for the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that present a balanced assessment of the Group’s ﬁnancial
position and prospects. This responsibility is administered primarily by the Audit Committee, the terms of reference for which are
referred to above.
Internal controls
The Board is ultimately responsible for establishing and monitoring internal control systems throughout the Group and reviewing
their effectiveness at least annually. It recognises that rigorous systems of internal control are critical to the Group’s achievement
of its business objectives, that those systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and that they can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group has been in place for the
ﬁnancial period under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. The Audit Committee’s terms of
reference include the review of the Group’s internal ﬁnancial controls and risk management systems. The effectiveness of all the
Group’s internal controls including operational and compliance controls and risk management systems in effect during the year
has been reviewed by the Board.
Corporate governance report continued Management and governance 2
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
The Group’s internal controls are regularly reviewed as part of the risk management process and in compliance with the Turnbull
guidelines. The Board has in place a process by which internal controls are reviewed during the year. This process involved
a review of each area of the business to identify material risks and controls in place to manage these risks. Material controls
including ﬁnancial, operational, business and compliance controls and risk management processes were reviewed. The process
provided a means for prioritising those risks and evaluating those controls and assessing whether improvements were necessary.
The process was undertaken in consultation with senior managers with responsibility for particular controls. Where any signiﬁcant
weakness or failing was identiﬁed, appropriate remedial actions were recommended for implementation.
The active involvement of the executive directors in the Group’s management committees allows the Board to continually monitor
and assess the signiﬁcant business, operational, ﬁnancial, compliance and other risks and to review the effectiveness of internal
control. This is reinforced by the provision to the Board by the executive directors of regular and detailed reports covering, inter
alia, ﬁnancial performance, investor relations, research and development, clinical development, commercial interactions and
intellectual property management.
The directors consider that in view of the control procedures in place in the Group, and given the size of the Group’s operations
at this time, it is inappropriate to appoint an internal audit function.
Communication and reporting
The Group’s strategy and business objectives are communicated to all levels of the organisation. The executive directors hold
regular all-employee meetings to exchange information with staff.
Information
Board members and members of the other committees and groups which discuss risk issues are provided with timely and
detailed brieﬁngs on relevant matters.
Human resources
The Group endeavours to appoint employees with appropriate skills, knowledge and experience for the roles they undertake.
The Group has a range of policies which are aimed at retaining and incentivising key staff. Objectives are set for departments
and employees that are derived from the Group’s business objectives. The Group has a clear and well-understood organisational
structure and each employee knows his or her line of accountability.
Regulatory framework
Documented quality procedures are in place to ensure the maintenance of regulatory compliance. These are subject to periodic
review to ensure current standards of quality compliance are maintained. A quality group monitors compliance of contractors to
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) through the implementation
of a compliance programme for relevant in-house and contracted-out activities. A pharmacovigilance contractor is responsible for
monitoring and reporting adverse events in support of the Group’s marketed product and development programmes. These are
managed in accordance with formally documented procedures which comply with current regulatory requirements.
Announcements
All major announcements are approved by the Chairman, the executive directors and a panel of senior executive management
and then circulated to the Board prior to issue. The Group also has internal and external checks to guard against unauthorised
release of information.
Operational reviews
The Group has procedures that are designed to ensure that key documents, decision points and investment decisions are
reviewed by the right people. Decision points include each signiﬁcant clinical development decision.
Financial
A comprehensive budgeting system operates whereby managers submit detailed budgets, which are reviewed and amended
by executive directors prior to submission to the Board for approval. Each month, actual results are reported against budget
and distributed to managers and the Board.
Insurance
The Group has reviewed its portfolio of insurance policies with its insurance broker to ensure that the policies are appropriate
to the Group’s activities and exposures.
Shareholder relations
The Group reports formally to shareholders four times a year, around April (annual results) and August (interim statement)
and, as required under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, releases interim management statements around June and
November. The annual report is usually issued to shareholders in April or May. Separate announcements of all material events
are made as necessary. 26 Management and governance
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Regular communications are maintained with institutional shareholders and, in particular, presentations are given to shareholders
when the half-year and full-year ﬁnancial results are announced. In addition to the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief
Financial Ofﬁcer, who have regular contact with investors, Mr Kennedy, as Senior Independent Director, is available to meet with
shareholders if and when required. The whole Board is kept up to date at its regular meetings with the views of shareholders
and analysts.
The Group’s website (www.vernalis.com) provides an overview of the business including its strategy, products and objectives.
All Group announcements are available on the website and new announcements are published without delay. The terms of
reference of each of the Board’s three committees and other important corporate governance documents are displayed on
the Group’s website. Additionally, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer provides a focal point for shareholders’ enquiries and dialogue
throughout the year.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) provides the opportunity for the Board to meet with all shareholders and their participation
is encouraged. Papers are sent out to shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of the meeting. At the meeting,
in addition to the statutory business, the Board has a policy of holding business presentations to ensure that an up-to-date
picture of the Group’s activities is given, following which the Board is available for questions from shareholders.
In accordance with the Combined Code recommendations, the Company counts all proxy votes. On each resolution which is voted
on a show of hands, the Company indicates the level of proxies lodged, the number of proxy votes for and against such resolution
and the number of abstentions. A separate resolution is proposed for each substantive issue and the Chairs of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nominations and Corporate Governance Committees attend to answer questions.
Corporate social responsibility
The Board is committed to running the Group in accordance with best practice in corporate governance. This commitment
includes recognition by the Group of the importance of taking into account its corporate social responsibilities (CSR) in operating
the business. In this context, the Group seeks to integrate CSR considerations relating particularly to social, ethical and health,
safety and environment (HS&E) issues in its day-to-day operations. The Board acknowledges its duty to ensure the Group
conducts its activities responsibly and with proper regard for all its stakeholders including employees, shareholders, business
partners, suppliers and the local and scientiﬁc communities.
In exercising its corporate social responsibility, the Group seeks to ensure that:
> The Board takes account of the signiﬁcance of social, ethical and HS&E issues.
> Business practices are managed ethically.
> Positive contributions are made to the scientiﬁc and medical communities.

Social
The health, welfare and development of the Group’s employees remain a priority. With the intent of attracting, recruiting, developing
and retaining key employees, the Group maintains a number of policies and procedures for the beneﬁt of its employees. These include
a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a whistle-blowing policy and procedure, an equal opportunities policy and a stress policy.
An employee handbook including these policies is made available to all employees on the Group’s intranet. Employee development
is encouraged through appropriate training. Scientists are encouraged to attend external conferences relevant to their disciplines.
Regular and open communication between management and employees is viewed as essential for motivating a highly educated
workforce. Brieﬁngs held at the Group sites provide updates on Group business and provide an opportunity for questions and
feedback. Review meetings are also held regularly within each department and amongst those involved on each of the Group’s
programmes. An elected staff consultancy group comprising employee representatives from across the Group meets at least
quarterly to discuss and review issues and concerns raised by employees. The Group maintains both an internet website which
is freely accessible and an intranet site accessible to all employees.
Ethical
In conducting its business, the Group has an extensive range of established procedures that enable it formally to manage the risks
associated with the discovery and development of drugs for the therapeutic treatment of serious diseases. The Group operates
within a strict regulatory environment in the pharmaceutical industry and conducts its laboratory research and clinical development
activities in accordance with internationally recognised regulatory standards. The Group manages its resources prudently to ensure
appropriate investment is made in its research and development programmes and its commercialisation activities. Up-to-date security
systems are utilised to protect the Group’s IT systems. The Group’s intellectual property is protected through a robust patenting
programme. Close attention is paid to maintaining relationships with key stakeholders including business collaborators, suppliers
and shareholders. A Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been developed to promote fair, honest and ethical conduct by all
employees in their relationships with other company stakeholders which is available on the Group’s website.
Health, safety and environment
The Group has well-developed health and safety policies and procedures, safeguarding staff, contractors and visitors, and it
complies with current legislation and best practice. Mr Weir (until his resignation) was the executive director responsible
for HS&E. This responsibility has been taken over by Mr Slater.
Health and safety is managed on each site in the UK. The Group’s health and safety policies and procedures are published on the
Group’s intranet and they form a key component in the staff induction programme. Appropriate health and safety training is provided
with quarterly internal safety audits, and annual audits by specialists and governmental agencies. No signiﬁcant issues have been
identiﬁed by these audits. Risk and COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) assessments are regularly reviewed and
updated as necessary.
The Group has in place practices which give regard to protection to the environment, particularly relating to waste management and
utility consumption. Waste is minimised with packaging and containers returned to suppliers where possible. Paper waste is recycled
and conﬁdential paper waste is shredded and recycled. Where possible, the Group recycles wood, metal, plastics and glass. The Group
does not knowingly discharge toxic materials into the environment other than very small amounts via fume cupboard extraction
systems, arising from small-scale synthetic chemistry, and low-level radioactive waste which is discharged into public drainage,
as permitted under the Group’s Certiﬁcate of Authorisation from the Environment Agency.
Going concern
At 31 December 2008, the Group had cash resources (being cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets)
of £17.2m. On 29 April 2009, the Company announced that it is to raise approximately £22.1 million, net of expenses, by way
of a fully underwritten Placing and Open Offer of, in aggregate, 799,112,129 new ordinary shares at 3 pence per ordinary share
conditional, inter alia, upon the passing by shareholders of the resolutions at a General Meeting to be held on 18 May 2009.
After making enquiries and taking into account: (i) management’s estimate of future revenues and expenditure; (ii) management’s
expectation, based on the underwriting undertaking received, that the Company will secure sufﬁcient equity funding in the proposed
Placing and Open Offer: and (iii) management’s expectation that shareholder support for the relevant shareholder resolutions will
be forthcoming at the General Meeting, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate ﬁnancial
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. 28 Management and governance
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
This report covers the year ended 31 December 2008 with comparative ﬁgures provided for the year ended 31 December 2007.
It has been prepared in compliance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Companies Act. In accordance
with the Companies Act, a resolution to approve the remuneration report will be proposed at the Company’s AGM. Details of the
resolution may be found in the Notice of the meeting accompanying this annual report. The vote will be advisory and will be
considered carefully by the members of the Remuneration Committee in the formulation and approval of the Company’s future
remuneration policies.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is made up entirely of independent non-executive directors of the Company
and it met four times in 2008. Dr P R Read is the Chairman of the Committee and sits with Dr A Baxter, Mr I Clark, Ms C Ferguson
and Mr G M Kennedy. The Committee invited the views of the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Operating Ofﬁcer
and Director of Human Resources (who also acts as Secretary to the Committee) at appropriate times and the views of Deloitte
and Touche LLP , who were retained as independent remuneration consultants. Deloitte have not provided any other services to
the Company during the ﬁnancial period.
The philosophy of the Committee is that remuneration programmes should apply to all staff working for the Company. The
Company’s policy on the remuneration of employees, including executive directors, is established by the Committee and approved
by the Board. The overall budget for remuneration of employees and the individual remuneration packages of each executive
director and senior employee is determined by the Committee. No executive director or employee participates in discussions
relating to the setting of their own remuneration.
The objective of the Company’s remuneration policy is to ensure that all employees receive remuneration tailored to their
performance, scale of responsibility, skills and experience. Remuneration packages are intended to enable the Company to attract
and retain key employees by ensuring they are rewarded competitively and that they are incentivised to achieve the highest level
of Company performance in line with the best interests of shareholders. A signiﬁcant proportion of executive remuneration is
performance-related. Performance conditions for performance-related bonus and long-term incentives are designed with a view
to alignment of executive, employee and shareholder interests.
The Company’s policy on remuneration takes account of the pay structure and employment conditions within the Group and
also the industry sector and geographical location. To determine the elements and level of remuneration appropriate to each
employee and executive director, the Committee considers remuneration levels in comparable biotechnology and pharmaceutical
companies, reviews pay and beneﬁts surveys relating to industry sector or professional specialism and considers individual skills,
experience and performance. In 2008 basic pay was increased in line with inﬂation.
The following report is divided into sections giving details of basic pay and beneﬁts, performance-related bonus schemes and
longer-term share option incentive schemes. The ﬁnal sections feature details of the directors’ contracts, tables showing the
remuneration of the directors and their current share and share option holdings. A graph showing Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
over the past ﬁve years is also included.
Basic pay and beneﬁts
During the reporting period, employees and executive directors received performance related base pay increases distributed out
of a 4.0 per cent pool of funds, calculated with reference to the retail price inﬂation reported by the Government at the beginning
of the reporting period.
All employees in the UK are invited to participate in either a Group personal pension plan or an occupational pension scheme.
The only pensionable element of remuneration is annual salary. All schemes are money purchase in nature and have no deﬁned
beneﬁts. During the period, the Group contributed a maximum of 10 per cent of base salary in relation to employees, a maximum
of 1 per cent in relation to senior employees and 19 per cent in relation to executive directors to the schemes. The Group has
no obligation to the pension schemes beyond the payment of contributions. Employees are entitled to private health insurance,
the cover being extended to spouse and dependent children for executive directors.
Performance-related bonus
All employees participate in a performance-related bonus scheme. The level of bonus is based on overall Group performance and,
in the case of executive directors and senior employees, on individual performance measured against criteria established with the
Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the ﬁnancial year. The objectives relate directly to shareholder value, the growth of
the portfolio and operational effectiveness as follows:
Shareholder value
The improvement in shareholder value over the period, taking account of the following measures over the bonus year: market
capitalisation, share price performance (both absolute and relative to the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical & Biotech and FTSE
Small Cap indices, Bloomberg Biotech and NASDAQ Biotechnology (Price Index) Index, investor feedback and analysts ratings.
Remuneration report Management and governance 29
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Growth of the portfolio
The progress of key strategic products, the licensing in or out of compounds, the development of new technologies or the
acquisition of new products through mergers and acquisitions.
Operational effectiveness
Related to the performance of the business, ensuring appropriate ﬁnancial controls, managing stafﬁng levels, whilst ensuring
good corporate governance.
As a further direct link between executive remuneration and the interests of shareholders, the Committee has asked that
a proportion of bonuses paid to executive directors be used to purchase shares in the Company, with the aim of building
and maintaining an eventual personal shareholding of at least one times annual salary.
The maximum bonus level for the Executive Chairman and the Chief Operating Ofﬁcer in 2008 was 80 per cent of base salary,
whilst for the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer the maximum level was 70 per cent For the coming year, the maximum bonus for the newly
appointed Chief Executive Ofﬁcer will be 100 per cent and for the newly appointed Chief Financial Ofﬁcer it will be 70 per cent
Maximum bonus levels for all other staff range between 10 and 40 per cent, based on their role and market requirement.
The Committee decided to award a performance-related cash bonus during the year to key executive directors. This was assessed
at 0% of their maximum bonus potential detailed above, and was in recognition of the achievement of operational targets
including the successful restructuring of the Group, the disposal of the US and Canadian businesses, the sale of Apokyn and
other licensing deals.
Long-term incentives
The Board believes that long-term incentive schemes are important in retaining and recruiting high-calibre individuals and
ensuring that the performance of executives is focused on creating long-term shareholder value whilst allowing the Company’s
cash reserves to be conserved. The Company currently operates two share option schemes and the Vernalis plc Bonus Long-Term
Incentive Plan (“Bonus LTIP”).
Share option schemes
The Company’s two current share option schemes are the Vernalis Share Option Plan (which comprises both an HMRC approved
and an unapproved scheme) and the Vernalis SAYE Plan, under which grants of options may be made. Prior to 31 December 2008
subsisting awards under the British Biotech Executive Share Option Scheme and the British Biotech Deferred Bonus Scheme
remained in place but these schemes will not be open to new awards.
The total number of unissued ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which may be placed under option on any day under
the Vernalis share option schemes and the Bonus LTIP may not exceed, when added to the aggregate number of shares that
have been or may be issued pursuant to rights granted for the past ten years under the Vernalis Share Option Plans, the Vernalis
SAYE Plan, the Bonus LTIP , the British Biotech Executive Share Option Scheme and the British Biotech Deferred Bonus Scheme,
10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company immediately prior to that day.
The performance criteria for awards made under British Biotech Executive Share Option Scheme relate directly to share price
performance using the following comparators: Median FTSE 100 and Upper-quartile FTSE 100. These criteria were chosen as being
in the best interests of shareholders after consideration of the particular circumstances of the Company at the time they were set.
All employees and executive directors of the Company are eligible to participate in the Vernalis Share Option Plans at the
discretion of the Committee. Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years following grant provided that any
performance target set by the Committee has been satisﬁed. The maximum award under the Plan is 200 per cent of base salary
at the time of appointment and 10 per cent of base salary in subsequent years. The current performance condition for options
granted under the Vernalis Share Option Plans is share price growth against the FTSE All Share Pharmaceutical and Biotech index
and the NASDAQ Biotechnology (Price Index) Index (for previous awards, performance was tested against the FTSE Small Cap).
No options will vest if performance is below median; 0 per cent of the shares under option will vest at median and there will
only be full vesting if the Company’s share price performance is in the upper quartile (with options vesting pro rata between
median and upper quartile).
The Vernalis SAYE Plan is a save-as-you-earn share option scheme approved by HMRC which has been offered to UK employees
and executive directors. The current scheme offer was made in November 2007 and vests in January 2011.
Bonus LTIP
A new long-term incentive scheme was approved by shareholders in 2007 and grants were made on 6 June 2007 to all staff
and directors in the UK and North America of options over ordinary shares of  pence each. The award levels were calculated
with reference to the annual performance-related bonus earned by each participant for the year ended 31 December 2006 30 Management and governance
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
(“Share Bonus Award”). For the ﬁrst year, Share Bonus Awards were made at the level of 40 per cent of the participants’
cash bonus achieved. In future years, awards will typically be set at 20 per cent of the bonus awarded. No grants were made
under this scheme in 2008 following the declaration of a nil bonus for 2007. The awards will not normally vest, or become
exercisable, prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant and will normally remain exercisable until the sixth anniversary
of the date of grant (except in the US where they will remain exercisable until the end of the ﬁnancial year in which the grant
vests). All participants also received a Matching Award which will only vest if challenging share price growth targets are
achieved over a three year period. The targets are appended to the share tables below. The maximum Matching Award
is three times the Share Bonus Award made.
In addition, under the Bonus LTIP the Committee may in certain years offer participants the opportunity or require a participant
to sacriﬁce a portion of their annual performance cash bonus up to a maximum of 100 per cent in return for an Investment
Award. The Committee may also make a Matching Award determined by reference to the Investment Award. This feature of the
Plan was not used in 2008.
Chairman’s remuneration
The remuneration of the Company’s Executive Chairman is determined by the Committee, led by the Deputy Chairman and senior
non-executive director, in the absence of the Chairman, after taking into account appropriate professional advice.
The Chairman receives an annual salary, but does not participate in the pension scheme, nor did he receive any other beneﬁts
in the 2008 ﬁnancial year except for the award of a performance related bonus (reported in the remuneration tables below).
In addition under the terms of his contract he is entitled to receive certain ﬁxed bonus payments once the Company’s share price
has reached pre-determined levels, payment being conditional on exercise of a corresponding part of the option referred to below
and such payment being equal to approximately half of the option price payable by the Chairman in respect of such options.
Directors’ service contracts
The Company’s policy in entering into service contracts with executive directors, including the Chairman, is to enable the
recruitment of high-quality executives and to obtain protection from their sudden departure to competitor companies. In addition,
service contracts are an important element in maintaining maximum protection for the Group’s intellectual property rights and
other commercially sensitive information. All service contracts are approved by the Committee and are one-year rolling contracts.
Each service contract may be terminated by mutual agreement or by either party giving 12 months’ notice to the other. However,
if an executive director is guilty of serious misconduct, serious breach (after due warning) or persistent failure to carry out his
duties, then the Company is entitled summarily to terminate his service contract without notice and without paying compensation
in respect of that termination. If an executive director’s service contract is terminated, he would receive a sum equal to
12 months’ pay and beneﬁts.
The service agreements of Dr Fellner and Mr Sturge were made on 21 March 2003 and came into effect on 23 April 2003.
Mr Sturge resigned from the Group and his service agreement was terminated on 29 February 2008. The service agreement
of Mr Weir was made on 24 June 1999 and was terminated on 14 November 2008. The service agreement of Mr Slater came
into effect on 20 October 2004. The service agreement of Mr Garland was made on 13 November 2008 and came into effect
on 29 December 2008.
Non-executive directors’ appointments and remuneration
Non-executive directors are appointed by letter of engagement for periods not exceeding three years. They receive fees for
services as members of the Board and its committees and the Chair of each Board committee is paid an additional fee for
performing that role. Mr Kennedy is also paid additional fees to reﬂect his additional responsibilities as Deputy Chairman
and Senior Independent Director. The level of fees is determined by the Board after taking into account appropriate advice.
Ms Ferguson, Mr Kennedy and Dr Read signed appointment letters dated 17 July 2003, each of which became effective on
1 September 2003. Each of Ms Ferguson, Mr Kennedy and Dr Read had an appointment for a ﬁxed term of three years to
30 August 2006. These contracts have been extended until 29 August 2009. Dr Baxter signed a letter effective 19 May 2004
for a ﬁxed term of three years to 18 May 2007; this was extended on 18 May 2007 to 18 May 2010. Mr Clark’s appointment
letter was effective as of 1 January 2007 for a ﬁxed term of three years to 31 December 2009.
All of these appointments are subject to the directors being re-elected under the provisions in the Company’s Articles of
Association, and in compliance with the Combined Code. Each non-executive director still serving at the end of his/her term
will have his/her appointment reviewed by the Board and a further term of ofﬁce may be agreed. Where a non-executive
director does not serve until the end of his/her term, the policy is to pay the fees due pro-rata to the date of cessation.
The Company has entered into qualifying third-party indemnity arrangements for the beneﬁt of all its directors in a form and
scope which comply with requirements of the Companies Act 198.

Share option schemes
The Company currently operates two share option schemes under which grants of options can be made. These are the Share Option
Plan (which comprises an HMRC approved section and an unapproved section) and the SAYE Plan. In addition, an Option Deed has
been granted in favour of the Chairman, Dr P J Fellner.
a) Share Option Plan
i) Eligibility Employees and executive directors of the Company are eligible to participate in the Share Option Plan at the discretion
of the Remuneration Committee.
ii) Exercise of options Options will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following grant, provided that any
performance target set by the Remuneration Committee has been satisﬁed. Performance conditions are appended to the table
above and apply to all staff and directors.
iii) Award limits The Remuneration Committee has currently limited the number of options granted to a maximum of twice basic
salary for executive directors on appointment or one and a half times basic salary in any subsequent year.
b) SAYE Plan
The SAYE Plan is a save-as-you-earn share option scheme approved by HMRC. The ﬁrst offer under the SAYE Plan was made
to all employees and executive directors on 29 October 2004 and the plan completed on 1 December 2007.
The second offer was made on 16 November 2007 of options over shares at a price of 1 pence each with a contract start date
of 1 January 2008, and an exercise period running from 1 January to 1 July 2011. 34 Management and governance
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
c) Chairman’s Option Deed
An option over 2,670,071 ordinary shares was granted to the Chairman in April 2003. The grant was made under an option deed
made by the Company with the Chairman. The exercise price is 100 pence per share. The option will vest and become exercisable
as follows:
Shares subject to the option vesting % Vernalis share price equal to or greater than
50 100p
25 200p
25 300p
For the option to vest in respect of any of the percentages of shares, the Vernalis target share price must be met (using the closing
price) over 30 consecutive trading days. The option will vest on a change of control of Vernalis to the extent that the Vernalis share
price has reached the target set out above.
Under the terms of his contract, the Chairman is entitled to receive certain ﬁxed bonus payments once the Company’s share price
has reached pre-determined levels, payment being conditional on exercise of a corresponding part of the options granted to him
on 25 April 2003 and such payment being equal to approximately half of the option price payable in respect of such options.
Accordingly, the Chairman is entitled to receive, in each case after the deduction of income tax and employees’ National Insurance
contributions (for which reason the ﬁgures given are approximate), £350,000 once the Vernalis share price has reached £1.00;
£100,000 when the Vernalis share price has reached each of £1.20, £1.40 and £1.60; £350,000 when the Vernalis share price
has reached £2.00; and a ﬁnal £350,000 when the Vernalis share price has reached £3.00. In each case, the share price will
only have reached the requisite value if the market value of an ordinary share has been at or above the required value over
30 consecutive dealing days.
d) Bonus LTIP
i) Eligibility Employees and executive directors of the Company are eligible to participate in the Bonus LTIP at the discretion
of the Remuneration Committee.
ii) Form of Awards and Limits Awards can be made in the following form under the Bonus LTIP:
Share Bonus Award: participants receive a Share Bonus Award which is determined by reference to their annual performance
cash bonus awarded in respect of the previous ﬁnancial year. The maximum Share Bonus Award that can be made is 60 per cent
of participants’ cash bonus earned. It is intended that typically awards will be made at the level of around 20 per cent of bonus
achieved. Awards in the ﬁrst year of the plan were made at 40 per cent of bonus achieved.
Matching Award: the Committee may make a Matching Award determined by reference to the Share Bonus Award. The maximum
Matching Award is 300 per cent of the Share Bonus Award. The vesting of matching awards will be subject to the achievement
of stretching share price growth targets.
Investment Award: the Committee may in certain years offer participants the opportunity or require a participant to sacriﬁce
a portion of their annual performance cash bonus (up to a maximum of 100 per cent thereof) in return for an Investment Award.
The Committee may also make a Matching Award determined by reference to the investment award.
iii) Exercise of options Options will normally be exercisable between three and six years following grant (except in the US where
they will remain exercisable until the end of the ﬁnancial year in which the option vests), provided that any performance target
set by the Remuneration Committee has been satisﬁed. Performance conditions are appended to the directors’ options table
above and apply to all staff and directors.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
in respect of the annual report, the directors’
remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors have
prepared the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company and the Group and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
> state that the ﬁnancial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
> prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue
in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualiﬁcations as necessary.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements and the directors’ remuneration
report comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and, hence, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the management and governance section of this annual report
conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
> the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and loss of the Group; and
> the directors’ report contained on pages 18 to 21 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
By order of the Board
J A D Slater
Company Secretary
29 April 2009 Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
We have audited the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements (the “ﬁnancial statements”) of Vernalis plc for the year ended
31 December 2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the Group and parent company balance sheets, the Group
and parent company cash ﬂow statements, the Group and parent Company statements of changes in shareholders’ equity and the
related notes. These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited
the information in the remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the
Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has
been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and
for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the report of the directors is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. The information given in the report of the
directors includes that speciﬁc information given in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, principal risks and uncertainties
facing the business and business review that is cross referred from the business review section of the report of the directors.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code (2006) speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements.
The other information comprises only the Board of directors, Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the remuneration report, the
Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the business review and ﬁnancial review, principal risks and uncertainties facing
the business and the corporate governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order
to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the remuneration
report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the
remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its loss and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
> the parent company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at
31 December 2008 and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
> the ﬁnancial statements and the part of the remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
> the information given in the report of the directors is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The ﬁnancial statements have
been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of the available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies are set out below.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving
a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the ﬁnancial statements,
are disclosed later in this note.
Going concern
At 31 December 2008, the Group had cash resources (being cash and cash equivalents and held-to-maturity ﬁnancial assets)
of £17.2m. On 29 April 2009 the Group announced that it is to raise approximately £22.1 million, net of expenses, by way of a fully
underwritten Placing and Open Offer of, in aggregate, 799,112,129 new ordinary shares at 3 pence per ordinary share conditional,
inter alia, upon the passing by shareholders of the resolutions at a General Meeting.
After making enquiries and taking into account (i) management’s estimate of future revenues and expenditure, (ii) management’s
expectation, based on the underwriting undertaking received, that the Group will secure sufﬁcient equity funding in the proposed
Placing and Open Offer and (iii) management’s expectation that shareholder support for the relevant shareholder resolutions will
be forthcoming at the General Meeting, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate ﬁnancial
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of Vernalis plc (the “Company”) and all its subsidiary
undertakings (together, the “Group”), made up to 31 December 2008.
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from
the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liablities incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent
of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired,
the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised
losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
the policies adopted by the Group.
Accounting developments
a) Interpretations effective in 2008 but early adopted in 2007
IFRIC 11, “IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions”, provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving
treasury shares or involving group entities (for example, options over a parent’s shares) should be accounted for as equity-
settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the parent and group companies.
This interpretation does not have an impact on the Group's ﬁnancial statements. The company’s accounting policy for share-

b) Interpretations effective in 2008 but not relevant.
The following interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008
but are not relevant to the group’s operations:
IFRIC 12, “Service concession arrangements”;
IFRIC 13, “Customer loyalty programmes”; and
IFRIC 1, “IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁned beneﬁt asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction”.
c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted
by the group.
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
IFRS 8, “Operating segments” (effective from 1 January 2009). IFRS 8 replaces IAS 1, “Segment reporting”. This is not expected
to have any impact on Group disclosures.
IAS 1 (revised), “Presentation of ﬁnancial statements” (effective from 1 January 2009). The Group and Company will apply IAS 1
(revised) from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 2 (amendment), “Share-based payments” (effective from 1 January 2009). It deals with vesting conditions and cancellations.
The Group and Company will apply IFRS 2 (amendment) from 1 January 2009. It is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group or Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 3 (revised), “Business combinations” (effective from 1 July 2009). The revised standard is still subject to endorsement by
the EU. The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some signiﬁcant changes.
The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) prospectively to all business combinations from 1 January 2010, subject to endorsement
by the EU.
IFRS 5 (amendment), “Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations”, (and consequential amendment to IFRS 1,
“First-time adoption”) (effective from 1 July 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU.
The Group will apply the IFRS 5 (amendment) prospectively to all partial disposals of subsidiaries from 1 January 2010, subject
to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 20 (amendment), “Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance” (effective from 1 January 2009).
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
IAS 23 (amendment), “Borrowing costs” (effective from 1 January 2009). The Group and Company will apply the IAS 23 (amendment)
prospectively to the capitalisation of borrowing costs on qualifying assets from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU,
but it is currently not applicable to the Group or Company as there are no qualifying assets.
IAS 27 (revised), “Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements”, (effective from 1 July 2009). The amendment to the standard
is still subject to endorsement by the EU. The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests
to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The Group will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010, subject
to endorsement by the EU, but it is currently not applicable to the Group or Company as there are no non-controlling interests.
IAS 36 (amendment), “Impairment of assets”, (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject
to endorsement by the EU. Where fair value less costs to sell is calculated on the basis of discounted cash ﬂows, disclosures
equivalent to those for value-in-use calculation should be made. The Group and Company will apply the IAS 36 (amendment) and
provide the required disclosure where applicable for impairment tests from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible assets” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment deletes the wording that states that
there is “rarely, if ever” support for use of a method that results in a lower rate of amortisation than the straight-line method.
The amendment will not have an impact on the Group’s operations, as all intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line
method.
IAS 38 (amendment), “Intangible assets”, (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to
endorsement by the EU. A prepayment may only be recognised in the event that payment has been made in advance of obtaining
right of access to goods or receipt of services. The amendment is not currently applicable to the Group or Company.
IAS 39 (amendment), “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment
to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU. The Group and Company will apply the IAS 39 (amendment) from 1 January
2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have an impact on the Group or Company’s income statement. Financial statements 3
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of ﬁnancial statements”, (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is
still subject to endorsement by the EU. The amendment clariﬁes that some rather than all ﬁnancial assets and liabilities classiﬁed
as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39, “Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement” are examples of current
assets and liabilities respectively. The Group and Company will apply the IAS 39 (amendment) from 1 January 2009, subject to
endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have an impact on the Group or Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
IFRIC 16, “Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation” (effective from 1 October 2008). The amendment to the interpretation
is still subject to endorsement by the EU. IFRIC 16 clariﬁes the accounting treatment in respect of net investment hedging. The Group
will apply IFRIC 16 from 1 January 2009. It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group or Company’s ﬁnancial
statements.
d) Interpretations and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Group’s operations
The following interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 or later periods but are not relevant for the Group’s operations:
IFRS 1 (amendment), “First time adoption of IFRS”, and IAS 27, “Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements”, (effective from
1 January 2009). The IFRS 1 amendment will not have an impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial statements which are already prepared
under IFRS.
IAS 16 (amendment), “Property, plant and equipment” (and consequential amendment to IAS 7, “Statement of cash ﬂows”)
(effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment will not have an impact on the Group or Company’s operations because none
of the Group’s companies ordinary activities comprise renting and subsequently selling assets.
IAS 19 (amendment), “Employee beneﬁts”, (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject
to endorsement by the EU. The Group will apply the IAS 19 (amendment) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by
the EU. The amendment will not have an impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial statements as it does not operate a deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme.
IAS 23 (amendment), “Borrowing costs” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to
endorsement by the EU. The Group and Company will apply IAS 23 (amendment) retrospectively from 1 January 2009, subject
to endorsement by the EU, but is currently not applicable to the Group or Company as there are no qualifying assets.
IAS 27 (amendment), “Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment will not
have an impact on the Group or Company’s operations because it is the Group’s policy for an investment in subsidiary to be recorded
at cost in the stand-alone accounts of each entity.
IFRIC 15, “Agreements for construction of real estates” (effective from 1 January 2009). The interpretation clariﬁes whether IAS 18,
“Revenue”, or IAS 11, “Construction contracts”, should be applied to particular transactions. IFRIC 15 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Group or Company’s ﬁnancial statements.
IAS 28 (amendment), “Investments in associates” (and consequential amendments to IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Presentation”,
and IFRS 7, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”) (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still subject to
endorsement by the EU. The Group will apply the IAS 28 (amendment) to impairment tests related to investments in associates and
any related impairment losses from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 28 (amendment), “Investments in associates” (and consequential amendments to IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Presentation”
and IFRS 7, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”) (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment will not have an impact on
the Group’s operations because it is the Group’s policy for an investment in an associate to be equity accounted in the Group’s
consolidated accounts.
IAS 29 (amendment), “Financial reporting in hyperinﬂationary economies” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment
will not have an impact on the Group or Company’s operations, as none of the Group’s subsidiaries or companies operate in
hyperinﬂationary economies.
IAS 31 (amendment), “Interests in joint ventures”, (and consequential amendments to IAS 32 and IFRS 7) (effective from 1 January
2009). The amendment will not have an impact on the Group’s operations as there are no interests held in joint ventures.
IAS 32 (amendment), “Financial instruments: Presentation”, and IAS 1 (amendment), “Presentation of ﬁnancial statements” –
“Puttable ﬁnancial instruments and obligations arising on liquidation” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment to the
standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU. The Group will apply the IAS 32 and IAS 1 (amendment) from 1 January 2009,
subject to endorsement by the EU. It is not expected to have any impact on the Group or Company’s ﬁnancial statements.  Financial statements

IAS 0 (amendment), “Investment property” (and consequential amendments to IAS 16) (effective from 1 January 2009).
The amendment will not have an impact on the Group or Company’s operations, as no investment properties are held by the
Group or Company.
IAS 1 (amendment), “Agriculture” (effective from 1 January 2009). The amendment will not have an impact on the Group
or Company’s operations as no agricultural activities are undertaken.
The minor amendments to IAS 20 “Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance”, and IAS 29,
“Financial reporting in hyperinﬂationary economies”, IAS 0, “Investment property”, and IAS 1, “Agriculture”. These amendments
will not have an impact on the Group or Company’s operations as described above.
There are a number of minor amendments to IFRS 7, “Financial instruments: Disclosures”, IAS 8, “Accounting policies, changes
in accounting estimates and errors”, IAS 10, “Events after the reporting period”, IAS 18, “Revenue”, and IAS 3, “Interim ﬁnancial
reporting”. The amendments to the standards are still subject to endorsement by the EU. These amendments, subject to endorsement
by the EU, are unlikely to have an impact on the Group or Company’s accounts and have, therefore, not been analysed in detail.
Share-based payments
The Group makes equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to its employees and directors. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the
options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options
were granted. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become
exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated income statement, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity. Equity settled share-based payments granted by the Company to employees of subsidiaries are
recognised as an expense charged to the relevant subsidiary with an equal increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings.
Cash settled share-based payments are accrued over the vesting period of the award based on the current expected fair value at
each balance sheet date.
When share options are exercised, the proceeds received net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value)
and share premium.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less provision for amortisation and impairments.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets
(including intangible assets) of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included
in intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at each balance sheet date for impairment and is carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the
entity or investment sold. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses are recognised in general and
administrative expenses in the income statement.
Internally generated intangible assets – product research and development
Development expenditure on new or substantially improved products is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised through
cost of sales over the expected useful life of the product concerned. Capitalisation commences from the point at which the technical
feasibility and commercial viability of the product can be demonstrated and the Group is satisﬁed that it is probable that future
economic beneﬁt will result from the product once completed. This is usually at the point of regulatory ﬁling in a major market where
approval is highly probable. Capitalisation ceases when the product is ready for launch. Where assets are acquired or constructed
in order to provide facilities for research and development over a number of years, they are capitalised and depreciated over their
useful lives. Expenditure relating to clinical trials is accrued on a percentage-of-completion basis with reference to fee estimates
with third parties.
Expenditure on research and development activities which does not meet the above criteria is charged to the income statement
as incurred. Financial statements 5
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
Purchased intangibles
Intangibles are recognised when they have been acquired separately for cash or other monetary assets or as part of a business
combination and are amortised through cost of sales over their estimated useful lives from the time they are available for use.
Impairment of assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life, or which are not yet available for use, are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset’s fair value less cost to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash generating units).
Employee beneﬁts
All employee beneﬁt costs, notably holiday pay and contributions to the Group or personal deﬁned contribution pension plans,
are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis. The Group operates several deﬁned contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The Group does
not offer any other post-retirement beneﬁts.
Investments
The Group classiﬁes its investments in the following categories: loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-
sale ﬁnancial assets. The classiﬁcation depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the
classiﬁcation of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
At each balance sheet date management assesses whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets
is impaired. On disposal or impairment of the investment, gains or losses recorded in equity are recycled through the income statement.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets or liabilities with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market. Assets in this category are recognised at amortised cost and included in trade and other receivables, and loans
in the balance sheet.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturities that the
Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Assets in this category are held at amortised cost.
Held-to-maturity investments include short-term investments with original maturities of more than 90 days.
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as available for sale. Assets in this category
are recognised at fair value with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in equity. Realised gains
and losses are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank deposits repayable on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings including loans are carried at cost less any impairment provision. Such investments are
subject to review, and any impairment is charged to the income statement. 6 Financial statements
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008

1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
Revenue recognition
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, returns, rebates, discounts and other similar allowances, represents the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable for the goods and services supplied. Product sales are recognised on receipt by the customer,
net of a provision for expected sales returns and rebates to be paid in future years. Non-refundable access fees, options fees and
milestone payments receivable for participation by a third party in commercialisation of a compound are recognised when they
become contractually binding provided there are no related commitments of the Group.
Where these receipts are inducements to enter into contracts, they are recognised over the expected life of the contract. Where there
are related commitments, revenue is recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis in line with the actual levels of expenditure incurred in
fulﬁlling these commitments. All other licence income and contract research fees are recognised over the accounting period to which the
relevant services relate. Revenues derived from grants received are recognised in line with the related expenditure. Royalty income
is recognised in relation to sales to which the royalty relates.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development expenditure consists of internal and external research and development expenditure, allocation
of overheads and any impairment of intangible assets.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic cost less depreciation and impairments with the exception of freehold land
which is not depreciated. Historic cost comprises the purchase price together with any incidental costs of acquisition. Depreciation is
calculated to write-off the cost, less residual value, of property plant and equipment in equal annual instalments over their estimated
useful lives as follows:
Leasehold buildings Period of lease
Plant and machinery Two to ﬁve years
Fixtures and ﬁttings Three to ten years
Vehicles Three to four years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in operating loss.
Finance and operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all of the beneﬁts and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if
the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in ﬁxed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments
is shown as obligations under ﬁnance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of both a capital and an interest element.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations under the leasing commitments and the interest element is
charged against proﬁt in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding. Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated
over the shorter of the relevant lease term and the useful economic life of the equivalent owned assets.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identiﬁed at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that the
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects
neither accounting proﬁt not taxable proﬁt and loss. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the
Group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base. Financial statements 7
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
1 Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that
there will be suitable taxable proﬁts, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary
difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where
the timing of reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse
in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability
settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Measurement of
deferred tax liabilities and assets reﬂects the tax consequence expected to fall from the manner in which the asset or liability is
recovered or settled.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the transaction date. Assets and
liabilities in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Differences
arising due to exchange rate ﬂuctuations are taken to the income statement account in the period in which they arise.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill, intangible assets and fair value adjustments arising on
consolidation, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the
dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations, and of related qualifying hedges,
are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
Segmental information
The Group’s primary segmental reporting is by geographical location of assets, with business sector being the secondary format.
This is consistent with reporting to the Board.
Financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments where necessary, to hedge against future material foreign currency exposures.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised and cease to be recognised on the basis of when the related legal title or obligations
pass to or from the Group. Financial assets and liabilities are shown at the lower of cost to the Group and fair value, as determined
by reference to the market value of the asset or liability. Income and expenses arising from ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
are recognised on becoming receivable or payable respectively and are measured at fair value.
Provisions
Provisions for restructuring costs, onerous lease costs and returns and rebates are recognised when the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate
that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the obligations. The increase in the
provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly atributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent signiﬁcant items of income and expense which due to their size, nature or the expected infrequency
of the events giving rise to them, are presented separately on the face of the income statement to give a better understanding to
shareholders of the elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better
assess trends in ﬁnancial performance. Exceptional items include, but are not limited to, impairments of goodwill and intangible
assets, restructuring costs and provisions for vacant leases. 8 Financial statements

Critical accounting policies and estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by deﬁnition, seldom
equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below.
a) Intangible assets
The Group has signiﬁcant intangible assets arising as a result of acquisitions of businesses and purchases of assets such as
product development and marketing rights. Under IFRS, intangible assets that are in use are amortised over their estimated useful
life and charged to cost of sales in the income statement and are only tested for impairment when there is an indication of the
balance sheet carrying value not being recoverable. Intangible assets that are not yet in use are not amortised, but are tested
annually for impairment. The impairment analysis is principally based upon estimated discounted future cash ﬂows. Impairment
of intangible assets not yet in use is charged to research and development expenditure. Actual outcomes could vary signiﬁcantly
from such estimates of discounted future cash ﬂows, due to the highly sensitive assumptions used, such as:
> Outcome of research and development activities (compound efﬁcacy, results of clinical trials, etc.).
> Probability of obtaining regulatory approval.
> Long-term sales forecast period of up to 20 years.
> Selling price erosion rates after the end of patent protection due to generic competition.
> Behaviour of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives etc.).
> The availability of sufﬁcient funding to develop the programme in-house.
The determination of these underlying assumptions relating to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective and requires
the exercise of considerable judgement. Any changes in key assumptions about our business and prospects, or changes in market
conditions, could result in an impairment change.
b) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when title and risk of loss is passed to the customer and reliable estimates can be made of relevant
deductions. Gross revenue on product sales is reduced by rebates, returns, discounts and similar allowances. Provisions for such
deductions are made at the time of sale, based on estimates made from historical trends. Given these amounts are estimates
they might not reﬂect the ﬁnal outcome. A further factor that affects product sales in the US is the wholesaler buying activity.
Wholesalers may choose to increase or decrease orders and inventory levels ahead of an anticipated price rise, or for any other
reason. The result of this is sales may be moved from one period to another. The Group constantly monitors wholesaler inventory
levels and has seen no evidence of any buying patterns outside of the expected activity of business.
c) Deferred revenue
Under IFRS, income received from upfront licence receipts is recognised over the expected life of the contract.
For marketed products this is estimated by taking into account the life of patents, and length of Orphan Drug Status, as well as the
expected level of generic competition. For a product still being developed this is based on the risk adjusted expected length of the
contract based on its current stage in development. All of these assumptions are subjective in nature and reviewed whenever there
is a change in circumstances related to a particular contract.
d) Provisions
The Group calculates its onerous lease provisions by estimating the expected level of occupancy for leases based on a number
of factors including current market conditions and our understanding of the intentions of a tenant. At any point in time an event
may occur which may cause a change to these highly sensitive assumptions.
e) Assets held for sale
On 29 November 2007 the Vernalis Board approved the decision to divest Apokyn®and the US Commercial Operations. Under IFRS 5
“Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”, when the management consider it to be highly probable that a sale
will be made, this business is presented as a discontinued operation, and the assets and liabilities classiﬁed as held for sale.
The Group wrote down the assets held for sale to estimated fair value of sales proceeds less costs to sell.
Company income statement
In accordance with the provisions of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate income statement has been presented
for the Company. The results for the Company are also prepared under IFRS. Financial statements 9

3 Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent signiﬁcant items of income and expense, which, due to their nature or the expected infrequency
of the events giving rise to them, are presented separately on the face of the income statement to give a better understanding
to shareholders of the elements of ﬁnancial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to
better assess trends in ﬁnancial performance. Exceptional items include, but are not limited to, the settlement of the Endo loan,
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring costs and the provision for vacant leases.

6 Income tax credit continued
No liability to UK corporation tax arose during the year. The Group had losses, as computed for taxation purposes, of approximately
£6 million at 31 December 2008 (31 December 2007: £68 million) available to be carried forward to future periods.
In accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act 2000 in respect of research and development allowances, the Group is entitled
to claim tax credits for certain research and development expenditure. The amount included in the ﬁnancial statements in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2008 of £1,500,000 (31 December 2007: £2,127,000) represents the tax credit receivable by the
Group in the UK. In addition, £16,000 represents the additional tax credit receivable by the Group in the UK in relation to prior years
and £223,000 relates to additional foreign tax in relation to prior years.
7 Proﬁt/(loss) per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion for
all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
For diluted loss per share, all potential ordinary shares including options and deferred shares are antidilutive.

8 Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
On 1 July 2008, the Group announced that it had completed the sale of Apokyn®and Vernalis Pharmaceuticals Inc, its US
Commercial Operations, to Ipsen SA for an initial consideration of US$6.5 million with up to a further US$6 million of milestones
payable. Ipsen SA also subscribed for US$5 million of Vernalis PLC shares at a 20 per cent premium.
Since the sale completed the Group has received US$1 million of the additional milestones. There is uncertainty over the receipt
of the other milestones and therefore they have not been recognised at this time.
The sales and marketing operations form a separate major line of business and geographical area of operations. The operations
were held for sale at the end of 2007 and therefore were classiﬁed as discontinued operations.

Accelerated amortisation on sale of future royalties
Following the Group’s early settlement of the amount due to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc (Endo) under the loan agreement
between the two companies, the Group agreed to forego future royalties on US sales of Frova®until annual US net sales exceed
a threshold of US$85 million per annum. Due to the sale of future Frova®revenues an accelerated amortisation of £13.6 million
has been recorded.
In accordance with IAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”, goodwill and other intangible assets that are created
in relation to the acquisition of a foreign subsidiary are maintained in the functional currency of that subsidiary. During the year,
the Group had a net exchange gain of £1.8 million on assets not yet in use relating to the acquisition of Cita.
Impairment
The Group has been actively pursuing an out-licensing strategy for V1512 during 2008 and in parallel exploring options to advance
the clinical development of the programme. Despite a signiﬁcant effort and a broad level of interest in this late stage programme
it has not yet been partnered. We continue to pursue out-licensing of V1512 and have investigated a faster and lower cost path to
US registration under the 505(b)(2) ﬁling process. The potential economic interest to the Group in this programme is substantially
lower than previously expected with royalty and milestone obligations payable to third parties. Taking these factors into account,
we concluded that the carrying value of V1512 was impaired and a charge of £9.3 million has been recorded. We have also released
the deferred consideration payable on this programme of £10.3 million due to the uncertainty over its clinical development path.
Impairment reviews
Goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are subject to impairment review at least annually. Intangible assets
in use are amortised over their expected useful lives and are reviewed when there is an indication that an impairment may have
occurred. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the asset exceeds the higher of its value in use to the Group or its anticipated
fair value less cost of sale, an impairment loss for the difference is recognised.
The impairment analysis is principally based upon estimated discounted future cash ﬂows. Actual outcomes could vary signiﬁcantly
from such estimates of discounted future cash ﬂows. In particular, the discounted future cash ﬂows for intangible assets under
development involves highly sensitive assumptions speciﬁc to the nature of the Group’s activities such as:
> Outcome of research and development activities (compound efﬁcacy, results of clinical trials, etc.).
> Probability of obtaining regulatory approval.
> Long-term sales forecast period of up to 20 years.
> Selling price erosion rates after the end of patent protection due to generic competition.
> Behaviour of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives etc.).
> The availability of sufﬁcient funding to develop the programme in-house.
Value in use calculations are generally utilised to calculate recoverable amounts. Value in use is calculated as the net present value
of the projected risk-adjusted, pre-tax cash ﬂows of the cash-generating unit (being the related products) relating to the intangible
asset, and applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital of approximately 12 per cent. This
approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash ﬂows. The cash ﬂows projected are over the expected useful lives
of the products which extend over the period of the licences or patents.
The determination of these underlying assumptions relating to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective and requires
the exercise of considerable judgement. Any changes in key assumptions about our business and prospects, or changes in
market conditions, could result in an impairment change.
None of the Group’s intangible assets at either 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007 were internally generated.

Paul Capital funding liabilities
The Group entered into a transaction with Paul Capital on 21 April 2008. Under the terms of the transaction Paul Capital provided
€18. million which will be repaid out of the potential future revenue stream under the licence agreement with Menarini to market
Frovatriptan in Europe.
Whilst the contractual arrangements with Paul Capital are royalty agreements under which royalties are payable on revenues earned
and payments received, the proceeds received from Paul Capital meet the deﬁnition of a ﬁnancial liability under IAS 39 “Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” and are treated as ﬁnancial liabilities accordingly. Royalties paid to Paul Capital are
treated as repayments of the liabilities and notional interest is charged on the liability using the effective interest rate at inception
of the agreement. The effective interest rate is 2.5 per cent. Any change in the estimated future payments to Paul Capital is
recognised as income or expense in the income statement. The future amount payable to Paul Capital is secured on the intangible
assets relating to Frova®.
The Group is committed to ensuring that Paul Capital Healthcare receives minimum payments in respect of years 2008-2010
calculated based upon delivery to Menarini of speciﬁed quantities of frovatriptan for such years.
Under the terms of the agreement Paul Capital Healthcare have the right (but not the obligation) to exercise an early repayment
option should certain adverse events occur. The Group would then be required to pay to Paul Capital Healthcare the loan amount
of €18. million plus an additional amount as speciﬁed in the ﬁnancing agreement.
US dollar secured loan
On the 20 February 2008 the Group announced that it had agreed to the early settlement of the amount due to Endo
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) under the loan agreement between the two companies. To give effect to this early settlement the
Group paid Endo US$7 million in cash and agreed to forego future royalties on US sales of Frova®until annual US net sales
exceed a threshold of US$85 million per annum. The outstanding balance on the loan together with the accrued interest,
which was originally due for repayment in August 2009, was US$56 million.

The Company did not have any borrowings at either 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007. 6 Financial statements

The royalty payment to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) relates to the fair value of payments conditionally due under the agreement of
December 2000 to buy out royalties due to GSK on sales of Frova® . The Group is committed to making one further payment
of US$5.0 million, the ﬁrst having been made in September 2002. The ﬁfth payment of US$5.0 million is due 90 days after the
end of the ﬁnancial year in which cumulative global sales exceed US$300 million. This threshold was met during 2008 and therefore
the liability has been recorded as current. During 2008, an exchange loss of £965,000 (2007: gain of £2,000) and an implicit
interest charge of £2,000 (2007: £23,000) have been recognised in the income statement.
The Group has been actively pursuing an out-licensing strategy for V1512 during 2008 and in parallel exploring options to advance
the clinical development of the programme. Despite a signiﬁcant effort and a broad level of interest in this late stage programme
it has not yet been partnered. We continue to pursue out-licensing of V1512 and have investigated a faster and lower cost path to
US registration under the 505(b)(2) ﬁling process. The potential economic interest to the Group in this programme is substantially
lower than previously expected with royalty and milestone obligations payable to third parties. Taking these factors into account,
we concluded that the carrying value of V1512 was impaired and a charge of £9.3 million has been recorded. We have also released
the deferred consideration payable on this programme of £10.3 million due to the uncertainty over its clinical development path.
Amounts due to subsidiary undertakings are unsecured, interest free and are repayable following the repayment of amounts due
from subsidiary undertakings.
19 Deferred income
At 31 December 2008 the Group had a total deferred income balance of £1.8 million (2007: £23.5 million) of which £1.0 million
(2007: £. million) was current and £0.8 million (2007: £19.1 million) was non-current.
Of the 2007 balance, £21.0 million related to the initial US$60 million payable from Endo in relation to the out licence of the
North American rights to Frova® . As a consequence of the early settlement of the loan due to Endo in February 2008, the
remaining £20.m was released from deferred income and recognised in revenue.
The remaining balance of deferred income relates to the up-front payments received from Biogen Idec of US$10.0 million and
Novartis of US$1.5 million in connection with the collaboration agreements entered into during 200 and €1.5m received from
Servier in connection with the collaboration agreements entered into during 2007. These are being recognised over the expected
useful lives of the respective agreements.

Onerous lease provision
Where leasehold properties become vacant the Group provides for all costs, net of anticipated income, to the end of the lease or the
anticipated date of the disposal or sublease. This provision relates to properties in Winnersh, Oxford and Cambridge and is expected
to be utilised over the life of the related leases to 2012, 2015 and 2023 respectively and has been discounted to fair value at the
balance sheet date.
The charge in the onerous lease provision in the year to 31 December 2008 is due to a portion of the Winnersh property becoming
vacant as a result of the restructuring and a change to the discount rate.
Included in the onerous lease provision is a dilapidation provision which principally relates to costs associated with the Group’s
obligation to reinstate leased buildings to their original state. The provision is expected to be utilised on vacation of the relevant
properties by 2012, 2015 and 2023 and has been discounted to fair value at the balance sheet date.
The future minimum payments receivable from tenants occupying Group properties which are subject to an onerous lease are:

Returns and rebates provision
On acquiring the North American Frova®rights from Elan, the Group took on an obligation for certain product returns, estimated
at £1.9 million.
In addition the Group is responsible for product returns, rebates and chargebacks from the date it re-acquired the rights from Elan
through to the date of the out licence to Endo. There are no further obligations to the Group in respect of these for sales made after
the Group out-licensed the rights of Frova®to Endo. The opening provision was utilised and released in the year and no further
liability exists.

Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment or being a good leaver. Options were valued using the “Monte Carlo”
model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation for options granted since 6 January 2003
are set out respectively in the tables below. The Company’s effective date for IFRS 2, “Share-based Payments”, implementation
is 1 January 2005 and the IFRS has been applied to all share options granted after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested

Notes to assumptions:
a) i) Five per cent of participants exercise per annum in years one to ten, providing that the options are “in the money”
(irrespective of the level of gain) to allow for good leavers in the ﬁrst three years and all other leavers in subsequent years.
The performance test must have been satisﬁed. If the test has not been satisﬁed at the date of leaving the awards lapse.
ii) Forty per cent of participants exercise after three years if a gain of 30 per cent is available. If this gain is not available these
individuals refrain from exercising until such a gain can be made.
iii) Twenty-ﬁve per cent of the remainder exercise in years four, ﬁve and six and so on using a reducing balance methodology
providing that a gain of 20 per cent is available. As with the initial 0 per cent of individuals, if the required gain is not
possible, these individuals refrain from exercising until such a gain can be made.
iv) Any remaining options are exercised at maturity providing they are “in the money”. Any awards that are “underwater” therefore
lapse at maturity. 70 Financial statements
Vernalis plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
23 Share-based payments continued
The above exercise strategy is subject to the passing of the performance condition. If 100 per cent of the award fails to vest
at year three, then these individuals hold until year four before exercising or the awards lapse at year four.
b) All options that have vested are exercised after three years
c) The dividend yield of nil per cent in all cases reﬂects the absence of dividends and of a clear dividend policy statement at the
relevant dates of grant.
d) Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to ﬂuctuate during a period. A standard
approach to calculating volatility has been used based on a calculation of the standard deviation of the natural logarithm
of share price movements.
e) UK Gilt rates prevalent on the grant date and commensurate with the term of each award (six years for the share option plan
and deed and three years for the SAYE).
f) The share price performance indicators attached to the option deed and share option plan are market conditions dependent
on the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares. Those attached to the SAYE Plan are not.

The merger reserve arises as a difference on consolidation under merger accounting principles and is solely in respect of the merger
of the Company and Vernalis Group plc in a prior period. The reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of shares
issued by the Company in consideration for Vernalis Group plc shares and the nominal value and share premium of Vernalis Group
plc shares at the date of the merger.
The other reserve arises as a result of the application of merger relief taken in respect of the issue of shares on the acquisition of
subsidiaries of the Group, including RiboTargets, Cerebrus Pharmaceuticals, Vanguard Medica and British Biotech Pharmaceuticals.
The revaluation reserve represents unrealised gains and losses arising from the revaluation to fair value of available-for-sale
ﬁnancial assets.
The options reserve arises from the valuation of outstanding employee share-based payments to their fair value.
The translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations.
25 Shareholders’ equity
The share premium account is a non-distributable reserve. The deferred shares carry no voting rights and no rights to participate
in the proﬁts of the Company. On a return of capital in a winding up or dissolution (but not otherwise) the holders are entitled to
a distribution in excess of assets distributed above £1,000,000,000,000. Further details of the rights of the deferred shares are
given in note 22.
The loss attributable to shareholders which is dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £19,672,000 (2007: £151,806,000).
In accordance with section 230() of the Companies Act 1985 there is no requirement to publish a proﬁt and loss account for
the Company. 72 Financial statements

30 Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
Monitoring of ﬁnancial risk is part of the Board’s ongoing risk management, the effectiveness of which is reviewed annually.
The Group’s agreed policies are implemented by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, who submits reports at each Board meeting.
Other than short-term currency options, the Group does not use ﬁnancial derivatives, and it is the Group’s policy not to undertake
any trading in ﬁnancial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Board
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained
unchanged throughout the period under review, and since the year end.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposures arise from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Group’s
functional currency, which include product sales receipts in relation to Apokyn® , royalty and product sale receipts in euros from
Menarini, the Group’s European licensee for frovatriptan, FTE funding in euros and payments in foreign currencies to various clinical
research organisations in respect of ongoing trials.
In addition, the Group has currency exposures to balances in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency. In particular,
the Group had a loan for US$50.0 million at the start of the year. This was settled in February 2008 and a loan for €18. million
was arranged with Paul Capital. Included within other liabilities is US$5.0 million due to GSK. In addition during the year the Group
has ﬁnanced the activities of its North American subsidiaries in their local currencies. The Group considers selectively hedging
against speciﬁc signiﬁcant currency exposures where the dates of future payments or receipts in foreign currency are known.
There were no hedging transactions in place at 31 December 2008 or 31 December 2007.
The following table summarises the impact on revenues and post-tax proﬁt from continuing operations if, the euro
and US dollar had weakened/strengthened by 5 per cent against the UK pound with all other variables held constant.

The table below summarises the impact on net assets relating to continuing operations if, the euro, US dollar and Canadian Dollar
had weakened/strengthened by 5 per cent against the UK pound with all other variables held constant. The euro and US Dollar
movements principally relate to ﬁnancial assets and liabilities that will be settled at a future date. The Canadian Dollar movement
principally relates to the net book value of intangible assets. Financial statements 75

Price risk
The Group is not exposed to debt market price risk at the year end because the investments held and classiﬁed on the consolidated
balance sheet as available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets at the end of 2008 and 2007 are not material.
Cash ﬂow and liquidity risk
The Group is a research and development based pharmaceutical company which is not yet a sustainable business.
It expects to incur further losses as current planned expenditure exceeds its anticipated receipts. The Groups’ existing cash
balances are unlikely to be sufﬁcient to fund its future net losses and the Group is likely to require additional ﬁnance (including
equity ﬁnance) at some point in the future.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
Where market values are not available, fair values of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash ﬂows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates. The fair value of short-term
borrowings approximate to book value.
The table below analyses the Group’s ﬁnancial liabilities and net-settled derivative ﬁnancial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings
based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the
contractual undiscounted total cash ﬂows, ie including ﬁnancing costs.

Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through reserves of cash and liquid resources. The funds are held in sterling, euro and US dollar
managed funds and sterling treasury deposits. The funds are actively managed by reputable independent fund managers to provide
the highest rate of return with a neutral risk proﬁle.

The fair value of short term deposits with a maturity of one year or less is assumed to be the book value.
Credit risk

companies such that, if one or more of them is affected by ﬁnancial difﬁculty, it could materially and adversely affect the Group’s
ﬁnancial results. Financial statements 77

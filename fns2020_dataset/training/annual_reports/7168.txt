people
I	am	proud	to	report	that	this	year	we	have	recruited	a	significant	
number	of	new	professionals	into	the	business,	across	a	variety	of	roles,	
and	we	continue	to	invest	going	forward.	This	is	an	exciting	time	in	the	
Group’s	development	and	I	am	confident	that	the	high	level	of	
professionalism	and	enterprise	within	each	business,	together	with	the	
long-term	opportunities	that	we	offer,	will	provide	each	individual	with	 
a	strong	environment	within	which	to	develop	and	build	their	careers.	
I	would	also	like	to	thank	all	of	our	people	for	their	hard	work	and	
commitment	through	the	year.	Since	joining	hays	I	have	spent	
considerable	time	getting	to	know	many	people	from	around	the	
business.	I	have	been	impressed	by	the	ingenuity,	enterprise,	
commitment	and	effort	shown	by	all	our	staff.	
c orporate responsibility
Our	approach	to	corporate	responsibility	covers	a	broad	range	of	
philosophies,	activities	and	standards.	Again	this	year	we	have,	as	an	
organisation, undertaken numerous events to raise money for charity. 
For	example,	a	group	of	13	hays	employees	climbed	Kilimanjaro	in	April,	
contributing	to	the	£250,000	raised	in	support	of	our	nominated	UK	
charity,	Action	for	Children.	Our	Asia	Pacific	division	organised	a	
fundraising	day	for	the	Queensland	Flood	Appeal,	raising	a	total	of	
£40,000	for	the	cause.	These	represent	just	two	of	many	events	which	
took	place	during	the	year,	but	which	characterise	and	pay	testament	 
to	the	generosity	and	spirit	that	exists	within	the	organisation.
summary
The	Group	has	made	significant	progress	in	2011	and	has	balanced	the	
need	to	rebuild	profitability	with	the	investment	necessary	to	build	a	
business	with	excellent	long-term	prospects.	however,	professional	
recruitment is a cyclical industry, which is highly sensitive to underlying 
macroeconomic	conditions	and	levels	of	business	and	consumer	
confidence.	This	was	clearly	demonstrated	in	2009	and	2010	by	the	
impact	that	the	global	recession	had	on	our	business.	Whilst	trading	
continues	to	be	positive	across	most	of	the	countries	in	which	operate,	
we remain alert to the economic and political uncertainties currently 
facing	many	of	the	world’s	major	nations,	and	to	any	adverse	impact	
this	may	have	on	our	business	going	forward.
a lan t homson 
Chairman
2011	has	been	a	year	of	recovery	and	
strong positive organic growth for the 
Group,	following	two	years	in	which	
difficult	economic	conditions	adversely	
impacted our performance.
Group	net	fees	increased	by	18%
(1)
 as we capitalised on improving 
market	conditions	across	most	of	our	operations.	We	have	also	focused	
on	rebuilding	the	Group’s	profitability	and	I	am	pleased	to	report	that	in	
2011	we	delivered	operating	profit	growth	of	33%
(1)(2)
, earnings per share 
growth	of	60%
(2)
	and	a	good	cash	flow	performance.	We	have,	
however,	continued	to	carefully	balance	rebuilding	the	Group’s	
profitability	with	making	the	investment	necessary	to	ensure	we	
capture the long-term opportunities for growth. 
Since	joining	hays	as	Chairman	in	November	2010	I	have	been	greatly	
impressed	by	the	management	team’s	unwavering	commitment	to	
building	a	business	capable	of	delivering	long-term	growth	and	
rewarding	shareholders	appropriately.	We	have	an	excellent	track	record	
and	have	now	built	a	broad	platform	across	31	countries	from	which	 
we	intend	to	capitalise	on	the	excellent	structural	growth	opportunities	
across	our	markets.	We	have	also	undertaken	substantial	investment	in	
our technology systems, people training and development programme, 
and	brand	identity.	These	investments	lay	the	foundations	necessary	to	
support long-term growth.
dividend
The	Board’s	current	priorities	for	our	free	cash	flow	are	to	fund	Group	
development,	maintain	the	strength	of	the	balance	sheet	and	support	 
a	sustainable	dividend	policy.	After	taking	account	of	the	improvement	
in	trading	during	the	financial	year,	the	Board’s	current	view	on	trading	
and	the	strength	of	the	Group’s	balance	sheet,	the	Board	proposes	to	
maintain	the	final	dividend	at	last	year’s	level	of	3.95	pence	per	share,	
giving	an	unchanged	full	year	dividend	of	5.80	pence	per	share.
governance
Bob	Lawson	retired	as	Chairman	earlier	this	year	after	12	years	on	the	
Board,	including	nine	as	Chairman.	During	this	time	he	oversaw	the	
restructuring	of	the	Group	and	its	emergence	as	a	focused	and	leading	
professional	recruitment	company.	his	wise	counsel	and	determination	
to	drive	the	Group	forward	will	be	a	hard	act	to	follow.
As	announced	in	May,	Lesley	Knox	will	step	down	from	the	Board	
following	the	2011	Annual	General	Meeting	in	November.	Lesley	has	been	
a tower of strength on the Board for the past nine years, latterly as 
Chairman	of	the	Remuneration	Committee	and	Senior	Independent	
Director.	h er	incisive	insight	and	contribution	to	strategic	and	operational	
debate	has	been	crucial	to	the	repositioning	of	the	Group.

building a stronger, 
broader based and 
more efficient business
alistair c ox Chief e xe Cutive
Our	businesses	in	Brisbane,	Christchurch	and	T okyo	each	faced	natural	
disasters of unprecedented scale during the second half of the year. The 
disruption created in each location was severe and we all witnessed the 
heart-rending	scenes	of	destruction	and	loss.	It	is	a	testament	to	the	
spirit	and	commitment	of	all	our	people	in	each	of	these	businesses	 
who	overcame	these	harshest	of	challenges	and	quickly	re-established	
operations.	I	thank	each	and	every	one	of	them	for	their	outstanding	
efforts	and	they	are	a	credit	to	our	company.
strategic progress in 2011
As	well	as	delivering	strong	financial	results	in	the	short	term,	we	also	
have	a	clearly	laid	out	ambition	to	build	the	pre-eminent	global	business	
in	professional	recruitment.	Last	year	I	set	out	our	key	priorities	for	the	
year	towards	achieving	this	goal	and	I	am	pleased	to	say	that	we	have	
made significant progress in each area.
International	growth	and	diversification
T en	years	ago	just	14%	of	our	net	fees	were	generated	outside	the	 
UK.	T oday	67%	of	our	net	fees	come	from	our	International	divisions	
and	I	expect	this	trend	to	continue	after	another	excellent	year	of	
international growth.
Ours	is	an	industry	characterised	by	a	very	small	number	of	relatively	
mature	markets	around	the	world	and	a	very	large	number	of	immature	
markets where the concept of using agencies to help source 
professional	and	skilled	people	to	fill	key	roles	in	business	is	new.	In	
these immature markets, clients tend to undertake their professional 
recruitment	in-house.	Our	challenge	and	opportunity	is	to	demonstrate	
to	these	new	markets	the	value	we	can	bring	as	a	result	of	our	deep	
expertise	and	understanding	of	the	talent	marketplace	they	need	to	
access, whether that is for local resources or looking further afield for 
resources	from	the	global	market.	
Over	the	years	we	have	developed	our	approach	so	that	we	can	now	
very	quickly	establish	and	then	grow	new	businesses	in	new	markets	 
at	very	little	risk.	We	are	at	the	vanguard	of	our	industry	in	terms	of	
opening	up	these	opportunities:	building	scale	in	existing	operations,	
expanding	city	networks	in	existing	countries	and	opening	up	new	
countries. The results this year speak for themselves, having opened 
offices	in	12	new	cities	around	the	world,	launched	operations	in	Mexico	
and	the	United	States	and	increased	our	international	consultant	base	
by	27%	to	around	2,800	consultants.	Consequently,	we	are	currently	
well	on	track	to	deliver	on	our	ambition	set	out	in	April	2010	to	double	
our international consultant headcount over a five-year period.
We	have	continued	to	invest	rapidly	
across	the	growth	areas	of	the	business,	
while keeping firm control on costs and 
raising the productivity of our consultant 
base	worldwide.
r eview of performance in 2011 
We	delivered	a	strong	set	of	results	in	2011,	despite	the	challenges	of	the	
markets	and	the	economic	uncertainties	that	we	have	faced.	Our	focus	
has	been	to	react	quickly	to	those	challenges	and	to	capitalise	on	every	
opportunity	that	came	our	way.	By	doing	so,	we	grew	our	Group	net	
fees	by	18%
(1)
	and	I	see	that	as	a	very	encouraging	start	to	our	recovery	
since	the	depths	of	the	economic	downturn.	What	is	also	reassuring	 
is	how	widespread	this	recovery	has	been	around	the	world.	T wenty-
two	countries	grew	their	net	fees	by	over	20%
(1)
, with 12 of those 
countries	recording	over	40%
(1)
 net fee growth. The investments we 
have	made	over	the	last	few	years	to	expand	our	footprint	globally	 
is	very	clearly	paying	off	when	we	see	that	level	of	growth	rate,	all	 
of it delivered organically.
We	have	successfully	turned	our	fee	growth	into	profit	growth	too,	 
with	Group	operating	profit	increasing	by	33%
(1)(2)
.	We	have	achieved	
this	by	carefully	balancing	our	investment	across	the	business,	keeping	
firm	control	on	costs	and	raising	the	productivity	of	our	consultant	base	
worldwide.	At	the	same	time	we	have	further	grown	our	network,	
building	ever	greater	scale	in	existing	locations,	as	well	as	expanding	
into new cities and countries.
With	a	business	as	diverse	as	ours,	and	with	the	world	economies	at	 
this	early	stage	of	recovery,	it	is	to	be	expected	that	our	performance	
around	the	world	shows	some	variation.	We	saw	this	impact	this	year,	
with	the	International	business	growing	net	fees	by	31%
(1)
	–	an	excellent	
result	–	but	the	UK	remaining	broadly	flat	as	the	UK	Government’s	
austerity	drive	severely	impacted	recruitment	in	the	public	sector.	
Consequently	our	net	fees	in	the	UK	public	sector	fell	by	35%	and	the	
public	sector	now	represents	just	22%	of	the	UK’s	net	fees.	h owever,	
over	three-quarters	of	our	UK	business	is	now	in	the	private	sector	 
and	here	we	delivered	strong	net	fee	growth	of	19%	in	a	market	still	
characterised	by	fragile	client	and	candidate	confidence.	Clearly,	
however,	we	are	not	happy	with	the	overall	UK	operating	profit	of	£3.6	
million
(2)
.	We	have	already	taken	further	action	to	reduce	our	cost	base	
in line with market activity and are very focused on raising productivity 
in	a	market	that	remains	difficult	but	not	without	opportunity.

Driving	productivity	and	operational	effectiveness
Our	business	is	all	about	our	expert	consultants	helping	other	
professionals	find	the	next	role	in	their	career	or	the	resources	they	
need	for	their	own	business.	It	is	the	ultimate	people	business.	however,	
it	is	also	a	business	that	can	use	technology	to	great	effect	to	enhance	
customer	service	and	make	us	more	efficient	in	what	we	do.	We	have	
invested	in	our	core	technology	platforms	and,	having	substantially	
completed	our	systems	programmes,	we	are	now	focused	on	exploiting	
our technology to deliver returns on our investment. The power of our 
database	allows	our	consultants	to	very	quickly	identify	the	best	people	
for	our	clients’	vacancies	and	thereby	raise	their	productivity.	Our	new	
internet	and	mobile	platforms	provide	effective	channels	to	market,	
communicate	and	transact	with	our	clients	and	candidates.	Our	UK	
back-office	automation	programme	streamlines	and	automates	areas	
such	as	timesheets,	payment	and	billing	processes,	thereby	speeding	
up	our	administration,	reducing	costs,	delivering	better	service	to	our	
customers	and	above	all,	providing	us	for	the	first	time	with	a	fully	
scalable	system	that	can	handle	significantly	higher	volumes	of	work	
without significantly increasing costs.
Elsewhere,	we	have	continually	managed	our	cost	base	to	align	with	local	
market	demand.	In	most	of	our	International	operations	this	has	resulted	
in	investment	in	terms	of	increased	headcount	and	office	network	
capacity.	In	the	UK,	where	the	markets	have	been	more	challenging,	we	
have	further	reduced	costs,	trimming	our	employee	numbers,	closing	 
23	smaller	offices	over	the	year	and	restructuring	the	non-fee-earning	
team.	These	changes	were	completed	before	the	end	of	the	year	as	we	
saw	confidence	in	the	UK	market	soften	and	are	expected	to	yield	
around	£7	million	of	cost	savings	per	year	going	forward.
Attract,	develop	and	retain	the	best	people	in	the	industry
T o	be	the	best	in	our	industry,	we	need	to	bring	in	the	best	new	recruits	
locally,	deliver	to	them	the	very	best	training	available	and	give	them	
career opportunities second to none. Demand for our services can grow 
very	quickly	so	our	ability	to	find	and	induct	successful	new	consultants	
is a key aspect of our success. T o achieve this, we have invested in our 
consultant	attraction	programmes	and	this	has	been	instrumental	in	
successfully	increasing	our	International	consultant	headcount	by	nearly	
600	people	over	the	year	to	fuel	our	growth.	Our	employees	now	span	
69	different	nationalities	demonstrating	how	international	our	business	
truly is.
We	have	also	significantly	raised	our	investment	in	consultant	and	
management	training	and	development	programmes.	Our	‘hays	
Academies’	standardise	the	training	we	deliver	around	the	world	 
and	are	aimed	at	providing	the	Gold	Standard	of	consultant	training	
anywhere	in	our	industry.	Similarly,	we	have	introduced	advanced	
management	and	leadership	programmes	in	conjunction	with	some	 
of	the	world’s	leading	business	schools,	designed	to	equip	our	 
global	leaders	with	the	skills	to	run	ever	larger	and	more	complex	
businesses.	Over	150	of	our	senior	team	are	currently	going	through	
these programmes.
T raining and development is a fundamental part  
of	our	culture;	it	embeds	the	‘hays	DNA ’	in	every	
team	and	individual	across	the	globe.	We	spoke	to	
Alexander	heise,	Business	Director	in	Germany,	to	
discover	how	he	had	benefitted	from	attending	our	
international leadership programme. 
“I	recently	attended	our	international	leadership	programme,	
a	course	put	in	place	for	our	senior	business	leaders.	This	
course	was	specifically	targeted	at	broadening	the	range	of	
skills	needed	to	lead	and	manage	our	fast-growing	business.	
Networking	with	my	fellow	business	leaders	from	across	the	
Group,	we	openly	discussed	the	opportunities	in	our	markets	
and	shared	ideas	on	how	to	best	capitalise	on	them.”

provide	expert	insights	into	the	professional	employment	marketplace.	
We	have	made	significant	progress	on	this	front	over	the	year	and	two	
excellent	new	examples	of	how	we	bring	this	value	to	the	world	we	live	
in	are	the	hays	Journal	and	our	report	on	‘Creating	Jobs	in	a	Global	
Economy’,	published	in	conjunction	with	Oxford	Economics.	The	hays	
Journal	is	designed	to	bring	real	and	practical	insight	to	our	clients	 
and	candidates	about	the	issues	we	know	they	face	in	the	world	of	
professional	work	and	the	feedback	we	have	received	from	all	around	
the	world	on	our	first	publication	has	been	enormously	encouraging.	
Similarly,	the	‘Creating	Jobs	in	a	Global	Economy’	report	highlights	the	
profound	changes	we	are	likely	to	see	in	global	workforce	populations	
within our own lifetimes, together with an approach on how society and 
business	may	address	these	challenges.	Both	of	these	publications	can	
be	found	at	haysplc.com.
Finally,	as	a	global	business	with	the	largest	consultant	base	in	our	
industry in the world, we have taken the opportunity to move significant 
numbers	of	our	people	internationally	into	new	markets	to	enable	us	 
to	grow	quickly	and	securely.	Over	100	of	our	employees	have	moved	
around	the	world,	for	example	from	Australia	to	China	and	Japan,	from	
Japan	to	the	US,	from	France	and	Portugal	to	Mexico	and	from	the	UK	
to	many	of	our	markets.	Not	only	does	this	provide	our	people	with	
unprecedented	career	opportunities	but	importantly	it	transfers	skills,	
knowledge	and	experience,	our	‘hays	DNA’,	around	the	Group	making	
us	a	stronger	and	more	integrated	business	and	creating	a	broader	
platform for growth in the future.
Leveraging	our	brand
Building	the	leading	business	in	our	industry	means	building	the	leading	
brand	too.	Our	brand	as	the	‘Experts	in	Professional	Recruitment’	sits	at	
the	heart	of	everything	we	do,	whether	it	be	the	design	of	our	training	
key characteristics that will drive h a ys’ long-term growth 17
Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011
Directors’ report | business review 
priorities for 2012
Our	ambitions	remain	unchanged	and	our	priorities	for	2012	emphasise	
this.	Our	task	is	to	balance	the	long-term	development	of	a	business	at	
the forefront of opening up our industry in multiple markets around  
the world, with the shorter-term need to continually improve our 
effectiveness	in	all	our	markets	and	deliver	good	financial	returns.	 
This	translates	into	the	following	areas	for	2012:
Driving UK performance
The	UK	market	remains	difficult.	After	significant	declines	over	the	last 	
18	months,	we	expect	the	UK	public	sector	to	broadly	stabilise	but	do	
not	expect	any	material	recovery	in	the	short	term.	The	private	sector	
recovery witnessed during 2011 progressively softened over the year, 
causing	us	to	take	early	action	on	the	cost	base	to	defend	profitability.	
We	will	continue	to	react	as	necessary	according	to	how	we	see	current	
demand,	as	we	did	towards	the	end	of	the	year.	however,	despite	the	
market conditions, we see opportunities to strengthen our market 
position in each of our locations across the country and raise individual 
consultant productivity. Delivering profit growth in the UK is our  
key	objective.
Continued	international	growth	and	diversification
We	had	a	very	successful	2011	in	our	International	divisions	and	we	
intend	to	use	2012	to	drive	further	growth	by	structurally	developing	
markets	all	around	the	world.	We	are	now	in	31	countries,	having	
recently	opened	our	first	office	in	Colombia	and	expect	to	open	new 	
businesses	in	Chile	and	Malaysia	in	the	year.	We	also	intend	to	open	
several	offices	in	existing	countries	and	rapidly	build	scale	by	recruiting	
additional consultants in virtually every international market within 
which we operate.
We	have	a	tried	and	tested	organic	growth	model	with	an	excellent	track	
record	of	success	at	developing	our	International	business	and	I	fully	
expect	2012	to	be	another	year	of	significant	investment	and expansion.
Investment	in	people
The	biggest	single	restraint	on	growth	in	the	majority	of	our	markets	 
is	people:	having	enough	highly	skilled,	trained	and	experienced	
consultants	and	leaders	to	drive	the	business	forward	and	satisfy	
market	demand.	This	is	why	we	have	been	steadfast	in	our	commitment	
to developing our people, from grass-roots level through to our senior 
management	and	business	leaders.	Next	year	I	expect	to	bring	a	
substantial	number	of	new	employees	into	the	business	across	a	range	
of	fee-earning	and	non-fee-earning	roles.	Our	investment	in	our	leaders	
gives	me	the	confidence	they	are	well	equipped	to	manage	these	
rapidly	growing	workforces	and	the	high	levels	of	international	mobility	
we	enjoy	across	the	Group	allows	us	to	move	skilled	and	experienced	
operators to the most attractive opportunities. This is increasingly a 
multinationality,	globally	integrated	team	sharing	the	same	hays	DNA	
worldwide	and,	combined	with	strong	local	teams	in	each	operation,	
gives	us	real	competitive	advantage.	Ensuring	that	we	continue	to	
identify,	train	and	develop	the	very	best	people	in	the	industry	
continues	to	be	at	the	very	heart	of	what	we	do.
Delivering	exceptional	customer	service
As	a	leading	professional	recruitment	business	we	advise	our	
candidates	and	clients	through	one	of	their	most	difficult	decision-
making processes, and we help ensure these decisions are the right 
ones.	We	call	this	‘Powering	the	World	of	Work’.	Our	key	differentiator	
therefore	is	the	expert	service	and	advice	we	deliver,	aiming	to	earn	the	
respect and loyalty of our clients and candidates as their trusted adviser, 
based	on	the	quality	of	the	work	we	deliver	to	them	and	the	way	we	
deliver	it.	Continually	measuring	this	performance,	acting	on	their	
feedback	and	raising	our	own	hurdles	on	service	levels	will	keep	us	
ahead	of	our	competition.	This	process	never	stops	and	will	always	be	
there as a key priority.
summary
2011	was	a	year	of	significant	progress,	both	financially	and	strategically.	
Many	of	our	businesses	rebounded	to	levels	above	their	previous	peak	
performance	and	our	platform	around	the	world	is	bigger	and	better	
than	ever	before.	Not	only	does	this	footprint	give	us	a	broader	base	
from	which	to	grow,	but	it	is	also	a	base	that	gives	us	real	advantage	as	
a	multinational,	integrated	and	joined-up	business	worldwide,	servicing	
our	clients	and	candidates	locally	and	globally.
We	ended	last	year	with	good	levels	of	momentum	across	a	great	many	
of	our	markets.	Clearly	a	number	of	macroeconomic	uncertainties	
remain around the world and since the year end we saw these 
uncertainties	manifest	in	significant	volatility	in	the	world’s	stock	
markets.	It	would	be	premature	at	this	stage	to	determine	how	these	
uncertainties	may	impact	on	our	own	business	but	understandably	 
we	monitor	and	assess	the	situation	in	each	of	our	markets	daily.	In	an	
industry	with	such	limited	visibility	as	ours,	our	task	is	to	build	a	business	
that	is	highly	flexible	and	ensure	we	act	quickly	and	decisively	to	all	
changes	in	our	markets,	both	positive	and	negative.	We	have	a	great	
track	record	of	delivering	this	over	the	last	40	years	and	will	continue	to	
do	so.	Most	importantly	though,	our	business	faces	the	best	long-term	
structural growth opportunities in new markets around the world that 
I have	ever	seen	and	while	businesses	need	people	and	people	need	
jobs,	we	have	a	very	bright	future	and	intend	to	capitalise	fully	on	that.

performance overview
In	Asia	Pacific,	net	fees	increased	by	44%	(30%	on	a	like-for-like	basis
(1)
) 
to	£210.0	million,	and	operating	profit	increased	by	50%	(35%	on	a	
like-for-like	basis
(1)
)	to	£78.1	million.	The	difference	between	actual	
growth and like-for-like growth was predominantly due to the 
appreciation	in	the	Australian	Dollar.	The	business	achieved	a	strong	
conversion	rate	of	37 .2%,	up	from	35.5%	in	the	prior	year,	as	we	carefully	
balanced	profit	growth	with	the	significant	investment	made	to	
capitalise on the long-term growth potential of the region.
In	our	market-leading	Australia	&	New	Zealand	business,	net	fees	were	
up	27%
(1)
	versus	prior	year.	T emporary	placement	net	fees	increased	by	
23%
(1)
 with demand increasing across all regions through the year and 
we	exited	the	year	at	record	temp	levels.	Permanent	placement	net	fees	
increased	by	33%
(1)
 with a good performance across the year, 
particularly	in	the	resource-based	regions	of	Western	and	South	
Australia	and	notably	in	Accountancy	&	Finance,	IT	and	Resources	&	
Mining.	Our	public-sector	business,	which	accounts	for	23%	of	net	fees	
in	Australia	&	New	Zealand,	remained	strong	with	net	fees	increasing	by	
14%
(1)
.	Our	businesses	in	Brisbane	and	Christchurch	responded	strongly	
to	the	challenges	imposed	by	the	natural	disasters	earlier	in	the	year,	
limiting	the	combined	second	half	net	fee	and	operating	profit	impact	 
of	these	events	to	approximately	£1	million.
Our	Asian	business,	which	accounted	for	13%	of	the	division’s	net	fees	 
in	the	year,	achieved	net	fee	growth	of	51%
(1)
	versus	prior	year.	Our	
businesses	in	hong	Kong,	China	and	Singapore	each	achieved	net	fee	
growth	in	excess	of	60%	and	set	several	monthly	net	fee	records	during	
the	year,	driven	by	growth	across	a	broad	range	of	specialisms.	Our	
business	in	Japan	was	significantly	impacted	by	March’s	earthquake	
and	subsequent	disruption,	with	net	fee	growth	decreasing	from	43%
(1)
 
in	the	first	half	of	the	year	to	5%
(1)
	in	the	second	half.	The	business	has	
responded strongly to the challenges faced, limiting the second half net 
fee	and	operating	profit	impact	to	around	£1.5	million.	
Consultant	headcount
(2)
	in	Asia	Pacific	increased	by	22%	during	the	
year,	with	consultant	headcount	increasing	by	15%	in	Australia	&	New	
Zealand	and	by	46%	in	Asia.	In	Australia	&	New	Zealand,	the	outlook	
remains good and we continue to increase consultant headcount, most 
notably	in	Western	and	South	Australia.	In	Asia,	we	have	more	than	
doubled	our	consultant	headcount	in	the	past	18	months	and	we	are	
continuing	to	invest	aggressively	in	order	to	capitalise	on	the	substantial	
long-term	growth	opportunities	that	exist	across	the	region.

In	Continental	Europe	&	Rest	of	World,	net	fees	increased	by	32%	(33%	
on	a	like-for-like	basis
(1)
)	to	£220.4	million,	a	record	for	the	division,	and	
operating profit
(1)(2)
	increased	by	89%	(95%	on	a	like-for-like	basis
(1)(2)
)  
to	£32.4	million.	The	difference	between	actual	growth	and	like-for-like	
growth	was	mainly	due	to	the	modest	depreciation	in	the	Euro.	The	
conversion	rate	increased	from	10.2%	in	2010	to	14.7%	in	2011	driven	by	
strong	net	fee	growth	and	the	return	to	profitability	in	the	majority	of	
countries across the division during the year.
Our	German	business,	representing	48%	of	the	division’s	net	fees	and	
the	significant	majority	of	the	division’s	profits,	recorded	37%
(1)
 net fee 
growth and posted several record monthly performances as 
momentum	remained	strong	through	the	year.	Growth	was	broadly	
based	across	our	contracting	and	temporary	placement	businesses	 
and	across	all	of	the	sectors	in	which	we	operate.	Our	diversification	 
into	Accountancy	&	Finance,	Construction	&	Property,	Sales	&	
Marketing,	Legal	and	Pharma,	continues	rapidly	and	these	specialisms	
now	account	for	24%	of	total	net	fees	(2010:	21%).	Our	market-leading	
position	and	the	increasing	diversification	of	the	business	places	us	
ideally	to	benefit	from	the	continuing	rapid	development	of	the	
specialist	recruitment	market	in	Germany	and	the	structural	growth	
opportunities this presents. 
Our	other	businesses	in	this	division,	covering	21	countries	and	focused	
principally on the permanent placement markets, delivered strong net 
fee	growth.	In	France,	our	second	largest	country	in	the	division,	we	
recorded	19%
(1)
 net fee growth with strong momentum through the 
year.	In	Brazil,	now	our	third	largest	country	in	the	division	and	sixth	
largest	country	in	the	Group,	we	delivered	exceptional	net	fee	growth	 
of	60%
(1)
	and	we	continue	to	rapidly	invest	in	our	office	network	and	
consultant	headcount.	A	further	seven	countries	across	the	division	
recorded	net	fee	growth	in	excess	of	40%
(1)
,	with	our	businesses	in	Italy,	
Belgium,	Denmark,	Poland,	Russia	and	India	having	all	achieved	record	
monthly performances during the year. 
Consultant	headcount
(3)
	increased	by	31%	during	the	year,	led	by	
increases	of	34%	and	50%	in	Germany	and	Brazil,	respectively.	Market

as	a	result	of	its	greater	weighting	to	the	public-sector	markets.	The	
conversion	rate	declined	from	4.7%	to	1.5%	as	a	result	of	the	net	fee	
reduction,	full	year	depreciation	costs	in	respect	of	the	new	IT	systems,	
dual	running	costs	of	the	back-office	automation	project	and	modest	
cost	inflation,	partially	offset	by	the	headcount	reductions	made	during	
the year.
In	the	private-sector	business,	which	currently	represents	78%	of	UK	net	
fees,	we	delivered	strong	net	fee	growth	of	19%,	with	good	growth	in	
our	Accountancy	&	Finance,	Construction	&	Property,	IT	and	Corporate	
Accounts	businesses.	We	achieved	excellent	growth	of	27%	in	the	first	
half, however we saw growth decelerate in the second half with net fees 
increasing	by	12%,	in	large	part	due	to	tougher	market	conditions	in	our	
Banking	and	City-related	businesses.	We	have	continued	to	build	our	
presence	in	the	Corporate	Accounts	market	and	have	won	a	number	 
of	important	contracts	during	the	year	including	American	Express	 
and	Siemens.
Our	public-sector	business	faced	tough	market	conditions	throughout	
the	year,	with	net	fees	decreasing	by	35%	and	we	exited	the	year	down	
57%	from	peak	levels.	Our	front-line	businesses	have	been	relatively	
more	resilient,	with	net	fees	decreasing	by	17%	versus	prior	year.	
however,	market	conditions	in	our	back-office	and	Construction	&	
Property	businesses	have	been	very	difficult,	with	net	fees	now	down	
around	70%	from	peak	levels.	The	UK	public-sector	business	
represented	24%	of	UK	net	fees	and	9%	of	Group	net	fees	in	the	year.
Consultant	headcount	in	the	United	Kingdom	&	Ireland	was	reduced	 
by	5%	during	the	year,	as	we	balanced	managing	the	recovery	in	the	
private	sector	with	the	difficult	public-sector	market.	h owever,	we	
expect	consultant	headcount	to	remain	broadly	at	this	level	in	the	
coming	months.	As	a	result	of	the	lower	level	of	momentum	in	the	
private-sector recovery in the second half we have reduced the non-
consultant	cost	base	of	the	business.	These	actions	will	generate	cost	
savings	of	around	£7	million	per	annum	going	forward.
We	have	a	long-standing	and	growing	
relationship	with	global	manufacturer	
Siemens.	We	recently	won	sole	supplier	
status for all permanent volume 
recruitment until 2013, and have also 
secured	our	position	as	Master	vendor	for	
temporary placements for another two 
years.	We	asked	Lucy	Grainger	at	Siemens	
why	hays	fits	the	bill.
“hays	has	the	depth	and	breadth	to	be	able	to	
supply	permanent	staff	into	all	of	our	sectors,	and	
there	aren’t	many	recruitment	suppliers	in	the	UK	
that	can	do	that.	In	an	organisation	of	this	size,	for	
me	to	have	a	partner	that	I	can	go	to	with	a	
problem,	and	know	that	they	can	solve	it	for	me,	
makes	my	life	a	lot	easier.	We	have	a	strong	
relationship	with	hays.”

Net	fees	in	the	permanent	placement	business,	representing	46%	of	 
the	Group	net	fees,	increased	by	27%
(1)
, with permanent placement 
volumes	increasing	by	23%.	We	capitalised	on	the	significant	
improvement	in	trading	conditions	across	the	vast	majority	of	our	
markets	this	period,	and	recorded	strong	performances	across	Asia	
Pacific,	Continental	Europe,	South	America	and	the	UK	private	sector.	
The	average	fee	per	placement	increased	by	4%	compared	to	last	year,	
driven	by	mix	and	modest	wage	inflation	in	Asia	Pacific	and	parts	of	
Continental	Europe.	
The	Group’s	operating	cost	base,	excluding	exceptional	items
(2)
, 
increased	by	15%
(1)
 versus prior year. This was principally due to the  
11%	increase	in	consultant	headcount,	together	with	an	increase	in	
commission	payments	which	rose	in	line	with	net	fees.	The	Group’s	
conversion rate, which is the proportion of net fees converted into 
operating profit
(2)
,	increased	to	17 .0%	from	14.4%	in	the	prior	year.	 
This	was	driven	by	net	fee	growth,	an	increase	in	average	consultant	
productivity	and	by	strong	management	and	control	of	the	Group’s	
operating	cost	base.
Group	consultant	headcount	increased	by	11%	during	the	year.	This	 
was	led	by	a	27%	increase	in	consultants	in	the	International	business	
where	we	continue	to	invest	in	order	to	capitalise	on	the	substantial	
opportunities	for	growth	across	the	majority	of	our	markets.	This	
increase	was	partially	offset	by	a	5%	consultant	headcount	reduction	 
in	the	UK	where	we	continue	to	balance	managing	the	difficult	
conditions	in	the	public	sector	with	capturing	growth	opportunities	 
in the private sector.
The	Group	performed	strongly	 
during	the	year	driven	by	excellent	
performances	across	our	International	
business.	
Group	turnover	increased	by	21%	( or	19%
(1)
	on	a	like-for-like	basis )	 
and	net	fees	increased	by	21%	(18%
(1)
	on	a	like	for	like	basis ),	driving	
operating	profit	growth	of	42%
(2)
	(33%
(1)
	on	a	like	for	like	basis ).	
Favourable	exchange	rate	movements,	principally	the	Australian	Dollar,	
had a positive impact on the results increasing net fees and operating 
profit	by	£14.2	million	and	£5.3	million	respectively,	and	fluctuations	 
in	exchange	rates	remain	a	significant	sensitivity	for	the	Group	going	
forward.
The	temporary	placement	business,	representing	54%	of	Group	net	
fees,	increased	by	10%
(1)
.	This	comprised	a	volume	increase	of	6%,	 
a	favourable	increase	in	mix/hours	worked	of	8%,	partially	offset	by	
underlying margins
(4)
	slightly	lower	at	14.7%	(2010:	15.2%).	Margins	have,	
however,	remained	broadly	stable	through	the	year.	The	lower	level	of	
growth	relative	to	permanent	placement	reflects	the	temporary	
placement	business’s	greater	resilience	in	the	prior	year	and	its	higher	
weighting	to	the	UK	public	sector.

net finance charge
The	net	finance	charge	for	the	year	was	£7 .5	million	(2010:	£9.4	million).	
The	average	interest	rate	on	gross	debt	during	the	year	was	2.5%	(2010:	
1.0%)	following	the	renewal	of	the	Group’s	banking	facility	on	1	July	
2010,	generating	net	bank	interest	payable,	including	amortisation	of	
arrangement	fees,	of	£6.0	million	(2010:	£1.6	million).	The	net	interest	
charge	on	the	defined	benefit	pension	scheme	obligations	was	 
£1.2	million	(2010:	£6.7	million)	with	the	decrease	primarily	due	to	the	
higher	scheme	assets	increasing	expected	returns	and	a	lower	discount	
rate	reducing	the	interest	cost.	The	charge	for	the	Pension	Protection	
Fund	levy	was	£0.3	million	(2010:	£1.1	million).	It	is	expected	that	the	net	
finance	charge	for	the	year	ending	30	June	2012	will	be	at	similar	levels	
to 2011. 
taxation
T axation	before	exceptional	items
(2)
	for	the	year	was	£35.2	million,	
representing	an	effective	tax	rate	of	33.0%	(2010:	37 .4%)	which	is	
representative	of	the	Group’s	current	geographical	mix	of	profits.	 
The	Group	also	recognised	a	£2.8	million	tax	credit	in	respect	of	the	
exceptional	restructuring	cost	incurred	in	the	year,	bringing	the	total	 
tax	charge	in	the	year	to	£32.4	million.	It	is	expected	that	the	Group’s	
effective	tax	rate	will	remain	at	a	similar	level	in	2012.
exceptional items
The	Group	has	recognised	an	exceptional	credit	of	£4.1	million	in	the	
Consolidated	Income	Statement	in	2011.	This	comprises	a	£24.0	million	
credit	in	respect	of	the	Group’s	successful	appeal	in	reducing	the	fine	
imposed	by	the	Office	of	Fair	T rading	in	September	2009,	and	which	
was previously fully provided for in the 2010 accounts. The fine which 
was	reduced	from	£30.4	million	to	£5.9	million,	has	been	paid	in	full	 
and	brings	this	matter	to	a	close.	In	addition,	the	Group	incurred	a	 
£10.0	million	goodwill	impairment	charge	in	respect	of	the	UK	healthcare	
business	acquired	in	February	2006	for	£17 .9	million,	due	to	tougher

relating	to	the	restructuring	of	the	UK	cost	base.	Including	the	effect	 
of	exceptional	items,	statutory	profit	before	tax	was	£110.7	million,

increased  
60%	to	5.19	pence	(2010:	3.25	pence).	The	increase	in	earnings	per

c ash flow and balance sheet
Cash	flow	in	the	year	was	good	with	85%	conversion	of	operating	
profit
(2)
	into	operating	cash	flow
(3)
.	This	was	below	cash	flow	conversion	
in	the	prior	year	(2010:	97%)	primarily	as	a	result	of	net	fee	growth	in	the	
temporary	placement	business,	which	increased	the	Group’s	working	
capital	requirements	and,	in	addition,	trade	debtor	days	increased	to	
38 days	(2010:	35	days ).	Overall,	cash	outflow	from	working	capital	was	
£47 .2	million	and	net	cash	generated	by	operations
(3)
	was	£97 .3	million	
(2010:	£78.1	million).
Net	capital	expenditure	was	lower	at	£18.6	million	(2010:	£29.8	million),	
reflecting	the	completion	of	the	Group’s	major	IT	investment	
programmes.	Capital	expenditure	is	expected	to	reduce	to	around	 
£15	million	in	2012.	
Dividends	paid	in	the	year	totalled	£79.7	million	and	£8.5	million	was	
paid	out	in	net	interest	and	banking	facility	arrangement	fees.	Net	debt	
increased	from	£77 .2	million	at	the	start	of	the	year	to	£134.8 million	at	
the end of the year, primarily due to the payment of the dividend and 
the	increase	in	working	capital.	The	Group	expects	that	net	debt	will	
increase	in	the	six	months	to	December	2011	due	to	the	proposed	
payment	of	the	final	dividend,	before	reducing	in	the	second	half.	The	
Group	has	a	£300	million	unsecured	revolving	credit	facility	available,	
which	expires	in	January	2014.
c apital structure and dividend
The	Board’s	current	priorities	for	our	free	cash	flow	are	to	fund	Group	
development,	maintain	the	strength	of	the	balance	sheet	and	support	a	
sustainable	dividend	policy.	After	taking	account	of	this	year’s	financial	
performance,	the	Board’s	current	view	on	outlook	and	the	strength	 
of	the	Group’s	balance	sheet,	the	Board	proposes	to	maintain	the	final	
dividend	at	last	year’s	level	of	3.95	pence	per	share,	equating	to	 
£54.3	million.	This	would	make	a	total	dividend	for	the	full	year	of	 
5.80	pence	per	share	(2010:	5.80	pence).	The	recommended	dividend	
payment	date	will	be	18	November	2011	and	will	be	paid	to	shareholders	
on	the	register	at	close	of	business	on	14	October	2011.

r etirement benefits
The	Group’s	pension	liability	under	IAS	19	at	30	June	2011	of	£11.9	million	
(£6.8	million	net	of	deferred	tax)	decreased	by	£55.2	million	compared	
to	30	June	2010,	primarily	due	to	higher	than	expected	asset	returns	
and	increased	Company	contributions.	During	the	year,	the	Company	
contributed	£16.5	million	of	cash	to	the	defined	benefit	scheme	 
(2010:	£5.5	million),	which	included	£12.0	million	additional	funding	
towards the pension deficit in line with previous guidance.
t reasury management
The	Group’s	treasury	operations	remain	straightforward	and	
uncomplicated	with	Group	operations	financed	by	retained	earnings	
and	bank	borrowings.	On	1	July	2010	the	Group	completed	the	renewal	
of	its	reduced	£300	million	revolving	credit	facility,	in	place	until	January	
2014,	and	it	uses	this	facility	to	manage	its	day-to-day	working	capital	
requirements	as	appropriate.	All	borrowings	are	raised	by	the	Group’s	
UK-based	treasury	department,	which	manages	the	Group’s	treasury	
risk	in	accordance	with	policies	set	by	the	Board.	The	Group’s	treasury	
department does not engage in speculative transactions and does not 
operate as a profit centre. 
The Board considers it appropriate to use certain derivative financial 
instruments	to	reduce	its	exposure	to	interest	rate	movements	under	its	
floating	rate	credit	facility.	During	the	period	the	Group	entered	into	six	
interest	rate	swaps	which	exchange	a	fixed	payment	for	floating	rate	
receipt	on	a	total	debt	value	of	£40	million	with	an	equal	mix	of	two-
year	and	three-year	maturities.	Each	of	the	interest	rate	swaps	
commence	in	October	2011.	The	Group	does	not	hold	or	use	derivative	
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Counterparty	risk	primarily	arises	from	investment	of	any	surplus	funds.	
The	Group	restricts	transactions	to	banks	and	money	market	funds	that	
have	an	acceptable	credit	rating	and	limits	exposure	to	each	institution.
c urrent trading
Whilst	we	remain	mindful	of	the	continuing	economic	and	fiscal	
uncertainty around the world, we continue to see good levels of 
momentum	across	the	majority	of	our	markets.	In	Asia	Pacific	we	
continue	to	see	good	growth	in	Australia	&	New	Zealand	and	strong	
growth	in	Asia.	In	Continental	Europe	&	Rest	of	World	growth	remains	
strong	across	the	division,	led	by	strong	growth	in	the	German	business.	
In	the	UK	we	have	seen	slowing	levels	of	growth	in	the	private	sector	
business,	with	continued	tough	but	broadly	stable	markets	in	the	 
public	sector.

provisions in the year and further explanation on particular topics can 
be found later in this Report and in the Remuneration Report.
t he second development was the introduction of the UK Bribery a ct, 
which came into force on 1 July 2011. t his legislation covers all global 
activities of any business that has an operation in the UK. We have taken 
the opportunity to refresh our anti-bribery and corruption arrangements 
in the year after undertaking extensive risk assessments in every 
operating country. We have introduced a new Group-wide anti-bribery 
and corruption policy (including guidelines relating to the giving and 
receiving of gifts and entertainment) and are providing comprehensive 
training for all Group employees. We have also introduced controls in 
respect of our dealings with relevant suppliers and we have put in place 
internal reporting mechanisms to monitor compliance. t he Board will 
monitor and review these arrangements periodically to ensure they 
operate effectively.
t he Code applies to companies whose accounting period begins on or 
after 29 June 2010. t he Financial services a uthority requires UK listed 
companies to explain how they applied the main principles set out in 
section 1 of the Code and whether they have complied with the 
principles set out in section 1 throughout the financial year. t his Report 
explains how we have applied the main principles of the Code during 
the financial year.

Statement of compliance
t hroughout the year ended 30 June 2011 the Company has, without 
exception, complied with the provisions set out in section 1 of the Code. 
Further information on the Code can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website, frc.org.uk.

hays is a strong business with a global presence. We are a leading 
global professional recruiting group, and experts in qualified, 
professional and skilled recruitment, helping to power the growth  
and success of thousands of organisations over five continents.
It was clear to me when I joined hays as Chairman in n ovember 2010 
that hays takes all aspects of governance very seriously and strives 
toward best practice. m y aim is to ensure that the Board of h ays plc  
and the organisation as a whole continue to operate to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. t he Board’s role remains three-fold: 
to provide entrepreneurial leadership to the business; stewardship; and 
to understand the views of shareholders. to help all our stakeholders to 
understand how the Board has achieved these objectives in the year, 
this Report continues to be structured along these three themes.
In the boardroom and across our business, we aim to ensure that  
we promote long-term commercial success, while embedding sound  
values and principles within our business culture. In this, my first 
Corporate Governance Report to you, our shareholders, I would 
highlight two important governance developments within the UK  
in the last 12 months that affect the way we, the Board, lead the 
management of your Company. 
t he first of these was the introduction of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code), which replaced the 2008 Combined Code. t he Code 
made some key changes to board governance, the most notable of 
which were the recommendation of annual re-election of all directors  
of Ftse 350 companies at their a Gm s, the need for boards to consider 
diversity when making new board appointments, board determination 
of the Company’s risk appetite in achieving its strategic objectives and

of reference to ensure that they remained in line with best practice

a s far as possible, each business is given autonomy, whilst being 
required to operate within the internal control environment established 
through the Group Policies and Procedures m anual.

Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011
Directors’ report | governance  m anaging risks and internal control
t he Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management process,  
its system of internal control and for maintaining and reviewing their 
effectiveness. t he Board annually reviews the nature and extent of 
significant risks identified by management both on a gross as well as  
a net (post mitigation) basis, and the status of mitigation plans. t his 
exercise involves the presentation of risk findings to enable the Board to 
review and oversee the status of the key risks to the business. t he Board 
in turn reflects on the level of risk appetite acceptable to the Group in 
order to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. In m ay 2011, the 
Board reviewed the nature and extent of the significant risks in the 
Group on a gross and net basis and determined that the risks and their 
relative priority were appropriate and that actions had been defined 
and attributed to owners in order to treat the risks appropriately. t he 
Board also considered the key regional risks that had been identified 
by management.
day-to-day management of risk is overseen by the m anagement Board, 
which operates a risk management process involving assessment of  
key Group risks twice a year. t he operating regions also conduct 
assessments of strategic and operational risks within each region.  
each risk is assessed in terms of its likelihood to occur and the potential 
financial and reputational impact if it does so. a ppropriate mitigation 
plans and strategies are put in place for those risks that are controllable. 
Progress on the management of risks is reported to the m anagement 
Board. during the year under review, the m anagement Board reviewed 
the progress of high-priority risks, and also considered any new or 
emerging risks that were identified.
Risks are further controlled through delegated authorities and other 
written policies and procedures, which are approved by the Board, 
updated as necessary, and overseen by Group functional departments. 
t he Group Policies and Procedures and Financial Reporting m anuals, 
which encompass all of the Group’s operations, are designed to ensure 
that a minimum level of corporate, accounting, financial and operating 
controls are in place and allow matters to be appropriately and promptly 
escalated to senior management and the Board. t he manuals are 
updated on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in procedures as and 
when they occur. t he Group’s Code of Conduct and ethics Policy 
outlines the way in which employees are expected to conduct 
themselves when carrying out their business activities.
t he Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting 
process. annual budgets are reviewed and approved at business and 
Group levels. t his process includes the identification and quantification 
of significant risks relating to markets and operations. monthly 
performance is reported against budget and prior year. t he monthly 
management accounts analyse and explain variances against budget 
and report on key indicators, with detailed explanations for variances 
and movements in forecasts provided to the Board. 
t he Group’s Internal a udit department also focuses on facilitating the 
identification of risks and undertakes reviews and testing of the controls 
in place for their mitigation. t he department’s resources are augmented 
with independent, expert external resource where necessary, to review 
risk and monitor compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. 
Regular reviews of the most important controls are undertaken to ensure 
that key control objectives are achieved. Reports on the effectiveness of 
operational and financial controls are presented to management and  
to the a udit Committee at each meeting and recommendations are 
agreed upon with management and implemented.
t he Group’s systems and controls are designed to manage risks, 
safeguard the Group’s assets and to ensure the reliability of information 
used both within the business and for publication. systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
t he principal risks disclosed opposite represent the significant areas 
which the Board considers could most likely impact the Group’s 
financial performance and reputational standing.
internal control statement
Responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control has been delegated to the a udit Committee. t he a udit 
Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control for the year ended 30 June 2011, covering all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and 
risk management systems and has concluded that it is in compliance 
with the revised t urnbull guidance – Internal Control: Revised Guidance 
for directors on the Combined Code (o ctober 2005) published by the 
Financial Reporting Council. t his internal control statement has been 
reviewed and approved by the a udit Committee. Further details on the 
Group’s internal control system are reported in the a udit Committee 
Report on page 43.

r isk m anagement actions to mitigate risk
Cyclical nature of our business
t he performance of the Group is 
significantly impacted by changes to the 
underlying economic situation in the United 
Kingdom, a ustralia, Germany and France.
t he Group has diversified its operations to include a balance of both temporary and permanent 
placement recruitment services to public- and private-sector markets, and operates across 31 countries 
and 20 sector specialisms. 
t he Group’s cost base is highly variable and is carefully managed to align with business activity.
t he Group has ensured that net debt has been kept at an appropriate level.
t he Group is highly cash generative, requiring low levels of asset investment. Cash collection is a key 
priority and the Group has made appropriate investment in its credit control and working capital 
management processes.
Business model risk
t he Group faces a number of industry risk 
factors in the competitive environment 
notably the increasing use of social media 
and the gradual shift towards outsourced 
recruitment models with associated 
margin pressures.
We have leveraged our broad geographical and sectoral footprint to win a significant number of 
multispecialism contracts with large corporate organisations. t his has strengthened significantly our 
relationship with these clients, increasing our share of their recruitment spend and increasing our share  
of the markets in which we operate.
We monitor changes in the market in terms of industry trends including social media, and continue to 
invest in our online presence to provide a high-quality customer experience.
talent
t he Group is reliant on its ability to recruit, 
train, develop and retain staff to deliver its 
growth plans.
We continue to ensure that overall remuneration packages are competitive. t his includes performance-
related commissions to incentivise staff.
Increased focus has been given to internal recruitment activities and training opportunities (for example 
through e-learning).
o ur leadership development programmes are in place and developing the potential of future leaders.
a nnual succession plans are undertaken across all regions to identify key roles and successor options.
We maintain medium- to long-term management incentive schemes for our top 360 employees to foster 
commitment to the continued growth of the Group.
Compliance risk
Certain checks are required before we place 
candidates into their roles. For certain roles 
and industries those checks are more 
specific as set out by legislation. Failure to 
complete, maintain or refresh those checks 
could lead to legal, financial and 
reputational consequences. 
a ll new employees receive training in respect of the relevant operating standards that are applicable  
to their particular recruitment role. t he Compliance function is also available to provide support and 
guidance to recruitment consultants.
o ur higher-risk specialisms such as education and h ealthcare have supplementary processes and 
controls in place to ensure that operational standards are complied with.
In territories where legislation sets out additional requirements, compliance specialists are employed,  
for example occupational health and safety in a ustralia. 
dedicated compliance auditors conduct spot checks on candidate records, to ensure that the appropriate 
vetting checks and due diligence are carried out in line with legal and contractual requirements.
Reliance on technology
t he Group continues to develop and 
integrate new systems to improve 
performance. Business activities are 
increasingly reliant on system performance 
and integrity (h ays’ and its clients’ systems) 
to deliver service to clients and workers.  
a large amount of confidential data is held  
in these systems.
t echnology systems are housed in various data centres and the Group has capacity to cope with a data 
centre loss through the establishment of disaster recovery sites that are physically based in separate 
locations to the ongoing operations.
data protection remains a key priority. s pecific contractual provisions exist with regard to our data 
centres, to ensure we have sufficient handling and storage procedures around confidential data. 
t he Company has in place data protection and security policies and, where data protection legislation 
allows, email monitoring programmes are undertaken to highlight potential areas of concern, which are 
then investigated.
Contract risk 
t he Company enters into contractual 
arrangements with clients, some of which 
can be onerous in terms of required activities.
during contract negotiations management seeks to minimise risk and ensure that the nature of risks and 
their potential impact is understood.
o ur legal team has the depth of knowledge and experience to enable them to advise management on 
the level of risk presented in contracts.
Reviews are performed on a risk basis across key contracts, to identify and agree improvements to the 
way in which we deliver services to clients.
t he Group Finance director reviews and approves contracts with non-standard terms.
Foreign exchange
t he Group has significant operations outside

shareholders on key issues and management performance. a summary 
of this report is subsequently provided to the Board.

Directors’ report | governance  bo Ard effec Tivene SS
Understanding the business
We consider that, to function effectively, all members of the Board need 
appropriate knowledge of the Company and access to its operations 
and staff. Presentations and reports on commercial initiatives, our 
markets, our competitive position and the general economic indicators 
are given periodically to the Board. In addition, we hold Board meetings 
away from the head office approximately twice a year, which allows 
focus on local markets and operations and enables the non-executive 
directors to meet the local management.
board training and development
o n appointment, directors receive a formal induction, which includes 
visits to relevant business units and functions and discussions with 
senior management. t hese are tailored to the needs of the individual 
director and continue throughout their tenure.
Briefing sessions on legislative and accounting developments are held 
for the Board and its committees when appropriate. during the year, the 
Board received updates from the Company secretary and from 
Freshfields Bruckhaus d eringer ll P , the Company’s external legal 
advisers, regarding regulatory changes and new legislation, the 
Remuneration Committee received updates from their external 
advisers, PricewaterhouseCoopers llP , regarding regulatory and 
governance changes and recent developments in shareholder 
sentiments, and the a udit Committee received updates from deloitte 
on developments in accounting standards and company regulations.
performance evaluation
t his year the Board undertook an internal review of the effectiveness of 
the Board, its committees and individual members, having carried out 
an external review with egon Zehnder in 2010. a s part of the review, 
each director ( other than the Chairman) completed a questionnaire 
comprising questions relating to:
•	 information flows, board papers and agenda composition;
•	 controls;
•	 board dynamics and relationships;
•	 discussion topics and decision making;
•	 value creation, strategy and performance; and
•	 the effectiveness of the a udit, n omination and Remuneration 
Committees.
t he completed questionnaires were sent to the Company secretary 
who compiled a report on the results of the evaluation for the 
Chairman’s consideration. t he Chairman met with each of the directors 
individually to discuss the results of the review and their responses, and 
to provide constructive feedback. t he senior Independent director also 
met with the other non-executive directors to appraise the performance 
of the Chairman, having consulted with the executive directors. t he 
findings of the 2011 performance evaluation were then considered by 
the Board and certain actions will be implemented as a result.
Board and committee performance
t he structure of the Board is considered to be appropriate and 
relationships between Board members are constructive. t he Chairman 
provides strong leadership, encouraging open debate and challenge 
and the Board is appraised of all material matters. t he Board is aligned 
around the strategic objectives facing the business. t he committees  
are well chaired and their structure and responsibilities are clear and 
appropriate. 
Various actions arising from the review will be addressed in the coming 
year, including consideration of the use of board pack technology to 
facilitate meetings, increasing the Board’s focus on strategy and 
execution, facilitating external briefings on key issues affecting the 
Group and providing additional training updates on governance and 
regulatory matters, and continued operational focus in relation to 
efficiency improvements. l ooking forward, the Board will continue to 
ensure that it has the appropriate balance of skills and experience in 
relation to the strategic objectives of the business.
t he a udit Committee also undertook its own separate review, details  
of which are reported in the a udit Committee Report on page 43.
Individual performance
t he effectiveness of each member of the Board was reviewed in 
respect of the financial year. t he Chairman, along with the non-
executive directors, reviewed the performance of the executive 
directors individually against their objectives. t he remuneration of the 
executive directors is linked to their respective performances and is 
determined by the Remuneration Committee based upon the result of 
these reviews. Further details are reported in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 48 to 57 .
t he non-executive directors, led by the s enior Independent director, 
met without the Chairman present to appraise his performance during 
the year.
Following the performance evaluation review, the Chairman is satisfied 
that each of the directors, who will all be put forward for reappointment 
at the forthcoming a nnual General m eeting, remains independent in 
character and judgement. a s William eccleshare and Paul stoneham 
will extend their terms of office beyond six years, the n omination 
Committee has given their performances particular consideration,  
as required by the Code, taking into account the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board. each of the directors being put forward for 
reappointment at the 2011 a nnual General m eeting continues to be 
effective. t heir ongoing commitment to the role is undiminished  
and they continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and  
its committees.

considered that individuals with business to business and professional 
services backgrounds would be particularly relevant, as would 
individuals with strong international experience and credibility within

only minor changes were necessary to reflect the revised 2010 iCsa ’s 
Guidance for a udit Committees. The terms of reference of the 
Committee are published on the Company’s website, haysplc.com, and

including the annual audit plan and resource requirements. The plan has 
delivered both geographic and financial coverage, as well as risk-based 
assurance in support of non-financial topics such as iT and hr 
processes, contract management and compliance. 
internal a udit reports include recommendations agreed with 
management to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of internal 
controls. a t each meeting, the Committee received a summary

paul Harrison 
a udit Committee Chairman
The Committee considered the scope and materiality of the audit  
work, considered and approved the audit fee, reviewed the results  
of the a uditor’s work and considered the a uditor’s performance and 
effectiveness. The risk of the a uditor withdrawing from the market  
was also considered.
The Committee met the external a uditor twice during the year without 
management being present. 
The Committee reviewed the policy on the engagement of the  
a uditor for non-audit services and confirmed the applicability of that 
policy in satisfying itself that their independence and objectivity was 
not impaired. 
The key features of this policy are as follows: 
•	 work closely related to the audit ( e.g. taxation or financial reporting 
matters ) can be awarded to the a uditor by the executive directors 
provided the work does not exceed £150,000 in fees per item; and
•	 all other work either requires Committee approval or forms part of a 
list of prohibited services where it is felt independence or objectivity 
may be impaired.
The Committee has reviewed the non-audit services performed by 
Deloitte ll P in the year and has concluded that the policy has been 
applied and the a uditor’s independence and objectivity has not  
been impaired as a result. Details of fees paid to Deloitte ll P and its 
associates during the financial year are set out in note 7 to the 
Consolidated Financial statements on page 69.
a fter due and careful consideration, taking account of the processes 
above, the Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte 
ll P be reappointed as the Company’s a uditor at the a nnual General 
Meeting to be held on 9 n ovember 2011.
r isk management and internal control
The Committee reviewed the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems by considering the Group’s risk assessment process 
which included detail of the extent of coverage, the assessment 
methods employed and the effectiveness of the controls to mitigate 
those risks. it also considered the results of testing performed by both 
the internal and external audit teams in evaluating the effectiveness of 
such controls. 
internal a udit and risk
The Committee oversees the risk management and assurance activities 
including the work of internal a udit.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the terms of reference of the 
internal a udit function and only minor changes were necessary.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance and 
effectiveness of the h ead of internal a udit and of the internal a udit

Structure of share capital
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), the Company  
no longer has an authorised share capital. As at 30 June 2011, the 
Company’s issued share capital of £14,640,965.66 comprised 
1,464,096,566 Ordinary shares of 1 pence each. No shares were allotted 
during the year.

Chapter 6 of Part 18 of the Act allows companies to hold shares acquired 
by way of market purchase in treasury, rather than having to cancel 
them. The directors may use the authority to purchase shares and hold 
them in treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury 
as permitted in accordance with the Act) rather than cancel them, 
subject to institutional guidelines applicable at the time. At 30 June 2011, 
79,851,635 Ordinary shares of 1 pence each were held in treasury.  
During the year to 30 June 2011, 344,692 shares held in treasury were 
transferred to satisfy awards of shares under the Company’s employee 
share schemes and a further 31,603 shares were transferred to the Hays 
plc Employee Share T rust to satisfy future option exercises under the 
Hays UK Sharesave Scheme and the Hays International Sharesave 
Scheme. No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held in treasury 
and no voting rights attach to the treasury shares. 
Rights and obligations of Ordinary shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting every holder of Ordinary 
shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote. On a poll, every member present in person or by proxy, shall have 
one vote for every Ordinary share held. In accordance with the 
provisions of the Articles of Association, holders of Ordinary shares are 
entitled to a dividend where declared or paid out of profits available  
for such purposes. On a return of capital on a winding up, holders of 
Ordinary shares are entitled to participate in such a return. 
Restrictions on transfers of securities 
The restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company are as follows: 
•	 the Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register the transfer 
of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal 
does not prevent dealing in shares in the Company from taking place 
on an open and proper basis;
•	 the Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer is lodged, duly stamped (if 
stampable), at the Registered Office or at another place appointed  
by the Board accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it 
relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require 
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer;
•	 the Board may refuse to register a transfer of shares in favour of more 
than four persons jointly;
•	 where a shareholder has declined to provide certain information 
requested by the Company in accordance with the Act, the Board 
can in certain circumstances apply to the court for an order directing 
that the shares in question be subject to restrictions. If an order is so 
made, any transfer of ( or any agreement to transfer) the shares will 
be void and no voting rights will be exercisable in respect of them;
•	 restrictions may be imposed on certain Group employees who are 
required to seek approval from the Company before dealing in shares 
in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the United 
Kingdom Listing Authority; and
•	 awards of shares under the Company’s incentive arrangements, the 
Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, are 
subject to restrictions on the transfer of shares prior to vesting.
The Company is unaware of any arrangements between its 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares 
and/or voting rights. 
Exercise of rights of shares in employee share schemes 
Certain share awards under Company incentive arrangements are held 
in trust on behalf of the beneficiaries. Except where acting under 
instruction as a bare nominee, the Trustee of the Hays plc Employee 
Share Trust does not seek to exercise the voting rights on these shares. 
No voting rights are exercised in relation to shares unallocated to 
individual beneficiaries.
Restrictions on voting deadlines
The notice of any general meeting shall specify the deadline for 
exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote at  
a general meeting. It is the Company’s policy at present to take all 
resolutions at a general meeting on a poll and the results of the poll  
are published on the Company’s website, haysplc.com, shortly after  
the meeting.
Significant direct and indirect shareholdings

Directors’ report | governance Oth ER Statut ORy inf ORmati On Powers of directors
The directors are responsible for the management of the business and 
may exercise all powers of the Company subject to legislation, any 
directions given by special resolution and the Company’s constitution.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 10 November 
2010, shareholders authorised the directors, until the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 9 November 2011, to purchase  
up to 138,421,332 Ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company and 
to allot new shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £4,614,044, 
being approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share capital. The 
authority to allot shares was not used. Renewal of both authorities will be 
proposed to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Board intends to continue to return surplus cash to shareholders 
where circumstances allow and it is not required to finance the organic 
expansion of the business, acquisitions and dividend payments, via the 
on-market purchase of its own shares. Shares will only be purchased if 
to do so would result in an increase in earnings per share and it is in the 
best interests of shareholders generally. No share purchases are 
anticipated in the 2012 financial year. 
The Board will be seeking the approval of the shareholders to renew this 
authority at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting as detailed in the 
separate Circular to Shareholders. 
appointment and replacement of directors
The Company may by ordinary resolution appoint any individual to the 
Board. The Board may appoint any individual willing to act as a director 
either to fill a vacancy or act as an additional director. The appointee can 
only hold office until the next annual general meeting whereupon he/
she will be put forward for reappointment.
The Articles of Association prescribe that there shall be no less than five 
and no more than 15 directors. Should the number reduce below five, 
the Board shall, as soon as practicable, appoint an individual to fill the 
vacancy. The Company may by ordinary resolution vary the minimum 
number of directors. 
The Articles of Association prescribe that at each annual general 
meeting, not less than one-third of the directors must retire by rotation 
and any director who has been in office for three years or more since 
his/her last appointment or reappointment must retire by rotation.  
A retiring director is eligible for reappointment. The 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code recommends that all directors be subject to annual  
re-election by shareholders. Therefore, with effect from the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 9 November 2011, all directors will  
offer themselves for annual re-election.
a rticles of a ssociation
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended by a 
special resolution passed by shareholders at a general meeting of 
the Company.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
The Company continues to maintain directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance. In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, it 
is the Company’s policy for each director and the Company Secretary 
and General Legal Counsel to be indemnified by deeds of indemnity. 
Employees 
The Company’s business is dependent upon our employees. As a 
consequence, our people strategy continues to focus on ensuring that 
we have the necessary capabilities, resources and work environment 
appropriate for a high-performing organisation.
The Group continues to be committed to developing its employees and 
investing in training tailored to meet the needs of the business, including 
both structured training and on-the-job training and briefings. Our 
leadership development programmes for our top global leaders, ‘Fast 
Forward’ and the Advanced Management Programme, continue to be 
implemented to ensure the development of talent in our business. 
As part of creating a stimulating place to work, there are a number of 
ways we ensure our employees are involved in the business and issues 
relating to its performance, including senior management briefings, 
employee briefing groups, email messaging and our global group 
intranet. T o encourage employees to have a stake in the business,  
there are also a number of share schemes. 
As a responsible employer of thousands of people, the Group is 
committed to equal opportunities and its policy ensures that everyone 
has the opportunity to contribute to the business regardless of age, 
gender, ethnicity, sexuality, physical appearance, religion, education 
and beliefs. 
The Group has a structured approach towards internal recruitment and 
promotion with decisions based on an individual’s ability to perform the 
role. This means that full consideration is given to disabled applicants 
where they have the right skills and abilities for the role. Should an 
employee become disabled whilst working for the Group, every effort  
is made to accommodate them or to find a suitable alternative role and 
to assist with any re-training. The Group’s commitment to training and 
development includes consideration of any special training needs of 
disabled employees. 
More information on the Group’s engagement with employees is set  
out in the 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report which is available on  
the Company’s website, haysplc.com. 
Payments to creditors
It is the Group’s policy to make payments to suppliers in accordance 
with agreed terms provided that the supplier has performed in 
accordance with the relevant terms and conditions. Creditor days for 
the Group for the year ended 30 June 2011 were an average of 32  
(2010: 32). The Company creditor days for the year ended 30 June 2011 
were 32 (2010: 32). 
Charitable and political donations
Group charitable donations made during the year totalled £219,000 
(2010: £183,000). No payments were made to political parties.

Directors’ report | governance  Environment
Whilst the Company’s business has a low impact on the environment, 
the Company aims to achieve continuous improvement in environmental 
performance and to prevent pollution. Wherever possible, we seek to 
minimise our impact by reducing our use of energy, water and raw 
materials and increasing efficiency. 
More information on the Group’s environmental activities is set out  
in the 2011 Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on the 
Company’s website, haysplc.com.
auditor
Deloitte LLP has indicated that it is willing to continue in office. Its 
reappointment, at a remuneration to be agreed by the directors, will  
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Change of control — significant agreements 
On 1 July 2010 the Company renewed its unsecured revolving credit 
facility at a reduced amount of £300 million. The terms of the 
agreement include a provision for a lending counterparty to amend, 
alter or cancel the relevant commitment to the Group following a 
change of control of the Company. As at 30 June 2011, £115 million  
of this facility had not been drawn.
There are no provisions contained within the service contracts of 
executive directors that will trigger in the event of a change of control. 
There are a number of commercial contracts that would alter in the 
event of a change in control but none is considered to be material in 
terms of the potential impact on the Group in this event.
Certain of the Company’s share award plans contain provisions that 
permit awards or options to vest or become exercisable on a change  
of control in accordance with the rules of the plans. 
Conflicts of interest 
In line with the Act, the Articles of Association allow the Board to 
authorise actual and potential conflicts of interest and duties that may 
arise and to impose such limits and conditions as it thinks fit. Conflicts  
of interest and duties can only be authorised by those directors who do 
not have an interest in the matter being considered, and in making such 
decision, the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith,  
will most likely promote the success of the Company. The Company  
has established a procedure whereby actual and potential conflicts of 
interest and duties are advised to the Company Secretary and are 
reviewed annually. Appropriate authorisations are sought for any ad hoc 
notifications of any new conflicts of interest or duties, or any changes to 
existing conflicts of interest or duties. The Board has undertaken a review 
of these procedures and considers them to have operated effectively 
during the year. 
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern 
basis as the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Further details can be found in note 2b to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements on page 63.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs ) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the directors  
are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions  
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
46
Directors’ report | governance The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Act. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
The Board confirms to the best of its knowledge that: 
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to the a uditor
As required by Section 418 of the Act, each of the directors as at  
31 August 2011 confirms that: 
(a)  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and 
(b )  the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is 
aware of that information. 
Words and phrases used in this confirmation should be interpreted in 
accordance with Section 418 of the Act.

The Committee’s activities for the 2011 financial year have included:
•	 a review of the basic pay, bonus and Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
awards of the executive directors, and other senior executives;
•	 a consideration of the appropriateness of the existing arrangements 
for the 2012 financial year;
•	 a review of the reward strategy in the context of Group risk; and 
•	 a consideration of the relationship between executive reward and  
the reward structures in place for other Group employees.
2012 Remuneration arrangements
Base salaries for the executive directors have been frozen since July 
2008. The Committee believed that it was appropriate to increase their 
base pay by 3% with effect from 1 July 2011 in line with the market and 
the average base pay increase for other employees based in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee agreed a new structure in 2009 for the 
annual bonus, deferred bonus and PSP awards for executive directors 
and other Management Board members, with the aim of creating 
arrangements that would be enduring over a number of business 
cycles. The Committee believes that the structure of these arrangements 
remains appropriate and no changes will be made to the structure or 
levels of the annual bonus, deferred bonus or PSP awards for the 2012 
financial year. The comparator group for the TSR component of the  
PSP award also remains unchanged. 
The Committee continues to review the executive reward arrangements 
in the light of comment from shareholders and representative groups 
and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and is 
satisfied that these arrangements are compliant. The Committee 
unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to approve the 
Remuneration Report at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
As we have already announced to shareholders, I will be stepping down 
from the Board at the conclusion of this year’s AGM and as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director. I am 
delighted that Paul Harrison, who will be relinquishing his responsibilities 
as Chairman of the Audit Committee, will be appointed Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Senior Independent Director with effect 
from the conclusion of the AGM.

DEAR SHAREHo LDER
I am pleased to introduce the report of the Board covering the 
remuneration policy and practice for the Company. 
2011 performance and reward
This year has seen a strong recovery for the Group following two years 
of challenging economic conditions. The business returned to growth, 
with an increase in net fees of 21% and a 42% (before exceptional items ) 
increase in operating profit. At the same time, we have continued to 
invest for the long term, including expansion into new markets and  
the development of our people, our brand and industry-leading 
technology systems. 
Given the Group’s results, the Committee believes that it is appropriate 
to pay bonuses for achieving agreed performance targets for the 2011 
financial year. Bonuses for executive directors for 2011 ranged between 
101% (2010: 110%) and 102% (2010: 112%) of salary and are set out in 
more detail in the table on page 51. o f the bonus awarded, 60% will be 
paid in cash and 40% will be deferred in shares for a three-year period. 
The Committee retains discretion to reduce the number of shares 
vesting if the underlying financial performance of the Company has  
not been satisfactory over the deferral period.

REMUNERATION REpORT | governance RemuneR ation R epo Rt RemuneR ation Repo Rt 
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports ) Regulations 2008 and will be submitted to 
shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)  
of the Company to be held on 9 November 2011. In carrying out its 
functions, the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) has followed 
the provisions of Schedule A to the June 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) which is published by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Further information on the Code can be found  
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website, frc.org.uk. 
Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration 
Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of 
reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for determining 
specific packages for the executive directors, the Chairman and other 
senior executives. The Company consults with key shareholders in 
respect of remuneration policy and the introduction of new incentive 
arrangements. During the year the Committee recommended minor 
changes to its terms of reference to the Board to take into account the 
ICSA’s Guidance on Remuneration Committee T erms of Reference 
issued in o ctober 2010. These changes were approved by the Board 
and the revised terms of reference for the Committee are available on 
the Company’s website, haysplc.com, and from the Company Secretary 
at the Registered o ffice. 
The Committee was chaired by Lesley Knox throughout the year under 
review. Lesley Knox will be stepping down as a director of the Board 
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the conclusion of  
this year’s AGM to be held on 9 November 2011. Paul Harrison, who  
will relinquish his role as Chairman of the Audit Committee, will be 
appointed Chairman of the Committee at the conclusion of the AGM.  
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. William Eccleshare, Paul Harrison, Richard Smelt and Paul 
Stoneham were Committee members throughout the year. The 
Committee receives assistance from the Chairman, Group HR Director 
and Group Company Secretary, who attend meetings by invitation, 
except when issues relating to their own remuneration are being 
discussed. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director also 
attended by invitation on occasions. The Committee met six times 
during the financial year ended 30 June 2011. Meeting attendance is 
shown on page 39 of this Annual Report. 
a dvisers to the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee continues to engage the services of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent remuneration 
adviser. During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all 
aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors and members  
of the Management Board. PwC also advised the Company on tax, 
administrative and compliance issues relating to the operation of the 
Company’s share schemes around the world and the Group’s IT project 
regarding management information systems. 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , which acts as the Company’s 
principal legal adviser, provided legal advice to the Committee in the 
financial year. 
Remuneration policy 
The Committee determines the remuneration policy for the executive 
directors, Chairman and other senior executives for current and future  
years and this is reviewed on an annual basis. The remuneration policy  
is designed to support the strategic objectives of the Company and to  
allow the business to attract, retain and motivate the quality of senior 
management needed to shape and execute strategy and deliver 
shareholder value. The Committee considers that a successful 
remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account  
of future changes in the Company’s business environment and in 
remuneration practice. Future reports, which will continue to be subject 
to shareholder approval, will describe any changes in this policy.
The policy is designed around the following key principles:
•	 a strong link between reward and individual and Company performance 
to align the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders;
•	 maintain a competitive package against businesses of a comparable 
size in the FTSE and comparable peer group businesses in the 
recruitment sector with reference to the breadth of the role and 
experience the role holder brings to the Company;
•	 operate a consistent reward and performance philosophy throughout 
the business;
•	 encourage a personal stake in the business and a long-term focus on 
sustained growth through long-term shareholding; 
•	 provide a balanced package with a focus on variable pay; and
•	 take into account the associated risks of each aspect of remuneration.
The Committee has considered how the remuneration policy reflects 
Hays’ principal risks (set out on page 37) and, where appropriate,  
can mitigate these. The table below sets out how the incentive 
arrangements serve this purpose through the combination of the 
performance measures chosen and the overall link to share price 
through deferral and shareholding requirements.

How the executive directors were paid in 2011
It is the Company’s policy to take into account the pay and employment 
conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
directors’ remuneration. The base pay of Group employees based in  
the UK, including the executive directors, was frozen for the 2010 and 
2011 financial years. During the year the Committee received a paper 
from the Group HR Director providing an overview of remuneration 
levels within the organisation as a whole. The Committee believed it 
was appropriate to increase the base pay of the executive directors  
by 3% with effect from 1 July 2011, in line with the market and the 
average base pay increase for other relevant employees based in  
the UK.
The table below sets out the key elements of the Company’s 
remuneration policy for the executive directors for the 2011 and 2012 
financial years.

REMUNERATION REpORT | governance RemuneR ation R epo Rt Co NTINUED f ixed to variable remuneration 
The remuneration packages for executive directors in respect of 2011 
policy contained a significant variable element dependent on the level 
of performance of the business and the individual, as can be seen from 
the chart below: 
Notes:
(1)  Variable compensation includes potential maximum bonus awards including the face 
value of awards made under the deferred bonus arrangements and Performance 
Share Plan as stated on pages 54 and 55.
(2)  Fixed compensation comprises salary, pension contribution and other benefits as 
stated in the table on page 54.
summary of share-based incentive schemes 
This section describes the design of the Company’s current share-based 
incentive schemes and how they were used in the 2011 financial year. 
The Company’s long-term incentives primarily comprise the 
Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan. 
The Committee reviews the operation of these plans annually to ensure 
that grant levels, performance criteria and other features remain 
appropriate to the Company’s current circumstances, and to ensure that 
there are no features of the plans that could inadvertently motivate 
irresponsible behaviour.
The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the ABI. These 
restrict the issue of new shares (and transfers of treasury shares ) under 
all the Company’s share schemes in any 10-year period to 10% of the 
issued o rdinary share capital ( excluding shares held in treasury) and 
under the Company’s discretionary schemes to 5% in any 10-year 
period. As at 30 June 2011, the headroom available under these limits 
was 59% and 39%, respectively. 
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is designed to link reward to the key long-
term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the 
executive directors and the global senior management population with 
the long-term interests of shareholders. PSP awards are granted annually 
and vesting is dependent on the achievement of performance conditions 
measured over a three-year period. Awards below Management Board 
level were based on a one-year performance period and a further two-
year holding period. Award levels for executive directors and other senior 
executives are determined each year by the Committee, but must not 
exceed 200% of a participant’s base salary in any financial year. Awards 
for the 2011 financial year were capped at 175% for executive directors and 
120% for other senior executives, the same as for the 2010 financial year. 
Approximately 360 key executives, including Alistair Cox, Paul Venables 
and eight other Management Board executives, participated in PSP 
awards made in September 2010. o ther employees may be eligible to 
participate in future years at the discretion of the Committee. 
Bonus deferral arrangements
Bonus deferral promotes a stronger link between short-term and long-
term performance through deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a 
three-year period. The last deferral to be eligible for a matching award 
was in relation to the 2009 financial year bonus and no further 
matching awards will be made.
o nly the executive directors and other members of the Management 
Board currently participate in the Company’s bonus deferral 
arrangements. o ther employees may be invited to participate in future 
years at the Committee’s discretion.

All-employee share schemes 
The Company has continued to operate the Hays UK Sharesave 
Scheme (which is HMRC approved and is open to all eligible staff in the 
United Kingdom) and the Hays International Sharesave Scheme (which 
is open to staff in certain other key countries where the Group has 
operations ). In the 2011 financial year, options over 1,594,144 shares at 
a price of 112 pence per share, representing a 10% discount to market 
value, were granted to 442 participants under both schemes. The 
overall participation rate for all current schemes remains good at 26.8% 
of eligible employees.
The executive directors’ interests in outstanding options and awards, 
including performance conditions, are detailed in the audited section  
of this Report from page 54 onwards.
performance targets on incentives 
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives 
are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations, cyclicality of the recruitment markets in 
which the Group operates and on the basis of external advice. T o the 
extent that any performance condition is not met, the relevant part of 
the award will lapse. There is no retesting of performance. The bonus 
awards payable in respect of the 2011 financial year, as reported on  
page 54, were agreed by the Committee having reviewed the 
Company’s results and the executive directors’ performance against 
their personal objectives.
Details of the targets used to determine 2011 bonuses for the executive 
directors are shown in the table below.

Performance levels between threshold, target and maximum were 
graduated on a straight-line basis.
Notes:
(1)  The basic EPS threshold was set at 95% of budget, target at 100% of budget and 
maximum at 110% of budget. The targets and actual performance were measured  
at budget exchange rates. o n this basis the EPS result for the 2011 financial year was 
4.74 pence, which was between the target and maximum figures and 91.8% of the  
EPS element of the bonus is payable.
(2)  Cash Conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company, after deducting net  
capital expenditure items (excluding capital expenditure incurred on the Group’s 
strategic IT projects) for the financial year, stated as a percentage of operating profit 
before exceptional items. The Cash Conversion result for the 2011 financial year of  
79.2% was between the threshold and target figures and 41.9% of this element  
of the bonus is payable.
(3)  The personal objectives for the Chief Executive included planning and prioritising  
the strategic expansion of the business into new markets; implementing specific  
market productivity plans; the development of the Group’s management capability;  
and identifying how to exploit the new systems and technical architecture. Those for  
the Group Finance Director included a number of targets relating to the development  
of the Group’s strategic planning process; the identification and acquisition of new 
shareholders as part of the investor relations strategy; the assessment of potential 
acquisition targets and, where appropriate, the funding, completion and integration of 
any targets; and ensuring the benefits of recent back-office system implementations are 
realised through cost savings and the use of improved management information tools. 
Progress against these objectives has been good but this element will not pay out in full.

arrangements can be found on page 56 of this Report. The emoluments 
of the executive directors and their share interests are set out on pages 
54 to 57 .
incentive structure for the 2012 financial year 
The overall incentive structure for the financial year 2012 is unchanged. 
The Committee Chairman’s introduction on page 48 and the policy 
table on page 50 summarise the approach taken for the 2012 financial 
year. This section provides more detail on the bonus and share  
incentive arrangements for 2012. There are no changes to the structure 
of the bonus, deferred bonus or the PSP for 2012 and the levels of 
remuneration, other than basic salaries, are unchanged.
Bonuses for 2012 financial year 
The structure of bonus arrangements for the 2012 financial year remains 
unchanged.
Annual bonus structure
2011 2012
Maximum bonus as % of base salary 125% 125%
Proportion of maximum based on  
financial measures: 80% 80%

 – Cash Conversion 20% 20%
Proportion of maximum based on  
personal objectives 20% 20%
Proportion of bonus payable subject  
to compulsory deferral 40% 40%
o f any bonus awarded, 40% will be compulsorily deferred into 
restricted shares for a period of three years, subject only to continued 
employment. There is no matching award. The Committee retains 
discretion to reduce the number of deferred shares vesting if the 
underlying financial performance of the Company has not been 
satisfactory over the three-year deferral period. Suitably stretching 
targets have been set in relation to budget. Similar bonus arrangements 
will be put in place for the Management Board members, but with the 
maximum set at a lower percentage of base salary.
PSP for 2012 financial year 
The PSP awards for the 2012 financial year will again be based 50%  
on total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a sector peer group of 
companies and 50% on cumulative EPS. The 2012 PSP award structure 
for the executive directors is shown in the table below. 
pSp incentive structure
2011 2012
PSP award as % base salary 175% 175%
TSR target relative to  
comparator group 50% of award 50% of award

 – Threshold (25% vesting) median Median
Cumulative EPS target 50% of award 50% of award
 – Maximum (100% vesting)
 – Threshold (25% vesting)
Similar arrangements are in place for the Management Board members, 
but at a lower percentage of base salary.
The size of the awards and proportion vesting at threshold levels for 
both elements of the award (25%) are unchanged.
In the same way as for the previous year’s awards, the Committee will 
set EPS targets using market consensus (reflecting the current point in 
any cycle) being a range of +/- 4% around the consensus forecast EPS as 
the starting point for the three-year cycle with a range of RPI plus 4% to 
RPI plus 12% over the remaining two years of the cycle for threshold and 
maximum payment respectively. The Committee considers this range 
to remain appropriate over several cycles. For each new award granted, 
the Committee reviews the range to ensure it remains appropriate. 
No changes have been made to the structure of the performance 
targets and the composition of the comparator group for the TSR 
component of the awards to be made for the 2012 financial year. 
The intended constituents of the comparator group for the 2012 awards 
are shown below: 
Adecco SA
CDI Corporation
Kelly Services Inc 
Manpower Inc 
Michael Page International plc 
Randstad Holdings NV 
Robert Half International Inc 
Robert Walters plc 
SThree plc 
USG People NV
The peer group has been chosen to reflect most closely the mix of the 
Company’s business. 
The EPS and TSR components will operate independently. There will be 
no payout for achieving less than threshold performance and vesting 
levels between threshold and maximum performance will be calculated 
on a straight-line basis.
Vesting of the TSR component is subject to satisfactory financial 
performance over the performance period as determined by the 
Committee. 
Pension, benefits and shareholdings 
There has been no change to the policies relating to pensions, benefits 
or shareholdings for the 2012 financial year. 
52
REMUNERATION REpORT | governance RemuneR ation R epo Rt Co NTINUED shareholding policy 
T o ensure that executive directors’ and other senior executives’ interests 
are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon, the 
Committee requires the Chief Executive to build and maintain a 
shareholding in the Company of at least two-times base salary and  
any other executive directors to build and maintain a shareholding of at 
least one-times base salary over a reasonable time frame, which would 
normally be five years. o ther Management Board executives are 
actively encouraged to build a significant shareholding in the Company 
over a similar time frame. 
service contracts 
The Company’s policy on service contracts is that executive directors’ 
contracts should be terminable on not more than one year’s notice.  
In the event of early termination of a director’s service contract, the 
Company would be required to pay compensation reflecting the salary 
and benefits to which the director would have become entitled under 
the contract during the notice period. Alternatively, the Company  
may, at its discretion, pay a predetermined termination sum in lieu  
of notice. In the event of early termination, the Committee will give 
careful consideration to what compensation should be paid taking into 
account the circumstances and the responsibility of the individual to 
mitigate loss.

at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. No compensation was paid to him 
on retirement.
a lan t homson’s arrangements as Chairman 
Alan Thomson, who succeeded Bob Lawson as Chairman on  
10 November 2010, serves the Company under a letter of appointment. 
This provides for an annual fee at the rate of £230,000. This level of fee 
was set by the Committee following a market review of the remuneration 
of company chairmen in similar groups to Hays. T aking this into account, 
the Committee determined there should be no change to the Chairman’s 
remuneration for the 2012 financial year.
n on-executive directors 
The payment policy for non-executive directors is to pay the market 
rate to secure persons of a suitable calibre for a group of this size.  
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by  
the Board. The responsibility of the role and international nature of  
the Group are fully considered when setting the fee levels, along with 
external benchmarking market data on the chairmanship of, and 
participation in, Board committees. There has been no increase in  
the fees paid to the non-executive directors in the year.
The non-executive directors’ fees are non-pensionable and non-
executive directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive plans. 
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the 
Company, but are appointed to the Board under letters of appointment 
for an initial three-year period. They have agreed to annual retirement 
and reappointment by shareholders at the Company’s annual general 
meeting and appointments can be terminated immediately by the 
Company. Letters of appointment are available for review from the 
Company Secretary and a pro forma letter of appointment can be 
viewed on the Company’s website, haysplc.com. 
policy on external appointments 
The Company permits its executive directors to hold one external 
non-executive directorship and all fees paid are retained by the director. 
Alistair Cox is a non-executive director of 3i Group plc and Paul 
Venables is a non-executive director of Wincanton plc. The directors 
retained fees of £57 ,000 and £45,000 respectively from these external 
appointments during the year under review.
ts R performance 
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s 
shares compared to the FTSE 350 index over a five-year period. The 
graph shows the total shareholder return generated by both the 
movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period  
of dividend income. The Committee considers that the FTSE 350 is the 
appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this 
index throughout the period. 
This graph has been calculated in accordance with the requirements  
of Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports ) Regulations 2008.

Notes:
(1)  The directors were required to defer a minimum of 25% and could voluntarily defer up to 100% of their pre-tax bonuses for the 2007/08 financial year into shares subject to a three-year 
restricted period. Matching shares were awarded, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year period. Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to the 
directors in respect of any matching shares that vest. The market price per share on the award date was 73.5 pence. See also Note 4.
(2)  The directors were required to defer 70% of their bonuses for the 2008/09 financial year into shares subject to a three-year restricted period. The award in respect of 45% of the bonus 
earned was deferred on a pre-tax basis and is addressed in the first table opposite. Messrs Cox and Venables elected to defer 25% of the bonus on a post-tax basis under the Deferred 
Annual Bonus plan for a three-year period. Matching shares were awarded in respect of this element, which are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year 
period ending on 30 June 2012 based on earnings per share, international net fees and cash conversion, in equal proportions. Dividend equivalent shares will be transferred to the 
directors in respect of any matching shares that vest. The market price per share on the grant date was 107.4 pence. 
(3)  Mr P Venables was required to defer a minimum of 25% and could voluntarily defer up to 100% of his pre-tax bonus for the 2006/07 financial year into shares subject to a three-year 
restricted period to 30 June 2010. The Committee awarded matching shares to Mr Venables, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over the three-year period based on 
Cumulative EPS (75%) and Cumulative International Net Fees (25%). The performance conditions were not met and consequently the matching share award lapsed on 21 September 
2010. The market price per share at the award date was 142.0 pence. See also Note 4.
(4)  o n 26 March 2010, in order to enable directors’ underpinning shares to be held on a post-tax basis (and as fully described in the 2010 Remuneration Report), the Committee accepted 
the waiver of certain deferred rights and granted vested special awards for no monetary consideration (representing the original awards plus dividend equivalent shares accrued up  
to the grant date of the special awards). A proportion of the shares under the special awards were sold on 26 March 2010 at a price of 108.7 pence per share to pay the tax and national 
insurance due. The special awards otherwise continue to be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as applied to the original awards. The matching awards and associated 
conditions remain unchanged. At the end of the restricted period on 27 September 2010, the vested special award granted to Mr Venables over 64,403 shares was released (see also 
Note 3 regarding the lapse of the related matching share award). The market price per share on the award date of the vested special award was 108.8 pence.

(1)  A Restricted Share Award equivalent to the market value of £600,000 was awarded to Mr A R Cox on joining the Company. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions summarised 
below, the award vested in three tranches over the first three years of Mr Cox’s employment, starting from 1 July 2007. o ne-sixth of the award vested each year subject to continuing 
employment and one-sixth vested each year if the Group PBT growth exceeded RPI + 3% measured from the 30 June 2007 base year. o n 26 March 2010, Mr Cox waived that element 
of the final tranche that related to continuing employment (64,516 shares), which was replaced by a vested special award over the same number of shares subject to the same 
restrictions in order to enable the shares to be held on a post-tax basis (and as fully described in the 2010 Remuneration Report). Mr Cox settled the tax and national insurance due 
from his own funds calculated by reference to the market value of the shares on the vested special award date of 108.8 pence. o n 2 September 2010, the vested special award over 
64,516 shares was released to Mr Cox, the continued employment criterion having been met. The second criterion based on Group PBT growth in respect of the remaining element  
of the final tranche over 64,516 shares was not met. Consequently, this element of the final tranche lapsed on 2 September 2010. The market price per share on the grant date of the 
original Restricted Share Award was 160.3 pence and of the vested special award was 108.8 pence.

Long-term incentive performance conditions 
Details of the performance conditions for the Company’s active long-term incentive plans are shown in the tables below.
Performance levels between threshold, target (where relevant) and maximum are graduated on a straight-line basis.
Notes: 
(1)  For awards prior to 2009, Cumulative EPS is the consolidated fully-diluted earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 for each financial year cumulative 
over the performance period. For awards from and including 2009, Cumulative EPS is the consolidated basic earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 
for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. Goodwill impairments arising from acquisitions prior to 30 June 2006 are excluded from the EPS calculation. 
Cumulative International Net Fees is the net fees of the Company excluding UK and Ireland, Australia and New Zealand for each financial year cumulative over the performance  
period. International net fees arising from any acquisition made from the start of the relevant performance period are excluded from the Cumulative International Net Fees calculation. 
Cumulative Cash Conversion is the operating cash flow of the Company, after deducting net capital expenditure (excluding capital expenditure incurred on the Group’s strategic  
IT projects), stated as a percentage of operating profit before exceptional items, for each financial year cumulative over the performance period. The Remuneration Committee  
may make adjustments to the calculations of Cumulative EPS and Cumulative Cash Conversion, including taking account of unusual or non-recurring items that do not reflect 
underlying performance. 
(2)  The EPS element is subject to an underpin whereby the EPS element will vest only if the Committee is satisfied that operating profit performance outperforms that of a comparator 
group of companies over the performance period.
(3)  For the purpose of ranking the performance of Hays shares against a sector group of comparator companies, TSR for each company is the difference between the average market 
values (in sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month periods prior to the start and the end of the performance period divided 
by the average market values (in sterling terms) of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. 
The TSR for Hays shares is ranked against the respective TSR performances of Adecco SA, CDI Corporation (2010 award onwards), Kelly Services Inc, Manpower Inc, Michael Page 
International plc, MPS Group Inc (2009 award only as subsequently acquired by Adecco SA and replaced by CDI Corporation within the comparator group for later awards), Randstad 
Holdings NV, Robert Half International Inc, Robert Walters plc, SThree plc and USG People NV. Vesting will be subject to satisfactory financial performance over the performance 
period as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
(4)  The lower and upper EPS growth range for the first year of the performance period was based on consensus forecast for that year (being a range of +/- 4% around the consensus 
forecast EPS of 4.9 pence per share). The EPS growth for the remaining two years requires additional growth of between RPI +4% and RPI +12% per annum to achieve threshold and 
maximum vesting respectively.

Independent Aud ItorS’ report on the ConS ol IdAted  
FInAn CIAl St Atement S
Independent Auditors’ r eport to the members of h ays plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Hays plc for  
the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprises the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework  
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to  
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
(APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
o pinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
30 June 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
o pinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements.
matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
•	 the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report  
in relation to going concern;
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board  
of directors’ remuneration.
o ther matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial 
statements of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 and on the 
information in the directors’ Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on  
the basis of the accounting policies and methods of computation

policies are consistent with those applied in the preparation of  
the accounts for the year ended 30 June 2010 with the exception

There have been no alterations made to the accounting policies

but which are only effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 July 2011. These new pronouncements are listed below:

The directors are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption  
of these standards, amendments and interpretations.
The Group’s principal accounting policies adopted in the 
presentation of these financial statements are set out below  
and have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
2 Significant accounting policies
a Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union  
and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on  
the historical cost basis.
b Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
effect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the review of the business on pages 1 to 25. The financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the 
financial review on pages 26 to 29. In addition, notes 19 to 20 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements include details of the Group’s 
treasury activities, long-term funding arrangements and exposure  
to financial risk.
The Group has sufficient financial resources which, together with 
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient 
sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial commitments and any proposed 
dividends, and the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.  
After making enquiries the directors have formed the judgement  
that at the time of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. financial statements |

2 Significant accounting policies continued
c Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which power to 
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group whereby the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their  
fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The financial statements 
consolidate the accounts of Hays plc and all of its subsidiaries. The 
results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are 
included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
d turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, 
VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Turnover arising from the placement of permanent candidates  
is recognised at the time the candidate commences full-time 
employment. Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting 
obligations where employees do not work for the specified 
contractual period.
Turnover arising from temporary placements is recognised over the 
period that temporary workers are provided. Where the Group is 
acting as a principal, turnover represents the amounts billed for the 
services of the temporary workers, including the remuneration costs 
of the temporary workers. 
Where Hays acts as principal in arrangements that invoice on  
behalf of other recruitment agencies, turnover represents amounts 
invoiced and collected on behalf of other recruitment agencies, 
including arrangements where no commission is directly receivable 
by the Group.
Where the Group is acting as an agent, turnover represents 
commission receivable relating to the supply of temporary workers 
and does not include the remuneration costs of the temporary 
workers. Where the Group receives income in respect of payroll 
processing, only the service fee element of this service is recognised 
as turnover.
e n et fees
Net fees represent turnover less the remuneration costs of 
temporary workers for temporary assignments and remuneration  
of other recruitment agencies. For the placement of permanent 
candidates, net fees are equal to turnover.
f exceptional items
Exceptional items as disclosed on the face of the Consolidated 
Income Statement are items which due to their size and non-
recurring nature have been classified separately in order to draw 
them to the attention of the reader of the financial statements and 
to show the underlying profits of the Group.
g f oreign currencies
On consolidation, the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  
of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated  
into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income  
and expense items are translated into sterling at average rates of 
exchange for the period. Any exchange differences which have 
arisen from an entity’s investment in a foreign subsidiary, including 
long-term loans, are recognised as a separate component of equity 
and are included in the Group’s translation reserve.
On disposal of a subsidiary, any amounts transferred to the 
translation reserve are included in the calculation of profit and loss 
on disposal. All other translation differences are dealt with in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of  
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate.
h r etirement benefit costs
The expense of defined benefit pension schemes and other post-
retirement employee benefits is determined using the projected-unit 
credit method and charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 
as an expense, based on actuarial assumptions reflecting market 
conditions at the beginning of the financial year. Actuarial gains  
and losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. Past 
service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that benefits 
have vested or, if not vested, on a straight-line basis over the period 
until the benefits vest.
The Group has chosen under IFRS 1 to recognise in retained earnings 
all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 July 2004, the date  
of transition to IFRS. The Group has chosen to recognise all actuarial 
gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 July 2004 in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting  
from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present 
value of available refunds and reductions in future contribution to 
the scheme.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an 
expense as they fall due. financial statements |
65
Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011
i share-based payments
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed  
upon market-based performance criteria is determined at the date  
of grant and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, taking 
account of the estimated number of shares that will vest.
The fair value of all share-based remuneration that is assessed upon 
non-market-based performance criteria is determined at the date of 
the grant and recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income 
Statement over the vesting period, based on the number of shares 
that are expected to vest. The number of shares that are expected  
to vest is adjusted accordingly to the satisfaction of the performance 
criteria at each period end.
The fair values are determined by use of the relevant valuation 
models. All share-based remuneration is equity settled.
j Borrowing costs
Interest costs are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Arrangement fees incurred in respect of borrowings are amortised 
over the term of the agreement.
k taxation
The tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated 
Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences, at rates 
that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which to offset 
the deductible temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise where there is a difference between the 
accounting carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and 
the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and 
associates where the Group is unable to control the timing of the 
distribution, and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
reverse in the future.
l Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of purchase 
consideration less the fair value of the identifiable tangible and 
intangible assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a business the attributable amount of goodwill is 
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 
(1 July 2004) has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill arising 
on acquisitions prior to 1 July 1998 was written off direct to reserves 
under UK GAAP. This goodwill has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
m intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are 
stated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value as at the 
date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any provision 
for impairment. The directors review intangible assets for indications 
of impairment annually.
Internally generated intangible assets are stated in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet at the directly attributable cost of creation of the 
asset, less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets are 
amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives up to  
a maximum of 10 years. Software incorporated into major ERP 
implementations that support the recruitment process and financial 
reporting process is amortised over a life of up to seven years. Other 
software is amortised between three and five years.
n Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful working 
lives of the assets, after they have been brought into use, at the 
following rates:
Freehold land – No depreciation is provided
Freehold buildings – At rates varying between 2% and 10%
Leasehold properties –  The cost is written off over the unexpired 
term of the lease
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
o t rade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value after appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts have been 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement where there  
is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. financial statements |

2 Significant accounting policies continued
p c ash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and current 
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject  
to insignificant risk of changes in value.
q t rade payables
Trade payables are measured at fair value.
r Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
amount of the proceeds received, net of direct-issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct-issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual 
basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and  
are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
s derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses certain derivative financial instruments to reduce  
its exposure to interest rate movements. The Group does not hold  
or use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that  
are designated and effective as hedges of future cashflows are 
recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group uses a range of 80% to 125% for hedge effectiveness,  
in accordance with IAS 39, and any relationship which has 
effectiveness outside this range is deemed to be ineffective and 
hedge accounting is suspended.
The fair values of interest rate swaps represent the replacement 
costs calculated using observable market rates of interest and 
exchange. The fair value of long-term borrowing is calculated by 
discounting expected future cash flows at observable market rates.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income statement in the same period in which the hedged item 
affects net income.
 Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time any cumulative gain  
or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is either 
retained in equity until the firm commitment or forecasted 
transaction occurs, or where a hedge transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, is immediately credited or expensed in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
t leases
Leases where a significant portion of risks and rewards of  
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into  
an operating lease are recognised on a straight-line basis over  
the lease term.
u Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and when the amount can be reliably estimated. If the 
effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. 
3  Critical accounting judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
r etirement benefit obligations
Under IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’, the Group has recognised  
a pension deficit of £11.9 million (2010: £67.1 million). A number  
of assumptions have been made in determining the pension  
deficit and these are described in note 22 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Goodwill impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. In performing 
these tests assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates 
and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash flows of 
income-generating units. These assumptions are set out in note 14  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Provisions in respect of disposed businesses
As described in note 23, provisions in respect of disposed businesses 
have been made. In assessing the adequacy of these provisions 
estimates are made of probable cash outflows in the future.
Provisions in respect of recoverability of trade receivables
As described in note 18, provisions for impairment of trade 
receivables have been made. In reviewing the appropriateness of 
these provisions, consideration has been given to the ageing of the 
debt and the potential likelihood of default, taking into account 
current economic conditions. financial statements |

4 Segmental information 
a doption of ifrs 8, o perating segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on 
the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate 
resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United 
Kingdom & Ireland.
The Group’s continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
n et fees and operating profit from continuing operations
The Group’s Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of 
revenue in internal reports. This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment 
agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments. The Group’s 
Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources. The reconciliation of turnover  
to net fees can be found in note 6.

The Group does not report items below operating profit by segment in its internal management reporting. The full detail of these items can 
be seen in the Group Consolidated Income Statement on page 59.
There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Group’s turnover by geographic origin and destination.
n et trade debtors
For the purpose of monitoring performance and allocating resources from a balance sheet perspective, the Group’s Management Board 
monitors trade debtors net of provisions for impairments only on a segment by segment basis. These are monitored on a constant currency 
basis for comparability through the year. These are shown below and reconciled to the totals as shown in note 18.

major customers
Included in turnover is an amount of approximately £540 million (2010: £278 million) which arose from sales to the Group’s largest customer, 
which were generated within the United Kingdom & Ireland. This is the only customer to exceed 10% of the Group’s turnover, however as it 
includes a significant element of remuneration of temporary workers and remuneration of other recruitment agencies, it represents less than 
2% of the Group’s net fees. financial statements |

5 exceptional items
During the year, the Group recognised an exceptional credit of £4.1 million in relation to the following items:
On 1 April 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) announced its judgement in respect of Hays’ appeal against the level of the fine 
imposed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in September 2009. The fine was reduced from £30.4 million to £5.9 million and has been  
paid in full, bringing this matter to a close. The effect of the reduction in fine has been recognised in the Income Statement as a non-cash 
exceptional credit of £24.0 million (2010: non-cash exceptional charge £29.0 million). 
As described in note 14 the Group has recognised a non-cash exceptional charge of £10.0 million resulting from the impairment of the 
carrying value of goodwill in relation to the UK Healthcare business which was acquired in February 2006.
The Group incurred restructuring costs in the UK of £9.9 million comprising redundancy costs of £7.0 million, onerous property leases  
of £2.1 million and a non-cash fixed asset write-down of £0.8 million. The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of £2.8 million.
In the prior year the Group incurred an exceptional charge of £41.4 million, comprising £29.0 million in respect of the OFT fine and  
£12.4 million restructuring costs principally in the UK. The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of £3.5 million.
The cash impact of the exceptional items during the year was as follows:
Cash paid in respect of current year exceptional items was £4.0 million with a further £5.1 million cash outflow expected in the future, 
primarily in the financial year to 30 June 2012.
Cash paid in respect of prior year exceptional items was £11.4 million, comprising £6.0 million OFT fine including interest, and prior year 
restructuring costs of £5.4 million.
The non-cash impact of the current year exceptional credit and cash paid in respect of the prior year exceptional charge of £19.5 million are 
shown together in the Cash Flow Statement.

The results of the discontinued businesses which have been included in the Consolidated Income Statement were as follows:
(In £s million) 2011 2010
Profit from disposal of business assets 0.5 1.1 
Profit before tax 0.5 1.1 
Tax credit 1.3 1.6 
Profit from discontinued operations after tax 1.8 2.7 
The profit from disposal of business assets of £0.5 million relates to the cash receipts from loan notes arising from the disposal of the Hays 
US Home Delivery business, which were previously fully provided against.
The tax credit of £1.3 million relates primarily to a write-back of tax-related accruals that were established when the Group completed the 
disposal of non-core activities between March 2003 and November 2004 which in the light of subsequent events were no longer required.
Cash inflows generated from discontinued operations were the following:

Additions during the year 1.4 9.9 
Impairment losses in the year (10.0) – 
At 30 June 183.5 185.6 
The additions of £1.4 million during the year represent the final deferred consideration in relation to the James Harvard acquisition in respect 
of earnout payments. 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill 
might be impaired. Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit (CGU), 
including goodwill, with the recoverable amount. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates. The operating 
profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management, and management uses estimated pre-tax discount 
rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The Group prepares cash flow 
forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on  
the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates. The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which  
are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% (2010: 3.0%), reflecting long-term wage inflation driving 
fee growth. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12.0% (2010: 12.0%). 
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated.
Before impairment testing, the carrying value in respect of the RSG acquisition in the United Kingdom & Ireland group of CGUs was  
£15.3 million. Due to current market conditions in the UK Healthcare sector in which the business operates, the Group has revised its  
cash flow forecasts for this CGU. The RSG CGU has therefore been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an 
impairment loss against goodwill of £10.0 million. The recoverable amount is considered to be in line with its value-in-use.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the other CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis  
has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill. This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to  
be possible by management, and included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in long term growth rate between  
0% and 5%. The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the other CGUs. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority either on the same taxable entity or entities which intend to settle current tax assets or liabilities on a net basis.
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of £43.3 million (2010: £33.2 million) available for offset against future profits,  
of which £5.8 million relate to United Kingdom capital losses, £7.8 million relate to otherwise unrelievable EU losses potentially relievable 
against United Kingdom profits, £21.3 million relate to overseas losses, and £8.4 million relate to United Kingdom losses. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of these losses (2010: £nil). Of these unrecognised tax losses, £0.1 million is due to expire between 2012 
and 2018 and £43.2 million is unlikely to expire in the short term.
The United Kingdom Government has announced that the rate of corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.  
If this change had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2011, the Group’s deferred tax asset would have been reduced by £0.1 million and 
£0.1 million charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
provided is £2.8 million. The temporary differences at 30 June 2011 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries 
where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the 
jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.

c redit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances  
for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience,  
is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group reduces risk through its credit control process and by 
contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoices on their behalf. The Group’s exposure is 
spread over a large number of customers.

A description of the Group’s treasury policy and controls is included in the Financial Review on page 29.
interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts. At 30 June 2011 the Group had drawn down 
£185.0 million (2010: £145.0 million) from its unsecured revolving credit facility. During the period the Group entered into interest rate 
derivatives to partially hedge this risk. The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June was £(0.7) million.
The interest rate risk profile of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows:
(In £s million) 2011 2010
Floating rate – sterling 189.9 151.9 
The floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.
c ommitted facilities
On 1 July 2010 the Group renewed its unsecured revolving credit facility and in the process reduced the facility from £460 million to  
£300 million. The new facility expires in January 2014. The financial covenants under the facility require the Group’s interest cover to  
be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio (net debt to EBITDA) to be no greater than 2.5:1. The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet 
mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%. 
At 30 June 2011, £115.0 million of the committed facility was undrawn.
interest rates
The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:
2011 2010
Bank borrowings 2.5% 1.0%
maturities of bank loans and overdrafts
The maturities of borrowings are as follows:

Within one year 4.9 151.9 
More than one year 185.0 –
189.9 151.9 
f air values of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts
The fair value of financial assets and bank loans and overdrafts is not materially different to their book value due to the short-term maturity 
of the instruments, which are based on floating rates.
c apital management
The Board’s current priorities for the Group’s free cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the Balance Sheet and 
to support a sustainable dividend policy. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its capital to 
ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents (note 19), bank loans and 
overdrafts (note 20) and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed in notes 24 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
f oreign currency risk
The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2011.

22  r etirement benefit obligations
Within the UK the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes. The majority of overseas 
arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context  
of the Group results.
a u K defined c ontribution scheme
The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001. Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees 
and, for eligible employees, from the employer. Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on  
the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of £3.0 million (2010: £2.3 million) represents employer’s contributions 
payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan. Contributions of £0.3 million (2010: £0.2 million) were outstanding at the end of the year.  
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
b u K defined Benefit s chemes
(i)   The Hays Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees’ length of service and final 
pensionable pay. It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001. An RPI cap on 
pensionable pay was implemented in 2007 in respect of active members. The Scheme is funded through a legally separate trustee 
administered fund.
(ii)  The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who 
were subject to HMRC’s earnings cap on pensionable salary.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is carried out every three years. The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays 
Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009. Following this valuation, the deficit was £150 million and a revised deficit funding 
schedule of £12 million per annum, subject to a 3% per annum fixed uplift over a 12-year period, was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010. 
During the year the Group made a contribution of £12 million to the Hays Pension Scheme (2010: £1.2 million) in accordance with the agreed 
deficit funding schedule.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2011 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension 
Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, and employee of Hymans Robertson LLP. The key assumptions used at 30 June 
2011 are listed below.
ias 19 accounting valuation
Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows:
•	 scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date;
•	 scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality 
corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability; and
•	 actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained 
earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The principal long-term assumptions are as follows:
% 2011 2010
RPI inflation 3.6 3.4 
CPI inflation 2.9 n/a
Discount rate 5.5 5.4 
Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 3.6 
Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.6 3.4 
Expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets 6.1 6.0  financial statements |
80
n ote S to the Con Sol IdAted F In An CIAl St Atement S CONTINUED
22  r etirement benefit obligations continued
The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return 
for each asset class and the proportions of each asset class held at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on 
pension scheme assets within the net financial charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin to 
future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that a 65-year-old male 
current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows:
(In £s million) 2011 2010
Expected return on pension scheme assets 22.7 21.0 
Interest on pension liabilities (23.9) (27.7)
Net financial charge (1.2) (6.7)

Member contributions 0.4 0.6 
Benefits and expenses paid (14.1) (16.0)
Fair value of plan assets at 30 June 440.5 378.2 
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to higher than expected asset returns and the increase in employer contributions. The 
actuarial gain due to changes in assumptions comprises a gain on account of deferred revaluation becoming linked to CPI rather than RPI  
in line with the statutory change for this benefit, offset by a loss due to the decrease in the net yield (discount rate versus RPI inflation rate).
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected return at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date was as follows:

440.5 6.1% 378.2 6.0%
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to 30 June 
2011, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the rate of return on  
AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other assets classes in which the portfolio is invested and the 
expectations for future returns of each assets class at 30 June 2010. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based  
on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio. This resulted in the selection 
of the 6.0% assumption for the year ended 30 June 2011. financial statements |

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.
Performance share Plan (PsP) and deferred a nnual Bonus (daB)
The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive directors and 
approximately 360 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders. PSP awards are discretionary 
and vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period 
with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between 
short-term and long-term performance through the deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 57. financial statements |

On 20 May 2011, the Group acquired 3 Story Software LLC, a vendor management software company based in Connecticut USA for a 
consideration of up to £6.0 million. The company was acquired for the purposes of providing and developing software services to Hays 
Group companies, to further enhance the service the Group provides to its larger corporate clients. This transaction has been accounted  
for by the purchase method of accounting.

The fair value has been calculated using the value-in-use of the asset to the Group after considering the alternative cost to develop an 
equivalent software solution or redevelop existing workflow systems. 
The deferred consideration arrangement requires determined milestone targets to be delivered at agreed timescales over a two-year period. 
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration 
arrangement is up to £2.0 million.
Acquisition related costs included within administrative expenses amount to £0.2 million.
Due to the timing of the acquisition 3 Story Software LLC did not contribute any material revenue or profit to the results of the Group for the 
period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year Group turnover for the year would have increased by £1.3 million 
and Group profit would have increased by £0.4 million. financial statements |

CompAny F InAn CIAl St Atement S
Independent Auditors’ r eport to the members of h ays plc
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Hays 
plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise the Company 
Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 16. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,  
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as  
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
r espective responsibilities of directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK  
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all  
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report.
o pinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 30 June 2011;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
o pinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
•	 the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•	 the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year 
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent Company financial statements.
matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters  
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law  
are not made; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of Hays plc for the year ended 30 June 2011.

1 basis of preparation
a a ccounting basis
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented  
as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and Law.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented.
The Company’s principal accounting policies adopted in the 
presentation of these financial statements are set out below  
and have been consistently applied to all periods presented.
b c ash flow statement and related party disclosures
The results, assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of Hays plc, which are publicly 
available. Consequently, the Company has taken exemption from 
preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised) 
‘Cash Flow Statements’. The Company is also exempt under the 
terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing related 
party transactions with entities that are part of the Group.
c investments
Shares in subsidiaries are valued at cost less provision for impairment. 
d Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided on a straight-line basis over the anticipated useful working 
lives of the assets, after they have been brought into use, at the 
following rates:
Plant and machinery – At rates varying between 5% and 33%
Fixtures and fittings – At rates varying between 10% and 25%
e deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which result 
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right 
to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when 
they crystallise. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of  
items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in 
periods different from those in which they are included in financial 
statements. Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of 
subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit 
these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
f Pension costs
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating 
profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on 
settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff 
costs. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss account if the benefits have vested. If the benefits have not 
vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until 
vesting occurs. The interest cost and the expected return on assets 
are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or credits adjacent 
to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in 
the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses. 
The main defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the 
scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee 
administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair 
value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the 
projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the 
current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent 
currency and term to the scheme liabilities. The actuarial valuations 
are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance 
sheet date. The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the 
related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets 
on the face of the Company Balance Sheet.
g employee share option schemes
The Company operates a number of employee share option 
schemes. All equity-settled, share-based payments are measured  
at fair value at the date of grant. All equity-settled, share-based 
payment schemes are dealt with in the Balance Sheet by including 
them within total equity shareholders’ interests in accordance with 
FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payments’.
h dividends
Dividends are recognised in the period that they are declared  
and approved.

10  r etirement benefit obligation 
The Company is the sponsoring employer for all of the Hays defined benefit pension schemes and recognises the full liability on its Balance 
Sheet. Under FRS 17 the actual cost of providing pensions to the Company is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred during the 
year, net of costs paid by subsidiary companies.
The pension cost charged to the Company’s profit and loss account is £0.7 million (2010: £0.5 million).
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin to 
future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments (minus 0.5 years for male pensioners). This assumes that a 65-year-old male 
current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The movement in the deficit during the year is analysed below:
(In £s million) 2011 2010
Deficit in the scheme brought forward (67.1) (109.2)
Current service cost (3.8) (4.1)
Contributions 16.5 5.5 
Net financial return (1.2) (6.7)
Actuarial gain 43.7 47.4 
Deficit in the scheme carried forward (11.9) (67.1)
Based on actuarial advice, the financial assumptions used in calculating the scheme’s liabilities under FRS 17 are:

f uture profile of h ays Pension scheme
The Hays Pension Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 July 2001. The age profile of the active membership will rise  
over time and hence the future service cost (as a percentage of annual salaries) is also likely to rise. The Group has considered the impact  
of the FRS 17 deficit in respect of the Group, its employees and pensioners. In the context of the prudent funding structure of the Group,  
the Group is in a strong position to manage this long-term liability to the satisfaction and benefit of all stakeholders.
The amount of deficit funding contributions which are expected to be paid to the scheme during the financial year to 30 June 2012  
is £12.4 million.

Capital gains t ax base cost of hays Shares 
Following the demerger of DX Services on 1 November 2004, the 
original base cost of your Hays plc shares for Capital Gains Tax 
purposes should be allocated between your Hays plc shares and  
the DX Services plc shares that you received as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57%/DX Services plc shares 10.43%. 
For example, suppose you held 100 Hays plc shares for which the 
base cost is £100. Immediately after the demerger, you held 100 
Hays plc shares and 5 DX Services plc shares. The £100 cost should 
be allocated between these shares as follows: 
Hays plc shares 89.57% x £100 = £89.57, or £0.90 per share  
DX Services plc shares 10.43%x £100 = £10.43, or £2.09 per share.
If you are in any doubt about the allocation of the base cost between 
the shares of the two companies, you should consult your tax adviser.

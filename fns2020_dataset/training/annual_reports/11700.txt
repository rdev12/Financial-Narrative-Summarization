Strategic Report
Chairman’s Letter
Following a turnaround 
year in 2012, 2013 has 
been a year of further 
recovery and expansion.
Dear Shareholder
Following a turnaround year in 2012, 
2013 has been a year of further recovery 
and expansion; the business has made 
good progress on its Strategic Plan, 
delivered very strong financial results, 
and through both organic developments 
and the acquisition of Aurora, has 
created a platform for further growth. 
Pace is making headway to becoming  
a “great technology company”.
2013 has been a year of tangible 
progress, with the Group achieving 
a 22.5% increase in adjusted EBITA 
through top-line growth, improved 
revenue mix, supply chain efficiency 
and increased operational efficiency. 
The Group delivered strong free cash flow 
of $209.0 million, a second consecutive 
year of over 100% cash generation. This 
sustainable strong free cash flow model 
gives the Company confidence and 
flexibility to identify and invest in both 
organic and acquisitive opportunities 
which will deliver long-term value to 
our customers and our shareholders.
Strategic review
Consistent with my statement last year, 
the Group remains focused on the 
evolution and execution of its Strategic 
Plan that we communicated to the 
market in November 2011:
 — transform core economics: improve 
our operating performance and 
leverage scale;
 — PayTV hardware leadership: build 
on our position as a world leading 
set-top box (STB), residential gateway 
and media server company; and
 — widen out in software, services 
and integrated solutions: accelerate 
“widening out” by pursuing opportunities 
to provide software and services assets 
for current and new customers.
Aurora acquisition
The acquisition of Aurora represents 
an important evolution in the Strategic 
Plan and enhances our strategy to grow 
a broader platform across Hardware, 
Software & Services. Aurora will allow Pace 
to expand beyond our existing business 
and build deeper and more embedded 
relationships with our customers by taking 
us beyond the home and into network 
infrastructure. Network operators have an 
ever-increasing need to cost-effectively 
deliver increased bandwidth to their 
customers and Aurora provides equipment 
that fulfils this need in an efficient way. 
The Company believes that Aurora will 
strengthen Pace’s position as a market-
leading solutions provider for the PayTV 
and broadband industries. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank our 
shareholders for supporting this acquisition 
and believe it will deliver significant value 
to Pace and our customers in 2014 
and beyond.
Pace is now over two years into the 
Strategic Plan and although there is still 
a lot of work to be done and opportunity 
for improvement, we are well on track 
against the targets and objectives set at 
the time. The addition of Aurora further 
strengthens the Board’s confidence that 
we can achieve our mid-term target 
of 9% operating margin
7
 in 2015.
Dividends
The strong performance in 2013 and 
the trajectory of the business give the 
Board confidence to continue building on 
the progressive dividend policy that was 
introduced in 2009. Therefore the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 
3.66 cents per share, giving a full year 
dividend of 5.49 cents per share, a 22% 
increase on 2012. The dividend reflects 
the robust ongoing cash generation 
of the business.
If you have any comments on my letter 
or any part of the Annual Report, I would 
be delighted to hear from you either by 
writing to me at Pace or by email at  
Allan.Leighton@pace.com.
Yours sincerely
Allan Leighton

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Mike Pulli
Chief Executive Officer
We have delivered a strong 
set of financial results, 
made good progress 
on our strategic plan, and 
created a platform for 
continued improvement.
2013 has been a year of further recovery 
and expansion for Pace. We have delivered 
a strong set of financial results, made good 
progress on our Strategic Plan, and created 
a platform for continued improvement in 
operating performance over the next 
few years.
Key highlights of the year
The Strategic Review we undertook in 2011 
highlighted that we operate in sustainable 
and profitable markets where we have 
differentiated capabilities; however, the 
Group must execute on its three primary 
objectives to take advantage of the 
opportunities for improving both the level 
and quality of its earnings. We remain 
focused on these objectives and have 
made good progress both in delivering 
strong results in 2013, building on the 
recovery made in 2012 and paving the 
way for improvement in 2014 and beyond.
This progress is reflected in 2013 revenues 
of $2,469.2 million, up 2.7% on 2012, and 
adjusted EBITA of $193.6 million, up 22.5% 
on 2012, equivalent to 7.8% of revenues, 
up 1.2ppt on 2012.
In addition to the various organic 
developments Pace has undertaken 
over the past two years, the acquisition of 
Aurora is a key step in the evolution of Pace 
and enhances our strategy to grow a broader 
platform across Hardware, Software 
& Services.
Strategic Plan
Transform core economics
Continued focus on efficiency has delivered 
further sustainable overhead savings and 
the transformation and rationalisation of our 
supply chain was completed, delivering 
significant benefits in 2013 and beyond.
 — Underlying operating expenses, 
excluding the impact of IAS 38 
accounting, reduced by $16.2 million 
(5.8%) in 2013. This was due to further 
efficiency programmes across the 
business and the impact of a full year’s 
run-rate of the changes implemented 
in 2012. Whilst reducing the overall 
operating expenses, Pace has continued 
to invest further in Software & Services 
and other growth opportunities. 
 — The transition to a consolidated 
Electronics Manufacturing Services 
(EMS) partner footprint was completed 
in the year. All new products are being 
developed through this model and the 
financial and operational benefits are 
now being realised and will drive 2014 
profitability. Further supply chain 
transformation activities are underway 
that will deliver value in 2014 and beyond.
Summary 
 — Increased operating 
profits through top-line 
growth, improved gross 
margins and increased 
operational efficiency.
 — Strong cash flow generation; 
$209.0 million free cash flow 
(108% of adjusted EBITA) and 
sustainable cash flow business 
model in place.
 — Announced highly 
accretive acquisition of 
Aurora Networks, Inc., a leading 
provider of optical transport and 
access network solutions.
 — The Board is confident that 
the Company will make 
further progress in 2014:
 — Revenues expected 
to be c. $2.7 billion
 — Operating margin expected 
to be c. 8.5%
 — Strong cash flow will 
continue and Pace expects 
to generate at least 
$185 million of free  
cash flow.

Strategic Report
Continued
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Strategic Plan continued
Transform core economics continued
 — Cash generation was strong 
throughout the year; free cash flow was 
$209.0 million (2012: $182.7 million), 
due to further re-alignment of working 
capital and tight management of capital 
expenditure. This enabled Pace to repay 
its debt in full prior to the end of the 
financial year
8
 and achieve a net 
cash position of $33.0 million at 
31 December 2013 (net debt at 
31 December 2012: $163.3 million).
The various components of the 
Transform Core Economics stream of the 
Strategic Plan are now well embedded 
across the Company and are delivering 
significant financial and operational benefits. 
However, the Company believes significant 
opportunities remain for further improvement 
and will pursue areas of inefficiency and 
relentlessly strive to continually improve 
operating effectiveness across all areas 
of the business.
PayTV hardware leadership
Pace was reconfirmed as the market 
leader in PayTV hardware; global number 
one in set-top boxes

, Media Servers
10
 
and Telco
11
 Gateways:
 — STB and Media Server revenues 
were up 8.4% to $1,979.6 million in 
2013 (2012: $1,826.0 million), driven 
largely by the high demand for media 
servers in H1 2013 in North America 
and a number of new deployments 
in H2 2013.
 — The move to media servers and 
whole home solutions is continuing 
at speed across the globe. Demand 
from customers in North America 
was strong with media servers now 
comprising over 28% of shipments 
in that market (2012: 14%). In the year, 
Pace announced a large number 
of media server wins beyond North 
America, with the first international 
deployment at Get TV in Norway and 
a number of deployments planned in 
2014 including Liberty Global, Foxtel 
and Telenet. We have a strong media 
server pipeline and anticipate increased 
demand across the globe in 2014 
and beyond.
 — IPTV is a segment in which Pace has 
previously been under-represented. 
In 2013, Pace began shipping 
Mediaroom enabled Digital Video 
Recorders (DVRs) and STBs to AT&T 
and CenturyLink, two of the largest 
telecommunications providers 
in North America, and Telefonica 
in Brazil and Chile.
 — Demand for traditional STBs remains 
strong; in the year, Pace achieved next 
generation hardware wins at a number 
of long-standing tier one customers 
and announced a multi-product deal 
with Charter Communications, a major 
cable operator in North America that 
Pace had not previously supplied 
product to.
 — Gateway revenues were down 
19.9% to $375.8 million in 2013 
(2012: $469.4 million) as the impact 
of expected dual sourcing at a major 
customer was only partially offset 
by new wins at customers such 
as GVT and MTS.
Pace was confirmed as the market leader 
in PayTV hardware and global number 
one in set-top boxes, media servers 
and telco gateways.
8 A new five year $150 million revolving credit facility plus a five year term loan of $310 million to finance the acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc. was put in place on 6 January 2014.

Widen out in software, services 
and integrated solutions
Pace achieved a number of key wins 
and deployments across all areas of our 
Software & Services offerings and has 
a strong pipeline into 2014. Revenues in 
this area increased 5.4% to $113.8 million 
in 2013 (2012: $108.0 million). 
 — The Pace Elements software platform 
continues to gain significant traction as 
part of an advanced integrated solution 
with a number of wins in the year, 
deliveries underway for wins achieved 
in 2013 at Foxtel and other customers, 
and deployments at customers such 
as Telefonica Vivo, Sky New Zealand, 
Altibox and Elisa. The Elements platform 
is currently being used by 3.3 million 
subscribers which are expected 
to increase in 2014. 
 — Pace Elements is also a key part of 
our integrated solutions for emerging 
markets; we have a number of operators 
deployed with this solution (Pace 
hardware, software and Latens 
Conditional Access System) in India 
and have an encouraging pipeline 
in Southern Asia, Central and Eastern 
Europe and CIS.
 — The Pace ECO Service Management 
Suite continues to evolve with a number 
of new modules launched in the year 
to provide increased functionality and 
wins at customers such as Telstra, 
Telmex and Bell Aliant. These wins 
build on a strong global customer 
footprint that includes AT&T and BSkyB. 
The ECO platform is currently supporting 
our customers to manage over 30 million 
devices across the world.
 — The Latens software-based 
Conditional Access and Digital Rights 
Management (DRM) business made 
good headway, with a 52% growth in 
the number of subscribers the product 
is deployed to in 2013, on both Pace 
and other vendors’ hardware and 
wins at a number of customers 
including Telenet.
12  EBITDA calculated as income from operations plus depreciation and amortisation (US GAAP as reported).
Aurora acquisition
The acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc. for a headline consideration 
of $310 million (on a debt and cash free basis), plus a further 
$13 million relating to tax benefits to be recovered over the three 
years post acquisition, was announced on 23 October 2013 and 
completed on 6 January 2014. The headline consideration represents 
a historic EV/EBITDA
12
 multiple of 10.5x before synergies and 8.2x after 
expected annual run-rate synergies, based on the results of Aurora 
for the twelve months to 31 March 2013.
What does Aurora do?
Aurora is a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced, 
next-generation optical transport and access network solutions for 
broadband networks that support the convergence of video, data 
and voice applications. With a leading presence in products that are 
increasingly important for cable operators as they fulfil consumers’ 
constant demand for ever-increasing bandwidth, the acquisition 
further strengthens Pace’s relationships with its customers. 
What does Aurora bring to Pace?
 — Positions Pace to support operators’ and consumers’ constant 
demand for cost-effective delivery of ever-increasing bandwidth.
 — Highly profitable and growing business with blue-chip customer 
base and market-leading positions, serving over 200 customers in 
50 countries, including all of the top ten cable operators in the US.
 — Strong management team that has delivered 30 straight quarters 
of profitability.
 — Creates deeper and more embedded relationships with key customers.
 — Cross-sell opportunity across customer footprints.
 — Further widens Pace out beyond PayTV Customer Premise 
Equipment (CPE).
How is the integration going?
Aurora is now operating as a standalone Strategic Business Unit (SBU) 
retaining the Aurora brand and managing a separate P&L to retain 
focus and accountability for business performance, whilst leveraging 
Pace Group common services. As such, revenue and adjusted EBITA 
contribution for Aurora Networks will be broken out as a separate 
SBU in subsequent statutory reports. The integration of Aurora into 
the Pace structure is progressing well. Based on current progress, 
the Company is confident that the integration of Aurora will be complete 
by the end of Q2 2014, and is highly confident that the expected 
synergies stated at the point of the acquisition will be achieved; 
$4 million realised in 2014 at a cost of $4 million and $8 million 
run-rate saving realised in 2015 at no additional cost.
A further update on integration and Aurora trading will be provided in 
the Q1 2014 Interim Management Statement on Thursday 24 April 2014.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Business performance
Pace has a broad global footprint within 
which individual markets are at varying 
stages of development. Overall, the markets 
in which Pace operates have remained 
strong during the year, with PayTV 
continuing to show varying levels of 
subscriber and Average Revenue Per 
User (ARPU) growth despite perceived 
disruptive threats from new over-the-top 
(OTT) market entrants and economic 
uncertainty in emerging markets. On a 
global basis, digital PayTV subscribers 
are expected to grow at c.2.8% compound 
annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2014 
and 2017
13
.
North America
North America is the largest, most 
advanced and most profitable market for 
digital PayTV and broadband technology 
in the world, with over 112 million PayTV 
subscribers and close to 104 million 
broadband connections
14
. We believe 
the digital PayTV market in North America 
will remain flat in terms of the number 
of subscribers for the foreseeable future, 
with gross subscriber acquisition being 
offset by customer churn between the 
various PayTV offerings.
Pace is the only vendor to all of the 
largest operators in each of the cable, 
satellite and telco markets; serving 
Comcast, DirecTV and AT&T respectively. 
In each case Pace supplies its most 
advanced in-home technology. In addition, 
Pace also serves a large number of other 
cable and telco operators in both 
the USA and Canada.
Total revenues in North America 
increased by 16.9% to $1,540.5 million 
in 2013 (2012: $1,317.6 million), driven 
largely by strong demand from DirecTV 
and Comcast for Media Server products 
in H1 2013, and new wins in H2 2013. 
These confirmed Pace’s continued position 
of technological leadership in our sector 
and we remain confident about the long-term 
strength of the market for our products 
in North America.
Gateway revenues decreased by 
22.3% to $348.6 million, reflecting a 
strong comparative period in 2012 and 
the dual sourcing of supply by a major 
customer. The Company believes overall 
market demand remains strong for high 
performance residential gateways from 
telcos and internet service providers (ISPs) 
to effectively deliver high quality 
triple-play services.
Software & Services revenues in 
North America decreased by 18.9% to 
$68.1 million reflecting a decreased call 
volume in the customer care business. 
The Software & Services revenue in 
North America is primarily comprised of 
customer care, ECO Service Management 
software and professional services.
Latin America
The Latam market is a large, diverse and 
fast growing market, within which Pace 
serves satellite, cable, IPTV and hybrid 
operators across the region, with Brazil, 
Mexico and Argentina the key markets.
The overall market has expanded 
significantly over the last few years and 
continues to display strong subscriber 
growth with a predicted 10% CAGR from 
2014 to 2017
15
. This growth is led by a 
number of factors including greenfield 
markets, deregulation in Brazil, the 2014 
World Cup and 2016 Olympics in Brazil 
and a number of growing PayTV operators 
in the region. Demand for PayTV is strong 
at all levels of technology: standard 
definition (SD) to support analogue to 
digital transition, high definition (HD) 
continues to grow to meet growing 
consumer expectations and operators 
are starting to develop high-end personal 
The markets in which Pace operates 
have remained strong during the 
year with PayTV continuing to show 
subscriber and ARPU growth.

video recorders (PVRs) and media 
servers for rollout in 2014 and beyond.
Pace revenue in Latam decreased by 4.3% 
to $358.4 million (2012: $374.4 million) 
due to a reduction in demand from a key 
customer. Pace continues to have a diverse 
business in Latam; Pace provides product 
to eight of the ten largest PayTV providers 
in the region and has made good progress 
in widening out the solutions provided in 
this market. In 2013 Pace achieved its first 
deployments of the following products: 
Gateway solutions at GVT, integrated 
solution of Pace Elements and Pace 
hardware with Vivo Telefonica and ECO 
Service Management at OnDigital in Brazil. 
The Company expects to make further 
progress with these solutions and remains 
confident that Latam offers strong revenues 
and profitability and is strategically well 
positioned in key markets and customers 
in the region.
Europe
Europe remains a fragmented and highly 
customer specific territory for Pace. 
Revenues in Europe were down by 19.5% 
to $323.9 million (2012: $402.4 million), 
however, sustainable improvements in 
product mix ensured that the Company 
generated the same profit on the lower 
revenue base. The decrease in revenue 
was mainly due to a reduced win rate of 
new products in 2011, which adversely 
affected revenue in 2012 and 2013. Sales 
performance is improving and we have 
achieved key wins in new and existing 
customers which we expect will lead 
to growth in H2 2014. 
Single-digit growth is predicted in the 
underlying European market
16
; however, 
we expect significant growth in the media 
server segment of the market as operators 
in Europe follow the innovation of North 
American operators. Pace launched its first 
media server outside of North America at 
Get TV in Norway and has been awarded 
media server contracts with a number 
of operators including Liberty Global.
In addition, the Group is seeing 
increasing demand from operators for 
integrated solutions, incorporating Pace 
hardware and software assets, that can 
be quickly deployed and that enable 
the operator to innovate and differentiate 
in highly competitive markets. Pace is 
focused on developing opportunities 
in this area of the market, and has 
a number of projects underway.
Rest of World
Rest of World covers a diverse range of 
markets which are developing at different 
rates: the highly developed markets in 
Australia, New Zealand and South East 
Asia, the “fast following” markets in the 
Middle East and Africa, and the fast 
growing Indian market. Revenues in Rest 
of World are down 20.3% to $246.4 million 
(2012: $309.0 million). This decrease was 
due to reduced demand from a number 
of large customers as they prepared for 
new product launches in H2 2013 and 
2014. However, despite the reduced 
revenue, profitability increased in the 
year reflecting improved product mix.
India is a key growth market for Pace 
as the country experiences large PayTV 
subscriber growth and the transition from 
analogue to digital progresses in the cable 
sector. During the year, Pace secured 
deals with a number of operators for 
its integrated solution for cable which 
combines STB hardware, Elements 
software platform and Latens 
Conditional Access System.
The Company remains confident that 
these markets will provide significant 
growth opportunities both at the high end 
of the market with HD, PVR and media 
server products, and also as the uptake 
of PayTV and digitisation continues in 
emerging greenfield markets allowing 
Pace to increase its footprint with new 
customers through software and 
integrated solutions.

Progress against Strategic Plan over the last two years
 — A key target outlined in Pace’s 
Strategic Plan is a 9% operating 
margin in 2015.
 — In 2013, Pace achieved an 
operating margin of 7.8%.
 — This performance is above initial 
expectations and reinforces the 
Board’s confidence of achieving 
the target of 9% operating margin 
in 2015.
Transform Core Economics:
The Transform Core Economics stream has been very 
successful and delivered more value than initially 
expected. However, we believe there remains significant 
opportunity for further improvement in both the existing 
Pace business and also the Aurora acquisition.
PayTV Hardware:
This stream has performed well with leadership positions 
achieved in STBs, Media Servers and DSL Gateways and 
key wins with existing and new customers. There is further 
opportunity for Pace to improve in this area by winning 
business at new customers and in currently under-
penetrated markets, and by remaining at the forefront of 
technology and innovation with our current customers. 
Widen Out:
There is significant opportunity for Pace to make further 
progress in widening out its offering in software, networks, 
services and integrated solutions. This will be achieved 
through the development of current offerings and 
capabilities, the successful integration and progress 
of Aurora and potential acquisition opportunities.

Risk Management and Principal Risks
The following are the key risks and uncertainties relevant to the business of the Group:
Risk Potential impact Mitigations
Strategic risks
Customers and markets
Revenue concentration from a small number 
of large customers.
Customer orders are typically short to mid-term 
commitments with no long-term guarantee.
 
Volatile revenue trends.
Procedures are in place to monitor the 
financial and operating strength of customers.
Suppliers
The Group works on long lead times for 
component supply and manufacture.
Concentration on a small number 
of manufacturing partners.
Lack of flexibility.
Loss of product availability.
Procedures are in place to monitor the 
financial and operating strength of suppliers.
The Group uses dual or multi source 
suppliers where possible to mitigate 
the risk.
Financial risks
Royalties
The Group’s products incorporate 
third party technology.
Inadvertent actions may expose the Group to the 
risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights.
Cash outflow.
Reputational damage.
The Audit & Risk Committee and Board 
receive a semi-annual report from the 
General Counsel regarding royalty claims 
under negotiation. All material claims are 
monitored by outside legal counsel.
The Group operates a system of internal control and risk management in order to provide 
assurance that it is managing risk whilst achieving its business objectives. The Group’s 
systems are designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, significant business 
risks, including the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, but can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
No system can fully eliminate risk and therefore the understanding of operational risk is central to the management process within Pace. 
The long-term success of the Group depends on the continual review, assessment and control of the key business risks it faces. 
To enable shareholders to appreciate what the business considers are the main operational risks, they are briefly outlined below.
Robust risk management.

Strategic Report
Financial Review
The financial position of Pace improved 
significantly in 2013. This improvement is 
reflected in the 2.7% increase in revenue 
(to $2,469.2 million), a 5.8% reduction in 
underlying operating costs, a 22.5% increase 
in adjusted EBITA (to $193.6 million) and 
the repayment of the Company’s 
external debt.
Pace has become a more profitable 
Company with operating margin increasing 
from 6.6% to 7.8%. In addition, free cash 
flow generation has been strong in 2013 
at $209.0 million (108.0% of adjusted 
EBITA), due to the continued benefits 
of robust cash management and further 
re-alignment of working capital (which 
reduced by 46.4% to $58.4 million). As a 
result of the strong cash flow, the existing 
debt facility was repaid in full and ahead 
of schedule (nil gross debt) and a cash 
position of $33.0 million was achieved 
at the close of the year (net debt of 
$163.3 million at 31 December 2012).
New five year facilities were put in place 
on 6 January 2014 to fund the acquisition 
of Aurora Networks, Inc. and the Company 
is well placed and efficiently funded 
to develop and grow in 2014.
Group trading results
Group revenue of $2,469.2 million 
(2012: $2,403.4 million) increased by 
2.7%, driven by strong demand for next 
generation media server product in the 
first half of the year. In the year, 57% of 
revenue was generated by the top three 
customers (2012: 49%), a reduction from 
59% in H1 2013 as customer concentration 
decreased, a trend expected to continue 
into 2014.
The financial position 
of Pace improved 
significantly in 2013.
Summary 
 — Pace has become a more 
profitable Company with 
operating margin increasing 
from 6.6% to 7.8%.
 — Free cash flow generation 
has been strong in 2013 
at $209.0 million (108.0% 
of adjusted EBITA).
 — New five year facilities were 
put in place on 6 January 
2014 to fund the acquisition 
of Aurora Networks, Inc. and

 — The full year proposed dividend 
increases 22% to 5.49 cents 
per share (2012: 4.50 cents 
per share) – reflecting the 
Board’s confidence in the 
outlook for the Company and 
its improving financial position.

Gross profit of $448.2 million 
(2012: $433.0 million) is up 3.5%. 
Gross margin percentage in 2013 was 
18.2%, an increase of 0.2ppt on 2012, 
reflecting the supply chain transformation 
and an improved revenue mix as Pace 
broadens out its customer base.
Operating costs pre-exceptional charges 
and amortisation of other intangibles 
decreased by $20.3 million (7.4%) to 
$254.6 million (2012: $274.9 million). 
The underlying decrease, excluding the 
impact of IAS 38 accounting adjustments, 
is a decrease of $16.2 million (5.8%) 
to $261.9 million (2012: decrease of 
$27.8 million). Considerable progress has 
been made in improving operating efficiency 
across the Company during the year; 
the cost savings reflect a scaling down of 
corporate resources and a re-organisation 
of the Americas and International business 
units over the past two years.
Adjusted EBITA was $193.6 million 
(2012: $158.1 million), an operating 
margin of 7.8% against 6.6% in 2012.
Exceptional costs of $12.2 million 
(2012: $12.5 million) relate to restructuring 
costs in the Americas and International 
SBUs and corporate ($4.2 million), the 
acquisition process for Aurora Networks, Inc. 
($6.9 million) and aborted acquisition 
costs incurred in the year ($1.1 million).
Amortisation of other intangibles, 
primarily reflecting the annual charge 
for intangible assets acquired in 2010, 
was $42.6 million (2012: $51.8 million).
Segmental analysis
The Group operates through SBUs. 
Pace Americas and Pace International 
are deemed by the Board to represent 
operating segments under IFRS 8, 
with revenues and adjusted EBITA 
in the table above.
Movements in revenue are described 
above. Although not wholly consistent, 
revenues in North America belong 
primarily to the Americas SBU, revenues 
in Europe and Rest of World belong 
largely to the International SBU, and 
revenues in Latam belong to both the 
Americas and International SBUs.
Pace Americas’ revenue increased by 
$237.6 million (16.5%) in 2013 reflecting 
strong demand for next generation media 
server products, and operating margin 
decreased to 9.1% (2012: 10.0%). The 
performance of Pace International improved 
with adjusted EBITA contribution increasing 
15.5% despite revenue decreasing by 
18.1%, and operating margin improved 
from 7.6% to 10.7%.
Other amounts include central and 
unallocated costs and other immaterial 
SBUs, which are operating segments 
that are allowed to be aggregated 
under IFRS 8.
The loss in Other decreased by 26.8% 
to $(42.6) million (2012: $(58.2) million).
Finance costs
Net financing costs of $8.0 million 
(2012: $13.7 million) reflect a reduction 
in average net debt during the period. 
Costs incurred include the amortisation 
of facilities fees of $2.1 million, $0.3 million 
of which were accelerated during the 
year as debt was repaid in full.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax was $130.8 million 
(2012: $80.1 million), an increase of 
$50.7 million (63.3%) on 2012. 
Taxation
The tax charge of $34.1 million 
(2012: charge $21.7 million) results from 
the full year effective tax rate of 26.1% 
(2012: 27.1%). The rate reduction reflects 
lower corporate tax rates in the UK. The cash 
cost of corporate tax was $23.8 million, 
12.3% of adjusted EBITA (2012: $23.8 million, 
15. 1% of adjusted EBITA).
Profit after tax
Profit after tax was $96.7 million 
(2012: $58.4 million), an increase 
of $38.3 million (65.6%) on 2012. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was 
31.2 cents (2012: 19.4 cents), an increase 
of 60.8%. Adjusted basic EPS, which 
removes the tax affected impact of the 
exceptional costs and amortisation of other 
intangibles to reflect underlying performance, 
is 44.3 cents (2012: 35.1 cents), an increase 
of 26.2%.

Financial Review
Balance sheet
Intangible development expenditure assets 
increased by $8.1 million (2012: $2.4 million 
increase) due to continued investment in 
product development and an increased 
number of development projects.
Tangible fixed assets decreased in 
the period as the depreciation charge of 
$25.0 million exceeded capital expenditure 
of $21.6 million. The $21.6 million capital 
expenditure reflected a reduction of 
$1.0 million from 2012 and is in line 
with the expected ongoing level for 
the Company.
Working capital
Net working capital was reduced by 
$50.6 million (46.4%) to $58.4 million 
in the period as commercial terms with 
suppliers were re-aligned to match 
Pace’s working capital cycle, inventory 
control processes strengthened and a 
more focused approach was taken to 
cash collection from our customers.
Inventory reduced by $25.3 million 
(13.9%) to $156.8 million during 2013, 
reflecting the improved controls in the 
business. Average stock turn in the year 
was 8.4 times against 8.7 times in 2012, 
due to the additional inventory required 
to support the EMS rationalisation.
Debtor days increased by seven days 
to 60 days at December 2013 reflecting 
a change in sales mix. The quality of the 
Company’s customer base is excellent 
and our customers pay us to terms.
Creditor days increased from 83 days 
to 90 days at 31 December 2013 
contributing a one-off benefit to cash 
flow of c. $29 million.
Debt
The cash balance of $33.0 million at 
31 December 2013 compares to a net 
debt of $163.3 million at the end of the 
prior year. During the year two scheduled 
facility re-payment instalments were 
paid of $37.5 million each in June and 
December 2013 and the remaining 
$75.0 million of the term loan taken out 
to buy 2Wire, Inc. was repaid ahead of 
plan on 31 December 2013. In addition 
the outstanding balance of the revolving 
credit facility was fully repaid in the year 
(31 December 2012: $90. 1 million drawdown).
The Company believes that a net debt to 
EBITDA ratio of not more than two times 
is an appropriate and efficient capital 
structure for Pace.
New borrowing facilities were put in place 
on 6 January 2014 to finance the purchase 
of Aurora Networks, Inc.: a five year 
$310 million term loan, plus a five year 
revolving credit facility of $150 million 
to give the Company flexibility around 
investment and working capital. Post the 
Aurora acquisition, the proforma net debt 
to EBITDA ratio is just above one times.
Liquidity and cash flows
A key performance measure for the 
Group is free cash flow, which was 
$209.0 million (2012: $182.7 million) and 
represented 108.0% of adjusted EBITA 
(2012: 115.6%). Cash outflows from 
interest payable net of interest received 
were $5.9 million (2012: $11.1 million). 
Cash invested in acquisitions in the form 
of deferred consideration paid was $Nil 
(2012: $15.7 million). Cash spent on 
exceptional costs was $10.4 million 
(2012: $17.9 million).
The Board is confident that the Company 
will continue to be strongly cash flow 
positive in 2014 and that the Company’s 
committed bank facilities are more than 
sufficient to meet its short to medium-term 
funding needs.
Foreign currency
In the period, approximately 81.2% of the 
Group’s revenues were denominated in USD 
(2012: 76.5%), 7 .7% in Euros (2012: 10.0%), 
10.7% in Brazilian Real (2012: 13.0%) 
and 0.4% in Sterling (2012: 0.5%). 
The impact of non-USD revenues, costs 
and overheads continues to be addressed 
through Pace’s foreign exchange 
hedging strategy.
Critical accounting policies
The directors consider that the Group has 
the following critical accounting policies, 
as they require the use of estimates 
and are subjective in their nature:
 — revenue recognition;
 — impairment;
 — provisions; and
 — intangible assets.
Details of accounting policies and 
estimates can be found within the notes 
to the Financial Statements.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 3.66 cents per share 
(2012: 3.06 cents per share), an increase 
of 20% in line with the progressive dividend 
policy introduced in 2009. The full year 
proposed dividend increases 22% to 
5.49 cents per share (2012: 4.50 cents 
per share). The increase reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook for the Company 
and its improving financial position. Pace 
will look to continue to pay a progressive 
dividend off this new rebased level.
Dividends will be paid in Sterling, equivalent 
to 2.192 pence per share. This is based 
on an exchange rate of £ = $1.670, being 
the closing rate applicable on 3 March 2014, 
the date on which the Board resolved 
to recommend the final dividend. The 
proposed dividend will be payable on 
4 July 2014 to shareholders on the 
register on 6 June 2014.

Methodology
The Company prepares an annual 
Responsible Business Report, and in 
2013 independent review and assurance 
with regards to the content of this Report 
was provided by Atkins, in accordance 
with the principles set out in AA1000 
Accountability Principles Standard 2008. 
The Report covers the following areas:
 — Environment
 — Products
 — Facilities
 — Supply Chain
 — Community
 — People
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regulations 2013. These 
sources fall within our consolidated 
financial statements. We do not have 
responsibility for any sources that are not 
included in our consolidated statements. 
We have used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition), data gathered 
to fulfil our requirements under the CRC 
Energy Efficiency scheme, and emission 
factors from UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2014. 
As this is the first year of Defra 
Greenhouse Gas Mandatory Reporting a 
comparison year is not required. The year 
of 2013 will act as a baseline year for 
future reporting.

The Company has maintained certification 
to the international management standard 
ISO 14001 at its Saltaire, Boca Raton, 
Bangalore, Paris, Tempe and San Antonio 
sites. The Group Environmental Policy has 
been applied to all Pace sites worldwide.
The Company is a signatory to the 
European Code of Conduct on Energy 
Efficiency of Digital TV Service Systems 
(EU Code of Conduct), ENERGY STAR 
Program Requirements for STBs and 
MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance 
Standard). Pace is committed to ensure 
that all products are designed to minimise 
energy consumption through its “Design 
for Environment” programme.
Supply chain
Pace is a member of the Electronic Industry 
Citizen Coalition (EICC) and applies the 
EICC Code of Conduct in its business.
A programme of assessment and 
auditing is maintained at the regular 
business review meetings held with 
the Group’s principal suppliers.
Charitable and community support
The Group has an established Charitable 
Donations Committee comprising 
employees based at the Group’s premises 
in the UK and the USA. The Committee 
considers all requests for charitable 
and community project assistance from 
employees within a financial budget 
and criteria approved by the Board 
on an annual basis.
The Group’s support through the 
Committee is focused on the local 
geographical area of Pace’s premises 
in the UK, France, India and the USA 
as well as the charitable and community 
initiatives of Group employees.
During the year, requests for assistance 
satisfying the above criteria received 
financial support amounting to $120,189 
in total.
The participation of employees of 
the Group in community and charitable 
activities outside work hours has been 
encouraged by the provision of funds 
to match individual sponsorship raised.
Pace has continued as sponsor of the 
Ahead Partnership’s education strand of 
business engagement in the UK’s West 
Yorkshire region. This three year 
commitment has enabled the Ahead 
Partnership to develop and roll out their 
Make the Grade business education 
partnership model in West Yorkshire.
_1_PIC_ar13_Front_[SM_MR].indd   22 20/03/2014   12:22:24 Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Pace plc 23
In addition, Pace has partnered with 
Teach First to support the science, 
technology, engineering and maths 
(STEM) teachers in Yorkshire and the 
Humber. Pace will fund the provision of 
personal development coaches to Teach 
First participants in their second year of 
teaching. Teach First recruits, trains and 
supports teachers working in schools 
in low income communities to raise the 
achievement, aspirations and access 
to opportunity of children from low 
socio-economic backgrounds. 
Employment policies
The directors recognise the importance of 
the Group’s employees to its success and 
future development and are committed to 
providing an environment that will attract, 
motivate and reward high quality employees. 
The Group continues to invest in a range of 
internal and external initiatives to promote 
employee development.
Employees are kept informed of matters 
affecting them as employees and factors 
affecting the performance of the Group 
through regular employee meetings/
briefings and regular written news 
briefings distributed electronically.
Diversity and inclusion
The Group welcomes applications 
for employment from all sectors of 
the community and promotes equality 
of opportunity in employment regardless 
of age, sex, sexual orientation, disability 
or ethnic origin. It is the Group’s policy 
that training, career development and 
promotion opportunities should be 
available to all employees. In the event 
that an employee becomes disabled, 
the Group makes reasonable adjustments 
where any aspect of premises or working 
practices puts such a disabled employee 
at a substantial disadvantage compared 
with a non-disabled employee.
We believe that diversity is an essential 
part of how we do business and meet the 
needs of our global customer base. We 
operate in 18 countries, employing 
C.2,000 people and working with 
customers and suppliers from a broad 
range of backgrounds and cultures.
The charts above show the gender split 
at different levels within the Group, as at 
31 December 2013.
Health and safety
Each SBU in the Group has an established 
Health and Safety Committee made up 
of health and safety representatives, the 
designated health and safety officer and 
other persons with expert knowledge 
who review health and safety issues 
relevant to the Group’s business. Other 
safety-related committees also conduct 
periodic reviews of specific work practices. 
These actions complement the UK 
Government’s “Health, Work, Wellbeing” 
(HWW) initiative which has been adopted 
and implemented by the Company.
Part of the HWW incorporates return 
to work programmes and the Group’s 
operations in Saltaire, Pace West* and 
Pace East*, France, Brazil and India have 
adopted similar policies. Each division 
incorporates, where appropriate, their 
ergonomic risk assessments. The Group’s 
businesses in India, the UK, Pace West 
and Pace East provide training for first aid, 
fire evacuation and fire wardens.
Pace West undertakes earthquake 
training and Pace East undertakes 
hurricane training. All of these initiatives 
are backed up by appropriate risk 
assessments. “Tool-box talks”, short 
presentations on specific aspects of 
health and safety, are also published 
on the Group’s intranet and shared 
between different parts of the Group.
The number of workplace accidents 
during the year for Saltaire was six. 
Outside the UK, there were 16 accidents 
in the Pace West and Pace East operations, 
three in France, six in Brazil and none in 
India. None of these accidents was regarded 
as serious by the relevant local Health 
and Safety Committee.
Human rights
The Group does not have a specific 
human rights policy at present, but does 
apply human rights considerations to 
the way it does business, for example, 
through our practices in relation to equal 
pay, the right to form and join trade unions, 
and our health and safety, supplier and 
anti-corruption policies. The Group will 
continue to review whether a specific 
human rights policy is needed in the future 
over and above our existing policies.
*  Pace West is represented by the 2Wire businesses, 
and Pace East is predominantly our office 
in Boca Raton, Florida.

the principal matters reserved for the 
Board are set out below:
 — setting the overall strategic direction 
and oversight of the management 
of the Company;
 — recommending or declaring dividends;
 — approval of the Company 
consolidated financial statements;
 — approval of major corporate 
transactions and commitments;
 — succession planning and 
appointments to the Board and senior 
management remuneration; 
 — review of the Group’s overall corporate 
governance arrangements including 
systems of internal controls and risk 
management; and
 — approval of the delegation of authority 
to the Chief Executive Officer and the 
terms of reference of all Committees 
of the Board.
Where appropriate, matters are 
delegated to a Committee which will 
consider them in accordance with its 
terms of reference.
Details of each Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the Pace website 
at www.pace.com
The Board of directors currently 
comprises two executive and four 
non-executive directors who bring a wide 
range of skills and experience to the Board. 
Biographical details of all directors are 
to be found on pages 24 and 25. The 
Chairman, Allan Leighton, is mainly 
responsible for the running of the Board, 
ensuring, together with the Company 
Secretary, that it receives timely and clear 
information appropriate to enable it to 
discharge its duties. The responsibilities 
of the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Pulli, 
are to focus on running the Group’s 
business and implementing Group 
strategy. The Chief Executive Officer 
is assisted in managing the business 
on a day-to-day basis by the Executive 
Committee as further described below.
All the non-executive directors (other than 
the Chairman) are deemed by the Board 
to be independent and the Chairman was 
deemed independent on his appointment, 
as required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In addition, the Board 
has designated Pat Chapman-Pincher as 
the Senior Independent Director. All directors 
have access to the advice and services 
of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and are able to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties, 
if necessary. Each of the directors submit 
themselves for re-election on an annual 
basis. New directors receive a programme 
of tailored induction on joining the Board 
and all directors are offered the opportunity 
to continually update their skills and 
knowledge by attending external training 
events. The Company has in place 
procedures to deal with directors’ conflicts 
of interest and the Board is satisfied that 
these procedures operate effectively.
The Board normally meets at least eight 
times each year. It reviews the strategic 
direction of the Group and meets with 
other senior executives and employees 
within the Group as required during the 
year. The Chairman holds meetings with 
the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present on a 
regular basis. It is the policy of the Board 
to undertake a formal review and 
evaluation of its performance including 
the performance of its committees, the 
Chairman and individual directors on an 
annual basis. This is generally concluded 
by written feedback in standardised form 
from each director to the Chairman or the 
Senior Independent Director in the case 
of appraisal of the Chairman. The Board 
will consider appointing an independent 
facilitator for the evaluation process at 
least once every three years and chose 
not to do so in 2013.
Board committees
The Board has established the following 
committees, each of which has written 
terms of reference specifying its authority 
and duties and copies of which are publicly 
available on the Company’s website.
The Audit & Risk Committee 
is comprised of independent 
designated non-executive directors 
Pat Chapman-Pincher, Amanda Mesler 
and John Grant, who is the Chairman 
of the Committee. John Grant was 
previously Group Finance Director 
of a listed business and is considered 
by the Board to have the necessary 
recent and relevant financial experience 
for his role as Chairman. 
Details of the role and of the primary 
responsibilities of the Audit & Risk Committee 
are explained on pages 29 to 31
The Executive Committee is chaired 
by Mike Pulli as Chief Executive Officer. 
The Committee generally meets once a 
month and ensures that the strategy, 
plans and policies previously agreed or 
delegated by the Board are implemented.

The Executive Committee comprises 
two executive directors together with 
the senior executives shown in the 
table above.
The Remuneration Committee 
is comprised of Allan Leighton and 
independent designated non-executive 
directors John Grant, Amanda Mesler 
and Pat Chapman-Pincher, who is 
the Chairman of the Committee. The 
Committee is responsible for setting the 
remuneration of the executive directors 
and other members of the Executive 
Committee and wider Executive Team, 
including making recommendations 
regarding the grant of share incentive 
awards. The members of the Committee 
have no personal interest, other than 
as shareholders, in the matters to be 
decided, no potential conflicts of interest 
arising from cross-directorships and no 
day-to-day involvement in the running of 
the business. Where directors do hold 
other external positions, these are not 
considered to have any impact on their 
duties for the Group. 
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance of the executive directors 
and other members of the Executive 
Committee as a prelude to recommending 
their annual remuneration, bonus awards 
and long-term share incentive awards to 
the Board. The final determinations are 
made by the Board as a whole but no 
director plays a part in any discussions 
concerning their own remuneration. 
There are no agreements between the 
Company and its directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs as a result 
of a takeover bid.
The Remuneration Report of the directors 
to shareholders, including the remuneration policy 
of the Company, is set out on pages 33 to 46
The Nomination Committee is 
comprised of non-executive directors 
Pat Chapman-Pincher, John Grant 
and Amanda Mesler and is chaired by 
Allan Leighton. Its principal purpose is 
to consider and make recommendations 
to the Board regarding the appointment 
of new directors. The Nomination 
Committee meets at least once a year 
or as required. 
Code compliance
As referred to on page 38 the Company 
granted an appointment share award 
to Allan Leighton on his appointment as 
Non-executive Chairman in 2011 and this 
currently remains unvested. Save in respect 
of this Appointment Share Award, the 
directors believe that the Company has 
complied throughout the year with the 
UK Corporate Governance Codes for 
2010 and 2012, as revised and adopted 
by the Financial Reporting Council. The 
Board confirms that it has established 
the necessary procedures designed to 
maintain a sound system of internal 
controls and that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks faced 
by the Company. 
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee comprises the two executive 
directors together with the following senior executives 
(who are deemed to be Persons Discharging Managerial 
Responsibility under the UK Listing Rules).
 — Anthony Dixon  General Counsel 
and Company Secretary
 — Shane McCarthy President, Pace International
 — Tim O’Loughlin President, Pace Americas
In addition the following senior executives attend 
meetings of the Executive Committee on a regular basis: 
 — Jon Cobb President, Software & Services

Audit & Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce this report of 
Pace’s Audit & Risk Committee for the 
year ended 31 December 2013. This reflects 
the new provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) now in 
effect regarding narrative reporting.
The Committee’s duties are described 
later in this report and reflect the Code’s 
recommendations. More broadly, the 
Committee sees its role as being to ensure 
the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting 
and the robustness of its internal controls 
and risk management processes. 
In relation to the integrity of financial 
reporting, we adopt prudent accounting 
policies and practices, with areas of 
judgement being subject to specific 
review by the Committee. We work 
closely with the Company’s external 
auditors to agree areas of risk of potential 
misstatement and to make sure these are 
addressed as part of the audit process.
While the ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and Accounts remains with the 
Board, in view of the new provisions 
in the Code regarding financial and 
business reporting, the Board requested 
that the Committee advise on whether it 
considers the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and to provide the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Risk management at Pace is a Board 
responsibility, but the Audit & Risk 
Committee is tasked by the Board with 
ensuring the risk management process 
is fit for purpose. Our systems of internal 
control are designed to focus resource 
on the principal risks to the business which 
are summarised within the Strategic 
Report. We have a well-developed budget 
process, with regular forecast updates 
and Board reviews of performance.
During the year the Committee has been 
assisted by the Chief Financial Officer, 
the Vice President of Group Finance 
and in particular the internal auditors, 
BDO LLP. I have also met separately 
with the Company’s auditors during 
which meetings I have discussed their 
views on the strength and depth 
of financial reporting and internal control 
processes operating within the Group. 
Set out in the following pages is the 
Committee’s report on its activities during 
the year, including a description of how 
the Committee dealt with those areas of 
financial reporting that require particularly 
careful review and judgement. None of 
these areas has proved critical in 
preparing the Group’s financial 
statements this year.
I hope you will find this report helpful in 
understanding the work of the Committee. 
Yours sincerely
John Grant
Chairman of the Audit  
& Risk Committee

Audit & Risk Committee Report
Internal audit
The Company’s Vice President of 
Group Finance, who has direct access 
to the Audit & Risk Committee primarily 
through the Chairman of the Committee, 
oversees an internal audit function 
provided by external qualified 
auditing professionals.
The Audit & Risk Committee 
reviews annually the arrangements 
for internal audit and during the year 
the Committee re-appointed BDO LLP 
(BDO) to act as internal auditors, 
performing an agreed programme of 
internal audits in collaboration with the 
Company’s Vice President of Group 
Finance and senior management. BDO 
attended and presented their reports 
to each of the Audit & Risk Committee 
meetings during the year.
The Committee has, amongst other 
things, considered the quality of reporting 
to the Committee and impartiality of the 
internal auditors and has concluded that 
the effectiveness of Internal Audit during 
the year was satisfactory.
External audit
The Audit & Risk Committee 
has satisfied itself that the external 
auditors, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG), 
acted independently of the Group. 
Previous appointments of KPMG and 
the extent of other work undertaken 
by it were considered inter alia 
in this regard.
It is the Committee’s opinion confirmed in 
discussions with KPMG that there were 
no limitations imposed by management 
on KPMG whilst performing their duties 
during the review period.
The Committee, in consultation with the 
Group’s executive management, agreed 
to the terms of the KPMG engagement 
letter, audit plan and budgeted audit fees 
for the 2013 financial year.
A formal framework governs the process 
through which the Group’s auditors are 
considered to render non-audit services. 
The Committee has approved a policy in 
relation to the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors and the nature 
and extent of non-audit services that the 
external auditors could provide within the 
scope of the policy during the year.
Details of the external auditors’ total fees 
including non-audit fees of $100,000 paid 
to KPMG during the year are set out in 
Note 4 to the Financial Statements.
External audit appointment
The Committee reviews and makes 
recommendations with regard to the 
re-appointment of the external auditors. 
In making these recommendations, the 
Committee considers auditor effectiveness 
and independence, partner rotation and 
any other factors which may impact the 
external auditor’s re-appointment. 
The external auditors are required to 
rotate the audit partner every five years. 
The most recent change occurred in 
the year ended 31 December 2012 and 
therefore partner rotation is due in the 
year ending 31 December 2017. 
The current external auditors, KPMG 
Audit plc, were first appointed in 1996 
and the external audit has not been 
formally tendered since then. 
Having completed the activities outlined, 
the Committee remains confident that the 
effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditors is not impaired in any 
way. There are no contractual restrictions 
on the choice of external auditor. KPMG 
Audit plc has notified the company that, 
as a result of their intention to instigate 
an orderly wind-down of the legal entity, 
they are not seeking re-appointment. 
Accordingly, a resolution proposing 
KPMG LLP to be appointed as external 
auditors will be put to shareholders at 
the 2014 Annual General Meeting. 
Continued
Role and key responsibilities
The terms of reference of the 
Committee are reviewed annually 
and are available on the Company’s 
website (www.pace.com).
The Committee’s main 
responsibilities involve:
 — monitoring the integrity of the 
Financial Statements of the 
Company and formal announcements 
relating to the Company’s financial 
performance and reviewing any 
significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein;
 — reviewing the Company’s internal 
financial and operational control 
and risk management systems;
 — monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function 
and reviewing its material findings;
 — reviewing accounting policies, 
accounting treatments and 
disclosures in the Strategic Report 
and Financial Statements ensuring 
that shareholders may understand 
strategic aims and risks of the 
business of the Group and that the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken 
as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable;
 — overseeing the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditors, 
including making recommendations 
as to frequency of tendering for 
audit services, the appointment 
or re-appointment of the external 
auditors, reviewing their terms of 
engagement and monitoring their 
independence and ensuring that 
policy surrounding their engagement 
to provide non-audit services 
is appropriately applied; 
 — monitoring fraud reports and 
reviewing the effectiveness of 
the Company’s whistleblowing 
procedures; and
 — reporting to the Board on how it 
has discharged its responsibilities.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Committee will continue to assess 
the effectiveness and independence of 
the external auditors. In doing so, the 
Committee will consider a formal tender 
process in accordance with provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
We will comply with the Competition 
Commission Order relating to the statutory 
audit market for FTSE 350 companies, 
which is expected to come into effect 
from 1 October 2014.
Activities of the Committee
The main activities of the Committee 
during the year are set out below.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed and considered 
the following areas in respect of financial 
reporting and the preparation of the 
interim and annual financial statements:
 — the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used;
 — compliance with external and 
internal financial reporting standards 
and policies;
 — significant judgements made;
 — disclosures and presentations; and
 — whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts are fair, balanced 
and understandable.
In carrying this out, the Committee 
considered the work and recommendations 
of the Group Finance Team. In addition, 
the Committee received reports from the 
external auditors setting out their view on 
the accounting treatments and judgements 
included in the financial statements. 
The external auditors’ reports are based 
on a full audit of the annual financial 
statements and a high-level review 
of the interim financial statements.
With the support of the external 
auditor, the Committee assessed 
whether suitable accounting policies 
had been adopted, whether management 
had made appropriate estimates and 
judgements and whether the disclosures 
were fair and balanced.
The significant judgements considered 
by the Committee in areas where there 
was potential risk of material 
misstatement, were:
 — Revenue recognition. This represents 
a key area of judgement in the accounts 
due to the complexity of some of the 
Group’s revenue streams, in particular 
those involving multiple elements. The 
Committee has discussed with senior 
management the accounting for such 
contracts and may review the accounting 
treatment of all material new contracts. 
The Committee has concluded that 
the timing of recognition continues 
to be in line with IFRS requirements.
 — Royalty provisions. These are 
considered a significant area of 
judgement due to the complexity 
of the claims made against the Group, 
and the range of possible outcomes 
of each claim. The Committee and the 
Board receive a semi-annual report 
from the General Counsel regarding 
royalties/claims under negotiation 
as referred to in Note 20 to the 
Financial Statements.
 — Capitalised development costs. 
Project development costs are 
capitalised and subsequently amortised 
over their useful life. The Committee 
considered the basis for selecting such 
costs as relevant development costs and 
the process for identifying the useful life. 
The Committee also reviews a summary 
of the larger projects, by carrying value, 
to understand how the costs capitalised 
are covered by future forecast margin. 
The Committee has concluded that the 
processes for capitalising development 
costs are robust and that the balance 
is recoverable.
 — Other areas of judgement reviewed 
by the Committee, but where it was 
concluded that there was not a risk 
of material misstatement, included: 
warranty provisions; classification 
of items as exceptional; potential 
impairments of goodwill, intangible 
and other fixed assets; and treatment 
of tax assets and liabilities.
Internal controls and risk management
The Committee reviews the framework 
of internal controls and the processes 
by which the Group’s control environment 
is evaluated. 
In this regard, the Committee 
received reports from internal audit on 
the operation of, and issue arising from, 
the Group’s internal controls and procedures. 
External audit has also provided input 
and observations on the internal control 
environment and on any specific control 
issues that occurred during the year. 
The Committee also reviewed compliance 
activities in relation to internal audit reports 
submitted to the Committee in prior years 
and received a report on the status of 
recommendations and actions outstanding. 
The Committee reviews the Group’s 
risk management framework in order 
to ensure it is appropriate and operating 
effectively. In doing so, the Committee 
received reports from the Vice President 
of Group Finance covering: 
 — the effectiveness of the risk 
management processes and their 
adoption across the Group; and
 — a summary of the top risks to the Group, 
controls identified to mitigate these 
risks and actions planned to reduce 
risks where considered necessary.
As part of its agenda, the Committee 
allowed time for in-depth reviews of 
particular risk areas. During the year, 
the risk areas considered included 
implementation of the Anti-Corruption 
Policy, information and IT security, and 
the impact of changes to corporate 
governance rules.

Nomination Committee Report
Committee meetings
The Committee will meet at least once 
per year usually in conjunction with 
Board meetings. 
Activities of the Committee
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
dealt with a number of matters, including 
the retirement of Mike Inglis from the Board 
and succession planning of non-executive 
director roles.
Pace and the Committee value the 
aims and objectives of The Davies Report 
on Women on Boards and support and 
apply the Group diversity policy set out 
on page 23. There is currently one-third 
female representation at Board level. 
No formal measurable objective has 
been set for female representation 
at Board level.
The Committee is sensitive to the need 
for the non-executive directors to remain 
independent from management in order 
to exercise independent oversight and 
effectively challenge management as 
necessary. The Committee continually 
assesses the independence of the 
non-executive directors and has 
determined that all the non-executive 
directors are independent. None of them 
serve as directors of any companies or 
affiliates in which any other director is a 
director. However, more importantly, each 
of the non-executive directors is prepared 
to question and challenge management, 
to request more information and to ask 
the difficult question. They insist on robust 
responses both within the boardroom 
and sometimes between Board meetings. 
We value the input we receive from our 
longer serving directors given their deep 
understanding of the Group. We are 
however focused on planning for the future 
to build a balanced Board with the skills 
and experience fit to face the challenges 
that lie ahead. The Committee recognises 
that, in due course, longer serving directors 
will step down and therefore it continues 
to search for other suitable non-executive 
directors, whose experience will align 
with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Committee responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for 
a number of matters relating to the 
composition of the Board and its 
committees. In particular it is 
responsible for:
 — reviewing the structure 
of the Board;
 — evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and 
diversity of the Board;
 — advising the Board on any areas 
where further recruitment may 
be appropriate; and
 — succession planning for key 
executives at Board level 
and below.
Where necessary and appropriate, 
recruitment consultants are used 
to assist the Committee in delivering 
its objectives and responsibilities. 
The Committee leads the process for 
the identification and selection of new 
directors and makes recommendations 
to the Board in respect of such 
appointments. The Committee also 
makes recommendations to the Board 
on membership of its committees. 
The Committee terms of reference, 
can be found on the Pace website  
(www.pace.com).

Remuneration Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you our 
2013 Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(“Policy”) and Remuneration Report. 
We have continued to follow our strategy 
of creating a remuneration framework 
that rewards good performance in 
both the short and long term as we 
believe that this is in the best interests 
of all our stakeholders.
This year the new regulations on 
directors’ remuneration take effect for 
Pace. We have therefore restructured 
our report to comply with the new rules.
There are three sections:
1. this annual statement;
2.  the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
on pages 34 to 40 summarising the 
different elements of remuneration, 
how they work and how they link 
to performance and strategy. At the 
AGM on 24 April 2014, shareholders 
will be asked to approve this policy, 
which will then become binding; and
3.  the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on pages 41 to 46 giving details of 
remuneration earned in the 2013 
financial year. This report will be 
subject to an advisory vote by 
shareholders at the AGM.
In the rest of this statement, I summarise 
the Committee’s main activities during 
the year. More details can be found 
in the Policy and Annual Report.
There have been no major changes 
to the policy on remuneration during 
2013, although the Committee has, 
of course, considered the packages 
of the executive directors and confirmed 
that, in its opinion, these remained 
appropriate, aligning with our strategy 
and shareholders’ interests. No increases in 
directors’ salaries were awarded in the year. 
Our Remuneration Policy recognises that 
Pace is an international business with a major 
portion of its customers and employees, 
including the Chief Executive Officer, based 
in the USA. The targets and framework 
for the 2013 bonus and PSP awards 
were set in this context with EBITA again 
chosen as the primary target but with 
personal objectives and an incentive to 
ensure strong cash management also built 
in to the criteria. The Committee reviewed 
the vesting of the PSP and Option awards 
granted in 2010 and concluded that 
no PSP or Option awards would vest 
in 2013. 
Mike Pulli’s service agreement (originally 
put in place in 2003, with subsequent 
amendments on his appointment as CEO) 
was also updated and renewed during 
the year to better reflect his position 
as a director of a UK listed company.
Looking ahead to 2014 and beyond, 
the Committee has sought to reflect 
developing best practice. As a result, 
the rules of the Company’s Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan (DSB) for the 2014 award 
cycle to provide for performance outcomes 
are to be adjusted in circumstances of 
financial misstatement, misconduct or 
inaccuracies in underlying information 
or assumptions.
With a view to incentivising performance 
over the longer term, the Committee 
would also like the ability to make long-term 
incentive awards under the PSP up to 200% 
of salary where appropriate. The intention is 
that awards would not be awarded at the 
maximum level, other than in exceptional 
circumstances. Shareholder approval to 
amend the PSP to increase the current 
limit will be sought as a separate resolution 
at the AGM. Alongside this the Committee 
has decided not to seek renewal of the 
Executive Share Option Plans when they 
expire in 2015 and going forward the PSP 
will be the only long-term incentive plan for 
existing executive directors. The UK and 
US Sharesave Plans have in the past been 
very successful within Pace and shareholder 
approval will be sought at the AGM 
to renew these plans. 
We want to ensure that our remuneration 
framework provides a fair reward for the 
performance delivered and an incentive 
to continue to deliver our strategy and 
develop our business over the long term. 
We believe the Policy that we are asking 
you to approve does this whilst giving 
the Committee the flexibility to respond 
to changes in circumstances and 
commercial pressures facing Pace 
in its international markets.

Remuneration Committee Report
The Committee 
The Committee determines the Company’s 
policy on the remuneration of executive 
directors, the members of the Executive 
Committee and the Chairman. The 
Committee determines their individual 
remuneration packages.
The members of the Committee in 2013 
were Pat Chapman-Pincher (Chairman), 
Allan Leighton, John Grant, Mike Inglis 
(retired 24 April 2013) and Amanda Mesler. 
The composition of the Committee is in 
accordance with the Corporate Governance 
Code. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are on the Company’s website.
During the year Mike Pulli and the Directors 
of HR, Jill Ezard and Jane Johnston, were 
invited to attend meetings of the Committee 
to provide advice to enable it to take 
informed decisions. No director was 
present when their own remuneration 
was being discussed. Kepler Associates 
retained by the Committee, assisted in 
relation to remuneration matters. Its fees 
were £5,850. They provided no other 
services to the Company. Pinsent Masons 
LLP , legal adviser to the Company, has 
provided advice on compliance with the 
legislation and regulations.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
In this section the Committee presents the 
Policy, which will be put to shareholders by 
way of a binding vote at the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 24 April 2014. Subject 
to shareholder approval, this Policy will take 
effect from the day following the AGM.
The intention of the Committee is that the 
Policy should remain in place for three years.
The policies summarised in this section 
are consistent with those that have been 
in place at Pace for a number of years. 
As now required, this Policy is broken 
down into a number of sections:
 — a future policy table for directors, which 
sets out details of the different elements 
of executive directors’ remuneration;
 — remuneration policies relating to the 
Chairman and non-executive directors;
 — an illustration of the sensitivity 
of remuneration outcomes under 
this Policy in relation to Pace’s 
performance; and
 — other policies relating to executive 
director remuneration, including 
recruitment, service contracts, 
appointments and terminations.

Base salary
Set to reflect 
expected 
contribution 
to delivering 
the Company’s 
strategy. Salaries 
are set in the 
context of 
overall pay.
It is the intention of 
the Remuneration 
Committee to set 
base salaries at a 
competitive level 
after considering 
those paid by 
comparable 
companies, 
recognising the 
market value of 
the executive’s role, 
skill, responsibilities, 
performance and 
experience.
Reviewed annually 
with any change effective 
from 1 January.
When setting salary, 
the Committee takes 
into account the level 
of increase for employees 
more generally, market 
data, business performance, 
external economic factors, 
the complexity of the business 
and the role, cost and the 
directors’ experience and 
performance.
The Committee’s policy 
in relation to salary is:
 — up to median salary on 
appointment depending 
on the experience and 
background of the new 
executive director;
 — on promotion, up to the 
median salary for the 
new role; and
 — otherwise pay increases 
are set by reference to 
inflation and other pay rises 
generally for employees.
The policy maximum is for 
the percentage increase in 
executive directors’ salaries 
not to exceed 10% in any 
year, but this is subject to 
an overriding discretion in 
exceptional circumstances. 
Salary levels and increases will 
be determined with reference 
to market practices and rates 
in the relevant location. 
There are no 
performance 
conditions, 
although 
individual 
performance 
is considered 
when reviewing 
salaries.

Benefits To provide 
reasonable market 
competitive 
benefits.
The Committee provides a range 
of benefits to executives in line with 
the Pace policy. These comprise 
a fully expensed car plus fuel (or an 
equivalent cash allowance), private 
medical insurance, permanent 
health insurance and life insurance, 
and may include relocation 
assistance and other benefits 
customarily provided in the 
relevant location where applicable.
No more generous than 
the equivalent benefits to 
those provided in 2013 but 
recognising the cash cost/
value of providing such 
benefits can vary significantly 
according to the age, health 
and location of the individual.
None.
Pension Market-
competitive 
retirement 
provision, 
recruitment and 
retention of high 
calibre executives 
and also supports 
succession 
planning.
A cash allowance is paid in lieu 
of pension contributions. With 
the Committee’s approval, an 
executive director may, at their 
discretion, redirect all or part of 
this allowance into any defined 
contribution pension arrangement 
in their home country (including 
401k plans in the USA). 
Up to 25% of annual 
basic salary.
N/A
Relocation To facilitate 
the recruitment 
and relocation 
of executive 
directors.
Where it is in Pace’s interests 
to request that executives work 
in a different country or region, 
then it may pay relocation and 
provide benefits and allowances 
to compensate the individual 
for the additional costs involved.
The Committee has no 
prescribed maximum level 
for the value of relocation 
payments as these can 
vary significantly based 
on the countries and individual 
circumstances involved. 
The Committee will agree 
relocation payments on 
a case by case basis.

Annual bonus To incentivise 
and reward 
performance 
against annual 
financial, strategic 
and operational 
goals, which are 
consistent with 
the medium to 
long-term strategic 
needs of Pace.
The award of annual bonus under 
the plan is determined following 
the year end by the Committee 
based on performance against 
the targets set at the beginning 
of the year and the Committee’s 
assessment of achievement 
of personal objectives.
A minimum of one-third of any 
bonus outcome is payable in Pace 
shares and all of any enhanced 
bonus award is payable in Pace 
shares and automatically deferred 
for a minimum period of two years 
under the Group Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan.
The Committee retains the 
power to reduce the bonus 
otherwise payable by up to 
50% based on its assessment 
of the management of Pace’s 
cash position during the year. 
The Committee has reserved 
the power to seek clawback of 
the deferred element of bonuses 
in certain circumstances.
Normal maximum: 150% 
of salary.
Exceptional maximum: 225% 
of salary.
In line with expectations: 75% 
of salary.
Threshold: 25% of salary.
The policy is 
for corporate 
objectives to 
be linked to key 
drivers of value 
creation, which 
may include 
EBITA, EPS, 
adjusted EPS 
or other 
operational 
measures. In 
addition the scale 
of annual bonus 
will depend on 
achievement 
of individual 
personal 
objectives 
aligned to the 
objectives of 
the Group 
that year.
Long-term 
incentives
To incentivise 
long-term value 
creation, aligning 
the interests of 
executives and 
shareholders 
through the 
delivery of 
awards in shares. 
The selected 
performance 
targets support 
the long-term 
strategy of Pace 
and aid retention of 
executive directors.
The Committee can make 
annual share-based awards 
to executive directors under the 
Pace Performance Share Plan. 
These can take the form 
of nil-cost options or 
conditional awards.
Clawback provisions are 
included in the Plan Rules 
and provide the Committee with 
the power to adjust unvested 
and/or unexercised awards 
in certain circumstances.
Awards can be settled through 
market-purchased shares, 
treasury shares or new 
issue shares.
Normal maximum: 100% 
of salary.
Exceptional maximum 
(subject to shareholder 
approval): 200% of salary.
As a percentage of maximum 
opportunity, the following 
amounts are payable for 
the corresponding levels of 
performance as a percentage 
of the award:
Minimum: 25%
Maximum: 100%
Other points on the vesting 
schedule may be determined 
at the Committee’s discretion 
when the performance 
targets are set.
The policy is 
for corporate 
financial 
targets to be 
set, measured 
over a minimum 
of three financial 
years and linked 
to the key drivers 
of value creation, 
which may 
include EBITA,

EPS or other 
operational 
measures.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The principles of the remuneration 
framework for executive directors reflect 
the same principles that apply to the 
broader employee population. Absolute 
levels and the provision of certain 
components vary by location and grade, 
but the overarching themes are consistent 
across the wider Group:
 — Salaries are reviewed annually with 
any increases made on a discretionary 
basis, considering factors such as 
those set out in the policy table.
 — Managers and key employees 
participate in annual bonus plans 
with measures linked to corporate, 
divisional and/or local performance 
depending on their level including, for 
the most senior, a compulsory deferral 
of part of annual bonus into shares.
 — Bonuses are awarded based on 
achievement of adjusted EBITA or 
adjusted EPS targets approved by 
the Committee and set by reference 
to annual budget expectations. 
The Committee has discretion 
to award enhanced bonus to 
senior executives (subject to an 
overall maximum limit) to reward 
exceptional corporate performance  
and personal performance.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
continued
Future policy table – executive directors 
continued
 — The all-employee plans described 
in the future policy table are offered 
on consistent terms to all qualifying 
employees in the locations where 
the plans operate. There is a long-term 
incentive plan, the Pace International 
Performance Share Plan, to incentivise 
key employees (but excluding the 
executive directors).
 — Eligibility for benefits and allowances 
varies by grade and local market 
practice. Pension provision below 
the Board is accrued at a lower rate.
Remuneration of other employees
When setting the salaries for executive 
directors, the Committee takes into 
account a number of factors (as noted in 
the future policy table) and these include 
the broader employment conditions 
within Pace. More specifically the 
Committee reviews budgeted salary 
increases across the Group when 
assessing the appropriateness of any 
increases for the executive directors. The 
Committee also takes account of the 
internal relativities within the senior 
management team and the degree 
of impact of the relevant roles on 
the Group’s performance.
The Committee did not consult with 
employees when preparing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for this report. 
Shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee has a 
standard annual agenda item whereby 
the feedback from shareholders and 
investor advisory bodies is presented 
and discussed both before and after 
the AGM. This feedback is sought and 
collated by the Senior Vice President of 
Investor Relations and Strategy and the 
Company Secretary. The feedback that 
the Committee receives then informs 
discussions for the formulation of future 
policy and remuneration decisions 
thereafter. Furthermore, as appropriate, 
the Committee will meet with 
shareholders on specific matters.
Remuneration policy – 
Non-executive directors 
The Board’s policy in relation to 
non-executive directors continues to 
be to pay fees that are competitive with 
the fees paid by comparable quoted 
companies. Non-executive directors’ fees 
are determined by the Board as a whole 
within the limits set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association. The policy is that 
non-executive directors are not eligible 
for performance bonuses or pension 
contributions and do not participate in 
the equity incentive plans. Non-executive 
remuneration is reviewed annually.

Illustrations of the application of 
Pace’s remuneration policy for 2014
In order to illustrate the potential 
opportunity available to the executive 
directors, and the sensitivity of pay 
to performance, the charts above 
set out pay outcomes for three 
performance levels:
 — Minimum: Pay is limited to 
fixed elements of salary, pension 
allowance and taxable benefits 
and no vesting under any of the 
long-term incentive plans.
 — In line with expectations: Fixed pay  
plus bonus at the mid-point of the  
range, giving 50% of the maximum 
opportunity and long-term incentives 
vest at 50% of the maximum.
 — Maximum: Fixed pay plus bonus at the 
maximum point of the range, giving 
100% of the maximum opportunity 
and long-term incentives vest at 100% 
of the maximum.
It is our intention to reward success. 
The policy is for a significant proportion 
of executive directors’ total remuneration 
to be capable of being earned from variable, 
performance-based incentives, through 
annual bonuses and share-based incentives. 
The objective of this policy is to provide 
rewards and incentives for success. 
More than half of each executive director’s 
potential remuneration is variable and 
can only be earned by good corporate 
and personal performance reflected in 
achievement of measurable corporate 
and personal objectives.
Policy on recruitment remuneration
When setting the remuneration package 
for a new executive director, the Committee 
will apply the same principles as set out 
in the future policy table. 
Base salary will be set at a level 
appropriate to the role and the experience 
of the director being appointed. This may 
include agreement on future increases 
up to a market rate, in line with increased 
experience and/or responsibilities, subject to 
good performance, where it is considered 
appropriate. A benefit package may be 
agreed consistent with the future 
policy table.
Normal annual bonus and long-term 
incentive awards for a new executive 
director will be within the maximum levels 
set out in the future policy table but, in 
any event, the Committee would not 
award annual variable pay above four 
times base salary.
In relation to external appointments, the 
Committee may structure an appointment 
package that it considers appropriate to 
recognise awards or benefits that will be 
forfeited on resignation from a previous 
position, taking into account timing, 
valuation and such other specific matters 
as it considers relevant. This may take 
the form of cash and/or share awards, 
which may be in addition to the normal 
variable remuneration. The policy is that 
the maximum payment under any such 
arrangements should be no more than 
the Committee considers is required 
to provide reasonable compensation 
to the incoming director. 
If the director will be required to relocate 
and/or to travel periodically in order to 
take up the position, it is the Company’s 
policy to allow reasonable relocation, 
travel and subsistence payments 
referable to actual costs involved. 
Where the Committee considers it to be 
necessary to secure the appointment and 
so long as the position is consistent with 
the overall policy on total remuneration, it 
may vary the remuneration structure and/or 
agree bespoke arrangements. If necessary 
to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the 
recruitment of a director, the Committee 
will have the flexibility to rely on exemption 
9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. The Committee 
would only intend to use this to structure 
compensatory awards, to facilitate 
recruitment of an executive and not 
to offer a “golden hello” unrelated 
to remuneration lost.
In the case of an employee who is 
promoted to the position of director, 
it is the Company’s policy to honour 
pre-existing remuneration commitments 
in accordance with their terms.
Non-executive director appointments 
will be through letters of appointment. 
Non-executive directors’ base fees, 
including those of the Chairman, will 
be set at a competitive market level, 
reflecting experience, responsibility and 
time commitment. Fees are reviewed 
annually. Additional fees may be payable 
for the Chairmanship of Committees 
and for the additional responsibilities 
of the Senior Independent Director.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
continued
Service contracts
The policy is that executive directors’ 
notice periods should not exceed one 
year. Each of the executive directors has 
a service contract that is terminable by 
the Company on twelve months’ prior 
written notice or by the relevant director 
on not less than six months’ prior written 
notice. At the option of the Company, each 
agreement may be terminated forthwith 
subject to the Company paying a sum 
equivalent to twelve months’ salary, 
benefits and pension contributions.
It is the Company’s policy to honour 
its obligations with regard to directors’ 
service agreements, and where the 
employment of a director is terminated in 
accordance with the contractual process 
for payment in lieu of notice, the executive 
will be paid the sum specified in the 
relevant service agreement as payable.
Each of the non-executive directors is 
appointed under a letter of appointment 
which is terminable at any time by the 
Company without contractual notice. 
Where notice is not given, termination 
is generally subject to payment of an 
amount equal to three months’ directors’ 
fees. Each of the directors has a letter of 
indemnity issued by the Company which 
provides an indemnity in respect of 
liabilities incurred in the course of their 
office to the extent permitted by the 
Company’s Articles of Association and 
the provisions of the Companies Act.
Exit policy
No service agreement includes 
any provision for the payment of 
compensation upon early termination.
If an executive director’s employment is 
to be terminated, the Committee’s policy 
in respect of the contract of employment, 
in the absence of a breach of the service 
agreement by the director, is to agree a 
termination package based on the value 
of base salary and contractual pension 
amounts and benefits that would have 
accrued to the director during the 
contractual notice period. The policy 
is that, as is considered appropriate at 
the time, the departing director may work, 
or be placed on garden leave, for all or part 
of his notice period, or receive a payment 
in lieu of notice in accordance with the 
service agreement. The Committee will 
consider mitigation (under the terms of 
the service agreement, and generally) 
to reduce the termination package to a 
leaving director when appropriate to do 
so, having regard to the circumstances. 
In addition, where the director may be 
entitled to pursue a legal claim, Pace will 
be entitled to negotiate settlement terms 
(financial or otherwise) with the director 
that the Committee considers to be 
reasonable in all the circumstances 
and in the best interests of the Company 
(with or without the benefit of legal advice) 
and to enter into a settlement agreement 
with the director to effect both the terms 
agreed under the service agreement and 
any additional statutory or other claims.
Annual bonuses deferred into share 
awards under the Company’s Deferred 
Share Bonus plan will normally be retained 
by the director except where performance 
adjustment or clawback or other exceptional 
circumstances apply.
The Committee will consider whether 
share awards held by the director under 
the Company’s Performance Share Plan 
should lapse or vest. Any determination 
by the Committee will be in accordance 
with the rules of the plan. In summary, 
the plan rules provide that awards can 
vest if employment ends by reason of 
retirement, injury, disability, death or 
change of ownership. Vesting of awards 
will normally be in accordance with the 
normal performance and vesting cycle 
and be subject to satisfaction of the 
relevant performance conditions. Any 
awards which vest will normally be time 
pro-rated. The Committee will have 
discretion to allow a higher level 
of vesting if appropriate.
If employment ends for any other reason, 
the plan rules permit the Committee to 
exercise its discretion. In doing so, the 
policy is that it will take account of all 
relevant circumstances, in particular, 
having regard to the performance of the 
Company, the director’s performance 
and behaviour towards the Company 
during the performance cycle of the 
relevant awards.
Examples of circumstances in which 
the Committee may decide to exercise 
its discretion to permit the vesting or 
increased vesting of long-term incentive 
awards may include continued good 
performance up to and following the giving 
of notice or the change of ownership and 
the director’s approach to the timing of 
departure and handover arrangements. 
The Committee has confirmed to the 
Chief Executive Officer that in the event 
of termination in good leaver circumstances, 
the discretion would be exercised in line 
with the policy and previous practice 
provided shareholder approval of this 
policy is maintained.
Historic options under the Company’s 
share option plans may be exercised 
early within a specified period of leaving 
in specified good leaver circumstances 
or at the Committee’s discretion, or the 
Committee may extend the period for 
exercise in such circumstances. The policy 
is that the Committee should retain the 
ability to exercise discretion in accordance 
with the rules but that performance 
conditions would be assessed in the 
advance of early exercise. Options may 
also be exercised in connection with a 
change of control or other corporate events 
and again the policy is that performance 
conditions would be assessed as at the 
date of the early exercise event and the 
Committee retains the ability to exercise 
discretion in accordance with the Rules.
It is the Company’s policy to honour 
pre-existing award commitments in 
accordance with their terms and the terms 
of the relevant plan(s). Where the executive 
director participates in one or more of the 
Company’s all-employee share plans, his 
awards may vest or be exercisable on 
or following termination, where permissible, 
in accordance with the rules of the plan.

Notes to the single total figure 
table – audited
 — Taxable benefits comprised of car 
allowance (plus medical insurance 
for Roddy Murray).
 — Pension contributions for Mike Pulli 
were partially suspended during the 
year to adjust contributions to reflect 
an overpayment of contributions 
in 2012; he is entitled to a pension 
contribution/cash allowance of 
18.5% of salary.
 — Bonus for Mike Pulli was 224% of 
base salary and comprised a normal 
bonus award of 118% of base salary 
of which one third is deferred into 
Pace shares for a period of two years; 
in addition he received an enhanced 
bonus award of $792,000 which is 
deferred into Pace shares for a period 
of three years subject to continued 
employment conditions. 
 — Bonus for Roddy Murray was 164% 
of base salary and comprised a 
normal bonus award of 103% of base 
salary of which one third is deferred 
into Pace shares for a period of two 
years; in addition he received an 
enhanced bonus award of $330,000 
which is deferred into Pace shares 
for a period of three years subject to 
continued employment conditions.
 — In each case bonus was calculated 
by reference to Group adjusted 
EBITA generated above the minimum 
target threshold of $187 million and 
the Committee’s assessment of the 
executive director’s achievement of 
personal objectives. The Committee 
exercised its discretion to award 
enhanced bonuses based on the 
Group cash management and net 
debt reduction achieved during 
the year.
 — Long-term incentives vesting in the 
year – in 2013 a US Sharesave option 
granted in 2012 vested during the year 
and in 2012 the 2009 PSP share award 
and an Executive Share Option, with 
a share option price of 75.0p, vested 
during the year. Share options granted 
in 2010 under the 2005 Unapproved 
Share Option Plan and PSP awards 
made under the Performance Share 
Plan due to vest in the year did not meet 
the minimum required performance 
targets and lapsed in the year.

Annual Report on 
Remuneration continued
Statement of implementation 
of Remuneration Policy in 2014
2014, the directors’ remuneration will be 
in line with the Policy.
2014 bonus: the bonus targets for 
executive directors have been set by 
reference to a range of Group adjusted 
EBITA and personal performance outcomes 
above 2014 expectations at the start of 
the year. Targets for executive directors 
to earn a potential enhanced bonus share 
award have been set by reference to cash 
management and personal performance 
target outcomes above current 
2014 expectations. 
2014 PSP: the performance targets 
for the PSP awards to be made to the 
executive directors have been set by 
reference to adjusted cumulative EPS 
growth over a three year period with 
minimum 25% vesting at 6% per annum 
cumulative growth and 100% vesting 
above 12% per annum cumulative 
growth. Awards on this basis are 
expected to be made to executive 
directors in 2014.
Clawback and performance 
adjustment: the annual bonus has for 
some years been subject to adjustment 
if cash management targets are not met. 
For 2014 bonus, deferred bonus and PSP 
awards, Pace has now introduced additional 
clawback and performance adjustment in 
circumstances of misconduct, restatement 
of accounts or a mistake in calculating 
the payout.

It is inherent in the methodology for calculating the single figure of remuneration that for a particular year it includes amounts 
that the executive did not actually receive in that year, due to deferral or due to retaining options after the date they first became 
exercisable. In the December of the 2011 financial year, Mike Pulli replaced Neil Gaydon as CEO. It would be misleading to show 
the full year’s total remuneration for each, so time pro-rating has been applied.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests – audited
The Committee operates individual shareholding target requirements for executive directors with a requirement (subject 
to a discretion of the Committee) for such executives to retain a portion of any net awards (i.e. after tax and exercise cost) of 
newly vested share-based incentives made after 2009 until the target shareholding level is reached. The target shareholding is 
approximately 100% of the executive’s annual salary. Up to 50% of shares earned but held under the Company’s Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan are deemed to count towards the ownership target. Each executive is required to achieve target ownership level 
within a period of five years. Mike Pulli and Roddy Murray have achieved the required minimum shareholding. 
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build up a meaningful shareholding. Allan Leighton purchased a significant individual 
shareholding on appointment. Details of the appointment share awards made to him in 2011 as a one-off exception to policy 
have been fully disclosed in these accounts and in the 2011 and 2012 accounts.

The Annual Report and Accounts contain 
certain forward-looking statements with

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Group and 
Parent Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they are 
required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company Financial Statements on the 
same basis. 
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the Financial Statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. In 
preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements, the 
directors are required to: 
 — select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently; 
 — make judgements and estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent; 
 — state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; and 
 — prepare the Financial Statements 
on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group and the Parent Company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Parent Company and enable them 
to ensure that its financial statements and 
the Directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement 
that comply with that law and 
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors as at the date of this 
Report, whose names and functions are 
listed in the Board of Directors on page 24, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 — the Financial Statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 — the Strategic Report includes a 
fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
Each of the persons who is a director as 
at the date of this report confirms that:
 — so far as the director is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 — the director has taken all the steps 
that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make himself/
herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006. In addition, the directors as at 
the date of this report consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Independent Auditors’ Report
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Pace plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 set out on pages 54 to 94. In our opinion: 
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2013 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 — the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU);
 — the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows: 
Revenue recognition ($2,469.2 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee Report), page 62 (accounting policy) and pages 68 to 69 (financial disclosures).
 — The risk – Revenue consists of hardware sales, software and services, on occasion contracted for within a single arrangement. 
Accounting for arrangements involving multiple elements can be complex as in many cases the total contract value is allocated 
to each identified component on a relative fair value basis and recognised as revenue as the related goods or services are 
delivered. The identification of components and allocation and recognition of revenue relating to components is a key area 
of judgement for our audit.
 — Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, testing controls relating to the identification of components 
within contracts, the allocation of revenue to components and the recognition of revenue for those components. We read 
significant new contracts entered into during the year to understand the contractual terms and to corroborate the components 
identified by the Group. We assessed the Group’s allocation of revenue, on a relative fair value basis, to identified components 
of contracts through analysis of revenue and margins. As part of our assessment of amounts recognised as revenue in the 
period we recalculated the deferred revenue balance at the balance sheet date. We also considered the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures in respect of revenue and deferred revenue. 
Royalty under negotiation provisions ($36.9 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee Report), page 67 (accounting policy) and page 86 (financial disclosures).
 — The risk – The Group’s products incorporate third party technology. Due to the complexity of intellectual property rights 
arrangements the Group is exposed to the risk of infringement of third party rights. Potential claims can be submitted many 
years after a product has been deployed and extensive negotiation is commonplace. Determining whether to recognise a 
provision, and the amount of the provision to be recognised, requires the Group to make judgements and estimates that 
are inherently subjective.
 — Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, considering the extent to which the Directors’ estimates takes 
into account a balanced assessment of the latest available information on the ongoing claims at the balance sheet date, and 
the accuracy and reliability of the sources of that information. This included discussing significant claims with the Group’s 
in-house patent expert and legal teams and, for the most significant claims, making enquiries of the Group’s external legal 
adviser. We read correspondence between the Group and individual claimants. We read information published by claimants, 
such as press releases, highlighting their successes against other parties, as part of our assessment of the strength of the 
claimant’s case. We considered the Group’s historical experience in assessing the level of provision required by comparing 
actual outcomes from previous claims to provisions made. We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of royalty provisions.

2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
Capitalised development costs ($57.8 million)
Refer to page 31 (Audit Committee Report), page 63 (accounting policy) and pages 73 to 75 (financial disclosures).
 — The risk – Project development costs are required to be capitalised (and subsequently amortised over their useful life) if they 
meet the criteria of relevant accounting standards which require, among other things, an assessment of the future out-turn of 
the project. The Group conducts a significant level of development activity. The Group has to apply judgement in identifying 
projects meeting the criteria for capitalisation under the requirements of accounting standards and to capture accurate time 
and costs information for those projects. There is a risk that capitalisation occurs on projects that do not meet the criteria, 
that incorrect amounts are allocated to projects or that projects are not as successful as initially anticipated leading 
to overcapitalisation and the need for impairment.
 — Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, testing controls over the authorisation of new development 
projects and the monitoring of ongoing development projects. We agreed costs assigned to a sample of larger value projects 
to time recorded or to invoices, considered the reasonableness of labour rates used, and compared the chosen amortisation 
periods to the forecast sales information for each project. As part of our assessment of the benefits expected to be generated 
for the Group from these projects, which is a key factor in determining whether capitalisation is appropriate, we considered the 
Group’s project cash flow forecasts. We assessed the appropriateness of key inputs, such as the value and timing of sales by 
reference to our knowledge of the Group’s business, our experience of the industry, and consideration of publicly available 
information, such as press releases. We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of 
development costs.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at $7,500,000. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation (of which it is 6%) which we consider to be one of the principal considerations 
for members of the company in assessing the financial performance of the Group.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit 
with a value in excess of $375,000 in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed by component auditors at the key reporting components in the following 
locations: West Coast United States, France and Brazil, and by the group audit team in the following locations: United Kingdom 
and East Coast United States. These group procedures covered 100% of total group revenue; 96% of group profit before taxation; 
and 100% of total group assets. The segment disclosures in Note 3 set out the individual significance of a specific country.
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the group were all performed 
to materiality levels set by the group audit team. These materiality levels were set individually for each component and ranged 
from $3.5 million to $5 million. 
Detailed instructions were sent to all the component auditors. These instructions covered the significant audit areas that should 
be covered by the component auditors (which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above) and set out 
the information required to be reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team visited the following locations: 
United Kingdom and East Coast United States. Telephone meetings were also held with the auditors at the locations that 
were not physically visited by the Group team. 
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion: 
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 — the information given in the Framework of Corporate Governance set out on pages 26 to 28 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.

5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 — we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 — the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
 — the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 — certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 — a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 — the directors’ statement, set out on page 47, in relation to going concern; and 
 — the part of the Framework of Corporate Governance on pages 26 to 28 relating to the company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope of report and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 49, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of 
an audit of accounts is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report 
is made solely to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2013a, which are incorporated into this report 
as if set out in full and should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this report, the work we have undertaken 
and the basis of our opinions.

Financial Statements
Notes
1 Basis of preparation and business environment
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation 
to the Financial Statements:
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost 
convention as modified by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company’s Financial Statements have 
been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented 
for the Company. The result of the Company for the year is shown in Note 25.
Financial year end
The current year’s Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the previous year’s Financial Statements 
are for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Going concern
At 31 December 2013 the Group was debt free having repaid all instalments on its term loan and revolving credit facility. The final 
payment on the term loan, which was due for repayment in March 2014, was settled early. On 6 January 2014, the Group took out 
new borrowing facilities to fund the acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc. and to provide working capital. The facilities were in the form 
of a $310.0 million term loan, which is subject to regular repayments over a five year period, and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility. 
These facilities are subject to financial performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Group has prepared a financial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short-term and 
medium-term plans. The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management 
and revenue reduction, and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have 
adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings (Note 13) drawn up to 
31 December 2013. Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability 
to use its power to affect those returns. Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been 
eliminated on the Group consolidation. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the Financial 
Statements of the Company.
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars 
which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency.
The US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2013 was 1.64 (2012: 1.62).
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty
The Group’s main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 62 to 67. 
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies in many areas. 
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions. Key areas of estimation 
uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows:
Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its products. Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or 
the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before field deployment 
data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the field.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data 
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed 
on a product by product basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.

1 Basis of preparation and business environment continued
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty continued
Royalties
Pace’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk 
of infringing third party intellectual property rights. Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been 
deployed. Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated 
claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. Having taken legal advice, the Board considers 
that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all 
claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential 
liabilities are finally settled. The provision is based on the latest information available.
Revenue recognition
Some of the Group’s sales involve the delivery of more than one product or service (multiple components) as part of a single 
transaction. The amount recognised as revenue for each component is calculated by reference to the fair value of the element 
in relation to the fair value of the arrangement as a whole. This requires a degree of management judgement and the fair value 
allocations are, by their nature, best estimates. 
Impairment reviews
As is required by International Accounting Standards, the Group carries out impairment reviews of its non-financial assets on 
an annual basis, or when indicators of impairment exist. Such reviews involve assessing the value in use of an asset or CGU by 
reference to its estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value. The judgements in relation to impairment reviews 
relate to the assumptions applied in calculating the value in use, and the future performance expectations. 
Intangible assets – Capitalised Development Costs
The Group business includes a significant element of research and development activity. Under accounting standards, principally 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benefits 
from projects deemed to be commercially viable. The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management 
of the forecasted economic benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection 
of amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product.
2 Accounting policies
Business combinations
Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power 
to affect those returns. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied 
in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
all measured as of the acquisition date. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred 
by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group. Consideration transferred also includes 
the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the 
business combination. If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and 
the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element 
is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation 
and arises from a past event and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. 
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due 
diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
2 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill continued
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount 
of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated 
to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 (date of transition to 
Adopted IFRS) has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually. The Group performs 
its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset 
categories as follows:
Customer contracts and relationships  three to ten years
Technology and patents   one to ten years
Other     three years
Research and development expenditure
All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Where a product is technically feasible, 
production and sales are intended, a market exists and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development 
costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned 
from commercial launch. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion 
of overheads. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between six and 30 months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Company’s distributable 
profits as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the income statement in research and development 
expenditure within the Administrative expenses category.
Impairment charges
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated 
to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets 
are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which 
the corporate asset is allocated. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any impairment losses recognised in respect 
of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.

Notes
2 Accounting policies continued
Impairment charges continued
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional items
Items that are significant by virtue of their size or nature and that are considered non-recurring are classified as exceptional 
operating items. Such items which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructuring 
and profits and losses made on the disposal of properties, are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category, 
albeit analysed as a separate line within that category, and are highlighted separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive 
of value added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the 
customer and substantially all of the Group’s work is completed, which is usually upon delivery to the customer or his/her agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised 
over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any 
future obligations remaining.
When a single sales transaction requires the delivery of more than one product or service (multiple components), the revenue 
recognition criteria are applied to the separately identifiable components. A component is considered to be separately identifiable 
if the product or service delivered has standalone value to that customer and the fair value associated with the product or service 
can be measured reliably. The amount recognised as revenue for each component is the fair value of the element in relation to the 
fair value of the arrangement as a whole. This requires a degree of management judgement and the fair value allocations are, by their 
nature, best estimates. The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been made. 
Where there is no separate selling price of an element, management determines fair value based on equivalent available products.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is 
inherently judgemental.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
in profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses 
recognised on financial assets. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a 
qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported 
on a net basis.
Government grants
Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income 
statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the project’s related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with 
original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose 
of the statement of cash flows.
Allowance for doubtful debts
Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant. 
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
2 Accounting policies continued
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate 
transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, 
slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, 
the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance 
sheet date. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
Long leasehold properties  Period of lease
Short leasehold properties  Period of lease
Plant and machinery  One to ten years
Motor vehicles   Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed 
to have occurred.
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected 
useful lives. The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding 
and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to the Group’s presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses 
of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling 
at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the 
translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation 
reserve is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does 
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The directors have determined that the instruments qualify 
for cash flow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows 
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain 
or loss on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.

Notes
2 Accounting policies continued
Derivative financial instruments continued
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income/costs. 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative 
gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Taxes
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax 
is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled. 
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable 
future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount 
recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions 
are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet 
the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting 
conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up 
for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as 
an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. 
The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised 
as personnel expenses in profit or loss.
Employee share ownership plans
The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benefits Trust are treated as being those of the Company. 
Until such time as the Company’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted 
in arriving at equity.
Employee benefits
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. 
The Group has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

2 Accounting policies continued
Dividends payable
Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a 
final dividend when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
(a) Royalties
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have 
indicated claims for royalties relating to the Group’s use (including past usage) of that technology. The provision is based 
on the latest information available. 
(b) Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical 
warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision 
required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
(c) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
(d) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower 
than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other 
standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013:
 — ‘Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ (Amendments to IFRS 7). The amendment has had no 
material impact on the Group. 
 — IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements (2011)’. As a result of IFRS 10 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy 
for determining whether it has control over and consequently whether it consolidates its investee. IFRS 10 (2011) introduces a 
new control model that focuses on whether the Group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect those returns. In accordance with the transitional provisions 
of IFRS 10 (2011), the Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees at 1 January 2013, and concluded that the new 
standard had not caused a material change to its previous accounting treatment. 
 — IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures 
about fair value measurements when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs. It unifies the definition of fair 
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. It replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
in other IFRSs, including IFRS 7. As a result, the Group has included additional disclosures in this regard. 
 — ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’ (Amendments to IAS 1). As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the 
Group has modified the presentation of items of OCI in its statement of profit or loss and OCI, to present separately items that 
would be reclassified to profit or loss from those that would not be. Comparative information has been re-presented accordingly.
(b) New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and not early 
adopted
There are no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.

3 Segmental analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) has been identified as the Board 
of Directors which reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance 
of the business and make decisions.
The Group determines operating segments on the basis of SBU areas, being the basis on which the Group manages 
its worldwide interests.
The Group has the following reportable segments:
 — Pace Americas;
 — Pace International; and
 — Other.
Other includes central and unallocated costs and other immaterial SBUs, which are operating segments that are allowed 
to be aggregated under IFRS 8.
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is reviewed 
by the CODM. Adjusted EBITA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant 
in evaluating the results of certain segments, relative to other entities that operate within these industries. 
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and pricing is determined on an arm’s length 
basis. There are no material inter-segment transactions.
The tables below present the segmental information:

The UK Finance Bill 2013, which includes the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and  
to 20% from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. As a result, UK deferred tax has been calculated on the rates 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share 29.8c 18.5c
Adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share 44.3c 35.1c
Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share 42.2c 33.4c
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a profit after tax of $96.7 million (2012: $58.4 million) divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue of 309,740,316 (2012: 300,344,669), excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

Dilutive effect of options outstanding 15.3 15.1
Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year 325.0 315.4
Diluted earnings per ordinary share varies from basic earnings per ordinary share due to the effect of the notional exercise 
of outstanding share options.
To better reflect underlying performance, adjusted earnings per share is also calculated (adjusting profit after tax to remove 
amortisation of other intangibles and exceptional items, post tax). The earnings amount is calculated as follows:

Adjusted profit after tax 137.2 105.3
The Group’s effective tax rate of 26.1% (2012: 27.1%) has been used to calculate the tax effect of adjusted items.

Goodwill
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations and relates to the following acquisitions:
 — XCom Multimedia Communications SA (now Pace Europe SAS) in February 2001;
 — the STB and connectivity solutions business of Royal Philips Electronics (Pace France) in April 2008;
 — Bewan Systems SA (Bewan) in April 2010;
 — 2Wire, Inc. (2Wire) in October 2010; and
 — Latens Systems Limited (Latens) in November 2010.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across Strategic Business Units, which are groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) 
as follows:
 — $124.7 million within Pace International;
 — $186.1 million within Pace Americas; and
 — $31.8 million within Latens.
These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated 
goodwill is monitored for management purposes. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there 
are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based 
on the following year’s budget and the Group’s three year plan. These forecasts have been approved by the Board, and have an 
appropriate long-term growth rate of 1% (2012: 1%) applied to them.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based 
discount rate. The post-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 10.33% (2012: 10.14%).
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes 
to selling prices and direct costs. Sales growth, selling prices and direct costs are built up within the budget and three year plan 
on a product by product basis utilising the knowledge and expertise of operational staff. The anticipated launch dates for new 
products, the achievable prices and direct costs to be incurred are therefore highly judgemental. The directors estimate 
discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money for the Group.
The directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered the following reasonable changes 
in the assumptions:
 — movements in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%; and
 — reductions in cash flows of up to $10 million per annum.
The directors consider that there is sufficient headroom within the value in use calculations at 31 December 2013.

(c) Gains and losses on currency derivatives
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in US Dollars. The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its 
income as possible in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign 
currencies, in respect of cash receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next twelve months.

(d) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount 
and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The Group does not require collateral in respect 
of financial assets. There were no significant impairments in the periods under review.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk 
at the reporting date was:
2013 2012
Carrying amount $m $m
Trade receivables 422.7 514.1
Cash and cash equivalents 33.0 74.7
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging
Assets 2.2 0.4
457.9 589.2
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was:
2013 2012
Carrying amount $m $m
Domestic 121.9 121.6
Euro-zone countries 9.7 24.0
United States 227.7 293.2
Other regions 63.4 75.3
422.7 514.1
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings. At each balance sheet date 
there was no significant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Group’s 
total revenues, as explained in Note 3.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2013, 92% were within terms (2012: 92%). Of the balance 5% were less than 30 days 
past due, with the remaining amounts over 30 days due (2012: 7% less than 30 days past due). There were no material bad debts 
provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast 
and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.
The directors have considered the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected 
to occur, together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
(f) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
The directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve month period would have a $Nil impact 
on cash flows (2012: $0.8 million). 
The Group’s key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling. A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against 
these would have an adverse impact of $1.0 million (2012: $0.2 million) on the profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2013 
and an adverse impact of $5.8 million (2012: $4.7 million) on equity.
(g) Capital management
Capital risk management
The Group and Company manage their capital, being the net assets base, to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern 
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises 
equity attributable to equity holders of Pace plc, consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed in Notes 21, 22 and 24 and cash and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 18.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders (through the 
progressive dividend policy introduced in 2009), issue of new shares and buy-back of existing shares and issuing new borrowings 
or repaying existing borrowings.
Note 21 to the Financial Statements provide details regarding the Company’s share capital and movements in the period. 
There were no breaches of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Company’s 
Articles of Association during the periods under review.

Royalties under negotiation
The owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Group’s 
use (including past usage) of that technology. Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time. The directors have 
made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available. Having taken legal advice, the Board 
considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate 
or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which 
the potential liabilities are finally settled.
Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more specific with regard to the timing of outflows.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute. Accordingly the directors have aggregated 
amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year.
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within the Group, along with professional fees 
to be incurred in relation to the Aurora acquisition and certain other provisions.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
20 Provisions continued
Warranties
Pace provides product warranties for its STBs and gateways from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised 
when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and 
related cost of repair information and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty 
provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty 
estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve 
during the lifetime of the product in the field.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the settlement of warranty claims during the year would be 
seriously prejudicial to other claims under negotiation. Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with 
additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.

The Notice of the Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote 
in relation to resolutions to be passed at the Annual General Meeting. All proxy votes are counted and numbers for, against or withheld 
in relation to each resolution are announced at the Annual General Meeting and published on the Company’s website after the meeting.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 April 2014, shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ power to allot 
shares and buy back shares in the Company and to renew the disapplication of pre-emption rights. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
and/or on voting rights.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change 
of controls following a takeover bid other than in relation to: (i) employee share plans; and (ii) the Company’s borrowings, which 
would become repayable on a takeover being completed.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that: (i) all directors must stand for election at the first Annual General Meeting after 
having been appointed to the Board; and (ii) at each Annual General Meeting, one-third of the directors who are subject to retirement 
by rotation must retire from office and may seek re-election. The Articles set out the procedure for determining the identity of the 
directors to retire at a particular Annual General Meeting.
Shares in the Company are held in the Pace plc Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) for the purpose of satisfying awards made under 
the Company’s employees’ share plans. The Trustees of the Trust may exercise the voting rights attaching to shares held in the Trust 
in respect of which the beneficial interest has not vested in any beneficiary provided that they are satisfied that to do so is in the 
beneficiaries’ interests. The Trustees have waived their right to vote in respect of any such shares held above 5%.

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options 
granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes model. The following table 
gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown. Expectations of early exercise are incorporated 
into the model, where appropriate.
2013 2012
Average share price (cents) 432.0c 202.3c

Expected volatility (%) 50% 50%
Option life (years) 10 10
Dividend yield (%) 1.4% 1.4%
Risk free interest rate (%) 5.0% 5.0%
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options), 
adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The charge for share-based payments is $4.1 million (2012: $7.9 million) which is comprised entirely of equity settled transactions.

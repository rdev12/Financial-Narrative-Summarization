We delivered a successful first year in the turnaround phase of our 
strategic plan. The results were characterised by a 129% increase in 
adjusted earnings per share that were driven primarily by the 56% 
increase in underlying adjusted operating profit. The £7.2m current  
year cash cost of the capacity reduction project was self-financed  
with only a small rise in net debt.

Executive summary 
The year was marked by a number of 
significant achievements in the first 
phase of our turnaround plan. Our focus  
has been on self-help measures and 
these have delivered a 56% increase in 
underlying adjusted operating profit  
in the current year whilst laying strong 
foundations for further growth in the 
new financial year. 
The complex project to reduce excess 
capacity in our Chain division saw 
completion of the closure of the  
Bredbury facility soon after the end of  
the financial year. Whilst project activity  
at the recipient sites continues during  
the first quarter of the new financial year, 
we expect to deliver three quarters of the 
annualised savings of £3.2m in the new 
financial year.
The underlying revenue picture was  
mixed across the world with local 
macro-economic conditions being the 
principal drivers of the overall 1.6% fall. 
The Americas and India both delivered 
good growth while European economies 
were mixed with the net revenue result 
being broadly flat. Underlying Australasian 
revenues were down 7.6%. The commodity 
dependent Australian market was 
particularly weak being down 15.2%.
Underlying revenue in T orque T ransmission 
fell 5.9% as a major mass transit contract 
wound down and demand in extractive 
industries softened.
The increase in adjusted operating  
profit and adjusted earnings per share 
without the benefit of sales growth 
emphasises the value accessible through 
our self-help measures. We remain focused 
on creating a continuous improvement 
culture in all of our locations and activities 
to deliver intelligent and sustainable 
reductions in our cost base. As these 
initiatives take root towards the end of the 
new financial year, we expect to turn our 
attention to the second phase of our 
strategic plan, the Organic Growth phase.

Re-engineering our future
The Bredbury closure project has been  
a major undertaking for the Group.  
It involved the relocation of manufacturing 
operations representing just under 12% 
of the Chain division’s external revenue. 
The project required the coordination  
of five of the six major chain production 
facilities with particular focus on the 
closing site in Bredbury and the principal 
recipient sites in Germany, the USA and 
China. I am pleased to report that the 
project is on time and on budget.
Elsewhere other key initiatives were  
undertaken which included some  
changes in the senior management team 
and recruitment to some newly created 
posts that fill capability gaps in the 
Group such as Product Management, 
Business Systems and Global Chain 
Manufacturing. We have continued  
our focus on improving existing or 
developing new business processes  
and, in particular, have rolled out new 
processes for hazard identification within 
our health and safety programme.
Overview
The past year has seen a huge amount  
of activity within the business, both 
above and below the surface. Above  
the surface, we successfully delivered  
a significant improvement in the Group’s 
underlying adjusted operating profit
1
  
against a backdrop of a small decline  
in revenue. Below the surface we 
successfully executed a large scale and 
complex project to reduce the excess 
manufacturing capacity in the Chain 
division. That project is on time to 
complete in the first quarter of the new 
financial year and will deliver significant 
recurring savings. In addition, the senior 
operational management team was 
strengthened during the year with a 
number of new key hires made to further 
support the Executive team in driving 
forward the pace of change.
Our balance sheet
Close management of our pension 
liabilities remains a key priority for the 
Board as we seek to re-build our balance 
sheet. The merger of the three UK 
defined benefit pension schemes was 
completed successfully in June 2013 with 
overall scheme membership reduced  
by 26% as 1,316 eligible members took 
the option to have their benefits paid  
out in full. Elsewhere, one of our three 
defined benefit schemes in the USA 
moved into surplus in January 2014, 
following strong performance by US 
equity assets, and we have now started 
the termination process which will fully 
de-risk this scheme for the Group. In 
South Africa, the surplus pre-tax funds  
of £1.4m were returned to the Group 
during the year.
The Group will continue to focus on 
measures to reduce its exposure to 
defined benefit pension obligations  
and is well placed to benefit from the 
anticipated rise in interest and discount 
rates over the coming years.
Chairman’s letter
“ The Group is making excellent 
progress in the first phase of our 
strategic plan. The successful 
delivery of the complex capacity 
reduction project in the Chain 
division is a major milestone 
in significantly lowering our 
breakeven point. ”

Strategic Report
Net debt and working capital have 
continued to be closely managed 
throughout the year. The Group took  
on the cash flow burden of the Bredbury 
closure project, which had a total 
expenditure of £7.2m, and still delivered 
net debt only £2.0m higher than at the 
start of the year. In parallel, the Group also 
managed to improve its average working 
capital ratio

 to 17.7% (2013: 19.0%). 
The Board and our people
In a year of significant change initiatives 
within the Group, I am grateful for the 
extra time and commitment that the 
members of the Board have made 
available to support the Executive team. 
The Board has been closely involved in 
the governance of the major projects and 
further evolution of the strategic plan.
I would also like to take this opportunity  
to place on record my heartfelt thanks  
to all of Renold’s employees. Change is 
always a challenge for any organisation 
and our staff responded positively and 
proactively in all locations. I would  
like to record my appreciation of the 
professionalism of our staff in delivering 
projects that, in some cases, ultimately  
led to a loss of employment. Their 
continued commitment is critical to  
our future success.
growth towards the end of the new 
financial year. The foundations we put 
in place during the turnaround phase of 
the strategic plan will be key enablers for 
robust and sustainable growth in the future, 
whether organic or through acquisition.
Renold enjoys a hard earned global 
reputation for high quality products  
and engineering. Our customers have 
demanding application requirements 
which we serve via a wide range of 
bespoke and high quality standard 
products. We remain well placed to 
leverage these key strengths with 
continuous improvement in business 
processes and disciplines that should 
deliver steady annual increases in earnings 
and shareholder value in future years.
Mark Harper
Chairman
Dividend
The Group has significant opportunities 
for investment in new capital equipment 
that will materially enhance our 
performance and support the delivery 
of our strategic objectives. In the current 
year the Board has therefore decided not 
to recommend the payment of a dividend 
but this will remain under review as 
performance continues to improve.
Outlook
The difficult conditions in some of  
our markets has moderated somewhat 
over the course of the year with some 
markets showing signs of modest growth. 
Overall, the external picture remains 
subdued. Hence our focus remains on 
internal improvement. Self-help remains 
our watch word as we aim to create  
and embed a continuous improvement 
philosophy in all aspects of our business, 
whether front line sales and service, 
manufacturing or support functions.  
We are challenging all of our people to 
make their activities more productive 
and more efficient.
While we currently remain firmly focused 
on the turnaround phase of our strategic 
plan, the Executive team is starting to 
turn its attention to the next phase which 
we anticipate will begin to deliver organic  Robert Purcell discusses the strategy 
and development of the business
“ Self-help initiatives remain the 
focus of our attention as we build  
a robust platform for growth. ”

 Chief Executive
Q 
How is the turnaround  
plan progressing? 
A 
We have a three phase plan to 
deliver profitable growth and 
shareholder value. Phase One, the 
Restructure phase, is on track and we are 
making excellent progress, concentrating 
on improving our processes across the 
board and making sure we have the right 
capacity and cost base for the business. 
A key aspect of this phase is our project 
to close the Bredbury facility and transfer 
production to other Renold sites, which 
remains on time and on budget. 
Our aim is to create a robust and 
sustainable business from the 
improvements we are making and it  
is pleasing to see our breakeven point 
reducing as our self-help measures 
continue to deliver benefits. We are 
keenly aware that much remains to be 
done, even with the significant progress 
made this year. We still have many  
areas where we can further improve  
our business and reduce our cost base.
Q 
What other changes are you 
making within the business? 
A 
Firstly, we are working hard 
on our health and safety 
performance. We have introduced 
the Renold Framework through which 
we are ensuring that we perform to the 
same high standards around the world. 
We believe a safe working environment 
is fundamentally aligned with high 
performance in the business as a whole.
We are looking to achieve superior 
performance in all areas of the business. 
Historically the business has been 
tolerant of average performance and has 
not demanded high enough standards. 
We are therefore working to simplify 
processes, to give better service and 
fundamentally make ourselves easier to  
do business with. Our simple objective is  
to ensure that customers receive the 
product and service they require.
We are focused on ensuring that the value 
we generate from our superior products 
stays within the business and delivers 
enhanced returns to shareholders. An 
important aspect of this is to understand 
how and where we add value for our 
customers and to accentuate these 
characteristics. In this way, we aim to 
generate steady and sustainable margin 
improvements year on year. This business 
is more than capable of delivering double 
digit operating margins.
Q 
Where do you see most 
opportunities – in Chain  
or in Torque Transmission?
A 
They are both excellent 
businesses, both are global 
market leaders and both offer 
excellent opportunities. In Chain we 
operate at the leading edge of technology 
with solutions for a range of complex 
applications and environments, from 
water treatment plants to rollercoasters. 
In T orque T ransmission we manufacture a 
range of specialised products, from fluid 
couplings to worm gears and drives. We 
work closely alongside our customers and 
will often manufacture a bespoke solution 
to meet specific application needs.
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 08 Turn to page 15 for
our three–phase 
strategic plan
Q 
 The geographic picture this year 
seems to have been mixed. In 
which areas are you particularly 
strong or weak?
A 
We currently sell our products 
in over 100 countries worldwide, 
and our broad geographic 
portfolio effectively mitigates the impact  
of weak conditions in any one country. 
Although the global economy as a whole  
is improving, region by region the picture  
is more mixed and that can be seen in 
our performance over the year. North 
America, which comprises 38% of our 
global sales, saw good growth with 
underlying revenue up 1.5%. Australasia 
saw a decline, which reflects the 
particular dependence of the Australian 
economy on natural resources. Europe 
was broadly flat although the French 
market was more challenging and 
underlying revenue was down 12%.

www.renold.com
Q 
How are you going to strengthen 
your balance sheet – especially 
in terms of the pension liability?
A 
This is an area of major importance 
for the Group as we aim to reduce 
the impact of the economic cycle 
on our business. We aim to ensure that our 
balance sheet is robust at all stages of the 
cycle. This involves a number of initiatives. 
Throughout the year we have worked hard 
to manage and to reduce our cost base. 
The close management of working capital 
and capital expenditure continues and net 
debt remains in line with our expectations. 
We are employing a number of different 
initiatives to reduce our pensions burden, 
including the completion this year of the 
merger of the UK defined benefit pension 
schemes. We are also looking at realising 
value from our significant tax assets.  
Our objective is to ensure that we have  
a consistent and positive cash flow  
which will be clear evidence that our 
strategy is working.
Q 
Where will future growth  
come from? 
A 
Towards the end of the coming 
year and next, we aim to move 
into the second phase of our plan, 
the Organic Growth phase. We will look 
to leverage our excellent Chain and TT 
products, to capitalise on our global market 
leadership positions, and to drive growth 
from improved sales and marketing 
practices. We have an excellent range  
of products but with greater emphasis  
on product management we will be able  
to penetrate new areas of the market. 
Further into the future, we believe there 
will be opportunities to leverage our  
own scale through acquisitions in our 
fragmented market. All our focus right 
now, though, is on building a robust and 
sustainable business which delivers steady 
improvement in shareholder value and 
provides a platform for future growth.

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 10 How Renold generates value 
Our customers come to us with a wide range of technically 
challenging power transmission problems. In some cases the 
answer is one of our standard solution products. In other 
cases the solution requires proactive engagement with the 
customer’s engineering teams to design a bespoke solution. 
This process will include specifying the exact materials and 
any additional coatings or treatment required to deliver the 
optimal performance solution for the customer.
Our production facilities can use unique manufacturing 
techniques to turn the designs into substance. Our logistics 
teams work with customers to get the products to the right 
location at the right time. The after sales service teams 
respond proactively to any follow on customer requests 
from all three major sales channels. The business model 
cycle can often end where it began with ongoing technical 
and service support that can be provided by an innovative 
range of performance monitoring solutions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 11
Strategic Report What we do
Renold manufactures and sells power transmission products 
and is configured as two separate operating divisions: Chain 
and Torque Transmission.
We operate Chain production facilities in seven countries, 
strategically placed to serve large or growing local markets. 
In re-engineering the Chain business, and with the appointment  
of a Chain Manufacturing Director, we are aiming to create  
an integrated production base that serves our customers 
around the globe in an efficient and effective way.
In Torque Transmission we have a number of specialised  
niche businesses that produce a range of technical products in 
both the industrial couplings and industrial gear markets. We 
manufacture in the UK, the USA, China and South Africa with 
sales and support in additional territories. Our couplings range 
includes fluid based systems, rubber-in-shear and rubber-in-
compression products. In gears, we provide a complete range 
of speciality worm and helical gears and drives.
Who we are
Renold employed an average of 2,379 people around the  
world in the last year, with 55% of our staff engaged in  
direct production activities. The divisional split of staff aligns  
closely with the split of sales with 78% of staff in Chain,  
20% in Torque Transmission and 2% in our head office.
Our global presence
Renold currently sells products in over 100 countries. The key 
regions and territories are represented on the chart opposite.
Our single biggest market is the USA which represents 33.1%  
of external Group sales. In addition, the UK, Australia, and 
Germany each represent over 5% of Group sales by destination 
with Canada, France, Switzerland, China and India also being 
major contributors. The remaining 24% of sales are spread  
over many other countries. This geographic spread reduces  
our dependence on any particular market.
We currently have a limited presence in South American 
markets which may in future represent a growth opportunity 
given our industry specific knowledge of products for sectors 
such as food and agriculture, quarrying and mining, and other 
natural resources – in addition to our wide range of high 
performance industrial chains.

Our business model
continued  The customers we serve
Our markets
Customer concentration for Renold is relatively low. Our  
biggest global customer represents less than 5% of sales. Of  
our five largest customers, three are themselves distributors  
of a wide range of industrial power transmission equipment and 
thus even this limited concentration of our sales is effectively 
sub-segmented into a huge range of end-customers.
We know from market research that these end-customers 
often ask for Renold product by name which emphasises  
that we maintain customer proximity and loyalty even  
when dealing through indirect sales channels.
The remaining customer base is split between end users  
and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Both of  
these user groups give us an opportunity to bring our  
expert knowledge including metallurgy and chemical  
coatings to bear in specifying what are often bespoke  
solutions to specific or unique issues.
The chart opposite shows the extremely diverse markets for 
the approximate 62% of our sales where we serve end users 
and OEMs directly. Distribution sales are excluded from this 
analysis as visibility of the final market is somewhat limited.
It can be clearly seen that we serve a very wide range  
of market sectors, particularly in the Chain division,  
but also in the Torque Transmission division. 
It is also clear that our products are often used in harsh and 
demanding environments where reliability and performance 
are key attributes required by customers. This requirement  
is also evident in safety critical applications. Total cost of 
ownership is a key purchasing criterion. 
Similar to our geographical penetration, we also currently 
estimate that we have relatively low levels of penetration  
in the addressable markets for the majority of our products. 
This creates opportunities for growth in those product sectors 
where we already have an established presence.

1 Significantly improving our health and  
safety performance while broadening  
all risk management activity
We firmly believe that a safe business is a well run and 
profitable business. By changing our health and safety  
culture and developing enhanced policies and processes  
we aim to ensure everyone associated with our business goes 
home each day in the same condition that they came to work.

Generating margin enhancing growth  
from our superior product capability
In the markets we serve, our products are among the 
best in the world. We are focusing on emphasising our  
value proposition in their superior performance, longevity  
and total cost of ownership to ensure that the value  
generated by these characteristics stays within the  
business and earns a return for shareholders.
As the business moves from the turnaround phase of  
our strategic plan to the organic growth phase, we will 
selectively target those sectors and geographies where our 
high performance products can earn an appropriate return.
3 Enhancing customer service By streamlining our business processes and making Renold 
easier to do business with we aim to offer a seamless route  
to market with shorter lead times and improved service levels.
4 Optimising business processes A Group wide programme is underway aimed at implementing 
standardised, efficient and seamless business processes. 
These will cover the full range of commercial, operational  
and support activities. Our ultimate aim is to significantly 
reduce our cost to serve.
5 Lowering our breakeven point The same streamlined business processes that enhance 
customer service will also reduce our installed fixed cost  
base in all of our locations. This will reduce the volatility  
of our profits in relation to changes in sales values.
6  Developing our people We are supplementing the knowledge and experience of our 
existing staff with new hires who bring different, incremental 
skills and experience to Renold. We are also developing 
training solutions to support both existing and new staff.
7 Strengthening our balance sheet  
and improving financial performance
We retain our focus on improving our working capital 
management to support business development through  
stock availability while reducing the amount of cash tied up.
We are actively working to reduce the annual cash burden 
of legacy pension liabilities though a number of different 
initiatives. We also aim to realise value from significant tax 
assets and any surplus properties. 
The overall aim of these activities combined with continuous 
improvement in operating results, is to significantly enhance 
the cash generation capability of the Group.

Future aims Risks and mitigation
1.  Significantly improving our 
health and safety 
performance
There is no simple short term solution to improving health and safety culture and performance. It requires perseverance 
and constant vigilance. During the year we implemented a new overarching framework for our approach to health and 
safety (known as ‘the Framework’). We also implemented a rolling audit programme with the recruitment of a dedicated 
and experienced health and safety auditor. 
LTAs
Reportable  
Incident Rates
Lost Time Days
Safety opportunities
Our overarching objective is to achieve zero accidents  
every year. Each site will implement a rolling programme to 
identify opportunities for safety improvements each year.
We are rolling out a training programme for all managers  
to ensure a consistent and shared base level of relevant 
skills and understanding.
In the new financial year we will also introduce a Group 
wide Health and Safety Awards programme to raise 
awareness and standards.
Organisational change increases the risk of accidents, 
particularly when the change is on a large scale and in 
production environments. The Group is mitigating this 
risk by considering in advance of any change, full risk 
assessments and new safe operating procedures.
The increased focus on audit may create a false 
impression of a worsening trend which should be  
borne in mind when assessing data.
2.  Generating margin 
enhancing growth 
from our superior 
product capability
At the current stage in our strategic plan we are not yet focused on delivering top line sales growth and hence our 
focus has been on margin enhancement through improving our efficiency and ensuring that our technical products 
achieve appropriate value in the market.
Our activities have included reviews of our product and margin mix. Through this process we have begun altering  
the mix to give ourselves a start in the trend towards higher margins.
RoS%
Adjusted EPS
ROCE%
We are aiming to deliver steady improvements in RoS % 
each year to ultimately achieve double digit operating 
margins. We are targeting steady annual gains to ensure 
they are robust and sustainable.
Our objective is to deliver double digit margins  
against a zero sales growth background. A significant  
fall in sales or a rapid appreciation in input costs could 
jeopardise this outcome if we were not able to respond 
quickly and effectively.
3.  Enhancing 
customer service
Our market research tells us that while customers value our products and technical capability, we are not always  
as easy to do business with as we should be.
Therefore, one of the key areas for improvement during the turnaround phase of the strategic plan is to change our 
business processes to deliver a faster, more efficient and seamless service proposition to our customers.
During the year we have implemented a number of new service metrics and objectives with a pilot in our European 
Chain business. These include target service levels to respond to customer queries and to reduce the lead times to 
deliver a quotation to a customer for standard or adapted chain.
Improvement in:
–  Customer contact 
response times
–  Quotation lead 
times
–  On Time Delivery 
In Full
Our aim is to show a steady and regular improvement  
in all metrics.
Excellent customer service requires efficient business 
processes and systems that deliver replicable, predictable 
and timely outcomes. As the Group is changing and 
improving many of our business processes and systems, 
this creates a risk to current service levels. This risk is 
being mitigated by a newly created Steering Committee 
with responsibility for oversight and approval of all 
business system change requests.
4.  O p timising 
business processes
Business processes have been improved in all functional areas. For example, on the commercial side, we have vastly 
increased the number of customer quotations coming directly from our systems, thereby cutting customer response 
times. In operations, as part of the Bredbury closure project, we have implemented a service cell dedicated to fast 
turnaround times on selected chain, assembled from a standard list of stocked components. 
Under development:
Each of our business 
processes will have  
its own set of KPIs
Our intention is to create one global, integrated, ERP 
system. Our cost to serve will be reduced and this work  
will also feed into the KPIs for customer service.
Changes to systems and processes may in the short 
term reduce performance as users learn new skills. If 
changes are not managed properly, the performance 
reduction and its duration can grow.
Our new Director of Business Systems is a key hire  
in mitigating this risk.
5.  Lowering our 
breakeven point
During the year we delivered a major reduction in excess Chain manufacturing capacity and overhead burden through 
the closure of our Bredbury facility. The production processes were successfully transferred to other Renold locations 
and the remaining activities are on track to complete at the end of the first quarter of the new financial year.
Elsewhere we built on overhead reductions started in the second half of the prior year with further reductions of £0.9m 
to give net, year on year, reductions in underlying overheads of £3.4m.
Total overheads As we re-engineer our business processes we aim to reduce 
the cost to serve of all of our activities. Our medium term 
goal is to deliver meaningful annual reductions in our 
overheads to support the delivery of enhanced margins  
and shareholder value.
Overhead structures tend to be inflexible and can  
be a major financial burden in a downturn. Our new 
processes are being designed with more flexibility in 
mind to reduce this risk.
6.  De v eloping  
our people
We have created a number of new key positions in the Group to emphasise and underpin our drive to manage the 
business in a more integrated way where there are benefits to be gained from sharing best practice and eliminating 
unnecessary duplication. These posts include a new Chain Manufacturing Director and a Group Business Systems 
Director. We have also refreshed our senior management team and a number of other key leadership positions have 
also seen new hires. With the senior team now in place, the pace of change and number of initiatives under 
management can be increased.
Under development Performance management processes and systems in the 
business are currently somewhat ad-hoc and inefficient.  
We aim to deliver a performance management system that 
assesses performance but that also both identifies training 
and development needs and supports delivery of them.
Change can be unsettling for all staff creating a risk  
of some staff leaving due to feelings of uncertainty.
To counter some of this we are increasing the regularity 
and content of communication to give all staff a clearer 
sense of direction.
7 .  S tr engthening  
our balance sheet
We completed the merger of the three UK defined benefit pension schemes. This has significantly reduced the ongoing 
administration costs of the schemes. At the same time, 1,316 members with small pension pots opted to have their 
entitlements paid out as lump sums which led to a reduction in scheme liabilities and assets of £10.9m and £10.4m 
respectively. Fewer members in the scheme will lead to lower overall administrative costs.
In the USA one of the three defined benefit schemes moved into a surplus following strong equity asset performance 
and the formal termination of that scheme has now commenced to allow it to be fully de-risked.
Our working capital ratio further improved to 17.7% (2013: 19.0%), equivalent to a reduction in average net debt of £2.4m 
based on current annual sales.
Annual underlying 
cost of servicing 
legacy pensions.

Gearing ratio
Ultimately we aim to de-risk the Group from all defined 
benefit pension liabilities. The short term focus is on 
managing down the larger exposures in the UK and 
Germany. We aim to have stable annual cash costs to 
enhance predictability. We want to optimise working capital  
to support the business while minimising the cash tied up.
Work is ongoing to identify an appropriate level of gearing 
for the Group.
Pension liabilities fluctuate with factors outside the 
Group’s control (interest rates, inflation expectations, 
longevity and returns on assets). The key is to be ready 
to de-risk when the market opportunity arises. Legislative 
changes can also lead to changes in liabilities and 
opportunities for de-risking. 
Working capital can take time to unwind and in the 
event of a sudden downturn in activity the Group  
could be left with excess stock.
To mitigate this risk we have deployed working capital 
management tools and WC % is a monthly monitored KPI.
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 16
Our strategic progress
We have made a robust start to the turnaround phase of our three-phase strategic plan. This turnaround phase requires us  
to rebuild our foundations, to remind ourselves of the high quality and value adding products that we deliver to the market  
and to our customers, and, in some cases, create new disciplines and basic processes that had withered in the business. We are 
working to develop detailed improvement projects for all aspects of our business – whether individual geographical locations, 
production facilities or worldwide business support functions. We are challenging every aspect of what we do and how we do it 
– seeking to create a continuous improvement culture throughout Renold. Hence, we really are ‘re-engineering everything we do’ . Strategic objective Progress in 2013/14 KPIs

Chain Performance Review
Underlying external revenue of £139.6m 
was virtually flat, being 0.2% behind the 
prior year. The regional picture was more 
mixed and reflected differences in local 
macro-economic conditions. The Americas 
and India delivered good growth of 5.3% 
and 4.7% respectively. Performance was 
also mixed within Europe itself with an 
overall fall of £1.0m (1.7%) being caused  
by a £1.1m (12.4%) fall in our French 
business with broadly flat performance  
in other territories. Underlying revenue  
in Australasia fell £1.8m (7.6%), wholly 
explained by the £2.2m (15.2%) fall in 
Australia itself which was impacted by  
a slowdown in activity within the natural 
resources sector. Our Chinese Chain 
business focuses on supporting other 
Group companies and its own direct 
external sales saw a small decline.
Underlying order intake grew by 1.4% 
with the first half ahead 0.5% and the 
second half 2.2% ahead (the latter being 
against a relatively weak second half  
in the prior year). At a regional level, 
European underlying order intake was  
up 1.8% and in the Americas it was up 
5.3%. Similar to the underlying revenue 
picture, the position was much weaker  
in Australasia where underlying order 
intake was down 11.6% with Australia 
itself down 16.6%. The smaller regions  
of China and India, in terms of externally 
focused activity, both delivered growth. 
The profile of our order intake (and hence 
our revenue profile also) has become 
more stable during the year with less 
reliance being placed on large one off 
orders which can have an adverse impact 
by disrupting our production processes.
The Chain division is exemplified by 
an extensive product range reaching 
into a wide number of geographies.
>  Sales offices and distribution 
channels in over 18 countries 
worldwide.
>  Extensive product range that  
can be customised or designed 
from scratch for any application.
>  Solution chains for many

Our performance
Chain The book to bill ratio in the Chain division 
finished the year at 100.4% indicating 
that the absolute level of underlying 
order intake was higher than the 
absolute level of revenue during the  
year. A result around 100% for this key 
metric suggests relatively flat sales with  
a result over 100% suggesting sales 
growth in the future. The Chain division 
delivered a result over 100% for five out 
of the six months in the second half.
Contribution margins, being the margin 
after all variable production costs, 
improved during the year. In part this was 
due to more predictable manufacturing 
activity following the reduction in large 
stocking orders. This change allowed a 
lowering of overtime and other inefficient 
production costs and also reduced under 
utilisation in the period which would have 
followed a stocking order. Direct labour 
costs were adverse to the prior year by 
0.8% of revenue and this was largely due 
to additional activity undertaken during 
the transfer of production from the 
Bredbury facility to sister sites where the 
extra labour and labour inefficiencies were 
treated as normal operating costs. Once 
the recipient sites have fully absorbed the 
Bredbury production load, a key task will 
be to deliver a second phase of operational 
efficiencies that will flow from the 
operating leverage at those sites.
Underlying net overheads were reduced  
by £2.5m in the year. Gross savings  
of £3.0m were offset by an additional 
£0.5m of depreciation on one of our  
ERP systems. Overhead reductions  
in the year were delivered by all Chain 
regions with the exception being India 
where overheads were flat. The overall 
gains in the year were part of the global 
effort to streamline our processes and 
structures and are part of our continuous 
improvement effort.
As a result of continuing reductions in 
overheads and measures to improve our 
contribution margins, adjusted operating 
profit rose 46% to £9.9m (2013: £6.8m), 
delivering a Return on Sales of 7.1% 
(2013: 4.9%). With the exception of 
Australasia, all Chain regions delivered 
an increase in absolute levels of adjusted 
operating profit and also Return on  
Sales ratio irrespective of whether their 
underlying sales grew, were flat, or 
declined. Australasia and Australia itself 
faced an additional challenge during the 
year of a rapidly depreciating foreign 
exchange rate for the Australian dollar 
which fell by 24% against sterling and 
21% against the Euro which are two  
of the principal trading currencies for  
the business. This currency change is 
inevitably having an inflationary impact 
on input costs which we have taken 
action to recover with a combination  
of price rises and overhead reductions.
Capacity reduction project
The single largest initiative undertaken by 
the Group during the year was the closure 
of the Bredbury Chain manufacturing 
facility and transfer of production to sister 
facilities around the world. Prior to its 
closure the Bredbury facility produced 
chain that accounted for approximately 
12% of all Renold external chain sales 
globally. The transfer of this production  
to three main recipient sites was a major 
and complex undertaking and hence it 
was managed by a dedicated external 
project manager with full time support 
from a number of internal personnel. The 
project also benefited from additional 
oversight from a steering committee 
chaired by the Group Chief Executive and  
a monitoring committee of the Board. 
The project involved the transfer of  
over 70 pieces of existing equipment  
as well as the sourcing of new and 
re-conditioned equipment in local 
markets at the recipient sites. In 
Germany and the USA building works 
were required to modify existing work 
areas and to create additional space.  
In total, the production of approximately 
17,000 part numbers was re-located with 
the requirement for those same items  
to have bills of materials and routings 
transferred to the recipient sites.
The expected benefits from phase one  
of the project, which represents the 
difference in overhead and cost bases 
before and after the project, are in the 
region of £3.2m on an annualised basis. 
The recipient sites have also been set  
an additional phase two challenge to 
address once the production process 
transfer is complete and bedded down. 
That second challenge is to deliver 
operating efficiencies by leveraging the 
additional throughput brought about by 
the transfer project and these benefits 
are targeted to start flowing in the 
second half of the new financial year.

Newly commissioned US aircraft carrier
FLT chain is designed to carry very high loads by virtue  
of the numerous interlaced plates mounted on a common 
chain pin. The chain has been further optimised by Renold  
to give high fatigue and wear resistance through careful 
selection of materials and our production processes.
The chain will be used on a newly commissioned US naval 
aircraft carrier in a critical cargo lifting role, which is a key 
part of the ship’s logistics. Renold FLT chain was chosen for 
its long life and reliability in this mission critical application 
and for the same reasons is specified widely for many  
of the world’s leading material handling companies.
Often used on forklift trucks, hence the name, this product  
is also used in a wide range of applications from port 
handling equipment to flood defence systems.

production process. They help convert the raw materials  
into the primary product, cane sugar. Renold has serviced 
the sugar cane industry for over 80 years.
Processing of sugar cane creates a variety of environmental 
challenges for power transmission products including 
abrasion, corrosion and repeated heavy loads throughout  
the various elements of the system. To cope with this,  
in the wash down conveyor shown, customised heat 
treatment and excellent surface finish of the chain  
bush and pins contribute to a product which resists  
fatigue and other aspects of the harsh environment.
The well established ability of Renold products to survive

Torque Transmission performance
Underlying external revenue of  
£44.4m was 5.9% behind the prior year. 
The majority of the £2.8m underlying  
fall in revenue arose from the wind  
down of a major mass transit contract 
that came to an end in the first quarter 
with a year on year reduction of £2.7m  
in the current year. In addition, revenues 
were negatively impacted by a downturn 
in the mineral extraction and processing 
sector as both the equipment manufacturers 
and the end user markets continued to 
reduce their demand during the first half 
of the year. The rate of revenue decline 
slowed slightly during the second half of 
the year as key geographical markets 
show some signs of bottoming out though 
this has taken longer than first estimated.
In contrast to the revenue picture, 
underlying order intake for the year 
experienced a modest fall of 0.3% with 
the first half reduction of 2.3% being 
almost offset by year on year growth  
of 2.1% in the second half. The upturn in 
order intake was less oriented towards 
the large mass transit contracts which 
tended to have lower margins in the  
past, and four of the seven operating 
units posted growth in underlying order 
intake in the second half. Investment  
in power generation in Asian markets 
returned at the start of year, whilst the 
metals industry improved slightly. The 
marine market, which has seen very  
weak demand for several years, is now 
showing early signs of recovery. We are 
aiming to enhance our prospects with 
the development of new products that

Our performance
Torque Transmission have contributed to new orders, for 
example, escalator products in both 
Europe and America.
The stronger finish to the year, with 
fourth quarter orders ahead by 4.7%, 
brought the book to bill ratio for the year 
to 98%. A result close to 100% for this 
key metric suggests sales should level  
off in the short term if the rate of order 
intake is maintained. In absolute terms 
the underlying external order intake was 
£0.8m below the equivalent revenue 
figure in the year. 
Contribution margins, being the  
margin after all variable production 
costs, improved during the year (as was 
the case in the Chain division). In part 
this was the result of the lower margin 
mass transit business that came to an 
end during the year but it was also 
supported by focusing more sales effort  
on the higher performance products  
in the portfolio. Other production  
cost ratios such as labour were relatively 
flat compared to the prior year, leaving 
further benefits to be pursued as we 
implement more efficient manufacturing 
processes and techniques.
Underlying net overheads in the  
division were reduced by £0.9m before  
an additional £0.3m charge in respect  
of the depreciation of the Group’s ERP 
system. These savings were the result  
of a number of initiatives in each location 
rather than one major restructuring 
project. The overall gains in the year  
were part of the global effort to streamline 
our processes and structures and are 
part of our continuous improvement 
effort which applies as much in the 
Torque Transmission business as it  
does in the Chain division. 
The combination of the gains in 
contribution margins and ongoing 
overhead reductions led to a healthy 
increase in the adjusted net operating 
margin of 1.9% to 13.1%. The absolute 
level of adjusted operating profit also 
rose by £0.8m to £6.1m before the impact 
of the additional ERP depreciation of 
£0.3m. This was achieved despite the 
reduction in external revenue of £2.8m 
and operating margin gains were spread 
over four of the seven units within the 
division. The gains in contribution margin 
extended to five out of the seven operating 
units and net operating margin gains 
were delivered in four of the units. 
However, our South African business  
did encounter difficulties throughout  
the year with a range of external issues 
such as the macro-economic situation, 
particularly in the mining sector where 
investment and maintenance spend has 
been negatively impacted by industrial 
unrest, and also a significant 25.9% 
reduction in the value of the South 
African Rand against sterling and  
23.0% against the Euro.

Strategic Report “ The Group successfully delivered  
a complex and significant plant 
closure project against a 
background of improving margins, 
working capital reductions and 
close management of our cash 
resources. In parallel, long term 
benefits were secured for our  
cost of capital and medium term 
pension funding costs. ”
 Brian Tenner 
 Finance Director
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 30
Overview
We have delivered a number of key  
steps to support our strategic objective  
to strengthen our balance sheet, improve 
our ability to generate free cash flow and 
to reduce our exposure to legacy pension 
cash costs. We were also able to continue 
improvements in our average working 
capital ratio, achieving a reduction for the 
fourth year in succession. During the year, 
the Group completed the restructuring  
of its internal capital structure. This 
optimises the benefits of the re-financing 
in 2012/13 and will further reduce our cost 
of debt in 2014/15. The completion of the 
UK pension scheme merger in June 2013 
achieves an annual cash flow saving of 
£1.0m with a full year’s benefit in 2014/15.
Orders and revenue
Order intake during the year was  
almost identical to revenue with the 
underlying ratio of orders to revenue 
(book to bill) being 99.8% (2013: 97.2%). 
As expected, the first half had a slower 
start with underlying orders £0.3m  
below underlying revenue (2013: orders  
£5.1m below revenue). In the second  
half orders exceeded revenue by £2.0m 
(2013: orders £0.8m below revenue). As 
set out on pages 18 and 19 and 24 and 
25, Chain and Torque Transmission 
experienced mixed performance in the 
two halves of the year.
Group revenue for the year decreased by 
3.3% to £184.0m. On an underlying basis, 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 
the decrease was lower at 1.6% (£3.0m). 
The Chain Division was virtually flat year 
on year with a 0.1% fall in underlying 
revenue. Torque Transmission therefore 
accounted for the overall drop in Group 
revenue with a divisional fall of 5.9%.
Operating result
The Group generated £5.1m of adjusted 
operating profit in the first half  
(2013: £3.6m) and £6.0m in the second 
half (2013: £3.6m) with a full year result  
of £11.1m (2013: £7.2m). The second half 
result was achieved on 2.6% (£2.4m) 
lower underlying revenue than the first 
half. This reflects improving margin 
outcomes and ongoing cost reduction 
activity as we continue to lower our 
breakeven point. The year on year 
reduction in net overheads of £3.4m was 
achieved against the headwind of £0.8m 
of additional depreciation on the ERP 
system which began to depreciate in the 
fourth quarter of the prior year. All Chain 
regions and the Torque Transmission 
division contributed to this reduction in 
overheads as set out in the divisional 
performance reviews.
Changes in foreign exchange rates 
resulted in operating charges of £0.4m  
in the year. All else being equal, there 
would be a further reduction of £0.5m 
operating profit if the year end exchange 
rates applied throughout the year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 31
Strategic Report
Exceptional items
The exceptional charges of £11.8m  
(2013: £12.3m) were predominantly driven 
by the closure of the Bredbury facility 
and are detailed in Note 2(c) to the Group 
financial statements with additional 
narrative in the Chain performance 
review on pages 18 and 19.
Financing costs
External net interest costs in the  
year were £1.8m (2013: £2.9m). The 
decrease on the prior year was the  
result of the restructuring of the Group’s 
internal capital structure following the  
refinancing in the prior year of the 
Group’s principal borrowing facilities. The 
annual charge includes £0.3m in respect 
of amortisation of the refinancing costs 
paid in 2012 which are being expensed 
over the four year term of the facility.
Net IAS 19 finance charges (which are a 
non-cash item) were £2.8m (2013: £2.5m), 
the net movement being due to lower 
interest rates on a higher opening liability 
figure. All figures in respect of pension 
financing costs have been restated in 
accordance with the changes to the 
relevant accounting standard (IAS 19 
Employee Benefits) and the impact of  
that change is set out in more detail in the 
Accounting Policies section to the financial 
statements. In the current year, the actual 
return on assets was £1.5m higher than 
the return used in the interest calculation 
as specified in IAS 19. The difference 
appears as a gain in the Statement of 
Other Comprehensive Income.
Result before tax
Profit before tax and exceptional items 
was £5.9m (2013: £0.6m restated). The 
loss before tax after exceptional items 
was £5.9m (2013: loss of £11.9m restated).
The business uses underlying measures 
of orders and sales in its daily reporting 
activities. This metric retranslates the 
prior year orders and sales to the 
current year foreign exchange rates to 
give a more meaningful comparison of 
performance. The same is also true for 
operating profit and earnings measures 
which are stated on an adjusted  
basis that strips out the impact of 
exceptional items, foreign exchange,  
the administration costs of closed 
legacy pension schemes and pension  
financing charges as these adjusted 
items are deemed to better reflect the 
performance of the ongoing business.

Debt facility and capital structure
The Group’s primary banking facility  
is for a four year term, maturing in  
October 2016. The facility comprises  
a committed £41m Multi-Currency 
Revolving Credit Facility (MRCF), and  
an additional £8m of ancillary facilities. 
These facilities have been provided  
by Lloyds Bank plc and Svenska 
Handelsbanken AB. 
The principal covenants are the Net 
Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio (calculated 
on a rolling 12 months basis), which  
has been set at a maximum of 2.5 times 
until maturity, and Adjusted EBITDA/
Interest cover which is required to be 
greater than 4.0 times until maturity.  
The Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio  
as at 31 March 2014 is 1.5 times  
(2013: 1.9 times), based on the period  
end net debt of £24.8m (2013: net 
debt £22.8m). The Adjusted EBITDA/
interest cover as at 31 March 2014 is  
8.7 times (2013: 4.2 times).
The Group also benefits from numerous 
other smaller overseas facilities totalling 
£3.4m.
At 31 March 2014 the Group had unused 
credit facilities totaling £9.0m and cash 
balances of £6.7m. Total Group credit 
facilities amounted to £44.4m with 
£41.0m being committed.
Treasury and financial instruments
The Group’s treasury policy, approved  
by the Directors, is to manage its  
funding requirements and treasury risks 
without undertaking any speculative 
risks. Treasury and financing matters  
are assessed further in the section on 
Principal risks and uncertainties on 
pages 36 to 38. Note 25 to the Group 
financial statements provides further 
details of financial instruments.
Taxation
The current year tax charge of £4.8m 
(2013: tax credit of £0.1m) is made up  
of a current tax charge of £1.2m  
(2013: charge of £0.7m) and a deferred  
tax charge of £3.6m (2013: credit of 
£0.8m). The Group cash tax paid was 
much lower at £0.9m (2013: £0.7m) and 
the difference is due to the utilisation  
of tax losses and other tax assets in 
various parts of the Group.
Group results for the financial period
Loss for the financial year ended  
31 March 2014 was £10.7m (2013: loss  
of £11.8m) and the basic and diluted loss 
per share 4.9p (2013: loss 5.4p for both). 
The basic and diluted adjusted earnings 
per share was 3.2p (2013: earnings 1.4p).
Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2014 were £18.1m 
(2013: £31.0m). The net liability for 
retirement benefit obligations was 
£49.3m (2013: £56.3m) after allowing  
for a net deferred tax asset of £15.6m 
(2013: £13.2m). Overseas schemes now 
account for £18.8m (38%) of the post tax 
pension deficits and £16.3m of this is in 
respect of the German scheme which is 
not required to be prefunded (see 
Pensions section on pages 33 to 35).
Cash flow and borrowings
Cash generated from operations was 
£6.1m (2013: £8.2m). Capital expenditure 
was increased to £7.1m (2013: £4.9m), 
largely due to £2.1m of capital expenditure 
incurred on the Bredbury closure project. 
Further gains were made in working 
capital management with reductions 
equivalent to £2.4m. 
These gains were despite a planned 
increase in safety stock as part of the 
Bredbury closure project. 
Group net borrowings at 31 March 2014  
of £24.8m were £2.0m higher than the 
opening position of £22.8m comprising 
cash and cash equivalents of £6.7m  
(2013: £9.8m) and borrowings (which 
include £0.5m of preference stock) of 
£31.5m (2013: £32.6m).
To manage foreign currency exchange 
risk on the translation of net investments, 
certain Dollar denominated borrowings 
taken out in the UK to finance US 
acquisitions had been designated as  
a hedge of the net investment in US 
subsidiaries. At 31 March 2014 this hedge 
was fully effective. The carrying value of 
these borrowings at 31 March 2014 was 
£5.2m (2013: £6.4m). 
The impact of transactional foreign 
exchange gains and losses during the year 
was a loss of £0.4m which is included  
in the operating profit result. This was 
primarily driven by the appreciation  
in the value of sterling purchases in 
overseas locations such as Australia  
and India as well as the impact of the 
Euro appreciating against the US dollar.
At 31 March 2014, the Group had 2% 
(2013: 2%) of its gross debt at fixed 
interest rates. Cash deposits are  
placed short term with banks where 
security and liquidity are the primary 
objectives. The Group has no significant 
concentrations of credit risk with sales 
made to a wide spread of customers, 
industries and geographies. Policies  
are in place to ensure that credit  
risk on individual customers is  
kept to a minimum.

of deferred tax) at 31 March 2014. The 
drivers of change are shown on the 
waterfall chart on page 35. One of the 
Group’s US pension schemes has moved 
into surplus during the year and since  
the year end the formal termination 
process has begun to wind up the 
scheme, secure member benefits and 
hence fully de-risk it from the Group’s 
perspective at minimal additional cost.
The aggregate expense of administering  
the pension schemes was £0.6m  
(2013: £1.3m) which is now included  
in operating costs but is excluded in 
arriving at adjusted operating profit. 
Exceptional pension merger and asset 
backed funding costs of £nil (2013: £0.7m) 
were incurred to complete a project 
initiated in the second half of the prior 
year. This has led to a £1.0m reduction  
in annualised cash costs in the UK with 
effect from the end of the first quarter  
of the current financial year. 
Summary
The focus for the management team 
remains on steady and continuous 
improvement in our day to day  
business processes and performance.  
We are working to support this activity 
with initiatives to improve our working 
capital management, including adding 
stock or resources to support business 
development activity. Separately, we  
aim to ensure that the legacy issues  
the Group faces are ring fenced as  
much as possible from the day to day 
operation of the business to ensure  
they are neither a distraction nor a 
hindrance. The improvements in our  
cost of debt and pension liability 
management represent a series of 
successful outcomes in delivering our 
strategic goal of strengthening our 
balance sheet.

UK pensions scheme merger and  
asset backed funding structure
Agreement was reached at the end  
of the last financial year to merge the  
three UK schemes into the Renold 
Supplementary Pensions Scheme 
(subsequently renamed the Renold 
Pension Scheme ‘RPS’). The merger  
was completed on 26 June 2013, with 
1,316 members taking wind-up lump  
sums to the value of £10.4m and, as a 
result, a small settlement gain of £0.5m 
was recognised. The remaining assets  
of the Renold Group Pensions Scheme 
and J&S Retirement Benefit Plan were 
transferred into the RPS and full wind-up 
of those schemes was triggered on 
27 June 2013. The merged scheme had 
3,635 members as at 31 March 2014 
compared to 5,118 at the start of the year.
The merged UK pension funds are 
underpinned by a 25 year asset backed 
partnership structure which provides 
annual cash contributions of £2.5m to 
the pension fund, with annual increases 
linked to RPI and capped at 5%. The 
contribution includes the first £0.5m  
of annual scheme operating expenses 
each year with the Company meeting  
any excess expense costs. The detailed 
structure and mechanics of the merger 
and underpinning asset backed funding 
structure are set out in Note 18 to  
the accounts. The triennial actuarial 
valuation of the RPS as at 5 April 2013 
was completed following the year end 
and no additional contributions in excess 
of those generated by the asset backed 
funding structure are currently required.
The new arrangements do not have a 
substantive net impact on the Group’s 
tax position.

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 34
 → The pie charts show the current make up of the UK pension scheme 
membership and asset allocation as at 31 March 2014.
 → The membership profile has changed over the last decade with 54%  
of members being either pensioners or dependents today compared  
to 48% in 2002.
 → The total number of scheme members has fallen by 60% since 2002  
to 3,635 today. Of this reduction, net mortality explains 41% with a 
further 32% due to net leavers from the schemes (whether through the 
recent Trivial Commutation exercises or members opting to transfer 
their entitlements elsewhere).
 → Given the relative maturity of the scheme 45% of assets are now 
invested in gilts and corporate bonds. It is expected that these are held  
to maturity and they are held primarily to generate an income stream 
that supports the ongoing annual pension payments made (currently 
circa £10.6m per annum including cash lump sums on retirement).
 → The overall target for UK portfolio returns is 6.6%.
 → The actual return in the year was 4.6% compared to the return (based on 
the discount rate on the scheme liabilities) used in the IAS 19 financing 
charge calculation of 4.3% (this led to a gain of £0.9m which added to 
overseas outperformance of £0.6m gives a gain of £1.5m included within 
remeasurement gains of £2.9m disclosed in the Statement of Other 
Comprehensive Income).
 → It should be noted that the hedge fund and dynamic diversified growth 
funds both have characteristics of gilts in that returns are lower and  
aim to be less volatile than equities but that their returns are targeted  
to be higher than simple gilts and bonds.
 → The chart shows the evolution of the number of members of the UK 
defined benefit schemes over the last ten years. 
 → The chart also shows the profile of the different categories of member.  
The category shown as pensioners includes surviving dependents of 
pensioners who are drawing their benefits as a spouse or dependent child.
 → All three UK defined benefit schemes were closed to new members  
and future accrual by March 2010 and hence membership of the active 
category fell to zero.
 → The significant step down in total membership and in individual 
membership of the deferred and pensioner categories in 2014 followed 
the scheme merger in June 2013. At that time 1,316 members opted to 
have their small pension entitlements paid out as a lump sum and hence 
they ceased to be members of the scheme.
 → Other movements in each year mainly result from deferred members 
either retiring or transferring out of the schemes or from mortality 
amongst pensioner members.
 → The Group is currently reviewing the potential impact of the proposed 
changes in legislation as set out in the recent budget. That legislation 
suggests that more members will be entitled to take their pension  
pots as a lump sum benefit which may have implications for the future 
membership of the UK scheme and on its costs of administration. The 
legislation has not yet been enacted and hence it is not yet possible to 
be definitive on any potential impact.

 → German and American discount rates fell by 0.35% and 0.3% 
respectively increasing the deficit by £1.0m and £0.4m in each case.
 → The settlement gain arose on the merger of the UK pension schemes  
as 1,316 members withdrew their entitlements in a lump sum.
 → Net asset out performance compared to the IAS 19 discount rate  
reduced the deficit by £1.5m.
 → The South African surplus was returned to the Group as an unrestricted 
asset and hence is no longer considered a pension asset.
 → The charts show the future cash outflows expected for the UK and 
German pension schemes, split between scheme members who have 
already retired and those who have not yet retired. Both cash flow  
profiles have been discounted using the discount rates used to value  
the total liabilities of the schemes as shown in the financial statements. 
 → The chart for the UK scheme shows that the scheme has already passed 
peak funding. This means that the peak annual cash outflow has already 
been passed and therefore, all else being equal, future cash flows will 
reduce in line with the profile above. It should be noted, however, that 
the profile assumes that all members draw their pension in regular 
payments rather than pursuing the small lump sum or trivial 
commutation route noted above.

 → The German chart also shows that peak funding has been passed but 
also the maturity of the scheme as evidenced by the relatively steep 
decline in annual cash flows in the medium term. By the end of the  
fifth year the annual cash outflow will have reduced by 15% compared  
to the cash flow this year and by 30% by the end of the tenth year.
 → The German scheme closed to new members in 1992 and the current 
average age of members is 68 years old.
 → The Group has initiated action to close the scheme to future accrual  
and the outcome of the court mediation process is expected to be 
known in the second half of the new financial year. Renold’s risk management framework is designed to identify and assess the probability 
and consequences of risks occurring and to manage the actions necessary to reduce the 
risks and to mitigate their impact.
Set out below are the known principal risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the Group together with the 
corresponding mitigating actions that have been taken by the Group. Additional risks not currently known or which are currently 
regarded as immaterial could also affect future performance.
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Strategic risks
↓ Business strategy
A strategy which does not match the  
Group’s circumstances, capabilities  
or potential will fail to create  
shareholder value.
The Group is developing a new strategy  
to deliver a turnaround in performance and  
to make that performance more stable and  
less exposed to revenue volatility. Unless 
successfully implemented the Group will  
continue to experience volatile results and  
weak levels of cash generation. These are  
basic requirements to allow the delivery  
of sustainable and consistent growth in 
shareholder value.
A new three phase strategic plan has been developed 
(refer to page 15). In parallel, a new and detailed 
operating model has also been specified and is now 
in the process of being implemented.
Structural re-engineering of our business processes 
and cost base is also underway and has already 
delivered significant reductions in our breakeven 
point. This is an ongoing process which will be 
embedded as continuous improvement in all of our 
business activities.
New and relevant Key Performance Indicators are 
being developed for all of our activities to monitor  
the delivery of the three phase strategy.
↓ Macro-economic and political
We operate in 18 countries and sell to 
customers in over 100 and therefore  
we are necessarily exposed to economic 
and political risks in these territories  
such as recession or the imposition of 
trade barriers.
The continuing fragile macro-economic 
climate in the Eurozone and Australia  
is a specific source of risk.
Key territory sales profile is shown below:
USA 33% (of Group sales)
Germany 7%
UK  9%
Australia  7%
Adverse macro-economic or political changes in 
any of these territories could have a material 
negative effect on the Group’s financial 
performance and condition and is a key driver 
for the objective to lower our breakeven point.
Our diversified geographic footprint inherently 
exposes us to more countries where risks arise  
but conversely mitigates the risk of over-exposure  
in any one country.
Actions to lower the Group’s overall breakeven  
point also serve to reduce the impact of a global 
economic slowdown.
Continuous monitoring of macro-economic trends,  
industry specific and internal leading indicators.
Strong core banking group with multi-currency  
debt facility supported by matching cash flows  
plus improving EBITDA.
← → Raw material price volatility
Increases in the cost of raw materials  
may not always be recoverable or have 
delays in recovery due to weakness in 
demand or competitor actions.
If raw material costs fall, the Group  
may face customer pressure to reduce 
prices or experience a fall in demand.
Approximately 35% of the Group’s sales  
value is spent on raw materials with steel  
being the primary purchase.
Steel prices experienced by the Group  
have been relatively stable recently  
following previous periods of considerable 
volatility. Unrecovered cost increases  
would have a material effect on the Group’s 
financial performance.
Continuous monitoring of different international  
steel price indices to give early warning of  
negative trends.
Where contractually possible, we pass on  
price increases.
Stock holdings are managed to maintain a  
forward hedge on input costs and time buffer  
to allow negotiations with customers and  
suppliers on price increases.
← →  Competitive markets and  
technology advancements
Renold operates in highly competitive 
markets with customer decisions based 
typically on quality, technology, service  
and price. New entrants or consolidation  
of existing competitors could restrict our 
ability to deliver our strategic objectives.
Renold may lose customers to competitors  
if we are unable to adapt to market 
developments due to changes in consumer 
preferences, regulatory or industry 
requirements or competitive technologies.
Highly fragmented market may reduce risk  
of significant competitive pressure.
Strategic objective to improve service and  
enhance customer relationships will deliver  
a more loyal customer base.
Investment in new technology and  
engineering capabilities.

Principal risks and uncertainties Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Operational risks
← → Health and safety in the workplace
A lack of robust safety processes and 
procedures could result in accidents 
involving Renold employees and others  
on Renold premises.
The risk assessment reflects the fact  
that increased focus and auditing is part 
of the rising rate trends seen on page 40.
Accidents caused by a lack of robust safety 
procedures could result not only in civil or  
criminal liability for both the Group and the 
Directors but also:
 →Business interruption;
 →Significant fines and penalties; and
 →Reputational damage.
Revised group wide health and safety policies 
contained within a documented management system, 
‘the Framework’ , have been rolled out during the year. 
Health and safety audits and enhanced reporting has 
been implemented at all sites and a new Group HSE 
Assurance Manager has been appointed.
Continual risk assessments to ensure awareness  
of risks.
Live tracking of accident rates and root cause 
analysis via the Integrated Risk Management System.
← → Manufacturing disruption
A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a 
portion of any of Renold’s manufacturing  
or distribution facilities, due to accident, 
labour issues, fire, weather, terrorism, 
natural disaster or otherwise, which in 
the short or long term could adversely 
affect the Group’s ability to meet the 
demands of its customers.
Some of the assets maintained by the  
Group, such as IT systems and machinery  
are critical to the manufacture and 
delivery of a particular product.
A material disruption to operational facilities  
or the loss of critical assets may negatively  
affect the Group’s:
 →Production capability and asset base;
 →Supply chain management;
 →Customer relationships and reputation; and
 →Financial performance.
Dedicated production teams focused on  
demand fulfilment.
Preventative maintenance programme.
Alternate manufacturing capacity exists for a 
substantial portion of the Group’s product range.
Inventory maintained to absorb and flatten out  
raw material supply and production volatility.
The Group has insurance cover to mitigate the  
impact of a number of these risks.
↓ ERP systems
The Group is presently implementing a 
global ERP system to replace numerous 
legacy systems.
Legacy systems are less robust and less 
efficient than new systems.
The risk continues that an unsuccessful 
implementation at an individual site could  
seriously impact the Group’s performance.
Risks have reduced by virtue of the  
experience gained and lessons learned  
from previous implementations.
Old systems may not support delivery  
of business objectives.
Use of specialist external consultants on the project.
Recruitment of experienced personnel.
Phased implementation rather than ‘big bang.’
Project assurance and lessons learned reviews to 
continuously improve the quality of successive roll outs.
Ongoing project to replace and upgrade legacy systems.
← →  Compliance risks –  
laws and regulations
Risks related to regulatory and  
legislative changes include the inability  
of the Group to comply with current, 
changing or new requirements.
Many of the Group’s business activities  
are subject to increasing regulation and 
enforcement by relevant authorities.
Failure by the Group or its representatives  
to abide by applicable laws and regulations 
could result in:
 →Administrative, civil or criminal liability;
 →Significant fines and penalties;
 →Suspension of the Group from trading; and
 →Reputational damage.
Communication of a clear compliance culture.
Risk assessments and ongoing compliance reviews.
Published up to date policies and procedures.
Monitoring of compliance with nominated 
accountable managers in each business unit.
Clear guidance and training issued to all employees.
↓ Bredbury site closure
A complex project was initiated to  
close the Bredbury site and transfer 
approximately 12% of the Chain division 
sales to other Renold sites.
The scale of the project in terms of the  
revenue streams being transferred, as well  
as the complexity inherent in moving major 
production processes, could, if executed  
poorly, have a major impact on Group sales, 
profitability and customer relationships  
in the short term and potentially in the  
longer term too.
As at the date of this report the project is largely 
complete with all production equipment moved to 
new locations or new equipment sourced in those 
locations. All of the new production lines are running, 
though with some still to reach full capacity.
Additional safety stock created during the project  
will now be worked out during the new financial year.
↓  A lack of technical expertise or 
management skills
The Group’s international operations  
are dependent upon existing key 
executives and certain other employees  
in order to sustain and grow its business 
and there can be no assurances that  
these employees will remain with the 
Group. The success of the Group will 
depend upon its ability to attract,  
retain and motivate highly qualified  
and trained employees.
If the Group fails to retain, attract or  
motivate the required calibre of employees  
then its operational and financial performance 
may be negatively impacted.
Competitive reward programmes, focused training  
and development.
Ongoing reviews of succession plans based on  
business needs.
Personal development reviews and training programmes.
Management team strengthened with new capability 
from external hires and internal promotions.
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 37
Strategic Report Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Financial risks
↓ Liquidity
In the new economic reality, all  
companies face risk in relation  
to the availability of debt to fund  
their ongoing operations.
If the Group fails to obtain the required  
funding then this could negatively impact:
 →Ongoing operations of the business; and
 →Going concern.
The Group’s primary banking facility expires  
October 2016.
Further improvements in results will increase  
the headroom in that facility.
Constant management focus to enhance working  
capital management processes.
← → Foreign exchange rate volatility
Transactional exchange risk exposure.
If the Group does not manage these risks 
appropriately, then this could result in the  
Group’s earnings and cash flows being exposed  
to currency risk on its sales and purchases and 
balances of foreign (non-functional) currencies.
The Board has approved a net cash flow hedging 
strategy for major currencies that extends for four 
quarters on a rolling diminishing coverage basis. 
Transactions are covered primarily by simple  
forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings denominated in foreign currency  
are supported and serviced by cash flows in  
the same currencies.
Dollar denominated borrowings taken out in the  
UK to finance US acquisitions have been designated  
as a hedge of the net investment in US subsidiaries.
← → Interest rate volatility
Borrowings at variable rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Exposure to variable exchange rates could 
negatively impact the financial performance  
of the Group.
Facility in place for interest rate swaps to manage  
part of this exposure if volatility arises.
↓ Pensions deficit volatility
Estimates of the amount and timing  
of future funding obligations for the  
Group’s pension plans are based  
upon a number of assumptions.
Pension deficits are dependent on  
market based assumptions for  
discount rates and inflation.
Changes in these assumptions can materially 
impact the performance and financial condition  
of the Group.
The major UK pension cash flows (50% of all  
defined benefit pension cash costs) are fixed  
under the 25 year asset backed funding scheme  
put in place during 2013. A further 25% of the  
annual cash flows are pensions in payment in 
Germany in a mature scheme that has passed  
its peak funding requirement.
All pension risks are actively managed in line with  
the Group’s risk management system covering 
investment and liability management issues.
The Group is represented by a Company nominated  
trustee on the investment committee which sets  
the asset strategies.

Principal risks and uncertainties
continued We believe that consideration of corporate social responsibility is integral 
to ensuring the protection of the long term interests of our shareholders.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
corporate social responsibility, including 
environmental policy and health and 
safety matters, with the Chief Executive 
taking direct leadership responsibility 
supported by the regional and business 
unit Executive teams.
Ethics
We recognise our duty to stakeholders  
to operate the business in an ethical  
and responsible manner.
Within the dynamic global business 
environment, we expect our employees 
and business operations to conduct 
themselves ethically, and to be honest, 
fair and courteous in their dealings. 
The highest standards of ethical business 
conduct are required of our employees  
in the performance of their duties. 
Employees may not engage in conduct  
or activity that may raise questions  
as to Renold’s honesty, impartiality,  
or reputation or otherwise cause 
embarrassment to the Group. Our 
employees are required to neither  
offer nor accept improper and/or illegal 
gifts, hospitality or payments. A new  
Group Gifts and Hospitality policy was 
implemented during the year.
Every Renold employee has the 
responsibility to ask questions,  
seek guidance and report suspected 
violations of the Group’s code of ethics.
A free of charge, independent whistle 
blowing hotline continues to be available 
to all employees across the Group, 
enabling them to report any concerns 
about theft, fraud and other malpractice  
in the workplace.
Following implementation of the  
UK Bribery Act in 2011, the Group put  
in place training for all members of  
staff whose roles involve working in 
environments or activities where there 
was a perceived risk. A revised Group 
Anti-Corruption policy was implemented 
during the year and a further training 
programme commissioned which will  
be refreshed on an annual basis. Other 
control processes and updates to formal 
contractual arrangements with agents 
and distributors have been put in  
place to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act.
Health and safety 
Renold is committed to providing a  
safe workplace for all its employees  
and those affected by its activities.  
No activity is so critical or urgent  
that it may be done in an unsafe and 
uncontrolled manner; at Renold the 
individual’s safety is the top priority.
The Group Health and Safety policy 
(reviewed and updated last year) is 
supported by the Group Health and 
Safety Management Framework 
structured to assist all parts of Renold  
to understand the Board’s expectations 
regarding health and safety performance.
The Framework is not a set of rules and 
regulations to be applied mechanically 
across the Group. It contains principles 
and expectations describing a set of 
outcomes. It is a structured process to 
manage specific health and safety risks, 
encompassing continual monitoring and 
periodic review. The Framework is 
consistent with internationally recognised 
standards, including OHSAS 18001.
The Group Health and Safety Management Framework
Each stage has a number of key components:
Plan
 → Determine the scope of the 
management system 
 → Set objectives and timescales and 
identify resource requirements 
 →  De v elop perf ormanc e indica tors

Learn
 → Undertake periodic reviews  
of the management system’s

Strategic Report
Corporate social responsibilities 1  The lost time accident frequency rate is calculated 
using the rolling lost time accident figure for the  
year to date divided by the number of hours  
worked in the year and multiplied by 1,000,000  
thus providing the lost time accident rate per 
1,000,000 hours worked.
The Plan-Do-Measure-Learn cycle is  
a key part of the Framework. It is an 
iterative process which enables a site  
to establish, implement and improve its 
management system and hence manage 
the targeted risks. It is applicable at all 
levels in the organisation from the top 
management through to every employee 
in every activity within the Group.
A rolling programme of assurance audits 
commenced during the year. The internal 
assurance audit tests and reports site 
compliance against the requirements of 
the Framework. The Framework presents 
a focus for continuous improvement  
and so is reflected in the audit outputs 
incorporated into a site action plan.
The importance of individual 
contributions to the continuous 
improvement of our systems is  
well recognised and we ensure  
all improvement opportunities are 
captured via the Integrated Risk 
Management System (IRMS). The  
IRMS supports a number of business 
processes including standardised 
reporting for accidents, incidents,  
near misses, safety opportunities and 
related action tracking and has been 
further enhanced during the year. 
The additional functionality includes a 
hazard assessment reporting feature 
that provides both a consistent and 
transparent view of the ongoing health 
and safety risks. During the year, roll  
out of the online hazard assessment 
module has focused on the larger sites 
with a plan that all areas will be using  
the system during 2014. This supports 
our drive to deliver improvements to  
our health and safety risk management 
processes and the quality of risk 
information generated allowing  
optimum focus of resources.
The Board regularly reviews health and 
safety performance and ensures that any 
issues identified are promptly addressed. 
Reporting enhancements have been 
made to broaden the performance 
measures. Trend reviews have also  
been completed on behalf of the Board 
focusing on particular incident types. 
The following charts show the Group’s 
health and safety performance for the 
four years to 31 March 2014. 
The Group uses an average manufacturing 
index for Reportable Incident Rates  
(RIR) as the performance benchmark for 
each of our locations. That benchmark  
is a score of 1,500 or lower. Sites with  
a score in excess of 1,500 are required  
to implement remediation actions to 
improve their performance.
The deterioration in the performance 
metrics is believed to be primarily due to 
the improved accident reporting and 
investigation processes introduced in 
January 2013. Other concurrent 
remediation actions including a global 
health and safety training programme and 
the introduction of the Group wide Health 
and Safety Awards scheme, are designed 
to encourage performance improvement 
against the now established benchmarks.
Following a successful assessment  
of compliance to OHSAS 18001, the 
management system for Occupational 
Health and Safety, the Milnrow, Mulgrave 
and Hangzhou facilities were recommended 
for certification. The Halifax site is  
also a holder of this standard. All other 
production facilities across the Group 
which are not currently certified have 
declared a target to achieve OHSAS 
18001. All sites are required to develop 
specific health and safety plans to 
highlight areas that require particular 
attention and are monitored on a regular 
basis by the Health and Safety team.
Employees
The motivation and commitment of our 
employees is essential to drive forward 
our business. The recruitment, retention 
and development of motivated, effective 
people will be key to the successful 
delivery of the revised strategy for the 
Group. That revised strategy will itself 
include assessing opportunities to 
improve our processes for managing  
and developing people.

Strategic Report
During the year ended 31 March 2014  
the following activities were carried  
out across the Group:
Engaging our people
We place a strong emphasis on  
employee communications and two  
way feedback. The Group’s intranet  
site enables access to the latest Group 
information as well as Group policies.  
We have also commenced regular 
presentations to employees throughout 
the Group where the half year and 
year-end financial results are presented 
and explained by senior management. 
This helps to achieve a common 
awareness amongst employees of  
the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Group.
We also use electronic bulletin boards  
for the sharing of knowledge and 
information across the world. 
Employment policies
Arrangements for consulting and 
involving Group employees on matters 
affecting their interests at work, and 
informing them of the performance of 
their employing business and the Group, 
are developed in ways appropriate to 
each business. A variety of approaches  
is adopted aimed at encouraging the 
involvement of employees in effective 
communication and consultation, and  
the contribution of productive ideas  
at all levels.
Employment policies are designed to 
provide equal opportunities irrespective 
of race, caste, national origin, religion, 
age, disability, gender, marital status, 
sexual orientation or political affiliation. 
Group policy is to ensure that disabled 
applicants for employment are given  
full and fair consideration having regard 
to their particular aptitudes and abilities, 
and that existing disabled employees  
are given equal access to training,  
career development and promotion 
opportunities. In the event of existing 
employees becoming disabled, all 
reasonable means would be explored  
to achieve retention in employment in 
the same or an alternative capacity, 
including arranging appropriate training.
on Human Rights: the concept of human 
beings as having universal rights, or 
status, regardless of legal jurisdiction or 
other localising factors, such as ethnicity, 
nationality, and sex. 
The Group respects all human rights  
and in conducting its business regards 
the right to non-discrimination and fair 
treatment as the most relevant to its  
key stakeholder groups, these being 
customers, employees and suppliers.  
The Group’s employment policies  
and procedures reflect principles  
of equal treatment. 
The Group has not been made aware of 
any incident in which the organisation’s 
activities have resulted in an abuse of 
human rights.
Environment
Renold is committed to managing  
its activities to provide appropriate  
levels of care for the environment,  
for customers and for employees. In 
particular, Renold seeks to develop  
and manufacture products that  
minimise their environmental impact  
as far as practicable, to co-operate  
with industry, government bodies,  
suppliers and customers, to develop  
and achieve improved standards of 
environmental care and to conduct 
operations in compliance with relevant 
statutory provisions concerning 
environmental matters.
Four sites within the Group are  
now accredited with the ISO 14001 
Environmental Management standard 
and four more sites are actively targeting 
accreditation. The systems introduced 
will further assist in ensuring that Renold 
meets all legal requirements, continues 
its efforts in preventing pollution and 
improves its environmental performance 
across all its activities.
Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme
Renold remains compliant with the  
UK Government’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment scheme, submitting both  
a carbon footprint report and annual 
return to the Environment Agency  
on behalf of the impacted UK sites.
Diversity
The Group is committed to equal 
opportunities and operates a non-
discriminatory working environment.  
We expect staff and job applicants to be 
treated equally regardless of age, race, 
religion, disability, gender or sexuality.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group employed 
2,208 people including 392 in the UK.  
Of the total number of employees,  
605 (being 27.4%) are female. The 
Company recognises the need to 
encourage and support more gender 
diversity throughout the employee 
population as well as at Board level:  
details of the Board’s Diversity policy  
are set out in the Nomination Committee 
report at pages 58 and 59.
We set out in the table below, a 
breakdown of the gender of our Board 
members, and, in accordance with the 
new reporting requirements, the number 
of ‘senior managers’ (including directors 
of the Company’s subsidiary companies) 
and employees as at 31 March 2014.  
A senior manager is defined in the 
legislation as an employee who has 
responsibility for planning, directing or 
controlling the activities of the company 
or a strategically significant part of the 
company. Whilst falling within the 
definition of ‘senior manager’, the most 
senior leadership population (below the 
Board), the Group Executive, is shown 
separately in the table below.

Human rights
As a result of the new reporting 
requirements, the Group is required  
to make a disclosure in relation to  
human rights.
The Board has overall responsibility  
for ensuring the Group upholds and 
promotes respect for human rights and 
has adopted the definition of human 
rights within the European Convention  Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 42
Corporate social responsibilities
continued
The Group continues to strive to reduce 
its energy costs and the impact of its 
activities on the environment. With this 
aim in mind, there have been a number 
of environment related improvement 
initiatives during the year ended 
31 March 2014, including the following: 
 → Our German Chain facility has  
applied improved waste streaming  
to ensure maximum recovery and 
re-use opportunities where waste is 
generated. In addition, heat from the 
heat treatment ovens is recovered to 
provide work environment warming.
 → Energy efficient lighting introduced  
at our Australian and US facilities has 
replaced inefficient fluorescent fittings.
 → Chemical spill team training and 
simulations have been conducted  
to prepare a rapid and appropriate 
response in the event of an on-site  
spill occurring.
 → Hazardous waste generation has  
been reduced by 21% within the  
paint process at our US Torque 
Transmission facility.
 → A project to cure air leaks and 
introduce improvements in the 
efficiency of air compressors at a  
UK Torque Transmission facility is 
lowering electricity consumption.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
The Group is committed to minimising 
the impacts of its business operations  
on the environment and our policy is  
to co-operate with government bodies, 
regulators, suppliers and customers to 
develop and achieve improved standards 
of environmental protection.
The organisational boundary is  
the boundary that determines the 
operations owned or controlled by the 
reporting company. The operational 
boundary is the boundary that 
determines the direct and indirect 
emissions associated with operations 
owned or controlled by the reporting 
company. Both are as defined by the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
issued in May 2013 (GHG Protocol).  
The operational boundary assessment 
allows a company to establish which 
operations and sources cause direct  
and indirect emissions, and to decide 
which indirect emissions to include that  
are a consequence of its operations.
The financial control approach is where 
the company has the ability to direct  
the financial and operating policies of  
the organisation with a view to gaining 
economic benefits from its activities, as 
defined in the Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines: Including Mandatory 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting 
Guidance, June 2013.
Greenhouse gas emission sources
Scope 1 (Direct emissions) from  
activities owned or controlled by our 
organisation that release emissions  
into the atmosphere.
Scope 2 (Energy indirect emissions) 
released into the atmosphere associated 
with our consumption of purchased 
electricity, heat, steam and cooling.  
These are indirect emissions that are  
a consequence of our organisation’s 
activities but which occur at sources  
we do not own or control. Our reported 
Scope 2 emissions are limited to those 
associated with purchased electricity  
as no location within the business 
purchases steam, heating or cooling  
from a third party.
Scope 3 (Other indirect emissions) arising 
as a consequence of our actions, which 
occur at sources which we do not own  
or control and which are not classed as 
Scope 2 emissions.
Effective environmental management is 
integral to the Group’s business strategy 
and we endeavour to achieve the highest 
practicable environmental standards of 
performance to ensure compliance with 
our statutory obligations. To support 
good environmental stewardship our 
manufacturing facilities have an active 
programme to implement environmental 
management systems compliant to  
ISO 14001. This provides an opportunity  
not only to identify the environmental 
impacts of the business but to consider 
opportunities to manage and optimise 
energy usage. This approach to both 
existing processes and new projects is 
embedded within our business model 
and will feature in the business’s 
developing carbon management plan.
The reporting of carbon emissions  
is undertaken at many facilities in 
compliance with local country legislation. 
However, the financial year ending 
31 March 2014 will see the first unified 
GHG report of all locations controlled  
by Renold. A ‘trial’ reporting project, 
conducted in 2013, allowed us to verify 
our global reporting process. This 
provided the opportunity to resolve  
any practical issues identified, ahead  
of the final data reporting.
After setting the organisational  
boundary using the financial control 
approach all Scope 1 and 2 emissions,  
as defined below, arising from the assets 
and operations within this control 
boundary are reported for the period 
1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014. 100%  
of operational boundary emissions for 
entities within the organisational 
boundary have been reported.
Using this 12 month period avoids  
the need to include consumption 
estimations when calculating the 
emissions for Scope 1 combusted  
fuel and Scope 2 purchased electricity. 
Scope 3 emissions are not reported. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 43
Strategic Report
Where possible emissions have  
been calculated based upon direct 
measurement or purchase invoices of 
fuel and energy. In other cases including 
those in relation to some Group transport 
and refrigerant gases it has been necessary 
to make consumption estimations. Where 
there is considered significant uncertainty 
in the activity data used, this will be 
identified. An overall ranking of uncertainty 
will be applied (high, good, fair or poor)  
so activity data quality is made using an 
internal procedure consistent with that 
suggested by the GHG Protocol Chapter 7.
The baseline will be amended where a 
variation of 5% or more results from 
acquisition and divestment or significant 
change in reporting methodology.
Community
We aim to be a part of the communities 
in which we work and seek to assist local 
projects with support where possible. 
We encourage volunteering and working 
with local educational institutions in the 
promotion and raising of awareness of 
engineering and manufacturing.
Whilst the Group is not currently in a 
position to provide financial support to 
local projects, it is the Board’s intention 
to review this in the future as part of a 
wider review of the Group’s corporate 
social responsibility policy.
Developing capability 
We strongly believe it is essential to 
maintain our skill pool. A good example 
of this is the commitment to a healthy 
flow of apprentices being recruited, 
trained and potentially permanently 
employed in some of our factories. 
In the UK, we have an Apprentice  
Training School at the Renold Gears 
facility. Apprentices spend their first year 
learning basic engineering skills, before 
transferring to the shop floor and other 
areas of the business such as planning, 
quality, purchasing and distribution so 
that they also gain an appreciation  
and awareness of the wider business 
operations and how these work together. 
We have engaged a third party 
consultancy (EEF: The Manufacturers’ 
Association) with expertise in converting 
utility usage into carbon emissions to 
provide advice and review the ongoing 
data collection process. In addition, EEF 
undertakes an assurance audit on the 
12 months reported data.
CO
2
-e is the unit of measurement to 
indicate the global warming potential 
(GWP) of each of the six greenhouse 
gases, expressed in terms of the GWP of 
one unit of carbon dioxide. It is used to 
evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) 
different greenhouse gases against a 
common basis.
The combined CO
2
-e emissions arising from 
owned transport and fugitive refrigerant 
gases were calculated to be 0.6% of the 
total emissions. We considered these 
emissions to be immaterial and they are 
not therefore included in the final reported 
figures for CO
2
-e. 
To ensure we have the ability to compare 
future years to our base year we have 
adopted an intensity measure where we 
express the combined Scope 1 and 2  
GHG emissions as tonnes of CO
2
-e per £m 
external revenue for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2014.

Our report methodology has used the 
GHG Protocol, data gathered to fulfil  
our requirements under the CRC Energy 
Efficiency scheme, and emission  
factors from the UK Government’s  
GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2014. Conversion of the  
source data into equivalent emissions 
was undertaken using the DEFRA 
(Department for Environment, Food  
and Rural Affairs) datasets ‘Greenhouse 
Gas Conversion Factor Repository’  
which can be found on their website  
www.ukconversionfactorscarbonsmart.
co.uk. 
The apprentices themselves value  
this mix of formal learning and the  
‘hands on’ experience they gain from 
working alongside their colleagues.  
There are currently 14 apprentices  
in the Training School at various  
stages of a four year programme.
Our German Chain facility currently 
employs 18 apprentices. There are  
a number of different types of 
apprenticeship in Germany for school 
leavers, the various roles including 
bachelor of engineering, bachelor of 
business administration, industrial clerk, 
industrial mechanic and toolmaker. In 
addition to role specific training, wider 
education and experience is also offered 
from exchange programmes with  
other local companies, participation in 
simulated business competitions, training 
and attendance at business exhibitions. 
In addition to traditional apprentice 
schemes, Renold also employs school 
leavers at a trainee level in the UK who 
continue to progress through higher 
education on a day release basis. 
Currently there is one trainee member  
in the sales team and three trainees 
working in finance. Extensive training  
in the areas in which the trainees work  
is given internally to complement the 
external courses being undertaken.
Renold also continues to liaise closely 
with various universities which conduct 
relevant research. We serve our 
engineering pipeline through these 
relationships with key universities and 
through sponsorship.

Corporate Governance
“ The Group is committed to and recognises 
the importance of high standards of 
corporate governance and behaviour. We 
believe that good corporate governance 
leads to good business and is an essential 
basis for long term corporate success. ”
 Mark Harper
 Chairman
Following the appointment of Robert Purcell as Chief Executive 
on 1 January 2013, this has been the first full financial year since 
the newly constituted Board has taken effect. On behalf of the 
Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance 
report for the year ending 31 March 2014.
In this report, we explain the Group’s approach to corporate 
governance and provide the information required of us by the 
Governance Code. We therefore detail how the Company is 
directed and controlled via the Board and its Committees, and 
importantly how the Board considers its own effectiveness. Also 
in addressing the governance structure of the Group, we set out 
how the Board oversees risk monitoring and internal control.
We include a section in this report addressing how the 
Company communicates with shareholders. I would like  
to take this opportunity to emphasise that in addition to  
the prescribed methods by which we communicate with 
shareholders, for example the AGM, we are pleased to  
receive feedback from shareholders at all times.
Finally, we include separate reports of the Audit (at pages 53  
to 57) and Nomination Committees (at pages 58 and 59) and 
the Directors’ Remuneration report (at pages 60 to 74), all  
of which are incorporated into this report by reference.
Compliance with the Governance Code
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance in order to facilitate efficient, effective and 
entrepreneurial management of the Company. The Board 
acknowledges its contribution to achieving management 
accountability, improving risk management and ultimately 
to creating shareholder value over the longer term. 
The Governance Code sets out guidance for companies with  
a premium listing in the form of main principles and specific 
provisions of good governance. 
The rules of the FCA require listed companies incorporated  
in the UK to disclose, in relation to the Governance Code,  
how they have applied those principles and whether they have 
complied with the provisions throughout the financial year.
The Governance Code is available to view on the FRC’s website  
at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board reviews its compliance with the Governance Code 
regularly and considers that the Company has complied  
with all provisions set out in the Governance Code that are 
applicable to it throughout the year ended 31 March 2014, 
except where highlighted in this report. Board of Directors
The Board provides entrepreneurial 
leadership of the Company within a 
framework of prudent and effective 
controls which enables risk to be  
assessed and managed. 
On these pages, we set out the age, tenure and biographical 
details of each Board member and the Company Secretary.
For details of how our governance structure works, including 
how the Board and its Committees are composed and how  
they work, see pages 48 to 52.

Corporate Governance
Committee membership and terms of reference
Committee membership may not be refreshed as frequently  
as would be the case for a company with a larger board. 
However, the Board is satisfied that no undue reliance is  
placed on particular individuals.
As a result of changes to the Governance Code and new 
legislation, a full review of the schedule of matters reserved 
for the Board and the terms of reference for each of the 
Committees has been carried out during the year. Revised 
terms have been implemented as a result and are available

Louise Brace has acted as secretary to the Committees  
during the year ended 31 March 2014. The revisions to the 
terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee included  
an amendment to provide for the Group Company Secretary  
to act as secretary of that committee, the role previously 
having been undertaken by the Group HR Director.
Board focus during the year
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Board has provided 
its main focus on the following matters:
 → Review of Group strategy;
 → Project to review manufacturing capacity in the Chain Division;
 → Health and safety performance;
 → Pension liabilities;
 → Balance sheet;
 → Margins and profitability;
 → Cashflow;
 → Organisational development; and
 → Consideration of the new Governance Code.
Expected Board focus for next year
The Board will continue to review the matters listed above, 
including the completion of the project to review manufacturing 
capacity. In addition it is anticipated that the following areas will 
form areas of focus for the Board for the year ended 31 March 2015:
 → Continued review of strategy and supporting the  
Chief Executive in developing the Group’s strategic plan;
 → Organic growth opportunities;
 → Customer service enhancement;
 → Financial performance;
 → Succession planning; and
 → ERP effectiveness.
Board composition
There have been no changes to the composition of the Board 
during the year ended 31 March 2014, there being a balance of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Currently, the Board 
comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, two Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. 
The Board’s consideration of its composition in the context of 
its diversity is more fully detailed in the Nomination Committee 
report on pages 58 and 59, together with a statement on the 
Board’s diversity policy.
The members of the Board maintain the appropriate balance 
of status, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties 
and responsibilities and to ensure the Board is of a sufficient 
size that the requirements of the business can be met.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separated  
with a clear division of responsibilities set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. The Chairman’s primary role is to ensure 
the effectiveness of the Board in setting the direction of the 
Company and the agenda of the Board. The Chief Executive has 
responsibility for managing the business and implementing the 
strategy agreed by the Board.
Biographical and experience details of the current Directors 
appear on pages 46 and 47. Details of Committee membership 
and attendance are set out on page 50. For further details of 
the Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are 
set out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Director induction and development
Board members are able to seek independent legal or other 
professional advice in respect of their duties as they may 
require at the Company’s expense, and have access to the 
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who ensures 
that Board procedures are complied with. 
The training needs of the Board are discussed as part of the 
Board performance evaluation process. Updates are provided 
to the Board at regular intervals in order to refresh the 
Directors’ knowledge. 
The Company has a detailed framework for the induction of 
new Directors. This includes the issuing of all key documents 
relating to the new Director’s role on the Board to the new 
Director, as well as site visits and face-to-face meetings with 
senior executives. Upon joining the Group in January 2013 and 
throughout the year ended 31 March 2014, Robert Purcell has 
visited all Renold’s sites on at least one occasion including 
those in the US, China, Australia, India and Germany. The Board 
itself has met at Renold manufacturing sites in the UK, China 
and India during the year.
Non-Executive Director independence
The Non-Executive Directors throughout the year are considered 
to be independent in character and judgement. The Board is of 
the opinion that all of the Directors take decisions objectively 
and in the best interests of the Company and that no individual 
or small group of individuals can dominate the Board’s decision 
taking. The balance between Non-Executive and Executive 
Directors allows independent challenge to the Executive 
Directors and senior management. Group governance structure

there has been full attendance of members at all Board and 
Committee meetings.
Risk monitoring and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems, and for reviewing 
internal control effectiveness. 
The ongoing process, in accordance with the FRC’s ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
(October 2005)’, for review of the system of internal controls by 
the Directors, to identify, evaluate and manage the significant 
risks faced by the Group, has been in place for the year ended 
31 March 2014 and up to the date of approval of this report and 
the financial statements. 
Internal controls and the risk management process are 
reviewed on a regular basis by the Audit Committee, which 
reports directly to the Board. This review includes a report 
from the Executive Risk Management and Monitoring 
Committee at each meeting of the Audit Committee. Further 
details of the Audit Committee’s oversight of the Executive Risk 
Management and Monitoring Committee can be found in the 
Audit Committee report on page 55.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
The Board is supportive of the principle of evaluation of the 
Board, as set out in paragraph B.6 of the Governance Code. 
A formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board,  
its members and its Committees is planned and is conducted 
annually. This process gives the Directors the opportunity to 
identify areas for improvement both jointly and individually 
through the use of questionnaires and/or open discussion. 
An evaluation of the Chairman is also carried out annually,  
led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Evaluations of the Board (including of the Chairman), the  
Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee were carried out during the  
year ended 31 March 2014.
The evaluation process commences with the completion of 
a written questionnaire for each separate review, compilation 
of a summary of the results and feedback obtained and then 
discussion between the participants.
In accordance with the Governance Code, the evaluation  
process also included a number of discussions during the  
year between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, 
without the Executive Directors present, to discuss feedback 
arising from the process and the performance of each 
Executive Director. The Senior Independent Director also  
met with the other Directors as part of the Chairman’s 
performance evaluation process.
Election of Directors
The Governance Code recommends that all Directors of  
FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual election  
by shareholders. This provision is not applicable to the 
Company. However, with a view to complying voluntarily  
with all terms of the Governance Code where possible, the 
Board has considered this provision in conjunction with its 
review of the new terms of the Governance Code. As a result, 
the Board has agreed that all Non-Executive Directors will be 
subject to annual election. Given the size of the Company, it 
would not be practicable for the two Executive Directors to  
be subject to annual election.
Board and Committee membership and attendance
The Board meets on a regular basis with an agenda and 
necessary papers for discussion distributed in advance of 
each meeting. The meetings are scheduled to coincide with  
the internal financial reporting timetable of the Company and 
key events including interim and final results and the AGM. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 51
Corporate Governance
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the responsibility to 
review internal control effectiveness was discharged by the 
Audit Committee and reported to the Board as follows: 
 → receiving and considering regular reports from the internal 
audit function on the status of internal control across the 
Group. The Audit Committee also reviewed the internal audit 
function’s findings, annual audit plan and the resources 
available to it to perform its work; 
 → reviewing the external auditor’s findings on internal financial 
control; and 
 → monitoring the adequacy and timeliness of management’s 
response to identified audit issues.
The executive team is accountable to the Directors for 
implementing Board policies on internal control and for 
monitoring and reporting to the Board that it has done so. 
Group internal controls are designed to mitigate rather than 
eliminate the risks identified and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. 
The key features of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management systems are: 
 → an Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
which oversees, on behalf of the Audit Committee and, 
ultimately, the Board, that appropriate policies are 
implemented to identify and evaluate risks. A critical review 
project commenced in the previous year to ensure that the risk 
management processes continue to meet the requirements  
of the Group Board. This has led to further changes in the 
current year and ensures continuous improvement. Output 
from the new risk management processes, comprising risk 
profiles and full action tracking, have been subject to review  
by each meeting of the Audit Committee to ensure that risks 
deemed to be significant are receiving commensurate 
management attention; 
 → access for all Group employees to a free of charge, 
independent whistle blowing hotline enabling them  
to report any concerns about theft, fraud or other 
malpractice in the workplace; 
 → an internal audit function which assists management  
and the Audit Committee in the fulfilment of the Board’s 
responsibility for ensuring that the Group’s financial and 
accounting systems provide accurate and up-to-date 
information about its current financial position whilst also 
permitting the accurate preparation of financial statements; 
 → an organisational structure which supports clear lines of 
communication and tiered levels of authority; 
 → a schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s approval to 
ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, 
financial, organisational and compliance issues; 
 → the preparation of detailed annual financial plans covering 
profit and cash flow, which are approved by the Board; 
 → the review of detailed regular reports comparing actual 
performance with plans and of updated financial forecasts; 
 → procedures for the appraisal, approval and control of capital 
investment proposals; 
 → procedures for the appraisal, approval and control of 
acquisitions and disposals; 
 → monitoring procedures which include a system of key 
financial controls self assessment questionnaires; and 
 → enhancements in internal controls have been achieved from  
the standardisation of processes and core transactional controls 
as supported by the implementation of the ERP system. 
The Board has approved a Corporate Governance Compliance 
Statement which contains terms of reference for the Board  
and each of the Board Committees. The terms of reference  
are available on the Company’s website at www.renold.com. 
Internal controls are in place at both local and Group level. 
In addition, the Renold Internal Control Statement contains 
details of such matters as Group signing authorities, contracting 
principles and ethics policy to ensure that all Group employees 
conduct business on behalf of the Group on the same basis and 
in accordance with approved policies and procedures. This 
has been approved by the Board and has been fully rolled 
out across the Group. Separate Group policies also address 
Anti-Corruption and Gifts and Hospitality.
Control over financial reporting
There are also in place internal control systems in relation to 
the Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s 
process for preparation of consolidated accounts. These 
systems include policies and procedures that: pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS; require representatives of the 
businesses to certify that their reported information gives  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business and 
its results for the period; and review and reconcile reported 
data. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing these 
internal control systems.
Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee
The principal role of the Executive Risk Management and 
Monitoring Committee is to evaluate and manage the risks 
to the Group. 
The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Executive Robert Purcell and is comprised 
of the Executive Directors. The Chairman invites attendance to 
the Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee of 
any employee as appropriate depending upon the nature of the 
risks to be considered at any one time. 
The following people currently attend by invitation: the Group 
Business Systems Director, the Group HR Director, the Group 
Head of Business Process and Assurance and the Group Legal 
Manager and Company Secretary. Group governance structure
continued
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 52
The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
meets quarterly and reports to the Audit Committee at least 
twice each year. During the year ended 31 March 2014, the 
Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee met 
four times. Details of the attendance by the Executive Directors 
can be found at page 50.
The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
considers the principal risks to the Group and the appropriate 
actions to be taken to minimise such risks. It is also provided 
with information in the form of reports on health and safety, 
treasury, insurance and material litigation. The Chairman of 
the Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
reports to the Audit Committee.
Communications with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. 
The Board is accountable to shareholders and therefore  
it is important for the Board to appreciate the requirements  
of shareholders and equally that shareholders understand  
how the actions of the Board and short term financial 
performance relate to the achievement of longer term goals. 
The Non-Executive Directors make themselves available to 
meet shareholders on request, attend shareholder visits at 
Company sites and are available for discussions with analysts 
and the Company’s broker.
The reporting calendar is driven by the publication of interim 
and final results each year, in which the Board reports to 
shareholders on its management of the Company. Comments 
on Group financial performance in the context of the business 
risks faced and objectives and plans for the future are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 43.
At other times during the year, presentations are given by the 
Executive Directors to analysts and updates provided to the 
London Stock Exchange and shareholders via the Company’s 
website at www.renold.com. In addition, the Chairman, Chief 
Executive and Finance Director meet with major shareholders 
to discuss governance and Group strategy. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not 
generally attend meetings with shareholders although makes 
himself available to attend such meetings if and when required. 
Whilst the Company is not in compliance with paragraph E1.1 
of the Governance Code, the Chairman ensures that the Chief 
Executive and Finance Director provide feedback to the Board 
following presentations to investors and meetings with 
shareholders and analysts’ and brokers’ briefings are circulated 
to all Directors in order to ensure that Board members, and in 
particular Non-Executive Directors, develop an understanding 
of the views of major shareholders about their Company. 
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for 
communication with private and institutional investors. 
Shareholders are encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting and we welcome their participation.
At the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman of the Board 
and the chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration, Nomination 
and Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committees, 
together with the Executive Directors, will be available to 
answer questions. Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent 
to shareholders at least 20 business days before the meeting. 
Details of the proxy votes lodged on each resolution are made 
available and shareholders are invited to talk informally to the 
Directors after the formal proceedings. Audit Committee report

appropriate embedded financial controls.
Key objective
In support of the Board’s duty of stewardship, the Committee 
aims to ensure appropriate corporate governance is applied to 
the Group’s systems of internal control, risk management and 
other compliance matters. The Committee also monitors the 
integrity of financial information published externally for use 
by shareholders. We ensure that the integrity of the financial 
statements are supported by an effective external audit.

Composition
The Committee was chaired by me during the year. The second 
member of the Committee is Ian Griffiths, also an independent 
Non-Executive Director.
The composition of the Committee therefore remains 
unchanged in the year and complies with the requirements  
of the Governance Code for a smaller company, this being to 
have two independent Non-Executive members. 
Biographical details and experience of members are set out 
on pages 46 and 47.
Expertise
The Committee members have been selected to give  
an appropriate range of financial, commercial and risk 
management expertise to allow the Committee to fulfil its 
duties. The Board considers that I have recent and relevant 
financial experience as required by the Governance Code to 
perform the role of Committee Chairman.
Committee meetings
The Committee meets at least four times each year. During 
the year ended 31 March 2014 the Committee met four times. 
The meetings are attended by the independent non-executive 
directors (the members), the Company Secretary and, by 
invitation, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Group Finance 
Director and the Group Head of Risk and Assurance. Full details 
of director attendance during the year are set out in the table 
of all Committee meetings on page 50.
Other members of the Group’s management team are also 
invited to attend to present or respond to queries on particular 
areas of focus. Our external auditor, EY, also attended the 
Committee meetings. Each meeting includes an opportunity  
for the external auditors to raise any matters in confidence 
which they consider should be brought to the attention of the 
Committee without the Executive Directors present.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
Significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements
The Committee monitors the integrity of the Company’s 
financial information and other formal documents relating  
to its financial performance and makes appropriate 
recommendations to the Board before publication.
A key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring 
that suitable and compliant accounting policies are adopted 
and applied consistently on a year-on-year basis and across 
the Company. In this respect, the Committee also considered 
the estimates and judgements made by management when 
accounting for non-standard transactions, the treatment of 
exceptional items and in provision calculations.
These considerations are supported by input from other 
assurance providers, for example, the Group’s actuarial 
advisers, the Group Internal Audit and Assurance team 
as well as our external auditors.
Summarised below are some of the significant issues the 
Committee considered in relation to the financial statements 
during the year. These are separated into items of particular 
focus this year and items on which the Committee would 
normally spend some time on.
Reporting of exceptional items (current year focus item:  
See Note 2(c) to the financial statements on page 99) 
For a second year in succession the size and scale of the current 
restructuring activities has created a number of exceptional  
items within the Group’s income statement. The Committee has 
reviewed each of these items to ensure that they genuinely need 
to be excluded to allow a user of the accounts to form an accurate 
assessment of the performance of the underlying business.
Impairment of tangible assets (current year focus item:  
See Notes 2(c) and 8 to the financial statements on pages 99  
and 103 respectively) 
The project to close the UK Chain Bredbury facility led to  
a significant pool of potentially impaired tangible assets 
(whether property, plant and equipment or stock). A Committee 
member therefore attended the regular project steering 
committee meetings and separate discussions were held  
with the Project Manager. 
In addition to ensuring that appropriate controls were in place  
to ensure that economic value was not lost in the execution  
of the closure plan, the Committee also reviewed the basis  
on which assets were either written down at the year-end or 
maintained in the balance sheet with positive carrying values. 
The Committee also reviewed the Bredbury assets that were 
impaired at the prior year end to ensure that the assumptions 
made at that time were still valid. The review of tangible assets 
has led to further net write offs of £0.6m. 
Defined Benefit Pension Accounting (recurring annual item: 
See Note 18 to the financial statements on pages 110 to 115)
During the year the Group adopted the modified accounting 
standard IAS 19, Employee Benefits as described in more detail  
in Note 18 and Accounting Policies on page 90. The new standard 
had a material impact on the Group’s net pension financing 
charge particularly for the UK defined benefit schemes and 
required prior year results to be re-stated (the details of these 
changes are set out in the Accounting Policies on page 90). 
Pension accounting is a relatively complex matter and the 
Committee devoted a significant amount of time to assessing  
the impact of the modified standard and the appropriate 
reporting thereof. The Committee concluded that the costs  
of administering the closed defined benefit pension schemes  Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 55

 → the revised annual process for control self-assurance  
and reporting;
 → the accounting for the charges under the new 2013 
Performance Share Plan;
 → the programme to improve the efficiency of financial control 
processes in the business; 
 → the training and update programme covering business  
ethics and anti-bribery legislation and awareness;
 → recordability of trade debtors and adequacy of doubtful  
debt provision; and
 → going concern assumptions and scenario modelling.
Internal control, risk and compliance
We evaluate regularly the integrity of financial reporting and 
the robustness of internal controls to ensure compliance with 
applicable legal and internal requirements. We also review the 
Group’s policies and procedures which are designed to identify 
material business risks, ensuring that excessive risks are 
treated so that these operate within acceptable tolerances.
During the year enhanced risk management techniques have 
been implemented. These are derived from the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
and the international risk standard ISO 31000.
The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
and the Audit Committee receive regular reports from the 
Group Head of Risk and Assurance, to convey the status of risk 
profiles and actions arising from the risk assessment process. 
The Executive Risk Management and Monitoring Committee 
reports the results of its discussions to the Committee. 
The Group’s management team makes regular use of an 
integrated risk management system which is delivered via the 
Group’s intranet. This system facilitates both the identification  
of risks and their relative priority in each functional area or 
each geographic location. The system also allows users to 
develop and implement action plans to mitigate those risks. 
The system has extensive reporting functionality that allows 
senior management and the Executive Risk Management and 
Monitoring Committee to review progress in mitigating the 
risks faced by the Group.
Further details of our internal control and risk management 
systems, including over the financial reporting process, can  
be found on pages 50 to 52 in the Corporate Governance 
Report with our risk factors in full in the Strategic Report  
on pages 36 to 38.
Confidential reporting procedures and whistle blowing
The integrity of the financial statements is further supported 
by the confidential reporting and whistle blowing procedures 
in place. The Committee reviews these procedures once a  
year to ensure that appropriate processes are in place to  
treat complaints confidentially and implement proportionate, 
independent investigation in all cases. Visibility and accessibility  
of communications to staff on whistle blowing policy are 
regularly reviewed by the Committee including first hand 
inspection during site visits.
should be included in operating profit but, for the purposes  
of assessing underlying performance as reported in adjusted 
operating profit and adjusted EPS, should be excluded from 
these calculations, as the costs relate to closed legacy pension 
schemes that have no bearing on relevance to understanding  
the underlying performance of the ongoing business: see Note 18 
to the financial statements on pages 110 to 115.
Pension accounting is also an area where values are very 
sensitive to management judgement and estimates. As has  
been the case for a number of years, the Committee reviews 
management estimates compared to third party benchmarks 
and also receives expert input from the actuarial team at EY 
on the reasonableness of the assumptions used. As a result  
of those reviews the Committee was satisfied that the 
assumptions are within an acceptable range and no  
changes were made to management assumptions. 
As part of the review of defined benefit pension accounting the 
Committee also reviews the carrying value and recoverability 
of the deferred tax assets which are the corollary of the gross 
pension deficit. The Committee was satisfied that the extended 
duration of the pension liabilities in Germany and the UK, and their 
priority in recognition, justified the extended recovery periods 
for the associated deferred tax assets which were also fully 
supported by future expectations.
Review of carrying value of intangible assets, deferred tax 
assets and investments in subsidiary undertakings (recurring 
annual item: see Note 7 to the financial statements on pages 
102 and 103 and Note 17 on pages 108 and 109)
The Group holds a number of valuable assets such as goodwill 
and deferred tax. In addition, the parent company and other 
subsidiary holding companies also hold investments in various 
subsidiaries. The judgements on the carrying value of these 
assets are normally a key area for Committee scrutiny. These 
are areas where management estimates play a key role in 
supporting the carrying values reported in the balance sheet. 
The Committee reviews the assumptions underlying the 
discounted cash flow calculations and the likelihood of long  
term recovery of the asset values. The details of the impairment 
review and the sensitivities performed are in Note 7 pages 102 
and 103. Short term cash flows are confirmed by reference to 
the Board approved budget for the following year and this is 
also a key area of focus for the external auditors.
Review of inventory valuation and provisioning (recurring annual 
item: see Note 11 to the financial statements on page 106)
As a manufacturer the Group adds value to raw materials as 
part of its normal production processes. In order to provide 
shorter lead times and better customer service the Group also 
holds a significant amount of stock. The Committee reviews 
the valuation bases and application of the Group’s policy on 
providing for slow moving and obsolete stock. The Committee is 
satisfied that the net book value shown in Note 11 on page 106 
is appropriate and that any management judgements formed  
in arriving at those values are reasonable.
Other matters reviewed by the Committee:
 → the revised corporate risk reporting and mitigation policy; Audit Committee report

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 56
non-audit services where fees exceed an agreed limit are 
subject to the prior approval of the Committee. This policy  
is available on the website at www.renold.com.
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Committee 
continued with the appointment of other accountancy firms  
to provide non-audit services to the Group and anticipates  
that this will continue during the year ending 31 March 2015.
Approval is also given on the basis the service is a natural 
extension of the audit or if there are overriding business or 
efficiency reasons making the external auditors most suited  
to provide the service. Certain services are prohibited from 
being performed by the external auditors.
Total non-audit services provided by EY during the year ended  
31 March 2014 were £0.2m (2013: £0.3m) which comprised  
46% (2013: 88%) of total audit and audit related fees. Total 
audit and audit related fees include the statutory audit fee and  
fees paid to EY for other services which the external auditors  
are required to perform, for example reporting to banking 
partners in territories where no statutory accounts are 
required to be prepared. Non-audit fees represent all other 
services provided by EY not included in the above. Significant 
non-audit services provided by EY in the year included tax 
advisory and compliance services (£0.1m) that were provided  
in territories where it would be prohibitive for the Group to 
employ its own full time tax manager.
The Committee considered that some overseas tax advisory 
and compliance services were most efficiently provided by the 
external auditors as much of the information used in preparing 
computations and returns is derived from audited financial 
information. In order to maintain the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity, Group and local management 
reviewed and considered EY’s findings and EY did not make  
any decisions on behalf of management.
The Committee also discussed the level of fees and considered 
them appropriate given the current size of the Group. The 
Committee is satisfied that the level and scope of non-audit 
services undertaken by the external auditor does not impair 
its independence or objectivity and considers that the Company 
receives particular benefit from the advice provided by its 
external auditor, given its wide and detailed knowledge of 
the Group and its international operations. An assignment 
would not be given to the external auditor when the result 
may be that: as part of the statutory audit, it is required  
to report directly on its own non-audit work; it makes 
management decisions on behalf of the Group; it acts as 
advocate for the Group; or the level of non-audit fees is  
such, relative to audit fees, as to raise concerns about its  
ability to form objective judgements.
Audit focus
To ensure appropriate focus on key risk areas identified by 
the Committee, before the audit commences, the Committee 
reviews and challenges the proposed external audit plan to 
ensure that EY have developed appropriately targeted audit 
procedures. These are closely aligned with the current year 
focus items noted above in the section Main activities of the 
Internal audit
The Committee receives and considers reports on the control 
environment from the Group Head of Risk and Assurance. 
These reports highlight key improvement themes and recommend 
areas for business focus, with additional observations provided 
around root cause analysis and cultural and behavioural 
themes. In addition, the Committee has visibility of management 
responses and action tracking via the Group’s Integrated Risk 
Management System. The audit plan, which contains mandatory, 
risk-based and cyclical reviews, was approved by the Committee 
in February 2013, and was built around focus areas such as 
organisational change, major projects, security, business 
resilience and capital spend.
The annual Internal Audit plan is built on a risk-based approach 
for the majority of work, but also includes an element to ensure 
coverage of key processes over a defined period. The inherent 
risk of each process is assessed and in turn is used to inform 
audit frequency, with elements of higher risk processes being 
audited on a more frequent basis. The Committee supports  
this approach and comments on particular areas of focus or 
concern that we wish to see addressed.
External audit
The Committee is responsible for overseeing relations with  
the external auditors, including the approval of fees, and  
makes recommendations to the Board on their appointment 
and, where appropriate, reappointment based upon reviews  
of audit effectiveness.
Details of total remuneration for the auditors for the year, 
including audit services, audit related services and other 
non-audit services, can be found in Note 2(b) of the  
consolidated financial statements on page 98.
Auditor independence and objectivity
The independence of the external auditors is essential to the 
provision of an objective opinion on the true and fair view 
presented in the financial statements. Auditor independence 
and objectivity is safeguarded by limiting the nature and value 
of non-audit services performed by the external auditors. The 
Group has a policy of not recruiting employees of the external 
auditors who have worked on the audit in the past two years  
to senior financial positions within the Group, and the rotation 
of the lead engagement partner at least every five years. The 
current lead engagement partner has held the position for 
three years.
Non-audit services provided by the external auditors
The Committee is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
relationship is maintained between the Group and the external 
auditor. Non-audit services can only be provided by the external 
auditors if there is no potential conflict of interest or material 
risk of values being included in the financial statements that 
have both been advised on and audited by the external auditors. 
To safeguard the independence and objectivity of the auditor, 
the Committee has approved a policy on non-audit services 
provided by the auditors in line with professional practice and 
in accordance with ethical standards published by the Audit 
Practices Board. This control is exercised by ensuring that all  Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 57
Corporate Governance
Committee during the year. They also reflect the relative 
changes in profitability and materiality of each of the Group’s 
operating units during the year (in some cases as a result of  
the ongoing restructuring activities).
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit and reappointment 
The Committee has a formal system for evaluating the 
performance and independence of the external auditors. 
This system involves active dialogue with the Lead Engagement 
Partner, a formal questionnaire and feedback process involving 
senior management in direct contact with the audit team, and 
EY’s response to accounting, financial control and audit issues 
as these arise.
An annual review is conducted by the Committee of the 
structure and approach taken in the external audit, the level 
of non-audit fees, and the effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors. This includes 
consideration of:
 → the global external audit process;
 → the auditor’s performance;
 → the expertise of the firm and our relationship with them; and
 → the results of the questionnaire process.
Following the review the Committee makes a recommendation 
to the Board on the reappointment of the external auditors.
Following this year’s annual review, the Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors, and recommended to the Board their 
reappointment for a further year. A resolution to reappoint 
EY and giving authority to the Directors to determine their 
remuneration will be submitted to shareholders at the 
2014 AGM.
Audit tender
EY were first appointed as the Company’s external auditors 
in 2007 following a tender process where assessment 
criteria included quality of service, qualifications, expertise, 
independence, effectiveness and scale of international  
network to service the Company.
The Governance Code requires FTSE 350 companies to put  
the contract for audit services out to tender at least once  
every ten years. While the Company is not covered by this 
requirement, as part of the annual process to review the 
effectiveness and performance of the external auditors, the 
Committee considers whether a tender process would create 
an opportunity for a more effective audit. The Committee is 
able to draw on the experience of its members on the Boards  
of other listed companies with different external auditors to 
compare performance and effectiveness. The Committee is 
satisfied that the external audit quality and effectiveness is 
such that a tender would not add value at this stage and has 
therefore recommended the re-appointment of EY as noted 
above. The Company may put the audit out to tender at any 
time and there are no contractual obligations restricting our 
choice of external auditors and no auditor liability agreement 
has been entered into and I will be available at the AGM to 
answer questions. The Committee is aware of the differing 
emphasis on the audit tender question being made by the EU 
and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. The Company 
will continue to comply with regulatory requirements once 
these are properly defined.
Audit information
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors  
in office at the date of the approval of this report are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are 
unaware and each Director has taken all reasonable steps to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and  
to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Disclosure Committee
As part of the process of ensuring that all disclosures made  
by the Company are timely and accurate and meet the legal  
and regulatory obligations and requirements arising under  
the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing and Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules, the Group established a Disclosure 
Committee whose membership includes the Chairman of the 
Committee (as Chair), Group Finance Director, Group Chief 
Accountant, Company Secretary and the Group Head of Risk 
and Assurance.
The following additional activities were carried out by the 
Disclosure Committee:
 → all those contributing were briefed on the new requirements 
of the Governance Code with specific emphasis on the fair, 
balanced and understandable requirements;
 → a number of senior managers who were knowledgeable 
about the business but otherwise not involved in the 
preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts, each 
performed an independent review and their comments 
incorporated accordingly;
 → as in previous years, a documented verification file of all 
substantive facts and assertions is maintained and reviewed 
for completeness prior to finalisation of the Annual Report 
and Accounts.
The Disclosure Committee presents its findings and 
recommendations to the Committee as part of its review of 
processes to enable the fair, balanced and understandable 
statement to be made.
We welcome feedback from shareholders on this report  
and I will be available at the AGM to answer questions.

Mark Harper Chairman 1 of 1
John Allkin Non-Executive Director 1 of 1
Ian Griffiths Non-Executive Director 1 of 1
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has delegated authority from  
the Board. The duties of the Nomination Committee include  
the following:
 → to review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
and recommend any proposed changes;
 → where new appointments of Executive and/or Non-Executive 
Directors are to be made, to lead that process and identify 
and nominate candidates to the Board; and
 → to give full consideration to succession planning for directors 
and other senior executives, taking account of the challenges 
and opportunities facing the Company.
Composition of the Nomination Committee
I chair the Committee and our two Non-Executive Directors  
are members of the Committee and have been so throughout 
the year. The Committee meets during the year as required.
Policy on appointments to the Board
In accordance with the provisions of the Governance Code, 
when reviewing the Board structure, the Committee’s primary 
objective is to ensure that the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors have the relevant skills, knowledge and experience  
to create a balanced and effective Board and to support the 
Group in delivering its overall strategic objectives. This is in 
parallel with ensuring that the costs and composition of the 
Board reflect the size of business and also the current stage of 
development of the business. Our policy extends to ensuring 
that the various sub-committees of the Board also have an 
appropriate range of skills and experience to deliver their  
terms of reference. 
In addition to skills and experience, we will also consider  
factors such as how an individual’s personal attributes would 
complement and enhance the diversity on the Board. For the 
appointment of Non-Executive Directors, additional factors for 
consideration include independence and time commitment.
In selecting candidates for the short-list for any appointment, 
the Board always considers candidates from a wide range of 
backgrounds and on merit and against objective criteria. 
“ The Nomination Committee plays a key 
role in the future success of the Company, 
leading the process in structuring the  
Board and making recommendations  
for changes. The nomination and 
appointment process is vital in ensuring 
that the Company has a Board with the 
right balance of skills and experience. ”

Corporate Governance
Activities during the year
Here we set out the principal activities of the Committee  
during the year. 
Diversity policy
Approval of the Board diversity policy: see details in  
adjacent column.
Board composition 
The Committee discussed the current Board composition and 
more specifically a question posed to the Company on whether  
or not there are a sufficient number of Non-Executive Directors  
on the Board to achieve a balance of skills and experience.  
We consider that the Chairman of the Board and the two 
Non-Executive Directors have a strong range of technical 
knowledge and breadth of experience that is sufficient to  
deal with the operational and commercial activities,  
challenges and risks that the Group currently faces. 
We are also conscious that the Company is in the turnaround 
phase of its strategic plan and that this involves reductions  
in staffing levels and pay restraint throughout the Group.  
We therefore consider that the current capability and cost  
of the Board is appropriate during this period of the  
Group’s transformation.
While there have been no appointments to the Board during 
the year ended 31 March 2014, in the prior year there were a 
significant number of changes to the composition of the Board 
with the former Chairman standing down and being replaced 
and one of the Non-Executive Directors also standing down 
without a replacement. The new Chief Executive was appointed 
and took office in January 2013. The Group and the Board have 
therefore benefitted in this last year from the stability and 
continuity of membership.
Mark Harper
On behalf of the Nomination Committee
27 May 2014 
The Board is already aware of the need to consider the  
benefits of diversity on the Board in all its aspects. The Board 
recognises that gender is one important aspect of diversity  
and while all current members of the Board are male, the 
Company Secretary, who is also the Group’s most senior  
legal professional, is female. An analysis of the gender of  
all employees is set out in the Strategic Report on page 41. 
Other than in relation to gender, the current Board is diverse  
in terms of the different skill sets of each member. These 
include professional qualifications and career work experience 
but also wider experience relevant to our global business, most 
of the Board members having worked and lived overseas for 
significant periods for example.
Given recent changes to the Governance Code, the issue  
of diversity was specifically debated by the Board in  
November 2013 and a formal Board diversity policy adopted. 
In any future changes to its composition, the Board will 
therefore continue to be mindful of the issues of diversity, 
including gender, and these factors will be taken into account 
alongside the over-riding objective of appointing the best 
possible candidate for the role.
The Board does not believe it is appropriate to set measurable 
objectives for the implementation of the policy at this time. 
The Board supports the engagement of executive search  
firms who have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct  
on gender diversity and best practice. The Board has most 
recently worked with Korn Ferry Whitehead Mann who 
themselves are signatories to the Voluntary Code.
As an international business with operations in multiple 
locations we employ a very diverse work force with a broad 
range of ethnicity which extends to senior management and 
leadership posts in the various territories.
The process for making appointments to the Board commences 
with the evaluation described above. The Committee will then 
seek to identify suitable candidates usually with the use of 
external recruitment consultants or, where appropriate, the  
use of open advertising. In addition to Korn Ferry Whitehead 
Mann, Odgers Berndtson also provide recruitment consultancy 
services to the Company. Neither of these firms have any other 
connection to the Company. Directors’ remuneration report
Annual statement
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 60
This year’s remuneration report has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. This amended Schedule 8 was introduced by the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, for financial 
years ending on or after 30 September 2013 in the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the Regulations).
Our report is now structured in two sections following this 
Annual Statement:
Directors’ remuneration policy (pages 62 to 68) which sets  
out the Company’s proposed policy on directors’ remuneration 
for three years from the 2014 AGM. The directors’ remuneration 
policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote at this year’s 
AGM and after that at least every third year;
Annual report on remuneration (pages 69 to 74) which shows 
the implementation of the directors’ remuneration policy. The 
annual report on remuneration together with this letter is 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM. 
Examples of new disclosures include the Chief Executive’s total 
remuneration over the last five years (page 73), options vesting 
history and the spend on Executive Director pay in proportion 
to a number of key business metrics (page 73).
Key responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee determines on behalf of the Board, and  
within agreed terms of reference set by the Board, the overall 
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman, and the terms of the service contracts and all other 
terms and conditions of employment of the Executive Directors.
The overriding objective is to ensure that executive pay  
is strongly aligned to the Company’s business priorities and  
the interests of shareholders. Our policy is also designed  
to attract, motivate and retain individuals who will deliver 
strong performance for all of our stakeholders. The Committee 
takes into account the pay and employment conditions of 
employees within the Group when determining Executive 
Directors’ remuneration.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on 
Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures  
that the incentive structure for the Executive Directors will  
not raise environmental, social or governance risks by 
inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Key decisions and changes in remuneration policy
The Committee decided to leave all fixed elements of salary  
and benefits unchanged for both of the Company’s Executive 
Directors. This aligns directly to the key strategic goal of 
lowering the Group’s breakeven point. It also reflects the  
pay restraint that is in force in all Renold locations.
The maximum achievable annual bonus remains unchanged. 
The targets reflect the need to improve operating margins  
and reduce average levels of net debt, now structured as a 
matrix to ensure that one goal cannot be pursued at the 
expense of the other.
“ As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ remuneration report for the  
year ended 31 March 2014. During the  
year we made a number of changes  
to our remuneration policy which we 
believe enhance the alignment between 
Executive Directors’ incentives and the 
interests of shareholders. ”
 Ian Griffiths
 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 61
Corporate Governance
The 2013 Performance Share Plan (PSP) (approved by shareholders 
at the 2013 AGM) has been introduced to increase the alignment 
of Directors’ remuneration with shareholder value, motivate 
the achievement of strong growth in the long term and increase 
the proportion of variable pay. It is a three year plan and the 
awards this year have required 50% growth each year in 
adjusted EPS for maximum vesting. As a result, it is both 
challenging and firmly aligned to shareholders’ interests.  
This year growth of 129% in adjusted EPS has been achieved.
Finally, having undertaken a review of best practice in 
remuneration policy, provisions to enable awards to be  
clawed back prior to vesting have been introduced to the  
2013 PSP as well as a shareholding requirement for Executive 
Directors. In addition, a provision has been added so that part  
or all of an annual bonus may be forfeited or sought to be 
clawed back in certain circumstances.

The Company Secretary attends all Committee meetings. 
The Executive Directors and the Chairman attend meetings 
by invitation. No Director is involved in deciding his own 
remuneration, whether determined by the Committee, or 
in the case of the Non-Executive Directors, by the Board.
An evaluation of the Committee was undertaken and  
I can report that this review concluded the Committee  
has operated effectively.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on 
the Company’s website at www.renold.com. None of the 
Committee members has any personal financial interest 
(other than as shareholders) in the matters to be decided  
or any conflict of interest, cross-directorships or day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the business.
The Company’s auditors are required to report on certain  
parts of the Directors’ Remuneration report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have  
been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant 
accounting regulations. Audited sections of the report are 
indicated accordingly. Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration policy
Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 62
Remuneration principles for Executive Directors
Our Directors’ remuneration policy has been designed to  
deliver two key aims:
To attract, motivate and retain executives who will deliver  
high performance for all our stakeholders.
We believe the mix of our remuneration package provides an 
appropriate and balanced set of rewards. Executive reward at 
Renold is relatively modest compared to our peer group and 
this has been validated by independent third parties. In part, 
this reflects a number of years of business underperformance 
but it is also consistent with the key strategic objective of 
lowering our breakeven point by reducing our cost base – this 
applies to executive pay as much as it does to any business 
expenditure. However, we are careful to ensure appropriate 
incentive opportunities remain for sustainable improvements 
in business performance.
To ensure a close alignment of executive pay to the  
Company’s strategic objectives and performance.
We review our incentive plans each year to ensure they remain 
closely aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and  
our shareholders’ interests, while continuing to motivate and 
engage the team leading the Company to achieve stretching 
targets. One consequence of this approach during the last year 
was to launch the 2013 PSP that includes demanding three year 
performance targets. To achieve the maximum vesting, the 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in adjusted EPS has to 
be more than 50% per annum that would result in an adjusted 
EPS figure more than three times that achieved in the year 
ended 31 March 2013. The current and forecast dilution levels 
from our share plans remain well below prescribed limits.
In addition, we aim to make the remuneration framework for 
Executive Directors relatively simple – the incentive plans are 
now therefore limited to an annual bonus and the 2013 PSP.
The Committee believes the requirement to build up and 
maintain a direct shareholding in the Company ensures that 
Executive Directors share a significant level of risk with the 
Company’s shareholders and their interests are aligned. 
Having reviewed current best practice, we have introduced 
a shareholding requirement for Executive Directors equal to 
100% of annual salary to be achieved over a five year period. 
Unvested shares/unexercised options are not counted within 
the shareholding requirement. Otherwise, the shareholding 
requirements can be met through purchase from salary,  
bonus or through vested long term incentive shares. As at  
31 March 2014, the Executive Directors both hold shares  
of a value in excess of this requirement. 
We also operate a mitigation policy in the event of early 
termination by the Company of an Executive Director’s 
employment. During the year the Committee introduced  
a formal claw back policy for Executive Directors in respect  
of annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards. This  
claw back policy is to come into effect so as to apply from  
1 April 2014 and has been introduced to provide the  
Committee with discretionary powers to claw back 
performance based remuneration should exceptional 
circumstances occur. Such circumstances would include:  
fraud; misconduct; significant misstatement of financial  
results or incorrect calculation of performance conditions.
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such 
circumstances to have occurred during a performance  
period from 1 April 2014 onwards then the claw back policy  
will provide the Committee discretion to determine that any 
amounts paid or payable under the Annual Bonus or awards 
under the 2013 PSP (which have not yet vested) by reference  
to the relevant period may be clawed back. The Committee will 
take into consideration any claw back events when determining 
future awards and/or bonus payments for Executive Directors.
Shareholder views
The Committee constantly welcomes the views of shareholders 
in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on 
behalf of shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The 
Committee documents all remuneration related comments 
made at the Company’s AGM and feedback received during 
consultation with shareholders throughout the year. Any 
feedback received is fully considered by the Committee and 
where thought necessary amendments made to 
remuneration policy.
Discretion of the Committee
The Committee has discretion in various areas of policy as set 
out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational 
and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules 
approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, 
the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard 
to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the 
opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 63

Policy table
Based on our view of current market practice, and the principles of our remuneration policy, we have established the 
remuneration policy set out in this report. The following table summarises the fixed and variable elements of remuneration  
for the Executive Directors.
The policy described here is intended to apply for three years beginning on the date of the 2014 AGM, subject to shareholders’ 
approval. Each of the elements of remuneration set out below are forward looking other than the 2004 Option Plans which  
is a provision of previous remuneration policy and although it will not be used going forward, it will continue to apply until all 
outstanding awards vest and is therefore included in the Policy table as required by the Regulations.

Base salary To ensure 
competitive salaries 
to attract, retain

responsible for 
executing strategy 
while ensuring the 
Company pays no 
more than is 
necessary.
Base salary is paid in 12 equal monthly instalments 
during the year. 
Reviewed annually, the policy is to provide  
third quartile salary for comparable jobs in 
manufacturing companies of a similar size, 
influenced by:
→  Role, experience and performance;
→ Changes in broader workforce salary; and
→  Salaries payable in similar companies.
Reviewed annually and set  
on 1 August each year.
Annual rate for each  
Executive Director is set  
out in the Annual Report on 
remuneration on page 69.
Salary increases will  
normally be in line with 
increases for the wider 
employee population.
Higher increases may be 
awarded in circumstances 
such as following recruitment 
into a role at a below-market 
rate or due to a change in role 
or responsibilities.
For new recruits, the salary 
increases may be higher than 
the wider workforce until the 
individual is aligned with 
market levels.
None.
Benefits As base salary 
above, benefits are 
non-pensionable.
The Company pays the cost of providing the 
benefits on a monthly basis or as required for 
one-off events. 
Benefits consist of a fully expensed company car  
(or cash equivalent) and private medical insurance,  
in addition to a lump sum death-in-service benefit  
of five times base salary. Death-in-service benefit is 
also available to all UK staff at five times base salary 
for those who opt to join the Company pension 
scheme and at two times for those opting out.
In the case that an Executive Director is required to 
relocate, either on recruitment or during service as 
a Director, reasonable relocation expenses will be 
provided in line with market practice.
The Committee may change the benefits offered in 
line with local market practice or the operational 
needs of the business.
Reviewed annually and set  
on 1 August each year in  
line with the Company’s  
car policy to a maximum of 
£11,000 per annum cash 
allowance or equivalent  
lease value.
The maximum opportunity  
for other benefits is defined 
by the nature of the benefit 
itself and the cost of 
providing it. As the cost of 
providing such insurance 
benefits varies according to 
premium rates and the cost 
of other benefits is 
dependent on market  
rates and other factors,  
there is no formal maximum 
monetary value. 
None.
Pension As base  
salary above.
The Executive Directors are not members of  
the Company pension scheme and have their  
own pension arrangements. The Company’s  
only pension liability is to make annual cash 
contributions to the personal pension  
arrangements of the Executive Directors.

Annual bonuses are paid shortly after the end  
of the financial year end to which they relate.
Bonuses are normally payable in cash but the 
Committee has flexibility to introduce a deferral  
if it deems it appropriate.
Bonus payments are based on Group financial 
targets. Maximum bonus payments are made only 
on the achievement of outstanding performance. 
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Performance targets are set at the start of the 
financial year and the level of bonus paid is 
determined by the Committee after the year  
end based on performance against target.
A claw back facility will apply from 1 April 2014 
under which part or all of the cash bonus may be 
forfeited or clawed back if any of the circumstances 
outlined on page 62 arise.
For Executive Directors  
the maximum annual  
bonus payable is 100%  
of base salary.
No bonuses will be payable 
unless a minimum level of 
financial performance has 
been achieved. 50% is

Financial targets will comprise at 
least half of the bonus.
Details of the measures and

to vary the weighting of 
performance metrics over the life 
of this remuneration policy.
2013 PSP To incentivise 
delivery of 
long-term 
shareholder value.
The 2013 PSP was approved by shareholders  
at the AGM on 23 July 2013. The key features  
are as follows:
→  Conditional share awards or options may be 
granted under the PSP (the exercise price of 
options is set by the Committee and can be nil).
→  The Committee will impose demanding 
performance conditions on the vesting of awards.
→  Outstanding commitments to issue new shares 
under all share plans operated by the Company  
are subject to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in any ten year period.
→  The PSP includes the ability to grant options under 
an HM Revenue & Customs approved schedule.
A claw back facility is in operation with effect from 
1 April 2014 under which part or the whole of the 
PSP award can be recovered prior to vesting if any 
of the circumstances outlined on page 62 arise, 
including if there is a restatement of the financial 
accounts or the individual is dismissed for cause.
A maximum grant is 
permitted of 100% of  
base salary each year  
(200% of base salary in 
exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment).
Vesting is dependent on 
performance conditions.  
On achievement of threshold 
performance 25% of the 
award vests for 30% CAGR  
in adjusted EPS.
Performance condition based on 
CAGR in adjusted EPS which must 
be met over a three year period. 
In exceptional circumstances, the 
Committee has discretion to 
change the performance measures, 
targets and weightings between 
measures during the performance 
period if there is a significant event 
which causes the Committee to 
believe that the original conditions 
are no longer appropriate. Any 
amendments would be such that 
the new conditions are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy 
than the original conditions.
The Committee also has discretion 
to reduce the percentage that vests 
in cases where it believes the 
outcome of the performance 
conditions is not a fair reflection  
of the Company’s performance.

Differences in remuneration policy for all employees
All employees of the Group are entitled to base salary  
and benefits. The Group operates a number of pension  
plans for employees which it operates in line with local  
market practice. Some employees in senior roles are  
entitled to participate in an annual bonus scheme. The 
maximum opportunity available is based on the seniority  
and responsibility of the role.
Conditional share awards are only available to senior  
executives and Directors. Since 2008, share option grants  
and conditional share awards have been made only to 
employees at senior executive level.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group
The Committee invites the HR Director to present at a meeting  
on the proposals for salary increases for the employee population 
generally and on any other changes to remuneration policy 
within the Group. The Committee limits any salary increases  
for Executive Directors to the inflationary increase available  
to employees unless there has been a change in role or they  
are progressing through a development phase.
The HR Director consults with the Committee on the performance 
metrics for Executive Directors’ bonuses and to the extent to 
which these should be cascaded to other employees. The 
Committee approves the overall annual bonus cost to the 
Group each year. The Committee has oversight over the grant 
of all LTIP awards across the Group.
The Group does not specifically invite employees to comment 
on the Directors’ remuneration policy but any comments made 
by employees are taken into account.
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration 
structure for senior management in the three tiers below 
Executive Director and uses this information to work with  
the human resources team to ensure consistency of approach 
throughout the Group.
Notes to the Policy table
Performance measure and targets for the annual bonus  
plan and the 2013 PSP
The performance targets are determined annually  
by the Committee.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation, closed defined benefit pension 
scheme charges and excludes exceptional items. Average net 
debt is the net sum of external borrowings, finance leases and 
cash and cash equivalents, measured at each month end to 
produce a simple annual average which excludes preference 
stock from targets and results. Adjusted EPS excludes 
exceptional items, pension administration costs, IAS 19 
financing charges and the tax thereon from earnings.
The Committee selected the performance conditions because 
these are central to the Company’s overall strategy. The annual 
bonus plan metrics of adjusted EBITDA and average net debt 
provide a balanced mix of targets to deliver improving business 
performance and enhanced cash generation. Importantly, 
both are consistent with the longer term goals of generating 
additional shareholder value and facilitating additional 
investment in the business itself and hence align with the long 
term incentive plan. Average net debt has been chosen as the 
appropriate measure of cash performance as it encourages 
continuous focus on cash and working capital management 
throughout the year rather than focusing on a single point in 
time. The two targets are structured as a matrix to ensure that 
management must have regard to both metrics to maximise 
reward. Equally, if either metric falls below a specified minimum 
level of performance then no reward can be earned, irrespective 
of performance on the other metric.
The Committee considers CAGR in adjusted EPS to be the  
most appropriate performance condition to align the longer 
term goals of executive management with the interests of 
shareholders. The performance period is three years at which 
point testing occurs and awards either vest or lapse. There is 
no opportunity for testing to be deferred or for re-testing at a 
later date. Minimum and maximum targets, at which 25% and 
100% of awards vest, are set at the time each award is made 
and are adjusted to ensure that they remain suitably 
demanding but also motivating.
The Committee is of the opinion that the performance targets 
for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive in respect of 
the Group and that it would be detrimental to the interests of 
the Group to disclose them. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 66
Total remuneration opportunity
The chart below demonstrates the total amount of 
remuneration payable to the Chief Executive, Robert Purcell  
and Finance Director, Brian Tenner, under the proposed 
remuneration policy for the year ending 31 March 2015 should 
they achieve minimum, on-target or maximum performance. 
The amounts shown represent £’000s and for share related 
elements are the face value of awards.
The chart shows that at minimum levels of performance the 
Executive Directors only form of remuneration is the fixed 
element of base pay, benefits in kind and pension contributions. 
For performance above minimum the variable element of pay 
for the Chief Executive increases to approximately 63% of total 
reward or 168% of the fixed elements of pay noted. The ratios 
are similar for the Finance Director.
The Executive Directors’ base salaries are assessed independently 
of the ability to earn variable awards under the annual and long 
term incentive plans and hence future bonus opportunities are 
not a consideration when setting base pay.

Note: On-target assumes 50% of maximum bonus is earned and threshold vesting

Service contracts, remuneration and exit payments
As a matter of policy, the length of service contracts and  
notice periods is determined by the Committee at the time 
of appointment in light of the then prevailing market practice. 
Details of the Executive Directors’ terms of appointment and 
notice periods are as follows:
Date of contract
Expiry date of current  
term/notice period
Robert Purcell 21 January 2013 No specified term/terminable 
on 12 months’ notice
Brian Tenner 1 September 2010 No specified term/terminable 
on 12 months’ notice
Other than normal payments due during notice periods,  
there are no express provisions for compensation on early 
termination of the Executive Directors’ contracts. In the event 
of early termination, the Company’s policy is to act fairly in all 
circumstances. The Committee has noted the Association of 
British Insurers’ and National Association of Pension Funds’ 
joint statement on Executive Contracts and Severance. Neither 
of the Executive Directors’ contracts provide for compensation 
in the event of a change of control of the Company. Copies of 
the two service contracts are available for inspection by 
shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, any outstanding awards 
under the long term incentive plan may vest. Awards will 
become exercisable immediately. The proportion of award 
vesting will be determined by the Committee based on the 
proportion of the performance period completed and the 
extent to which the performance condition has been met  
at the date the change of control occurs. 
The Committee has discretion to waive any performance condition 
if it considers this appropriate in the particular circumstances.

Leavers
The Committee’s policy for exit payments on a leaver event involving an Executive Director is:
Item Policy Details
Salary, pension and benefits A maximum of 12 months’ salary, pension and benefits 
may be payable.
Payments may be subject to mitigation if the leaver 
finds alternative employment.
Annual bonus No annual bonus normally payable, unless the 
Committee uses its discretion to treat as a good leaver.
Good leavers are entitled to receive a bonus based on 
performance to date of termination, pro-rated for the  
period of service to termination.
PSP The Committee will use its discretion to determine  
whether the individual should be treated as a good  
leaver or a bad leaver.
In the event of death or retirement, an individual will 
be treated as a good leaver.
Bad leavers will forfeit outstanding PSP awards.
Good leavers’ awards shall vest pro-rata based on the 
proportion of the vesting period completed and based 
on the extent to which the performance condition has 
been met at the date of leaving.
Awards may be exercised within a six month period 
following date of leaving. In the case of death, the 
award may be exercised within a 12 month period 
following death. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 67
Corporate Governance
In determining whether an individual should be treated as a  
good leaver or a bad leaver, and in assessing the extent to which 
any award will vest, the Committee will consider the specific 
circumstances of the departure, the individual’s performance 
prior to departure and the performance of the Company.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event of the appointment of a new Director the same 
principles would apply as they do today to the existing Directors.
The remuneration package of any new Executive Director 
would therefore include the elements and maximum award size 
set out on pages 63 and 64 in accordance with the Company’s 
remuneration policy and subject to the same discretions.
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to 
set the salary level in accordance with the remuneration policy 
and having taken into account the individual’s experience, the 
nature of the role and their existing remuneration package.
Where it is necessary to ‘buy out’ an individual’s awards from 
a previous employer, the Committee will seek to match the 
expected value of the awards that vest over a timeframe similar 
to those given up, with a commensurate reduction in quantum 
where the new awards will be subject to performance conditions 
that are not as stretching as those on the awards given up. This 
would be an additional element of remuneration to the normal 
maxima as set out in the Policy table on pages 63 and 64.
Details of the Company’s approach to the remuneration of 
Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 68.
External non-executive directorships
The Board encourages Executive Directors to broaden  
their experience outside the Company by taking up a  
non-executive directorship.
Long Term Incentive Plans – 2004 Option Plans  
(audited information)
The 2004 Option Plans were not used during the year ended 
31 March 2014 as indicated in the resolution approving the 
2013 PSP at the Annual General Meeting on 23 July 2013. The 
final use of these plans was an award of options to Robert 
Purcell in January 2013 on joining the Company. The information 
presented below is therefore purely in respect of awards made 
in previous years. The plans consist of the Renold plc 2004 
Inland Revenue Approved Company Share Option Plan and  
the Renold plc 2004 Non-Inland Revenue Approved Company 
Share Option Plan (together the ‘2004 Option Plans’). Their  
key features are:
 → Market value options exercisable three years after grant; 
 → The maximum annual grant limit is 200% of base salary; and 
 → Outstanding commitments to issue new shares under all 
share plans operated by the Company are subject to a 
maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital in 
any ten year period.
For options granted since the year ended 31 March 2010, the 
performance condition is based on a varying percentage of the 
share options becoming exercisable depending on the Company’s 
share price on the date three years following the date of the 
grant. The following tables show the different conditions for 
existing awards not yet subject to performance testing.

3. Ian Griffiths’ appointment was renewed on 14 January 2013 for a period of three years in line with best practice guidelines.
The Company’s policy for Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is managed by the Board. Their remuneration is confined to fees 
alone, with no performance-related element. Reasonable expenses are also reimbursed as incurred.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. The level of fees is reviewed from 
time to time with regard to fees paid in comparable organisations and the time commitment required. The Chairman’s remuneration 
is determined by the Committee and the Board and is subject to the same basis of review as the other Non-Executive Directors.
The letters of appointment for each of the Non-Executive Directors confirm that their appointment is for a specified term and  
that reappointment is not automatic. When making a decision on reappointment, the Board reviews the Non-Executive Director’s 
attendance and performance at meetings and the composition and skill of the Board as a whole. Each Non-Executive Director is 
appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to earlier termination by either party. Thereafter, the appointment may be 
renewed, provided that both the Non-Executive Director and the Board agree. Their respective appointments continue on an 
annual basis, subject to re-election at each AGM. The letters of appointment contain no provision for payment or compensation  
on early termination. Copies of the individual letters of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s 
registered office.

Annual report on remuneration
The year 2013/14 delivered a good start to the business turnaround plan with significant progress on the key strategic objective to 
lower the Group’s breakeven point. A number of critical operational milestones were achieved as well as fundamental improvements 
in underlying business processes and systems. This was reflected in significant improvements in operational and financial performance 
as evidenced by adjusted earnings growth. At the same time financial risks associated with leverage and pensions continued to be 
managed down. All of these factors were taken into account when remuneration was assessed.
The composition of the Committee is set out on page 61 of the report.

4  Robert Davies left the Company on 31 December 2012. The salary shown for 2013 was in respect of the nine months of service in the previous year (£218,000). It was agreed 
that an amount of £367,000 be paid to Robert Davies as compensation for loss of office equivalent to one years basic salary of £291,000, benefits of £33,000 and 
pension contributions of £43,000.
5  Mark Harper’s fee was £40,000 upon appointment as Non-Executive Director on 1 May 2012 and increased to £110,000 upon his appointment as Chairman on 12 July 2012.
6  John Allkins’ fee was increased to £43,000 on his appointment as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 21 January 2013.
(1) Fixed elements of pay 
(i) Base salary
Consistent with the key strategic goal of lowering the Group’s breakeven point and the pay restraint that continued across the 
Group, there were no pay rises for Executive Directors during the period. Robert Purcell’s annual salary from 1 April 2013 therefore 
remained at £300,000 and Brian Tenner’s annual salary at £185,000. These figures are outlined in the Total remuneration 
table above. 
The proportion of the Group’s basic salary bill attributable to the Executive Directors’ base salaries for the year ended  
31 March 2014 was 0.87% (2013: 0.93%).
(ii) Pension
The Executive Directors only pension entitlements are cash contributions by the Company to their individual personal pension 
plans. Cash contributions equivalent to 15% of base salary were paid during the year ended 31 March 2014 for Robert Purcell 
 of £45,000 (2013: £8,831 in the period from appointment in January 2013 to 31 March 2013) and Brian Tenner of £27,750  
(2013: £27,750). These figures are shown in the Total remuneration table above.  Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 70

Annual report on remuneration 
continued
(iii) Benefits
The Executive Directors received the following benefits during the period. Robert Purcell received a non-cash benefit of £14,000  
for his company car and private healthcare. Brian Tenner received a cash benefit of £10,000 for his company car allowance and 
£1,000 non-cash benefit for private healthcare. These figures are outlined in the Total remuneration table on page 69.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits.
(2) Variable elements of pay – awards vested in year
(i) Annual bonus (payable in cash) 
The annual bonus, which is payable in cash, provides the Executive Directors with the opportunity to receive an annual  
bonus based on achievement of certain performance targets. For the year ended 31 March 2014 the annual bonus scheme  
for Executive Directors was structured as follows: 
Maximum Adjusted EBITDA Average Net Debt Paid in cash
Total paid as 
% maximum
(% salary) Weight Achieved Weight Achieved (£’000) %
Robert Purcell 100% 70% 100% 30% 100% 300 100
Brian Tenner 100% 70% 100% 30% 100% 185 100
The two metrics shown were structured as a matrix such that failure to deliver a minimum result in either metric would have led 
to no bonus being achievable in the other. Similarly, in order to achieve the maximum award, superior performance would be 
required against both metrics. There was no allowance for personal objectives during the year (for the year ended 31 March 2013 
this was 20%). 
The following table sets out an indication of the actual performance against the targets for the year ended 31 March 2014.  
The performance targets for the annual bonus are based on internal targets and considered commercially sensitive.  
Consequently these will not be disclosed.

to 47.9% of the maximum award) vested on 27 September 2013 as the mid-market price of the Company’s shares on the three 
preceding trading days was 38.35p.
(iii) 2013 PSP awards performance testing during the year

The graph above shows the Company’s total shareholder return (share price growth plus dividends reinvested where applicable) 
for each of the last five financial years of a holding of shares in the Company against a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE 
All-Share Industrial Engineering index. The Committee considers this index to be an appropriate index for total shareholder return 
and comparison disclosure as it represents a broad equity index of which the Company is a constituent.
The market capitalisation of the Company at 31 March 2014 was £124,358,571 and the lowest and highest share prices during the 
year were 20p and 67.5p respectively, with a share price on 31 March 2014 of 55.75p.

Chief Executive’s remuneration for the period 2009/10 to 2013/14
The following table shows the history of the Chief Executive’s total remuneration and proportions of annual bonus and Options 
vesting each year as a percentage of the maximum over the last five years.

1  The values use the same methodology as that shown in calculating the single figure basis of remuneration in the table on page 69. The total remuneration figure for 
the year ended 31 March 2013 has therefore been re-calculated to exclude a sum of £367,000 paid as compensation for loss of office to Robert Davies.
2  Figures for 2009/10 to 2012/13 are in respect of Robert Davies who left the Company on 31 December 2012. Robert Purcell was appointed as CEO on 21 January 2013 
and his total remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2013 was £71,000. Robert Purcell did not participate in the annual bonus plan for the year ended 31 March 2013 
and was not eligible for any vesting incentives during this year. Figures for the year ended 31 March 2014 are in respect of Robert Purcell, who was not eligible for any 
vesting under long term incentives during the year.

1  Due to a change in the Chief Executive in the prior year the remuneration paid was less than would normally be expected in a comparative 12 month period.
2 The figures include only those employees who were not promoted and did not change role during the year to provide a like-for-like comparison.
3  The Group uses the UK workforce as an appropriate comparator group as the Executives are based in the UK and the structure of remuneration varies considerably 
based on local market practice in other countries in which the Group operates.
Relative importance of spend on pay 
The table below sets out the total of the Executive Directors’ remuneration (on a single total remuneration basis as shown in  
the table on page 69) compared to a number of other key financial metrics. The metrics chosen are considered of interest and

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, closed defined benefit pension scheme 
charges and exceptional items. Average net debt is the net sum of external borrowings, finance leases and cash and cash 
equivalents, measured at each month end to produce a simple annual average.

The performance conditions attaching to options that will be granted under the 2013 PSP in the year commencing 1 April 2014, 
measured as the equivalent CAGR in adjusted EPS over a three year period, are as follows. On achievement of threshold 
performance 25% of the award vests. Straight line vesting occurs between threshold and maximum performance. Performance 
will be measured from an adjusted EPS figure of 3.2p for the year to 31 March 2014.

Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee received independent advice from EY in relation to the 2013 PSP, with total fees for services 
provided amounting to £34,890 plus VAT. The fee for this advice was negotiated in advance of the work being undertaken given 
the nature of the project. EY is the Company’s external auditor and was appointed by the Committee to advise following an 
assessment and interview process in relation to the 2013 PSP alone. EY also provide tax services to the Company: full details  
of EY’s remuneration are set out in Note 2(b) to the Company financial statements on page 98.
The Committee has also received advice from PwC, with total fees for services provided over the year amounting to £3,150 plus 
VAT. PwC was appointed by the Committee following an assessment and interview process and has advised on various issues  
including remuneration policy and the Regulations and updating the Committee on trends in compensation matters. Fees  
charged have been on a time-spent basis. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and adheres to that  
group’s Code of Conduct. PwC has provided internal audit and pensions related services to the Company. The Committee  
has chosen to retain PwC as its adviser.

Corporate Governance
Directors’ report
The Directors submit their report and the financial statements 
as set out on pages 81 to 122.
The Directors’ report, which comprises pages 75 to 78,  
is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and the FCA’s Listing and Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules.
In accordance with section 414C (11) of the Companies Act 2006, 
information about the employment of disabled persons, employee 
involvement and greenhouse gas emissions, which is required 
to be included in the Directors’ report, has been included in  
the Strategic Report. The Corporate Governance report also 
forms part of the Directors’ Report. Where statutory and other 
disclosures have been made elsewhere in the Annual Report 
and Accounts, they are cross referenced accordingly and 
therefore incorporated by reference.
The Strategic Report provides an overview of the performance 
of the business in the year ended 31 March 2014 and covers likely 
future developments in the business of the Company and the Group.
Group
The Company is a public limited company incorporated  
in England, registered number 249688, with its registered 
office at Renold House, Styal Road, Wythenshawe, 
Manchester M22 5WL. 
The Group is an international engineering group, producing 
a wide range of high quality engineering products which  
are sold in over 100 countries worldwide. 
A summary of the principal undertakings of the Group is  
set out in Note (xiv) to the Company financial statements.
Results
Loss before tax for the year ended 31 March 2014 is  
£10.7m compared with a loss of £11.8m for the year  
ended 31 March 2013.
Dividends
Details about dividend policy are set out on page 88 of the 
Group financial statements.
The Board has decided to recommend that no ordinary 
dividend be paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014, 
but it will consider future dividend policy in the light of results 
from the business going forward.
Dividend payments in respect of the 6% cumulative  
preference stock in the Company were made on 1 July 2013 
and 1 January 2014.
Directors
The current Directors’ biographical details, including the date 
upon which they were appointed to the Board, can be found 
on pages 46 and 47. 
The appointment and replacement of Directors of the Company 
is governed by its articles of association and legislation. The 
Company’s articles of association give power to the Board to 
appoint Directors to fill a vacancy or as additional Directors, 
but also require Directors to retire and submit themselves for 
election at the first Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment. In addition, all Non-Executive Directors are 
subject to annual election: please refer to the Corporate 
Governance report on page 50 for further details. 
As a result, Brian Tenner, Mark Harper, John Allkins and  
Ian Griffiths will be standing for re-election at the 2014 AGM. 
Under the terms of reference of the Nomination Committee, 
appointments to the Board are recommended by the 
Nomination Committee for approval by the Board. For a  
full description of the Company’s policy on appointments  
to the Board, see the Nomination Committee Report at  
pages 58 and 59.
Shareholders may also appoint a Director by ordinary resolution.
Directors’ interests
Details of the interests of the Directors and their connected 
persons in the Company’s share capital and in options held 
under the Company’s share option schemes, along with any 
changes in such interests since the end of the year, are detailed  
in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 60 to 74.  
No Director had any interests in contracts of significance  
in relation to the Company’s business during the year.
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
Liability insurance for directors and officers was maintained 
throughout the year. No qualifying third party indemnity 
provision or qualifying pension scheme indemnity provision 
was in force when this Directors’ report was approved or was 
in force during the year.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Please refer to page 79 for the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts 
and for the Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information 
to auditors. Directors’ report

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 76
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s articles of association were amended at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting, in line with the Companies Act 
2006, to allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest of Directors, on such terms (if any) as the Board thinks 
fit when giving any authorisation. Any decision of the Board to 
authorise a conflict of interest is only effective if it is approved 
without the conflicted Directors voting or without their votes 
being counted and, in making such a decision, the Directors 
must act in a way they consider in good faith will be most likely 
to promote the success of the Company. The Board considers 
that the procedures it has in place for reporting and considering 
conflicts of interest are effective and a review of previously 
approved conflicts is carried out annually.
Shares
Share capital
On 13 and 22 August 2013 respectively, the Company allotted 
500,063 and 1,500,187 fully paid new ordinary shares pursuant  
to the exercise of warrants by Royal Bank of Scotland plc  
at a price of 21.06 pence per share. Both allotments were 
conditional only on admission of the new shares to the Official  
List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market for listed securities becoming effective. Admission to 
the main market became effective on 16 and 29 August 2013 
respectively. The warrants were originally granted in August 
2009 as part of the refinancing agreed with the Company’s 
banks at that time, being Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Fortis 
Bank UK Branch. The warrants were subsequently modified 
during the equity placement in December 2009 at which time 
the exercise price was fixed at 21.06 pence. Following the two 
exercises by Royal Bank of Scotland plc during the year, there 
are no remaining warrants.
As a result of the above allotment, as at 31 March 2014, the 
issued share capital of the Company was £27,146,657.75 divided 
into 223,064,703 ordinary shares of 5p each, 580,482 units of  
6% cumulative preference stock of £1 each and 77,064,703 
deferred shares of 20p each. The ordinary shares represent 
41.08% of the Company’s total share capital, the preference 
stock represents 2.14% and the deferred shares represent 
56.78%. The Company’s ordinary shares and preference stock  
are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The deferred shares 
have no voting or dividend rights and are not able to be traded. 
The Company obtained shareholder authority at the 2013 
Annual General Meeting to make market purchases of up to 
22,106,445 ordinary shares in the Company, which remains 
outstanding until the conclusion of the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting. The minimum price which must be paid for any 
ordinary share is the nominal value of such share at the time  
of the purchase and the maximum price is that permitted under 
the FCA’s Listing Rules or, in the case of a tender offer, 5% 
above the average of the middle market quotations of the 
Company’s ordinary shares as derived from the London  
Stock Exchange’s Daily Official List for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date on which the tender offer  
is announced. As at the date of this report, the Company had 
not purchased any of its own ordinary shares in the market 
pursuant to such authority. The Directors will seek authority 
from shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
for the Company to purchase, in the market, up to 22,306,470 
of its own ordinary shares (which represents approximately 
10% of the Company’s ordinary share capital as at the date of 
this report) either to be cancelled or retained as treasury shares. 
Details of the Company’s share capital are also set out in 
Note 19 to the Group financial statements on page 115.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares 
are contained in the Company’s articles of association, a copy of 
which is available at www.renold.com or can be obtained upon 
request to the Company Secretary. The articles of association 
may only be changed by a special resolution passed at a 
general meeting of the Company.
Voting rights
The Directors confirm that no person has any special rights of 
control over the Company’s share capital and that no shares 
have been issued that carry any special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. 
Participants in employee share schemes have no voting or 
other rights in respect of the shares subject to those awards 
until the options are exercised, at which time the shares rank 
pari passu in all respects with shares already in issue. No such 
schemes carry any special rights with regard to control of 
the Company. 
No member shall, unless the Directors otherwise determine, 
be entitled to vote at a general meeting either personally or by 
proxy, or to exercise any other right conferred by membership 
in relation to meetings of the Company, if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him to the Company in respect of such 
shares remains unpaid. The Directors also have powers to 
suspend voting rights in certain limited circumstances when 
a shareholder has failed to comply with a notice issued under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 77

Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights and 
appointing a proxy or proxies in respect of the resolutions to

No major shareholder had any interest in derivatives or 
financial instruments relating to shares carrying voting  
rights that are linked to the Company’s shares.
Directors’ rights in respect of shares
The Board, which is responsible for the management of  
the Company’s business, may exercise all the powers of  
the Company subject to the provisions of relevant legislation 
and the Company’s articles of association. The powers of the 
Directors set out in the articles of association include those 
in relation to the issue and buyback of shares.
Issue of shares
The Directors are authorised to issue equity securities either 
by way of a rights issue or in any other way, provided that the 
shares issued other than by way of a rights issue, open offer 
or other pre-emptive offer or under the various share option 
schemes of the Company be limited to shares with an aggregate 
nominal value of £552,661.13, being equal to 5% of the 
aggregate nominal amount of the Company’s ordinary share 
capital in issue as at the date of the Notice of the Company’s 
2013 Annual General Meeting. The authority will expire at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Directors will seek 
authority from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to 
issue equity securities either by way of a rights issue or in any 
other way, provided that the shares issued other than by way 
of a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer or under 
the various share option schemes of the Company be limited to 
shares with an aggregate nominal value of £557,661.76.
In addition, the Directors have authority to allot shares up to 
a maximum nominal amount of £7,361,446.28, representing 
approximately two thirds of the issued ordinary share capital 
as at the date of the Notice of the Company’s 2013 Annual 
General Meeting. The authority will expire at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. The Directors will seek authority from 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to allot shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £7,428,054.61, representing 
approximately 66.6% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 
the date of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
Transfer of shares
The registration of transfers may be suspended at such  
times and for such periods as the Directors may determine.  
The Directors may refuse to register the transfer of any share  
which is not a fully paid-up share and may refuse to register 
any transfer in favour of more than four persons jointly. The 
Directors may also refuse to recognise any instrument of 
transfer unless it is in respect of any one class of share, is 
lodged at the requisite place and, where appropriate, is 
accompanied by any relevant share certificate and such  
other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require  
to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. 
The Directors may suspend transfers where a shareholder  
has failed to comply with a notice issued under section 793  
of the Companies Act 2006. 
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of shares  
in the Company other than certain restrictions which may  
from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example, insider trading laws and market requirements  
relating to close periods) and pursuant to the FCA’s Listing 
Rules whereby certain employees of the Company require the 
approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s securities.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities which may result in restrictions  
on the transfer of securities or voting rights.

Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 78
Contracts
Change of control provisions
The Company’s main UK banking facilities agreement with 
Lloyds Bank plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB contains  
a change of control provision. This requires the Company  
to provide notification to the agent in the event of a change  
of control. The banks may then demand cancellation and 
repayment of the commitments and the loans. 
The share subscription and shareholders’ agreement  
between L. G. Balakrishnan & Bros Ltd, Renold International 
Holdings Limited and Renold Chain India Private Limited  
dated 24 June 2008 contains certain change of control 
provisions. On the change of control of a shareholder (being  
one of the parties to the agreement), the other shareholder  
has a right to terminate the agreement and/or to require the 
shareholder suffering the change of control to sell, at a fair 
price, all of its equity shares to the terminating shareholder  
or a nominee of such shareholder. 
No other material contracts contain change of control provisions. 
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Note 18 to the Group financial statements on pages 110 to 115 
details the Group’s obligations to contribute to the UK defined 
benefit pension schemes.
Details of the effect of any change of control in relation to 
awards under the long term incentive plan are set out on  
page 66 within the Directors’ remuneration report.
Important events affecting the Group since  
31 March 2014
Note 27 to the financial statements refers to post balance  
sheet events and is incorporated by reference here.
Going concern
After making enquiries, we, the Directors, have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to  
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  
We therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
The basis on which this conclusion has been reached is set  
out on page 83 which is incorporated by reference here.
The Directors’ report was approved by the Board on 
27 May 2014.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
in relation to the Group financial statements and Annual Report
Consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and regulations and IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
must not approve the financial statements for the Group unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. Under IFRS, the directors are required to prepare 
financial statements that present fairly the financial position of 
the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the 
Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
 → select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently; 
 → present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 → make judgements and estimates that are reasonable; 
 → provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and 
financial performance; 
 → state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
 → prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records, which show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and the Corporate Governance Report in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, 
including the requirements of the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
Parent company financial statements prepared under UK GAAP
The directors are responsible for preparing the parent company 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors 
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with UK GAAP. Under company law, the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Company and of the profit and loss of the Company for 
that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors  
are required to: 
 → select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 → make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
 → state whether applicable accounting standards have  
been followed, subject to any material departures  
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 → prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the  
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ report are listed on pages 46 and 47. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the 
Company’s auditor, each of these Directors confirms that: 
 → to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there 
is no information (that is, information needed by the Group’s 
auditor in connection with preparing its report) of which the 
Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
 → each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Directors’ responsibility statements pursuant to DTR4
Each of us, for himself and on behalf of each other director  
who held office on 31 March 2014, confirms that, to the best  
of his or her knowledge: 
 → the Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and result of the Company and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation as a whole; and 
 → the Strategic Report (comprising pages 2 to 43) and the 
Directors’ report (on pages 75 to 78) includes fair review  
of the development and performance of the business and  
the position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties it faces.
 → The Board confirms that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the performance, strategy and business model of the Company.

Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out 
to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are 
promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud 
1.  Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares. 
2.  Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call. 
3.  Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised  
by the FCA. 
4.  Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details. 
5.  Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back. 
6.  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date. 
7.  Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams. 
8.  Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
9.  Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money. 
10 .   R emember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! 
Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, 
where you can find out more about investment scams. 
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. Independent auditor’s report

Financial Statements
We have audited the group financial statements of Renold plc  
for the year ended 31 March 2014 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement  
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows, the Accounting Policies and the 
related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
set out on page 79, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 → give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs  
as at 31 March 2014 and of its loss for the year then ended; 
 → have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
 → have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest  
effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources  
in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team: 
 → Revenue recognition
 → Inventory provisioning
 → Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes
 → Group restructuring
 → Deferred tax
 → Risk of misstatement due to fraud and error
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning  
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.  
For the purposes of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement we define 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, 
would be changed or influenced. 
We also determine a lower level of performance materiality 
which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to 
reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined  
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged  
would be material for the financial statements as a whole. We 
determined materiality for the Group to be £415,000, which is 
approximately 5% of forecast adjusted profit before interest  
and tax. We adjusted profit before interest and tax to exclude 
exceptional costs which do not reflect the underlying  
performance of the Group.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that overall performance materiality (i.e. our 
tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) 
for the Group should be 50% of planning materiality, namely 
£207,000. Our objective in adopting this approach was to 
ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit differences  
in all accounts did not exceed our planning materiality level.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £20,750, as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Following our assessment of the risk of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements, we selected 11 components 
which represent the principal business units within the Group’s 
two reportable segments and account for 69% of the Group’s 
profit before interest and tax and 86% of the Group’s revenue.  Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 82
Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of Renold plc 
continued
Five of these were subject to a full scope audit, whilst the 
remaining nine were subject to a specific scope audit where the 
extent of audit work was based on our assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s 
business operations at those locations. They were also selected 
to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to 
address the risks of material misstatement identified above. 
For the remaining components, we performed other procedures to 
confirm there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
in the Group financial statements. 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of 
planned visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior 
Statutory Auditor visits each of the locations where the Group 
audit scope was either full scope or identified as a higher risk 
location annually. For all entities in scope, the Group audit  
team reviewed key working papers and participated in the 
component team’s audit planning, including the component 
team’s discussion of fraud and error, and audit planning, including 
the component team’s discussion of fraud and error, and  
the audit closing meeting.
Our response to the risks identified above was as follows:
 → Revenue recognition – we carried out substantive testing  
and analytical procedures, including cut-off testing verifying  
the recognition of revenue to contractual shipping terms  
and goods dispatched. We confirmed management’s  
policies for revenue recognition continue to be robust  
and are applied consistently. 
 → Inventory provisioning – we tested the standard costs used 
to value inventory at year end, challenged management’s key 
assumptions, such as labour and overhead absorption rates. 
We tested managements’ calculation of the inventory 
provision, challenged management’s judgements formed in 
arriving at those values for appropriatenes and confirmed 
that the provision was derived in line with Group policy.  
We also checked that a consistent approach to inventory 
valuation and provisioning had been adopted globally. 
 → Accounting for defined benefit pension schemes – we 
challenged the assumptions and methodology applied in 
calculating the defined benefit pension scheme deficit for 
consistency and appropriateness, including specifically the 
discount rates, inflation rates and mortality assumptions used.
 → Group restructuring – we reviewed the exceptional costs 
recognised in the financial statements as a result of the 
group restructuring to test that the costs have been 
appropriately accounted for and disclosed in line with IFRS.
 → Deferred tax – we considered the appropriateness of 
management’s assumptions and estimates in relation to  
the likelihood of generating suitable future taxable profits  
to support the recognition of deferred tax assets described  
in note 17, challenging those assumptions and considering 
supporting forecasts and estimates.
 → Risk of misstatement due to fraud and error – we carried out 
analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to 
identify and test the risk of fraud arising from management 
override of controls. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and 
the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report  
to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report  
and Accounts is: 
 → materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
 → apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge  
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider the Annual Report and Accounts are fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
 → certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
 → we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 → the Directors’ statement, set out on page 78, in relation  
to going concern; and 
 → the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating  
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Renold plc for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 
on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited.

Financial Statements
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Renold plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Company 
financial statements present information about the Company  
as a separate entity and not about the Group. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU. In addition, the financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are 
presented on pages 124 to 134. The financial statements were 
approved by the Board on 27 May 2014.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries). Control is defined as where the Group 
has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or 
otherwise has power to govern financial and operating policies.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control  
is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated  
from the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group 
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the cost cannot be recovered.
The results and financial position of Renold Scottish Limited 
Partnership (SLP) have been consolidated in the consolidated 
financial statements of Renold plc. Renold plc is the parent 
undertaking of the general partner in the SLP (see Note (xiv)  
to the Company financial statements). Accordingly, advantage 
has been taken of the exemption conferred by paragraph 7  
of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the 
requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of  
the partnership’s accounts.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. In determining the appropriate basis of 
preparation of the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to consider whether the Group can continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Further information in relation to the Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position is set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 2 to 43.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity 
position and borrowing facilities are described in the  
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 43. In addition Note 25  
to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital, its financial  
risk management objectives, details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities and its exposure to foreign exchange, 
credit and interest rate risk. Further details of the Group’s cash 
balances and borrowings are included in Notes 13, 14 and 24  
of the financial statements.
The Directors have assessed the future funding requirements  
of the Group and the Company and compared them to the level 
of available borrowing facilities. The assessment included a 
detailed review of financial and cash flow forecasts, financial 
instruments and hedging arrangements for at least the  
12 month period from the date of signing the Annual Report  
and Accounts. The Directors considered a range of potential 
scenarios within the key markets the Group serves and how 
these might impact the Group’s cash flow, facility headroom 
and banking covenants. The Directors also considered what 
mitigating actions the Group could take to limit any adverse 
consequences. The Group’s forecasts and projections show  
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of  
its borrowing facilities and covenants. 
Having undertaken this work, the Directors are of the opinion 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis  
in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the 
Group are measured using the currency that best reflects the 
economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances 
relevant to that entity (the functional currency). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the 
functional and presentational currency of the parent company, 
Renold plc. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the  
functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  
at the date of the transaction or average rates where 
applicable. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation  
at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the 
income statement, except for monetary items that form part  
of the net investment in foreign operations which are taken  
to other comprehensive income. 
Assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated  
into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the 
financial year. Income statements and cash flows are translated  
at the appropriate average rates of exchange for the year. 
Differences on exchange arising on the re-translation of net 
assets in overseas subsidiaries at the beginning of the year, 
borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against those 
investments and from the translation of the results at average 
rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income. On  
loss of control of a foreign entity, related exchange differences 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or  
loss on sale.  Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 84

Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services 
provided to external customers after deducting value added  
tax or other sales related taxes and trade discounts. Revenue 
from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks  
and rewards of ownership of goods are transferred to the 
buyer which is normally the point of despatch. Revenue  
from the sale of services is recognised when the service  
has been provided.
Exceptional items 
Items which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate,  
are material to an understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance are separately disclosed as memorandum 
information on the face of the income statement. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes  
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use  
or sale are capitalised as part of the costs of the respective 
assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs 
that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Taxation 
The tax charge comprises current tax payable and deferred tax.
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The 
current tax charge represents an estimate of the amounts 
payable to tax authorities in respect of taxable profits. It is 
based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or 
substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in  
the consolidated financial statements. Currently enacted, or 
substantively enacted, tax rates as at the balance sheet date 
are used in the determination of deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that  
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised or taxable 
profit will be available against which unused tax losses can  
be utilised before they expire.
Deferred income tax is provided on taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except  
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference 
can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to 
allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each 
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable profit will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and not the income statement. Similarly, income tax  
is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are 
credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise, income tax  
is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities 
are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current 
income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the 
deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable authority  
and taxable entity, or where deferred tax relates to different 
taxable entities, the tax authority permits the Group to make  
a single net payment.
Business combinations and goodwill – prior to 1 April 2010
The purchase method of accounting was used to account for 
the acquisition of subsidiaries of the Group. Goodwill represents 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value 
of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets, liabilities  
and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity is 
included as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not amortised but  
is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment charge  
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
In circumstances where the fair value of the interest acquired  
in an entity’s assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds 
the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as 
a gain in the income statement.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3: 
Business combinations to business acquisitions that occurred 
before 4 April 2004. Therefore, the carrying amount of 
goodwill (being cost less accumulated amortisation) included 
under UK GAAP forms the ‘cost’ of goodwill recognised under 
IFRS at the date of transition. Goodwill that was written off 
directly to reserves under former UK GAAP will not be taken 
into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of 
previously acquired businesses after 4 April 2004.
Business combinations and goodwill – post 1 April 2010
There have been no business combinations post 1 April 2010. 
IFRS 3R will apply for any business combinations prospectively 
and will result in the following changes in accounting treatment 
from the policy adopted prior to 1 April 2010: 
 → Acquisition costs incurred will be expensed and included  
in expenses.
 → Contingent consideration will be recognised at fair value at 
the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of 
the contingent consideration will be recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in the profit or loss account or in other 
comprehensive income. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 85
Financial Statements
Interests in joint ventures
The Group has a contractual arrangement with another  
party which represents a joint venture whereby there is an 
agreement to share control over a jointly controlled entity.  
The Group recognises its interest in the entity’s assets and 
liabilities using the equity method of accounting. Under the 
equity method, the interest in the joint venture is carried in  
the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in  
the Group’s share of its net assets, less distributions received 
and less any impairment in value of individual investments.  
The Group income statement reflects the share in the jointly 
controlled entity’s results after tax.
Intangible assets
(a) Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of plant  
and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset. 
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis so as to charge 
the cost of software to the income statement over its expected 
useful life which is between three and seven years. Costs 
associated with maintaining computer software programmes 
are recognised as an expense as incurred.
(b) Research and development
Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design 
and testing of new or improved products) are only recognised  
as intangible assets in circumstances where certain strict criteria 
are satisfied. These include the expectation that it is probable 
that the project will be a success, considering its commercial  
and technological feasibility, and that all associated costs can  
be measured reliably. Otherwise development expenditure is 
recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs 
previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as  
an asset in a subsequent period. Development costs that have 
been capitalised are amortised from the commencement of  
the commercial production of the product on a straight-line 
basis over the period of its expected benefit.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, being 
purchase cost plus any incidental costs of acquisition, less 
accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to 
charge the depreciable amount of the respective assets to the 
income statement over their expected useful lives. The useful 
lives of assets are as follows:
 
Years
Freehold buildings 50
Leasehold properties 50 years or the period  
of the lease if less
General plant and equipment 15
Fixtures 15
Precision cutting and  
grinding machines
10
Motor vehicles 3
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually and 
where adjustments are required these are made prospectively. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately  
to its recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in  
operating profit.
As permitted by IFRS 1, at 4 April 2004, the Group has 
measured its freehold properties on a fair value basis and  
used that value as the deemed cost at the transition date.
Asset impairment 
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed, at least annually, to ensure that assets are not carried 
above their recoverable amounts. Where some indication of 
impairment exists, calculations are made of the discounted 
cash flows resulting from continued use of the assets (value in 
use) or from their disposal (fair value less costs to sell). Where 
these values are less than the carrying amount of the assets,  
an impairment loss is charged to the income statement. 
Leases 
Tangible assets held under finance leases, which are those  
where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the 
balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset  
or the present value of the minimum lease payments. Assets 
acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of 
the useful life of the asset or the lease term. The corresponding 
liability to the leasing company, net of finance charges, is 
included as an obligation under finance leases in creditors. The 
interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income 
statement on a basis which produces a constant rate of charge 
over the period of the liability.
Leases where a significant portion of the risk and reward of 
ownership is retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
Investment property 
One of the Group’s properties is classified as an investment 
property on the basis that it will be held for the long-term, 
earning a rental income. This is a contractual arrangement 
arising from the disposal of a former business segment.
The investment property was previously a manufacturing 
facility of the Group but owner-occupation ceased upon 
disposal of the automotive business. On the date of disposal  
a transfer was made from property to investment property.  
The cost model has been applied since that date and 
depreciation charged at 2% on a straight-line basis. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 86
Accounting policies
continued
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated  
net realisable value, after due allowance for obsolete or  
slow moving items. Cost includes all direct expenditure and 
attributable overhead expenditure incurred in bringing goods  
to their current state under normal operating conditions. The 
first in, first out method of valuation is used. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.  
In the Group accounts, unrealised profit on sales within the 
Group is deducted from inventories.
Assets held for sale 
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount 
will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the 
business and where the sale is highly probable. Assets that are 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original 
invoice amount less an allowance for any identified impairment. 
The impairment allowance is charged to the income statement 
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not collect 
all amounts due under the original terms of the transaction. 
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is 
assessed as remote.
Financial assets and liabilities
(a) Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a  
party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified  
as financial assets at fair value through the income statement  
or loans and receivables, as appropriate. The Group determines  
the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, 
where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation  
at each financial year end. When financial assets are recognised 
initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction 
price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through 
the income statement, directly attributable transaction costs.  
The Group considers whether a contract contains an embedded 
derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. The 
embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if  
it is not measured at fair value through the income statement 
and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely 
related to those of the host contract. Reassessment only occurs  
if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All standard purchases and sales of financial assets are 
recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Standard transactions 
require delivery of assets within the time frame generally 
established by regulation or convention in the market place. 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on 
their classification, as follows:
(i) Financial assets at fair value through the income statement:
Financial assets classified as held for trading and other assets 
designated as such on inception are included in this category. 
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are 
acquired for sale in the short term. Derivatives, including 
separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as held  
for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging 
instruments. Assets are carried in the balance sheet at fair 
value with gains or losses recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets may be designated at initial recognition as  
at fair value through the income statement if the following 
criteria are met: (i) the designation eliminates or significantly 
reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise 
from measuring the assets or recognising gains or losses on 
them on a different basis; or (ii) the assets are part of a group 
of financial assets which are managed and their performance 
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented 
risk management strategy; or (iii) the financial asset contains an 
embedded derivative that would need to be separately recorded.
(ii) Loans and receivables: 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been 
designated as either fair value through the income statement  
or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method if the time value of money  
is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised  
or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
(b) Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether  
a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
(i) Assets carried at amortised cost: 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on assets 
carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the 
loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), 
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest 
rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, 
through the use of an allowance account. The amount of the 
loss is recognised in administration costs. 
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the 
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any 
subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the 
income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the 
asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 87
Financial Statements
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment  
is made when there is objective evidence (such as the 
probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties  
of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all  
of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.  
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through  
use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised 
when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
(ii) Assets carried at cost: 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an 
unquoted equity instrument that is not carried at fair value 
because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, or on a 
derivative asset that is linked to and must be settled by 
delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, has been 
incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market 
rate of return for a similar financial asset.
(c) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when  
the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at the fair value of consideration received  
less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial 
recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, 
settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised 
respectively in finance revenue and finance cost. 
(d) Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement 
Includes financial liabilities held for trading and financial 
liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through the income statement. 
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they  
are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. 
Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are 
also classified as held for trading unless they are designated  
as effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on liabilities 
held for trading are recognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts to hedge its risks associated  
with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. Since  
1 April 2005, such derivative financial instruments have  
been initially recognised at fair value on the date on which  
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets 
when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair 
value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts  
with similar maturity profiles.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which 
hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is 
formally designated and documented at its inception. This 
documentation identifies the risk management objective and 
strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, 
the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being 
hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its 
duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly 
effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and 
are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they 
actually have been highly effective throughout the reporting 
period for which they were designated.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
 → Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in 
cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction; or 
 → Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
There are no fair value hedges.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to 
the income statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising 
from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, as follows: 
(a) Cash flow hedges 
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or  
loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in  
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion  
is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to  
other comprehensive income are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects the income 
statement, such as when a forecast sale occurs. 
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive  
income are transferred to the income statement. If the  
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or  
exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation  
as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement  
or to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or 
liability as above. If the related transaction is not expected  
to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
(b) Hedges of a net investment 
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a 
hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the 
net investment, are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow 
hedges. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion are 
recognised in other comprehensive income while any gains or 
losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the 
income statement. On loss of control of the foreign operation, 
the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the 
income statement. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 88
Accounting policies
continued
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or  
other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those  
of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at  
its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the 
income statement.
From 1 April 2005, the Group’s 6% cumulative preference stock 
of £1 each ‘Preference Stock’ has been classified as a liability. 
Dividends payable are included within net finance costs. 
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans  
around the world. The costs are calculated by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Any past 
service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised 
immediately in income. Administration costs, other than plan 
asset management costs which are included in the actual 
return on plan assets, are charged to operating costs,  
including the Pension Protection Fund Levy.
Remeasurement gains and losses, comprising of actuarial gains 
and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts 
included in net interest), are recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the net total for each plan of the present value 
of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair 
value of plan assets (for funded schemes) at the balance sheet 
date. If a plan records a surplus, the asset recognised is limited  
to the present value of any amount expected to be recoverable 
by the Group by way of refunds or reduction in future contributions.
Under the UK pension scheme rules, any notional surplus arising 
on payment of agreed contributions is fully recoverable.
For defined contribution plans, the Group’s contributions are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they 
fall due. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has 
no further payment obligation.
(b) Share-based compensation 
The Group operates equity settled, share-based compensation 
plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is calculated using a 
Black-Scholes pricing model and is recognised as an expense 
over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over 
the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value  
of the options or performance shares granted. At each balance 
sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises 
the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity 
over the remaining vesting period. No expense is recognised  
for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards  
where vesting is conditional upon market or non-vesting 
conditions which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether  
or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied provided 
that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.  
The market-based conditions are linked to the market price  
of shares in the Company.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or  
a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled 
award, the cost based on the original award terms continues  
to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition,  
an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting 
period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based 
on the difference between the fair value of the original award 
and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on 
the date of the modification. No reduction is recognised if this 
difference is negative.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has applied IFRS 2: Share-
based payment only to equity settled awards granted after  
7 November 2002 and which vested on or after 1 January 2005.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at 
cost. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash 
equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank 
overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities  
on the balance sheet.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group: (i) has a present 
legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;  
(ii) it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will  
be required to settle the obligation and (iii) a reliable estimate 
of the amount can be made. Where the Group expects a 
provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
Costs related to ongoing activities of the Group are not 
provided in advance.
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements  
in the period in which the dividends are paid or approved by 
the Company’s shareholders.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts  
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets  
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and  
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
However, uncertainty about these assumptions and  
estimates could result in outcomes that could require a  
material adjustment to the carrying value of the Group’s  
assets or liabilities in the future. Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 89
Financial Statements
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a potential risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts  
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: 
a) Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date.  
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the asset  
or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of those cash flows.  
Further details are included in Note 7. 
b) Deferred tax assets 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax 
assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning 
strategies. Actual outcomes may vary that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts. Further details are 
contained in Note 17. 
c) Retirement benefit obligations 
The valuation of the Group’s defined benefit plans are determined by using actuarial valuations. These involve making assumptions 
about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long term nature of these plans, 
such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability. Further details are given in Note 18.
d) Onerous lease 
The Group has assessed an existing operating lease obligation at the Bredbury facility in the period and concluded that an onerous  
lease provision is required. This involves making assumptions upon future sub-let income streams and the discount rate used.  
Refer to Note 2(c) and 16.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
The Group has not adopted the following pronouncements, which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) but are not effective for the year ended 31 March 2014:
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) Effective date

1  The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations (except that for IAS 27, IAS 28, IFRS 10-12 the dates reflect 
the later mandatory endorsement date in the EU). As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the 
application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having being endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism. In the majority  
of cases, this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsements restricts the Group’s 
discretion to early adopt standards.
The Group has adopted all applicable amendments to standards with an effective date from 1 April 2013. The Group has adopted 
amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits, including consequential amendments to other standards, with a date of initial 
application of 1 January 2013, and restated the prior year’s results accordingly.  Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 90
Accounting policies
continued
The Group has changed its accounting policies in accordance with the modified accounting standard, IAS 19R, with respect to the 
basis for accounting for financing income/expense on the value of the defined benefit pension schemes’ assets/liabilities and with 
respect to the costs of administering the defined benefit pension schemes. The Group now determines financing income/expense 
for the period by applying the discount rate used for valuing the schemes’ liabilities to the value of the net pension asset/liability  
at the beginning of the year (taking into account any changes during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments). 
Previously, the Group calculated financing income by applying the expected return on assets to the value of the schemes’ assets  
at the beginning of the year and financing expense by applying the discount rate to the value of the schemes’ liabilities at the 
beginning of the year (taking into account any changes during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments). 
Administration costs of defined benefit pension schemes are now included as operating costs except those relating to plan  
asset management which are recognised in other comprehensive income (as part of the difference between actual return  
and net interest income). Previously it was accounted for as a reduction in the expected return on schemes’ assets.
In the course of the process of determining the impact of implementing IAS 19R, the directors have also reconsidered the 
treatment required by IFRIC 14 which deals with refunds of pension surpluses. Under the scheme rules, any notional surplus 
arising on payment of the agreed contributions is fully recoverable and therefore the additional liability of £6.9m and increase  
in deferred tax asset of £4.5m that was recognised at 31 March 2013 has been reversed, with the net result of increasing other 
comprehensive income by £2.4m. If we applied IFRIC 14 consistently with the prior year an additional liability of £8.2m and an 
increase in deferred tax asset of £5.4m would be recognised.
For the year to 31 March 2013, the restatement on implementation of IAS 19R has reduced operating profit before exceptional 
items for the period as previously reported by £1.3m, increased operating exceptional costs by £0.7m, increased net financing 
costs by £2.2m, reduced tax by £1.0m, and increased other comprehensive income by £3.2m.
There was no impact on the balance sheet at 31 March 2012 of these changes and consequently no opening balance sheet at  
1 April 2012 has been presented.
The Group has also adopted IFRS 7 ‘Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ , IFRS 13 ‘Fair value Measurement’ 
both effective from 1 January 2013 and IAS 1R ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ in the period. The Group has also adopted early 
amendments to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets‘ (effective date 1 January 2014). Adoption of these standards did not have any material 
impact on financial performance or position of the Group. The Group disaggregated the foreign exchange differences disclosed in the 
Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in 2013 relating to hedging of net investments.

1. Segmental information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into two operating segments according to the nature of their products and 
services and these are considered by the Directors to be the reportable operating segments of Renold plc as shown below:
 → The Chain segment manufactures and sells power transmission and conveyor chain and also includes sales of  
torque transmission product through Chain National Sales Companies ‘NSCs’; and
 → The Torque Transmission segment manufactures and sells torque transmission products such as gearboxes and couplings.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker ‘CODM’ for the purposes of IFRS 8: ‘Operating Segments’ is considered to be the Board of 
Directors of Renold plc. Management monitor the results of the separate reportable operating segments based on operating  
profit and loss which is measured consistently with operating profit and loss in the consolidated financial statements. The same 
segmental basis applies to decisions about resource allocation. However, Group net financing costs, retirement benefit obligations 
and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and therefore are not allocated to operating segments. Transfer prices between 
operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Bredbury factory closure costs include redundancy costs of £2.6m and £2.7m of other project costs incurred during the closure of 
the manufacturing facility and transfer of production to other Renold plants. The costs above include £1.1m expected to be incurred  
during the next financial year. The Bredbury onerous lease provision is based on a discounted cash flow (using the risk free rate  
of 3.35%) of the remaining committed payments under the unexpired lease term of 16 years less an allowance for assumed rental 
income from potential sub-leasing of the facility. A working group is currently reviewing options to mitigate this liability (including 
the options for a sub-lease).
In the prior year, the Group carried out a review of the business model for the Chain division which resulted in the identification 
and impairment of a number of assets, largely driven by excess production capacity. Asset impairments of £5.7m were recognised 
in respect of the Bredbury site which subsequently closed as described above. In addition, due to a reduction in the number of 
management units and expected users resulting from restructuring activities, a proportion of the costs in respect of the ERP 
system were also impaired (intangible assets impairment charge of £1.1m). A provision of £0.3m was also made for future 
payments for licences that are now unlikely to be used.
Also in the prior year, an impairment charge of £0.1m was made against the carrying value of the investment in the jointly 
controlled entity Renold Transmission Technology (Jiangsu) Inc. The carrying value of this investment at 1 April 2013 was £nil. 
Other reorganisation and redundancy costs incurred in the current and prior year relate primarily to redundancy costs associated 
with the global initiative to reduce overheads in all of our operations. 
In the prior year costs associated with the pension merger and asset backed funding projects have been treated as exceptional 
following the restatement required for IAS 19R (see page 90). 
Exceptional refinancing costs of £0.2m were recognised in the prior year representing costs associated with the previous 
borrowing arrangements that would have been amortised over the duration of those facilities.
(d) Employees and key management compensation

(d) Employees and key management compensation continued
In the prior year figures have been restated to exclude pension benefits included within Directors’ remuneration of £28,000 paid  
in cash and £9,000 reclassified from post-employment benefits to Directors’ remuneration. Only one Director received direct 
payment for pension contributions (2013: one). 
The remuneration listed in the table above differs from the single total figure table in the Directors’ remuneration report on  
page 69 for the following reasons: 
 → Only pensions payable directly to pension schemes are included in the Post-Employment benefits in the table on page 99.  
£45,000 (2013: £9,000) additional cash payments for pensions paid indirectly were included in Directors’ remuneration; 
 → The table above excludes LTIP’s vested in the form of share options; and
 → 2013 includes former Directors’ compensation for loss of office of £367,000.
Further details of the remuneration of Directors are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 60 to 74. 
A geographical split of the Group’s average number of employees during the year is included in Note 1. The total number of

Factors affecting the Group tax charge for the year
The UK Finance Act 2013 proposed reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 23% to 20%, reducing the rate to 21% 
from 1 April 2014 and then 20% from 1 April 2015. As at 31 March 2014, these reductions have been enacted and their effect has 
been incorporated into the closing deferred tax balances in the Company’s financial statements.
This has resulted in a £0.4m deferred tax charge to the income statement and a £1.3m deferred tax charge to other comprehensive 
income, due to the reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets recognised in the UK.
The Group’s tax charge in future years will be affected by the profit mix, effective tax rates in the different countries where the 
Group operates and utilisation of tax losses. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. 
The actual tax on the Group’s loss before tax differs from the theoretical amount using the UK corporation tax rate as follows:

Further details in relation to the warrants can be found in Note 19.
The adjusted EPS numbers have been provided in order to give a useful indication of underlying performance by the exclusion  
of exceptional items. Due to the existence of unrecognised deferred tax assets, there was no associated tax credit on some of  
the exceptional charges and in these instances exceptional costs are added back in full.

The Group performed its annual impairment test of goodwill at 31 March 2014 that compares the current book value to the 
recoverable amount from the continued use or sale of the related business. No impairment charge has been recognised in  
the period. In the prior year, the Chain division business model review identified excess production capacity in a number of 
manufacturing processes within the division which resulted in an impairment of £1.5m of goodwill in respect of the acquisition  
of Renold (Hangzhou) Company Limited (see Note 2(c)).
The recoverable amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) has been determined on a value in use basis. Value in use is calculated  
as the net present value of cash flows derived from detailed financial plans for the next financial year as approved by the Board.  
Cash flows beyond this are extrapolated using the long term country growth rates disclosed overleaf: Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Renold plc 103

Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations:
Sales volume, selling prices and cost changes
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the latest management estimates for the next financial year. The expected sales 
prices and volumes reflect management’s experience of how sales will develop at this point of the economic cycle. The expected 
profit margin reflects management’s experience of each CGU’s profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the 
impact of any restructuring that took place during the year ended 31 March 2014.
Cash flows beyond the period of projections are extrapolated using long term growth rates published by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development for the territory in which the CGU is based. The discount rates applied to the cash  
flows of each of the CGUs are based on the risk free rate for long term bonds (typically ten years) issued by the government  
in the respective market. This is then adjusted to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk  
of the specific CGU (using an average of the betas of comparable companies).
Management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of  
Jeffrey Chain and Ace Chains to materially exceed each CGU’s recoverable amount. With respect to Renold Chain India if  
long term growth rates fell by approximately 15% (2013: 25%) the goodwill in respect of that unit may become impaired.

The property has been accounted for on a cost model basis with a value of £1.4m in respect of land and £0.6m in respect of the 
building. A valuation of the property was conducted in March 2013 by BNP Paribas, French chartered surveyors and property 
consultants. At that date, the fair value of the property was assessed at £1.9m (excluding de-pollution costs) based on ongoing 
rental for industrial use. As a result of this valuation, an impairment charge of £0.5m was made in the prior period to include 
estimated depollution costs. The Directors are not aware of any long term circumstances that have arisen to materially alter  
that external valuation. The Group is currently assessing options with regard to the future use of this site following the end of  
the most recent tenancy.

independent real estate agent in France. In the event of a sale, the Company may retain an interest in the part of the facility that  
is in use in the business or seek alternate premises for that activity. The property was independently valued by BNP Paribas Real 
Estate on 29 October 2012 on the basis of a freehold sale. The value disclosed above reflects that valuation and in the opinion of

Core banking facilities
On 28 September 2012, Renold agreed a new banking facility agreement for a four year period maturing in October 2016. The  
new facilities comprise a £41m Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility (MRCF), and an additional £8m of ancillary facilities. These 
facilities have been provided by a banking group comprised of Lloyds Bank plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB. The MRCF is fully 
committed and available until maturity. 
At the year end the undrawn facility was £9.0m (2013: £13.1m). The Group pays interest at LIBOR plus a variable margin in respect 
of this facility. The average rate of interest paid in the year was LIBOR plus 2.75% for the Euro and Sterling denominated facility 
and LIBOR plus 3% for the US Dollar denominated facility (2013: all facilities LIBOR plus 4% before the re-financing and the same 
rates as this year after the refinancing). This facility has two primary financial covenants which are tested on a six monthly basis. 
The first is net debt as a ratio of rolling annual EBITDA with a maximum ratio of 2.5 times. The second is interest cover with a 
minimum ratio of 4.0 times (rolling annual EBITDA divided by net financial interest cost). The Group also benefits from a number  
of overseas facilities totaling £3.4m. Costs of £1.1m associated with the refinancing were capitalised and offset against loans and 
are being amortised over the life of the facility.
Secured borrowings
Included in Group borrowings are secured borrowings of £27.5m (2013: £28.7m). Security is provided by fixed and floating charges 
over assets (including certain property, plant and equipment) primarily in the UK, USA, France, Germany and Australia.
Finance leases
The Group has no obligations under finance leases.
Preference Stock
At 31 March 2014 there were 580,482 units of Preference Stock in issue (2013: 580,482).
All payments of dividends on the Preference Stock have been paid on the due dates. The Preference Stock has the following rights:
i.  a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum payable half yearly on 1 January and 1 July in each year;
ii.  rank both with regard to dividend (including any arrears on the commencement of a winding up) and return of capital in 
priority to all other stock or shares in the Company, but with no further right to participate in profits or assets;
iii.  no right to attend or vote, either in person or by proxy, at any general meeting of the Company or to have notice of any such 
meeting, unless the dividend on the Preference Stock is in arrears for six calendar months; and
iv.  no redemption entitlement and no fixed repayment date.
There is no significant difference between the carrying value of financial liabilities and their equivalent fair value. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 108

The net deferred tax asset recoverable after more than one year is £18.7m (2013 restated: £20.8m). The pension plan deferred tax 
asset has been restated following the adoption of IAS 19R. In the course of the process of determining the impact of implementing 
IAS 19R, the directors have also reconsidered the treatment required by IFRIC 14. This adjustment is no longer required and the 
deferred tax asset of £4.5m (in respect of an additional pension liability of £6.9m) recognised at 31 March 2013 has been reversed.

During the year the Group has reported an operating profit before exceptional items and pensions administration costs of £11.1m.  
The businesses in all jurisdictions where deferred tax assets have been recognised will, more likely than not, generate suitable profits 
based on approved management forecasts from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets amount to £27.4m (2013: £25.0m) arising from unrecognised losses of £15.9m (2013: £16.1m) 
(representing losses of £56.0m (2013: £54.6m)) and other timing differences of £11.5m (2013: £8.9m). Based on available evidence,  
it is considered unlikely that these amounts will be recovered within the foreseeable future. The significant majority of these 
losses are not subject to time limits. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 110
18. Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world covering many of its employees. The plans are a mix of defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans. In a defined benefit plan the members are guaranteed a certain level of benefits that depend 
on a number of factors such as service, salary and inflation. Defined benefit plans can be supported by an asset fund that will be  
used to pay member benefits or can be unfunded in which case obligations to members are paid by the sponsoring employer as they 
fall due. In a defined benefit plan, because the level and duration of the members’ benefits are uncertain, the risk of any increase or 
decrease in the cost of providing those benefits stays with the employer. This contrasts with a defined contribution plan where the 
employer’s only obligation is to pay the amount agreed in the employment contract into a pension plan.
Any change in the total expected cost of providing defined benefits can produce either funding shortfalls or surpluses. In the  
case of an expected funding shortfall, the Company is required to agree a schedule of additional contributions to make good  
the shortfall over an agreed period of time (sometimes referred to as a ‘funding plan’ or a Minimum Funding Requirement (‘MFR’) 
which can also include an allowance for some of the shortfall to be made good by future asset outperformance). In the case of a 
surplus, mechanisms are available in all of the Renold schemes to return that surplus to the Group.
In the course of the process of determining the impact of IAS 19R, the directors have also considered the treatment required by 
IFRIC14. Details of the restatement made is disclosed on page 90.
UK Pension Plans
The principal fund is the Renold Pension Plan (‘RPP’) in the UK that was formed by the merger in June 2013 of three predecessor 
plans: (i) the Renold Group Pension Scheme ‘RGPS’; (ii) the Jones & Shipman plc Retirement Benefits Plan (1971) ‘J&S RBP’; and (iii) 
the Renold Supplementary Pension Scheme 1967 ‘RSPS’ (which was then renamed the RPP). The RPP is a funded defined benefit 
plan with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. The RPP closed to the future accrual of member benefits between 
August 2008 and June 2009 and is also closed to new members.
The Trustees are chaired by an independent professional trustee firm and have access to a range of professional advisers.  
The Trustee Board is required to consult the Company in matters such as investment policy and to obtain agreement to any 
amendments to benefits. The Company can make proposals to the Trustees on a range of issues but cannot insist on their 
adoption. The majority of Trustees are either independent or member nominated with Company nominated Trustees being  
in the minority. To mitigate the risk of potential conflict of interests, no Directors of Renold plc are Trustees of the UK scheme.
The merger of the UK schemes was implemented to reduce the administration costs of running three separate pension schemes. 
During the merger, 1,316 members with smaller pension entitlements opted at that time to have their entire entitlement paid out in 
wind up lump sums. All other members had their benefits transferred in full into the RPP. In total, £10.9m of scheme liabilities were 
discharged for cash payments of £10.4m with the small difference being a net reduction in the scheme deficit. The merger had no 
material impact on the Group’s tax position. The RGPS and J&S RBP are now progressing through a formal liquidation process.
The merged scheme is underpinned by a 25 year asset backed partnership structure (the ‘SLP’). The partnership holds an 
intercompany loan from Renold International Holdings Limited, the holding company for most of the Group’s overseas trading 
companies. The capital rights to the assets in the SLP belong to Renold except in the event of a corporate insolvency of the 
scheme sponsor (Renold plc). The income rights in the SLP belong to the RPP. The loan generates interest income that will provide 
annual cash contributions of £2.5m to the pension fund, with annual increases linked to RPI plus 1.5% and capped at 5%. The 
income stream is used to fund deficit repair payments and the first £0.5m of annual administrative expenses (with the company 
bearing any excess). In the event that the RPP becomes fully funded on a buyout basis, the income stream will instead accrue to 
Renold. The SLP was put in place with the expectation that the period to recover the funding shortfall was agreed at 25 years. The 
SLP therefore helps reduce the volatility in short term cash funding by following an agreed payment plan over a longer period of 
time. The interest in the SLP held by the Schemes is not reported as a plan asset in the consolidated financial statements as it is  
a non-transferable interest issued by the Group.
The new arrangement replaces all other existing funding arrangements for the UK defined benefit schemes and there is no 
separate schedule of contributions as at 31 March 2014. The SLP therefore represents the entirety of the cash element of the 
funding plan for the RPP. The funding plan also assumes an allowance for asset outperformance of 1.0% (that is, assets are 
expected to return an amount of 1.0% more than the discount rate applied to the liabilities). The IAS 19R deficit will be reduced  
as the cash contributions under the scheme are made.

18. Pensions continued
Total cash costs for UK deficit repair payments and UK administrative expenses in the period were £2.7m (2013: £3.8m). The 
current year figure includes the £2.5m noted above in connection with the SLP, and £0.2m in respect of the costs of setting  
up the SLP. The Group has also agreed that if operating profits reach an absolute pre-determined level in the year ended  
31 March 2017, additional contributions will become payable while profits remain above this level. The pre-determined profit  
level is significantly higher than the operating results disclosed in the current year.
An opening valuation of the merged scheme has been carried out during the year with an effective date of 28 June 2013. The 
valuation was carried out by Barnett Waddingham, professionally qualified actuaries. No additional schedule of contributions  
was required as a result of the review with the annual cash contributions being limited to those disclosed above under the  
asset backed funding structure.
The Renold Group Money Purchase Pension Scheme ‘RGMPS’ is a defined contribution type plan. Future contributions to the 
RGMPS ceased in April 2009. All current and future UK employees have the opportunity to join the Renold Personal Pension Plan 
which is a contract based defined contribution scheme.
Overseas Pension Plans
Germany
In Germany, in addition to participating in the Government pension scheme, the Group operates an unfunded defined benefit 
scheme (no other Group company operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme). The scheme has no asset backing and the  
Group pays member benefits as they fall due. The scheme closed to new members on 1 April 1992. The Group has commenced 
proceedings aimed at closing the scheme to future accrual and an arbitration hearing is scheduled for the coming financial year.  
If successful, depending on the terms of the closure, there would be a reduction in the scheme liabilities, all else being equal.
United States of America
In the US the Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes in the Torque Transmission business. All three schemes are 
closed to new members and two of the schemes closed to future accrual at the same time. Only the hourly paid scheme remains 
open to future accrual. Following strong asset performance last year one of the closed schemes has moved into surplus and a 
project has been initiated to secure the members benefits and terminate the scheme. The US Chain business operates a defined 
contribution scheme.
In aggregate the three defined benefit schemes in the US have combined assets of £8.0m (2013: £8.0m) and liabilities of £11.4m 
(2013: £11.6m) giving a net deficit of £3.4m (2013: £3.6m). The change in the net deficit was due to a reduction in the discount rate 
more than offset by asset performance and net foreign exchange gains.
Other overseas schemes
Other overseas employees participate in a variety of different pension arrangements of the defined contribution or defined  
benefit type, funded in accordance with local practice.
In aggregate the other overseas defined benefit schemes have combined assets of £5.7m (2013: £7.5m) and liabilities of £6.1m 
(2013: £7.4m) giving a net deficit of £0.4m (2013: net surplus of £0.1m). The primary change was the liquidation of the scheme 
surplus in South Africa which reduced the scheme assets by £1.4m (which was returned to the Company in cash) partly offset  
by various reductions in liabilities.
The pension disclosures in the financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations. Where material, these  
have been updated to the balance sheet date by qualified independent actuaries. The disclosures provided are presented on a  
weighted average basis where appropriate. Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The weighted average duration for both the UK and German pension schemes are 14 years (2013: 14 years) respectively. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 112

Significant assumptions
The principal financial assumptions used to calculate plan liabilities as at 31 March 2014 are presented below. The assumptions 
adopted by the plans’ actuaries represent the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due  
to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

1 No increase applies following the closure of the UK defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual.
2  Inflation assumption used for UK schemes was changed to a blend of RPI and CPI in 2012. In addition, the Company implemented a Pension Increase Exchange 
programme in 2011/12 in which members are entitled to take a one off increase in their pension payments in return for giving up future pension inflationary  
increases in some of their benefits. On average approximately 25% of members took this option which has the effect of partially de-risking the scheme to inflation. 
3  Following the implementation of IAS 19R the expected return on net assets is no longer used in calculating the net financing charge shown in the income statement. 
However, it remains a relevant disclosure that enables an assessment of the potential level of outperformance of assets compared to the return assumed in the 
income statement that is equal to the discount rate applied to the liabilities.
The predominant defined benefit obligation for funded plans within the Group resides in the UK (£183.0m of the £223.9m Group 
obligation for funded plans). In addition to the assumptions shown previously, mortality assumptions have a significant bearing  
on the calculated obligation. The assumed life expectancy for the RPP members on retirement at age 65 is as follows.
2014 2013
Males
 Currently aged 45 21.3 20.5
 Currently aged 65 20.3 19.5
Females
 Currently aged 45 23.6 23.8
 Currently aged 65 22.5 22.6
The post-retirement mortality tables used for the UK plan are the S1PA series tables published by the UK actuarial profession with 
a 20% uplift in mortality. The scheme uses its own specific experience to then reduce or uplift the mortality rates assumed in the 
standard tables. The RPP experiences mortality significantly in excess of the national average. The mortality rates for the RPP are 
based on average year of birth for both non-pensioners and pensioners with an allowance for the medium cohort projection. 
In Germany, the mortality expectations for the scheme are in line with the local national averages as is the case in the United 
States and Australia.
Sensitivity analysis on UK schemes:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on plan liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £6.1m/increase by £6.6m
Rate of inflation Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase by £3.5m/decrease by £3.4m
Rate of mortality Increase/decrease by 1 year
1
Increase/decrease by £6.5m
1 Calculated using a reduction to assumed mortality rates of 12.5% at all ages. This is broadly equivalent to an increase in life expectancy of one year at age 65.

The market values of assets of the principal defined benefit plans of the Group, together with the present value of plan liabilities, 
are shown below. It should be noted that the market values of the plans’ assets are stated as at the Group’s year end and since  
it is not intended to realise the assets in the short term, the value may change significantly before being realised. The present 
values of the plans’ liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain. Charts on 
pages 33 to 35 set out the profiles of those expected discounted cash flows for the two principal schemes in the UK and Germany.

Equities include investments in quoted equities, funds of hedge funds and, in the prior year, property investment vehicles. The 
assets held are materially a reflection of the underlying liabilities in that lower risk assets such as gilts and bonds are deemed  
to be a match for pensioner liabilities whereas equities are deemed a better match for the liabilities associated with scheme 
members not yet in retirement.

The retirement benefit surplus relates to the Australian scheme which moved into surplus as a result of an increase in discount 
rates of 0.5% and asset performance in excess of the expected return. The surplus shown in the prior year was a net £1.4m 
balance in respect of a closed South African defined benefit pension scheme that was liquidated during the year and the surplus 
returned to the Group as a cash payment. This is included within the £2.1m benefits paid disclosed in overseas above.

In August 2013, the Company issued 2,000,250 fully paid ordinary shares of 5p each (2013: 1,499,750) pursuant to the exercise of 
warrants by Royal Bank of Scotland at a price of 21.06p. The warrants had a seven year term commencing from 13 August 2009 
during which they could be exercised at any time and were granted as part of the re-financing agreed with the Group’s banks at 
that time. There are no outstanding warrants as at 31 March 2014.
20. Share-based payments
Details of the share-based payment arrangements are provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 60 to 74.  
At 31 March 2014, unexercised options for ordinary shares amounted to 7,609,971 (2013: 5,343,642).

21. Reserves
The currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of 
foreign operations and the proportion of the gains or losses on hedging instruments used to hedge against movements in net 
investments in foreign operations that are determined to be effective.
Other reserves record the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an 
effective hedge.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to Group reserves at 31 March 2014 amounted to £3.5m (2013: £3.5m).
Included in retained earnings is an amount of £6.1m (net of tax) (2013: £6.5m) relating to the revaluation of freehold property that 
was undertaken at the date of IFRS adoption. The amount is not distributable until it is realised.

22. Operating lease obligations continued
Certain of the leased properties have been sublet and the future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under 
non-cancellable sublease agreements is £3.0m (2013: £3.3m).
An onerous lease provision of £5.7m (see Note 16) has been established following the closure of the Bredbury manufacturing 
facility (see Note 2(c) for more details). The lease expires in May 2030 at a rental cost of £0.8m per annum. These lease obligations 
have been included in the analysis.
23. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Performance guarantees given to third parties in respect of Group companies were £nil (2013: £nil).
Various UK group companies have given guarantees to the merged UK pension scheme to cover the full cost of buying out  
the liabilities in the event that the Sponsoring Employers defaulted on the agreed deficit repair plan. As one of the sponsoring 
employers of the UK scheme is Renold plc, the continuing obligation is effectively unchanged and is to fully fund the member’s 
accrued benefits.

Foreign currency risk and sensitivity
As a result of the significant operations in the US and Europe, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by 
movements in the US Dollar/Sterling and Euro/Sterling exchange rates.
The following table demonstrates the impact of reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar (US$) and Euro exchange rates  
(with all other variables held constant) on the Group’s result before tax (due to the effect of foreign exchange on monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in a different currency to the functional currency of operation) and the Group’s equity (due to the effect 
on other comprehensive income of changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts and the effect of hedging borrowings). 
The impact of translating the net assets of foreign operations into Sterling is excluded from the sensitivity analysis.

The Group has US Dollar denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment in its subsidiaries  
in the US. The carrying value of the US Dollar borrowings at 31 March 2014 was £5.2m (1 April 2013: £6.4m). £0.6m of exchange 
gain (2013: £0.4m loss) on translation of the borrowings into Sterling is included as part of the hedging reserve movement in

Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on relevant national base rate equivalents, which can fluctuate on  
a daily basis. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and 
are therefore not subject to interest risk.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s Sterling, US Dollar and Euro debt obligations.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on 
credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with 
the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in 
Note 12. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and certain 
derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.

The Group has contracted forward contracts consisting of Euro forward contracts of nil (2013: £1.1m) and US Dollar forward 
contracts of £3.2m (2013: £4.3m) both of which are predominantly made up of sell contracts as the Group tends to have a surplus  
in both currencies. 
A lease became onerous in 2014, see note 22 for details of rentals payable under this lease.

(h) Fair values 
Set out below is a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments excluding 
derivatives, short term trade payables and short term trade receivables which are already carried at fair value (or where the 
carrying amount approximates fair value):

Interest bearing loans and borrowings
 Floating rate borrowing 30.9 31.5 30.9 31.5
 Preference Stock 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5
The fair value of borrowings have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
With reference to the fair value hierarchy below the above financial instruments are level 2 except Preference Stock which is level 1.
Fair value hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
 → Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 → Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly; and
 → Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
financial market data.
As at 31 March 2014, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value:

(i) Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a satisfactory credit rating and capital 
ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain  
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to the shareholders  
or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2014 and  
31 March 2013.
The Group monitors capital using two gearing ratios, one of which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt and the other  
is the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA.

We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
Renold plc for the year ended 31 March 2014 which comprise 
the Company balance sheet, the Company statement of total 
recognised gains and losses, the accounting policies and the 
related notes (i) to (xiv). The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities for the Company financial statements set out  
on page 125, the Directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the parent company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility  
is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
 → whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed;
 → the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates  
made by the Directors; and
 → the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Company financial statements:
 → give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2014;
 → have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 → have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 → the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be  
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with  
the Companies Act 2006; and
 → the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the  
financial statements are prepared is consistent with  
the Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
 → adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 → the Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 → certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made; or
 → we have not received all the information and explanations  
we require for our audit.
Other matters
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements 
of Renold plc for the year ended 31 March 2014.

Financial Statements
Accounting policies
A summary of the principal Company accounting policies is  
set out below. These have been applied on a consistent basis 
unless otherwise indicated.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Basis of accounting 
The accounts have been prepared in compliance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for the Company 
financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report, the Directors’ report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the  
Directors have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the  
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Company for that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 → select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
 → make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 → state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 → prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the  
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Foreign currencies 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation  
at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the  
income statement.
 
Financial instruments and risk management 
The accounting policies of the Company in respect of financial 
instruments are consistent with those of the Group, and are 
detailed in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance 
with paragraph 2(d) of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 29, 
the Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of 
FRS 29. The Company’s financial instruments are consolidated 
with those of the Group and are incorporated into the 
disclosures in Note 25.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge  
the Group’s exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from 
operating and financing activities. In accordance with its 
treasury policy, the Company does not hold or use derivative 
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets represented by properties and equipment 
are stated at cost, being purchase cost plus any incidental costs 
of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation. The book values of 
certain assets which were the subject of past revaluations have 
been retained as permitted by the transitional arrangements of 
FRS 15: Tangible Fixed Assets. Depreciation is calculated by 
reference to original cost at fixed percentages assuming 
effective useful lives as follows:
 → Leasehold properties: the period of the lease
 → Equipment and fixtures: 10 to 15 years
 → Motor vehicles: 25% per annum for three years, leaving 25% 
residual value
 → Computer software: three to seven years. 
Where appropriate, adjustments are made to the remaining 
effective useful lives of assets to reflect changes in circumstances 
to those envisaged when the asset was brought into use.
Leases 
Annual rentals in respect of operating leases are charged 
against the profit of the year on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Investments 
Investments in subsidiary companies are accounted for at  
cost and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Where 
indicators of impairment are present, the cashflows of the 
underlying entities are reviewed to determine whether the 
investment value is recoverable.
The results and financial position of Renold Scottish Limited 
Partnership (SLP) have been consolidated in the consolidated 
financial statements of Renold plc. Renold plc is a parent 
undertaking of the general partner in the SLP (see Note (xiv)  
to the Company financial statements). Accordingly, advantage 
has been taken of the exemption conferred by paragraph 7  
of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 from the 
requirements for preparation, delivery and publication of  
the partnerships accounts. Renold plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 126
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences that have 
originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, 
or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date, with the following exceptions:
 → Provision is not made for tax that would arise on the 
remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries 
unless the dividends have been accrued as receivable at  
the balance sheet date
 → Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, 
based on all available evidence, it is considered more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from  
which the future reversal of the underlying timing  
differences can be deducted
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the  
tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which  
the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on  
tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted by the  
balance sheet date.
Pension costs 
Employees of the Company participate in the pension plans 
operated by the Group in the UK. These include pension plans of 
the defined benefit and defined contribution types. However, the 
contributions paid by the Company are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans in all cases. This is because the Company is 
unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities 
in the respective plans, as required by FRS 17: Retirement 
Benefits. Therefore, contributions paid to the respective pension 
plans are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred. 
Disclosures associated with the Group defined benefit plans 
 are provided in the Group financial statements.
Share-based compensation 
The Company operates equity settled share-based compensation 
plans as detailed in the Group financial statements.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange  
for the grant of the options is calculated using a Black-Scholes 
pricing model and is recognised as an expense over the vesting 
period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options 
granted. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its 
estimates of the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding 
adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. No 
expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or 
non-vesting conditions which are treated as vesting irrespective 
of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied 
provided that all other performance or service conditions are 
satisfied. The market-based conditions are linked to the market 
price of shares in the Company.
 
Equity-settled share based payments granted to employees  
of the Group providing services to subsidiary undertakings  
are treated as an investment in the company’s balance sheet.
As permitted under the transitional provisions of FRS 20,  
the Company has applied the standard only to equity settled 
awards granted after 7 November 2002 and which vested  
on or after 1 January 2005.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially 
recognised at net proceeds. After initial recognition, debt  
is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  
effective interest method.
Dividends 
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders  
are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders, while interim dividend distributions are 
recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared  
and paid. Dividends receivable from subsidiary undertakings 
are similarly recognised on this basis.
Cash flow statement 
As permitted by FRS 1: Cash Flow Statements (revised 1996), 
the financial statements do not contain a cash flow statement 
as the financial statements of the Group, which are publicly 
available, contain a cash flow statement.
Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to 
disclose related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries 
of the Group under FRS 8: Related Party Disclosures.
Accounting policy on derivatives 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed in the Group 
financial statements.

(representing losses of £16.4m (2013: £7.6m)) and other timing differences of £0.8m (2013: £0.1m). Based on available evidence

Banking facilities
The Group’s core banking facilities comprise a £41m Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility (MRCF), and an additional £8m  
of ancillary facilities which mature in October 2016. These facilities have been provided by a banking group comprised of  
Lloyds Bank plc and Svenska Handelsbanken AB. The MRCF is fully committed and available until maturity. See Note 14  
to the consolidated financial statements for more details.

The Group has contracted forward contracts to sell foreign currency consisting of Euro forward contracts of £nil (2013: £1.1m)  
and US Dollar forward contracts £3.2m (2013: £4.3m).
(viii) Pensions
Employees of the Company include members of the principal UK defined benefit schemes. However, the contributions paid by  
the Company are accounted for under a defined contribution scheme, because the Company is unable to identify with any degree 
of reasonable certainty its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the respective schemes. This is due to the fact that the 
Company cannot attribute the members of the schemes to the individual sponsoring employer company. As a consequence, the 
deficit in the UK defined benefit schemes is only recognised as a liability in the Group balance sheet. The basis used to determine 
the deficit in the schemes is disclosed in Note 18 in the Group financial statements. 
No contributions are outstanding at the year end. As the pension schemes are in a deficit position a plan has been put in place  
for the participating employers to make additional payments into the schemes. The Company will continue to make payments

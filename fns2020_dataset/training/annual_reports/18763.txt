CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 
DEAR 
SHAREHOLDER 
 
The results for 2015 reflect the benefits of our strategy 
over the past two years, during which Informa moved 
from a period of Measured Change and launched the 
2014–2017 Growth Acceleration Plan. 
6 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com //Already, 
Informa is a 
leaner, more 
focused and 
growth-oriented 
company. We 
have expanded 
our presence in 
key markets, 
notably the US./ /
effective integration of Virgo and Hanley 
Wood Exhibitions. Acquisitions are likely 
to remain an important component of 
growth for Informa in the future. All 
capital commitments will continue to 
be made in a disciplined manner and 
will remain subject to rigorous strategic 
and financial hurdles.
On behalf of all Shareholders, your 
Board continues to monitor Informa’s 
performance in important areas such  
as compliance, risk management and 
remuneration. In 2015 we took steps 
to improve further the governance and 
controls in place across the Group, 
including further investment in our Risk 
and Compliance Team and systems. 
The quality of Informa’s Shareholder 
returns reflects, ultimately, the quality of 
its people at every level. This includes 
the Board. As part of this commitment 
to quality, we appointed two first-rate Non-
Executive Directors during the year. These 
were to broaden the Board’s international 
experience, particularly of US markets, 
and to prepare for John Davis stepping 
down from the Board in May 2016 after 
10 years of service. 
Stephen Davidson joined in September 
and brings extensive corporate and 
financial market experience in both 
Executive and Non-Executive roles, 
making him well suited to his position 
as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. In the same month, we also 
appointed David Flaschen to the Board. 
David is an American citizen with a wealth 
of Senior Management experience in 
the US Media, Information Services and 
Technology sectors. The Group’s growing 
presence in these markets and stated 
ambition to build its position in North 
America make him an invaluable source 
of advice and insight to the Board and 
its Management Team. 
nforma has delivered another 
year of improved operating 
performance and further strategic 
progress. On behalf of the Board 
and our Shareholders, I would 
like to thank our Management Team and 
all our colleagues for the hard work in 
delivering the financial results set out 
in this Annual Report. 
The statutory results for the 12 months 
to 31 December 2015 reflect the benefits 
of our strategy over the past two years, 
during which Informa moved from a period 
of Measured Change and launched the 
2014–2017 Growth Acceleration Plan. 
Your Board is confident that Informa 
will meet its ambitious goals, generating 
sustainable growth across all four 
Operating Divisions, which should in turn 
drive Shareholder returns. The Board 
will continue to oversee management’s 
performance closely, ensuring that the 
Group executes its strategy with financial 
discipline and with integrity. 
Already, Informa is a leaner, more 
focused and growth-oriented company. 
We have expanded our presence in 
key markets, notably the US. We also 
strengthened our divisional management 
and enhanced our returns to Shareholders 
through improvements in revenue, 
earnings and dividend growth. 
There is still a long way to go to  
reach the ambitious targets we have set 
ourselves. But the Group is on track and 
the Board remains supportive and united 
behind the current strategy. 
Your Board of Directors has endorsed 
management’s plans to internationalise 
the Group further, as we look to extend all 
our businesses into new markets that offer 
growth opportunities. It is encouraging to 
see that the US expansion programme 
in the Global Exhibitions Division is 
delivering ahead of plan, following the 
I would like to take the opportunity 
to thank John Davis for his long and 
distinguished contribution to Informa. 
He fulfilled important roles on the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees and put 
his extensive sector expertise to good 
use in the service of Shareholders. 
I am also grateful that he agreed to 
stay on the Board for an extra period 
whilst we prepared for the new  
Non-Executive joiners. 
Full details of your Board’s 
composition and governance procedures 
can be found from page 65 onwards in 
this report.
Our confidence in the progress and 
performance of the Group led the Board 
to increase the total Dividend Per Share 
for 2015 by 4.1% to 20.1p. We have also 
increased our minimum commitment for 
the remainder of the Growth Acceleration 
Plan. Through 2016 and 2017 we will 
increase our annual dividend by a 
minimum of 4%, double the previous 
2% commitment.
The Board is confident that continued 
progress in the Growth Acceleration Plan 
will include further steps to enhance our 
returns for Shareholders. This will make 
the Group an outstanding enterprise in 
which to work, with which to do business 
and in which to invest. 
My thanks again go to the 
Management Team and all Informa 
colleagues, as well as to customers and 
business partners for their support in 2015. 
I look forward to 2016 as a year of further 
investment in the Group’s growth and 
continued value-creation for Shareholders.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
FROM  
PROGRESS 
TO 
DELIVERY
Informa is now well placed for both product and 
market growth opportunities in the Knowledge 
and Information Economy. 
8 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com //We have 
managed to 
invest at scale 
in our own 
business whilst 
meeting our 
commercial 
performance 
targets.//
Like many businesses, we overcame 
challenges in specific markets. Our trading 
environment was impacted by energy 
price volatility, adverse currency 
movements, and geo-political upheaval 
in several parts of the world. Throughout, 
we stuck to our plans and I am pleased to 
report that we are on track with action to:
• Repair and recover our position in 
Business Intelligence;
• Accelerate our growth and size and 
scale in Global Exhibitions;
• Maintain our position as a leading 
publisher in Academic Publishing, 
with deep content and strong customer 
relationships; and
• Rethink and re-energise our approach 
to conferences and learning in 
Knowledge & Networking by focusing 
on communities and content.
This Annual Report reflects the 
progress we achieved in all these areas 
during 2015. 
It was a year in which we improved the 
management of our business operations, 
including how we deliver customer 
support, subscription renewals, cash 
collection and cash management, and 
imposed greater discipline around 
integrating acquisitions into the Group.
This effort, combined with Informa’s 
unique blend of passion, professionalism 
and personality, helped deliver a strong 
annual performance.
We have managed to invest at scale 
in our own business, by acquisition and 
through organic investment, whilst meeting 
wo years ago Informa 
launched its Growth 
Acceleration Plan, a 
programme to return every 
part of the business to 
growth, enhance operational efficiency 
and seize new market opportunities.
After a period of intense work, 
including major reorganisation, selected 
US acquisitions and withdrawal from 
non-core activities, it is clear that 2016 
will be the Delivery Year. 
We have strengthened all four 
Divisions with committed, coherent 
and creative Leadership Teams. Their 
businesses will benefit from £90m 
of investment, which has now been 
committed as part of the Growth 
Acceleration Plan or GAP, and detailed 
plans and projects are underway across 
the Group to consolidate improvements 
in our performance.
During 2016 we will invest tactically 
in functional simplification, systems, 
products, people and our publishing, 
marketing and sales platforms, which  
will be enhanced by improved activation 
and provisioning.
We are doing all this because it 
strengthens Informa’s competitiveness; 
it meets customer demand; and it builds 
capabilities that will unlock further growth.
PROGRESS AND PERFORMANCE 
IN 2015
Informa’s performance in 2015 was a 
credit to the Group, and to every colleague 
within the Group.
our commercial performance targets 
and rewarding our Shareholders. Those 
Shareholder returns include dividend 
growth and the share price appreciation 
we have seen over the past three years, 
with gains for over 16% of Colleagues who 
participate in Informa’s employee share 
ownership scheme ShareMatch.
Over the past year, we have also 
seen initial benefits emerge from GAP, 
particularly in the Business Intelligence 
and Global Exhibitions Divisions. 
Our Academic Publishing Division 
has performed with resilience in a 
steadily changing marketplace, and the 
Knowledge & Networking Division 
has been enhanced by a streamlined 
operating structure under a new 
Leadership Team.
IMPROVED FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
In the period covered by this report – the 
second year of GAP – Informa delivered 
financial results that reflect the work 
undertaken to simplify our operating 
structure, strengthen our systems, 
enhance our products and extend 
our customer focus.
Our improved capabilities in these 
areas, combined with an extended market 
reach particularly in the US, enabled 
Informa to generate revenues of £1.2bn 
for 2015, representing an increase of 
more than 6.5% on the previous year, and 
adjusted profits of £365.6m, an increase 
of almost 10% on the previous year.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
9 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com Importantly, in the fourth quarter all four 
Divisions returned to growth, which is  
an important measure of future potential.
For the year as a whole, our Global 
Exhibitions Division represented 22% 
of our revenues. The Division’s organic 
revenue grew by 10.5% as successful 
events and acquisitions contributed 
strongly to overall performance.
Academic Publishing grew in line 
with the market in 2015. Some softness 
in the US Medical Books market and the 
wider lower level academic market had a 
marginally negative impact on the Division, 
but our balanced mix of books and 
journals, subscription and open access 
options, print and online formats, and  
our geographic reach and focus on upper 
level academia mitigated these negatives.
Business Intelligence moved 
towards organic revenue growth, reporting 
negative growth of -1.9% for the full year 
but moving into positive growth in the 
fourth quarter. This represents significant 
progress on its 2014 performance, 
reflecting improved customer retention. 
The Division has brought forward its 
growth ambition and is targeting positive 
organic growth for the full year of 2016.
We implemented a number of 
restructuring measures in 2015 in 
Knowledge & Networking. The Division 
moved towards a positive growth rate as 
the year progressed and has put in place a 
new operating structure for 2016 as part of  
its plan to generate sustained positive growth.
Overall we have delivered improved 
free cash flow and a better working capital 
performance as a result of our simplified 
operating model, tight financial control, 
improved subscription renewals and scale 
in the US market.
Our debt levels remain within our target 
range at just over two times earnings. The 
success of these metrics follows measures 
put in place to improve our financial fitness 
since 2013. This has given us the flexibility 
and the confidence to pursue our growth 
and acceleration strategy.
As the Chairman of the Board noted in his 
introduction, our performance in 2015 has 
enabled the Group to exceed the 2% 
minimum growth in dividend commitment 
we made at the outset of GAP, increasing 
the total Dividend Per Share by 4.1% to 
20.1p and committing to increase the 
dividend by at least 4% for the remaining 
period of the Plan.
CONTINUED PROGRESS WITH 
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
Our improved financial performance is a 
clear beneficial outcome of the simplified 
structure at the core of our business, 
and the increased focus on customers 
and markets.
As shown by our business model  
and strategy section on page 18, the 
2014–2017 Growth Acceleration Plan  
is designed to drive growth in all parts  
of our business, whilst simultaneously 
building scale and capabilities for 
further expansion.
We made good progress on all six 
elements within GAP, notably in our 
new management approach, improved 
portfolio management discipline and 
our investment programme in platforms, 
people and products.
GAP management model
The Management and Leadership Teams 
within our Divisions now combine years 
of experience within the Group with 
newly-appointed executive talent in a 
range of positions. Amongst our top 150 
managers, approximately 40 have joined 
the Group within the past three years.
In September, we welcomed Charlie 
McCurdy as the CEO of Global 
Exhibitions as a successor to Will Morris, 
who retired towards the end of the year. I 
would like to take the opportunity to thank 
Will for his long service to Informa and his 
leadership in creating the strong and 
international Exhibitions business we 
have today. 
Dedicated Chief Technology Officers 
were appointed to each of the Operating 
Divisions during the year, putting 
technology expertise at the heart of 
our product development and 
customer engagement.
The Group now operates four 
coherent Operating Divisions, with shared 
back-office and technology support and 
where each has a clear focus on growing 
revenues, customer satisfaction and 
renewal rates.
GAP portfolio management
The increasingly disciplined approach 
Informa takes to portfolio management led 
to the sale of certain non-core businesses 
in 2015. 
We disposed of the Consumer 
Information businesses in Business 
Intelligence in July 2015. During the 
second half of 2015, we withdrew from 
the Danish, Swedish and Dutch European 
conferences businesses in Knowledge & 
Networking as a result of a decision 
to focus on larger, Branded, English-
language events. Also in this Division, 
we entered into a new partnership 
arrangement for our Russian Conferences 
Brand, Adam Smith, the structure of 
which will allow the business to be run 
in a more effective manner by working 
with a local player.
These disposals have been important 
in refocusing our portfolio and allowing 
management to concentrate on the 
vertical markets and Brands where 
we believe we have differentiation.
GAP investment
The GAP investment programme is one 
of the key elements of the overall strategy. 
We will invest £90m in total by the end 
of 2017 . This plan has been almost fully 
funded by the significant improvements 
in our working capital and free cash flow 
over the last two years.
STRATEGIC REPORT
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED)
10 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com As of the end of 2015, more than 
20 projects spanning the four Operating 
Divisions and Global Support were 
underway. Common to many of these 
projects is a focus on investing in the 
digital delivery of our products: 
strengthening our data capabilities, our 
customer engagement and marketing 
platforms, and the technology that 
serves our customers and products.
The Group Finance Director runs  
a process of vetting, progress tracking 
and commercial benefit analysis around 
each of the investments. This ensures 
that each project receives funding based 
solely on the delivery of specific tracked 
targets. We continue to anticipate that 
this investment programme will deliver 
returns in line with our targets.
INFORMA AND THE KNOWLEDGE 
AND INFORMATION ECONOMY 
We are now well placed for product 
and market growth opportunities in the 
Knowledge and Information Economy, 
which analysts believe represents an 
addressable market worth more than 
$750bn, and which is forecast to grow at 
an annualised rate of over 4% between 
2015 and 2018.
Informa offers a mix of relevant and 
exclusive data, research, actionable 
insight and intelligence that is vital to 
commercial customers.
We serve modern businesses that 
make investment and purchasing 
decisions based on rigorous quantitative 
information and original insight and 
analysis. Informa also meets demand from 
professional audiences to develop their 
networks and make sales and business 
development at business-to-business 
trade shows, events or conferences, or 
to learn based on content and insight 
delivered online or in person.
Academics value the qualified 
knowledge represented by our trusted, 
high quality journals, learning platforms 
and ebooks or physical books. All of our 
published academic content attracts 
high levels of users and allows them to 
disseminate and share their work and 
gain professional recognition amongst 
a wide but relevant audience.
Across our Divisions we produce, 
manage and distribute knowledge and 
information on specialist topics to 
specialist communities, as well as creating 
platforms to connect those communities. 
Face-to-face events remain a chosen and 
powerful option for connecting many 
people, and the rise of digital technology 
and lower cost software and cloud-based 
solutions also creates the opportunity for 
year-round engagement online, an area in 
which Informa is increasingly innovating.
Informa’s position within 
attractive vertical markets 
Informa has strengthened its position 
in vertical markets over the last year. We 
are increasingly adopting a sector-led 
approach to portfolio development, 
ensuring that our business is focused 
on markets and verticals where we have 
the greatest opportunity to grow.
Our Business Intelligence, 
Global Exhibitions and Knowledge 
& Networking Divisions focus in the 
main on seven key verticals: Telecoms, 
Media & Technology; Financial Services; 
Construction & Real Estate; Luxury & 
Leisure; Agriculture; Food Ingredients;  
and Personal Care & Beauty.
These are some, but not all, of the 
vertical markets where we are building

Across the Group, Informa’s 
geographic footprint in the US increased 
in 2015, as it did in 2014, and we continue 
to see potential for further expansion. 
The increasing internationalisation of our 
Group gives us balance and resilience, 
allowing us to navigate through more 
challenging periods in individual 
geographies.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (CONTINUED)
INFORMA AND 2016
I am encouraged by the steady 
operational momentum with which we 
have started 2016. Subscription renewals 
are improving, new products are being 
launched and the volume of open access 
articles is growing. We also anticipate 
further expansion at the first major Informa 
events of the year, including Biotech 
Showcase, Arab Health and World of 
Concrete. Our Academic Publishing 
Division is making the changes necessary 
to create a single global books and a 
single global journals business, and the 
new and energetic Leadership Team 
in Knowledge & Networking has 
installed its new and more focused 
operating approach. 
As we note this continued momentum, 
Informa cannot be immune to wider 
changes in global macro-economic 
conditions. These include signs of a 
slowdown in Chinese economic growth, 
oil price weakness and its impact on 
attendant oil economies, rapprochement 
with Iran, upheaval elsewhere in the 
Middle East, political questions about the 
future of Europe including the outcome 
of the UK’s in–out referendum and the 
gathering interest in November’s US 
Presidential election.
We need to make decisions with one 
eye on all of these market moving events. 
I am confident we can navigate the 
fast changing environment in which 
we operate, thanks partly to our deep 
specialisms. Alongside our focus on  
our customers and products, Informa is 
emerging as a challenger Brand in many 
of our markets.
In all our Divisions we exist to provide 
knowledge, learning, insight, intelligence, 
connection or intellectual and commercial 
advantage. This approach is based on  
the content we have, and the manner in 
which we allow our customers to access 
it, learn from it, use it and pursue their  
own ambitions.
It makes us facilitators in the 
Knowledge and Information Economy. 
And that economy is set to grow in the 
mid to long term. As more and more 
countries shift to higher levels of 
education, professionalism, service 
and consumer-led economies, Informa 
is well placed.
We seek to enable our customers, 
delegates, attendees, subscribers, 
authors, institutions of learning, sponsors, 
advertisers and our markets overall to work 
better and be smarter.
We will continue to invest in our 
products, people and platforms, and 
do it with effective execution and 
entrepreneurialism. 
Most of all, we will intend to be proud 
and mindful of doing this whilst being 
respectful of the cultures and communities 
that we work with and in. As a company, 
we are determined to enable our 
individuals and teams to have the freedom 
to experiment, to develop, to expand, 
to have fun and do good along the way.
We are grateful for the Shareholder 
support we received during 2015. 
Informa remains focused on delivering 
further growth and improvements in 
the year ahead.

12 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com MARKET 
TRENDS: 
DOING 
BUSINESS AT 
THE TIPPING 
POINT
Informa operates within the Knowledge and Information Economy, 
a burgeoning sector that is global in nature and fast moving. 
To provide an independent understanding of this market and a 
perspective on external trends that could affect the Company’s 
continued progress and performance, Outsell, Inc. a leading 
research and advisory firm focused on media, information and 
technology, highlights the tipping points it believes 
will impact the sector in 2016.
13 DOING 
BUSINESS AT 
THE TIPPING 
POINT
Outsell, Inc. Co-founder 
& CEO Anthea Stratigos
The information industry is an array 
of segments with revenues totalling 
almost $800bn, including news, 
market research, business media, data 
services, events, scholarly publishing, 
financial and risk information, training 
and education. Add in gaming, music 
and entertainment and it serves a 
broad set of needs around the world. 
And all of its contours are undergoing 
profound structural change, a result 
of technology’s ongoing and 
persistent march. Underlying growth 
in the industry ebbs and flows with 
the economy – in recent years in low 
single digits – mirroring GDP and the 
budgets of the customers it serves. 
There is rapid expansion in tech-
fuelled areas such as analytics, and a 
legion of new entrants and would-be 
disrupters. A constant cycle of growth 
through mergers and acquisitions 
adds fuel, with the newcomers 
providing the engine for innovation 
and boosting growth for large 
acquirers. In many sectors a handful 
of companies dominate, the middle 
is hollow, and a long tail wags. 
Against this backdrop several 
important market trends are unfolding: 
CONVERGENCE
In the new networked digital economy, 
everyone is a publisher and part 
of a global conversation. Today’s 
information solutions providers 
operate in a complex environment 
where categories are blurred and 
traditional boundaries fluid. The 
convergence between content, 
commerce, community and the 
tools that support them requires 
businesses not to remain trapped 
in just one category. Publishers are 
/ /Publishers are 
now software 
companies 
too, building 
platforms and 
applications 
to make 
information 
intelligent and 
actionable.// 
now software companies too, building 
platforms and applications to make 
information intelligent and actionable. 
The most powerful of these platforms 
are built to open standards with 
connectors and application program 
interfaces or APIs. They become 
ecosystems hosting content and 
services not just from the company 
itself, but from clients and third parties 
– even from their competitors. At the 
same time, technology firms are in 
the business of content: not just 
hosting it, but actively seeking out 
data partnerships and acquisitions to 
make their workflow environment the 
destination of choice. 
14 FOCUSED 
SCALE
As the industry has converged in this 
networked world, size really matters. 
The power of any network increases 
exponentially with the number of 
members. So the biggest online 
communities, search engines, and 
e-commerce markets scoop up most 
of the available profits. And only 
a small number of information 
platforms can achieve the scale 
to support and sustain the investments 
required to compete effectively.
Recent years have seen aggressive 
portfolio management across the 
information industry by the largest 
companies, buying and selling assets 
to drive what we call focused scale: 
being among the clear leaders in a 
specific sector rather than a small 
or medium-sized player in multiple 
markets. Diversification without 
scale is not a winning proposition. 
Achieving that kind of focus requires 
ruthless scrutiny of assets. Even high 
performing operations may have to 
go in order to liberate capital and 
resources for activities that can 
contribute to securing market 
leadership positions. 
NEW  
FORMS OF 
COMPETITION
The other consequence of 
convergence is multi-dimensional 
competition. The long tail is wagging 
furiously, invigorated by the optimism 
and healthy innocence of start-ups 
unburdened by legacy models 
of what an information business looks 
like. Technology rather than content is 
often their starting point, solving new 
customer problems or attacking old 
problems in new ways. 
Start-ups have cheap access to 
unimagined computing and storage 
power in the cloud, a benign funding 
environment, a data universe of open 
APIs, and the “gig” economy of talent 
for hire. This is the research and 
development engine of the industry, 
coming up with new forms, new 
content and new ways of doing 
businesses, informed by the primacy 
of mobile consumption and social 
sharing and collaboration. They come 
to market quickly with lower costs 
and no traditional transformational 
journeys, using agile development to 
test, learn and pivot. They take market 
share with products not even in beta, 
discovered by curious users rather 
than sold to an enterprise buyer.
Information businesses are also 
increasingly competing with some of 
their own clients. Publishers of legal 
information buy legal process 
outsourcing companies and services 
offering practical self-help tools to 
lawyers. Meanwhile law firms start 
positioning unprofitable low level legal 
work as information services, 
delivering commoditised legal content 
to their own corporate clients via 
online platforms. We have become 
accustomed to “co-opetition”, where 
competitors become “frenemies” and 
partner in some areas. Now we are 
entering a phase where customers 
become rivals: call it “custompetition”?
15 GOLD  
IN THE 
DATA
In this new information era, words still 
have their place. But rich seams of gold 
are now in the data. The world is 
creating 2.5 exabytes of data each day*: 
from photos and video uploaded to 
social media posts, purchase transaction 
records, mobile phone data, countless 
sensors on machinery of all kinds, and 
myriad other sources. We need 2.5 
million new high spec home computers 
to store the data from the internet of 
humans and things. Every day.
Increasingly powerful analytics 
software is the essential equipment for 
goldminers in the age of big data. It is 
no longer sufficient simply to use such 
tools to describe what the data might 
be saying. Even predictive analytics, 
making probability-driven forecasts 
about what may happen in the future 
is giving way to prescriptive analytics 
– recommendations about what 
possible actions to take based on the 
data and the context. This is the new 
frontier and where successful 
companies will live. 
Enterprises of all kinds now emit and 
collect data as part of their digital 
existence and see information and 
data services as part of their long-
term competitive differentiation. 
A whole new class of acquirer, 
prepared to pay great multiples, is 
emerging for young, tech-infused 
companies. An agrochemical 
company buys a business selling 
precise and detailed data to farmers 
about climate and other conditions 
affecting crop yields; a software giant 
buys the world’s leading weather 
forecasting company. 
In the big data world, no single 
company can possibly house or 
control everything its analytics 
engines might need and the field in 
all sectors is ripe with activity as 
machines interact in the new era. 
But it is essential for companies in the 
industry to have a data and analytics 
strategy and the platforms to deliver it 
in order to secure market leadership.

CHANGING 
EXPECTATIONS
Above all, the demands of clients and 
users are evolving rapidly. A generation 
weaned on the abundance and the 
freedom of modern consumer digital 
riches is bringing those expectations 
to the workplace. They want the 
business environment to be just as open.  
To succeed, information businesses 
need to serve users on any device, 
at any time. They have to facilitate 
sharing and collaboration. They must 
welcome users contributing new 
content to their platforms and allow 
them to apply their tools of choice to 
bring insights to the data. They have 
to look outward, harnessing new ideas 
and innovation from all sides. They 
need to adapt to the new ways human 
beings interact with machines, how 
machines communicate with each 
other, and how computers start to 
learn and reason like humans.
Those who master convergence, 
embrace data, achieve focused scale, 
deal with new competition, and keep 
up with ever faster cycles of innovation 
and changing expectations, will be the 
ones to succeed in an information 
industry at the tipping point.

FACE  
TO  
FACE
Our research consistently shows 
that the more our world goes digital, 
the more important face-to-face 
interaction becomes. Trade shows, 
conferences, training: events small 
and large that bring professionals 
together still matter and are highly 
valued. Companies pay for their 
people to attend, they sponsor 
events, and more than ever they 
are spending on staging their own 
events as a key way to reach 
customers and prospects and 
provide strong Brand experiences. 
In the world of professional training, 
in-person courses remain 
stubbornly popular. 
Digital communities and online 
learning now offer the possibility 
of bridging the physical and the 
virtual into a 365-day experience. 
The acceleration of virtual reality 
technology points to further 
transformation, extending and 
complementing face-to-face 
engagement but without replacing it.

Informa’s approach to risk management 
is one of continuous progress and 
improvement. The Group aims to uphold 
a risk culture through which consistent, 
enterprise-wide risk management is 
embedded in the organisation, in a way 
that supports the Company’s growth 
strategies and can dynamically adapt to 
changing environments.
Informa manages risk by deploying 
structures, policies, processes and 
systems that identify, evaluate and 
manage the Group’s risk exposure.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
ENHANCEMENTS DURING 2015
During 2015 Informa strengthened its 
existing risk management processes, 
structure and supporting activities.
• A new Risk Management Framework 
was developed to reflect the Group 
Operating Model established in 2014. 
This framework has embedded 
standardised tools and processes by 
which risks are identified, assessed, 
reported and managed. Responsibilities 
for risk management have been 
formalised within the Operating 
Divisions and Global Support. 
• A Director of Risk and Compliance was 
appointed to lead the function and to 
oversee the operation of the Risk 
Management Framework:
• The Group implemented a new risk 
taxonomy. This provides a standard way 
for each Operating Division plus Global 
Support functions to identify, describe, 
classify and understand the risks that 
could impact their operations and the 
Group. It has created a way to describe 
risks across Informa in a consistent 
manner, so they can be easily compared 
and consolidated.

• The Group deployed a new and unified  
risk management tool and scoring

GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT
In accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, Informa’s Board is 
responsible for determining the nature  
and extent of the principal risks it is willing 
to take to achieve the Group’s strategic 
objectives. It has reviewed and assessed 
those risks, outlined overleaf, which are 
defined as those that would threaten 
Informa’s business model. 
Informa’s Board provides direction 
on risk management through the Group  
Audit Committee, with the Group Risk 
Committee responsible for how risk 
management functions throughout  
the Company. 
The Group Risk Committee oversees 
the Group Risk Management Framework. 
It is chaired by the Group Finance Director 
and comprises Divisional Chief Financial 
Officers and representatives of key Global 
Support functions. The Committee 
articulates, implements and enforces 
Group policy to manage and mitigate 
relevant risks, and has a remit to report 
significant risks to the Audit Committee 
and the Board. During 2015, the Group 
Financial Planning and Accounting 
Director and the Group Director of Talent & 
Transformation also joined the Committee.
The Internal Audit Team provides 
independent assurance through planned 
audit activities that assess whether controls 
are adequately designed and implemented. 
This Team also makes recommendations 
for improving controls. 
Some assurance activities take  
place independently of Internal Audit,  
such as regular testing for technology 
vulnerabilities. They are reported  
through defined governance channels,  
the results considered and any changes  
to the control environment made.  
A whistleblowing facility is available to 
employees and third parties to report 
control failures or behaviours, informing 
the Group on potential changes or 
improvements to risk mitigation activities.
IDENTIFYING DIVISIONAL 
AND GROUP RISK
Under Informa’s Risk Management 
Framework, risks are identified at  
a Group and Divisional level, recorded 
in risk registers and mitigating activities 
are defined. Those that are more likely  
to occur and/or have the potential to 
significantly impact business activities  
and the Group’s objectives are identified 
as principal risks. The principal risks 
are therefore a consolidation of Group 
and Divisional risks, with all factors 
represented and, where appropriate, 
quantified according to their effect on 
business activities. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
PRIORITIES FOR 2016
Informa intends to build on the risk 
management work undertaken in 2015 
and to continue to develop the Group’s 
risk maturity in 2016. This will include a 
formal assessment of the Company’s  
risk appetite and tolerance and improving 
how risk is monitored and reported to  
the Board. 
VIABILITY STATEMENT 
Taking into account Informa’s current 
position and its principal risks and 
uncertainties as described on pages 
22–25, the Directors have assessed the 
Group’s prospects and viability. The 
Directors have specifically assessed 
Informa’s viability over the next three 
years, to December 2018, which they 
believe is appropriate since it is 
consistent with the Group’s three-year 
business planning horizon and its 
associated three-year financial forecast. 
To make this assessment, the 
Group’s forecast revenue, operating 
profits, EBITDA and cash flows over 
the assessment period were subject to 
robust downside testing. This involved 
modelling the impact of a number of 
severe but plausible adverse scenarios, 
both in isolation and in combination, 
which could arise as a consequence  
of the most financially material of the 
Group’s principal risks crystallising. 
Other than the immediate 
consequence of a major incident, the 
risks modelled were strategic ones.  
The scenarios were modelled against  
a base case that reflects the business’s 
current financial and operating position, 
and against an alternative base case  
in which the business was assumed  
to borrow further to undertake a  
major acquisition. 
Based on this assessment, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group will be 
able to continue to operate and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period 
to December 2018.
In making this assessment,  
the Directors have made the key 
assumption that funding will be available 
in the form of the capital markets or 
bank debt in all plausible market 
conditions.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Principal risks are risks the Group considers would have the most impact on Informa’s strategic objectives. They have been robustly

The Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the principal risks, and considered them in the formulation of the Long-Term 
Viability Statement on page 21.
STRATEGIC RISKS
Risk Description Mitigating activities
2014–2017  
GROWTH  
ACCELERATION 
PLAN
Growth may not be delivered within 
the expected timeline or at a rate 
that will cover investment costs, 
leading to reputational impact.
IMPACT
Failure of the Growth Acceleration Plan 
would have a major impact on the 
Group’s ability to deliver its stated 
corporate growth objectives. There is 
potential for reputational damage within 
the investor community leading to an 
impaired ability to obtain, or retain, 
key funding commitments.
There are defined structures in place to support and deliver 
the Growth Acceleration Plan.
A Steering Committee directs the overall programme to ensure 
it meets its objectives of accelerated growth underpinned by 
operational fitness, strengthened capabilities and better 
customer experience. 
A central Design Authority controls the finances available to 
each project and ensures the quality of each project. Projects 
progress through stage gates at which point the release of 
funding is approved or denied. 
The Design Authority is supported by a team of functional 
specialists and an Architecture Review Board. All risks to 
projects are considered through regular review forums.
Divisional teams submit business cases for each project and 
lead and deliver their own GAP projects, with support from 
Divisional Project Management. 
CYBER  
SECURITY
Major information security breach  
or cyber-attack resulting in loss  
or theft of data, content or  
intellectual property.
IMPACT
In the event of such a breach, Informa  
could suffer reputational damage, fines, 
business interruption and litigation.
Data security at Informa is governed by a dedicated Enterprise 
Information Security Office and supported by an Information 
Protection Steering Committee and an Information Protection 
Management Forum. 
There is an enterprise-wide data security programme and 
defined incident management processes, including those for 
employees to report security breaches. System controls include 
secure infrastructure, content level protection, access 
management and monitoring.
Awareness of the Group’s information protection policies 
and procedures is maintained through training and periodic 
communications that highlight the importance of the 
appropriate stewardship of information. 
In 2015, the management of data security and risk at a 
Divisional level was reviewed and strengthened through the 
appointment of Chief Technology Officers to each Division.
22 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com Risk Description Mitigating activities
ACQUISITIONS Sub-optimal acquisitions.
IMPACT
The failure to successfully identify and 
integrate key acquisitions could lead 
to loss of profits, inefficient business 
processes, inconsistent corporate 
culture and weakened Brand. Poor 
quality acquisitions weaken Informa’s 
Brand and reputation and provide poor 
return on investment.
Informa takes a disciplined approach to identifying and 
testing acquisitions. 
Targets are analysed according to formal investment decision 
criteria to identify suitable, earnings enhancing acquisitions. 
They are tested by the Group Strategy and Business Planning 
Team for strategic fit. The due diligence process is led by the 
Director of Mergers & Acquisitions and supported by relevant 
Divisional Leadership Teams and Global Support functions 
including Finance and Legal. 
The Group’s focus for 2016 is to improve the integration of 
acquisitions. A Group-wide acquisition integration tool is in 
development and anticipated to launch in the first half of  
the year.
RELIANCE  
ON KEY 
COUNTERPARTIES
The overreliance on or loss of  
key counterparties.
IMPACT
This may impact the Group’s ability to  
enter into or remain in certain markets  
and have a disruptive effect on trading  
and revenues.
The Group monitors changes in the market and gathers regular 
customer feedback to ensure its products are well placed. It 
invests in a variety of distribution channels for products, which 
may include multiple venues per location or product type. 
The Group also engages regularly with key suppliers to 
understand their strategies and ensure a fit with the Group’s 
strategic objectives. Deep dive reviews are conducted to 
examine and understand the risks and opportunities key 
counterparties present.
ECONOMIC 
INSTABILITY
The arrival, or impending arrival, 
of an economic downturn or period 
of uncertainty affecting customer 
appetite for discretionary expenditure.
IMPACT
A period of economic instability could lead 
to a reduction in discretionary spending 
behaviours, which would have a direct 
impact on the profitability of one, or more,  
of the Group’s products and services.
Fluctuations in exchange rates could have 
an adverse effect on the strength of our 
Balance Sheet and our reported earnings.
The Group’s business planning cycle allows for a degree of 
forward planning in the event of a period of economic instability. 
While it is not possible to mitigate the impact of such a period 
entirely, particularly if a downturn were prolonged, the Group 
could identify areas of significant impact and take corrective 
actions. These may include reducing the capacity of certain 
events to align with prevailing market conditions.
Emerging uncertainty in the economic environment will be 
closely monitored in 2016. At a portfolio level, Informa’s 
products and services are diversified across markets and 
geographies, which reduces the Group-wide impact of a 
downturn in any single sector or region.
Financial planning and modelling activities are overseen by the 
Group Finance Director, who works closely with each Division 
to consider the trends likely to impact business activities. 
Governance oversight is provided by the Treasury Committee. 
The Group’s financial control environment includes a credit 
control function that ensures advance payment is received for 
many events and subscriptions, as well as the close monitoring 
of trade receivables and exchange rate risk by Group Treasury.

OPERATIONAL RISKS
Risk Description Mitigating activities
TECHNOLOGY 
FAILURE
A major IT infrastructure failure  
or prolonged loss of critical IT 
systems, internet, networks and 
similar services.
IMPACT
Disruption of Informa’s ability to deliver 
products and services. A prolonged 
interruption could lead to an inability 
to host certain key events or transact 
business, leading to a reduction in 
revenues and reputational damage.
The Group is strengthening its technology capabilities 
at a management, infrastructure and process level. 
In 2015, it appointed Chief Technology Officers and information 
security professionals to each Division, led by the Group Chief 
Information Officer, and instituted a Technology Leadership 
Forum that oversees all technology-related matters and 
ensures the Group’s technology strategy is implemented. 
Informa has established a technology governance framework, 
Technology Minimum Expected Practices, which sets minimum 
standards for technology-related controls across the Group. 
Internal Audit and the Group Technology Compliance Director 
monitor compliance with these practices and provide audit 
and reporting mechanisms.
Proactive measures to prevent disruption include moving  
to cloud-based solutions, monitoring, software patching  
and security testing. There is continuous investment in  
internet and electronic delivery platforms, networks and 
distribution systems. 
SAFETY 
MANAGEMENT
A significant accident or incident at 
an Exhibition, event or Informa office.
IMPACT
The impact of a safety-related incident 
could have numerous consequences for  
the Group and could lead to significant 
reputational damage, enforcement 
action and multiple claims for damages.
The Group has a health and safety framework, supported by 
relevant policies and procedures, which is overseen by the 
Group Risk Committee. There is a nominated Board Director 
responsible for health and safety matters. 
Informa’s event-based businesses have dedicated Health and 
Safety resources responsible for overseeing and executing the 
Group’s framework locally. There is a process designed to 
oversee the Group’s office environments led by the Global 
Support Division. 
Accidents, incidents and near misses are reported to the Group 
Risk Committee. The Group maintains insurance coverage in 
respect of Health and Safety matters.
The increase in unpredictable terrorist attacks is an emerging 
risk, and part of the Group’s focus in 2016 will be on security, 
protection and business continuity. 
CRISIS 
MANAGEMENT
A significant event requiring careful 
and sensitive management to protect 
the Group or other key stakeholders.
IMPACT
The inability to respond appropriately 
and in a timely manner could exacerbate 
an already sensitive incident, leading to 
significant business disruption, diversion of 
management time and reputational damage.
It is impossible to have a plan in place for all potential situations. 
The ultimate mitigation is dependent on management’s 
judgement, effective teamwork, speed of reaction and quality  
of communication in a crisis situation.
The Group has in place a crisis communications manual,  
which lays out the communications processes and procedures 
to follow in the event of a crisis. Its aim is to improve the quality 
of the Group’s communications response to risk events, and to 
help avoid common mistakes and oversights.

REGULATORY 
COMPLIANCE
The Group may be adversely affected 
by enforcement of and changes in 
legislation and regulation affecting 
its business and that of its customers 
and suppliers. Compliance with some 
legislation may be embedded into key 
financial undertakings to which the 
Group has been or may be subject.
IMPACT
Failure to comply with relevant regulations 
could lead to criminal and civil prosecution, 
including censure, reputational damage 
and potential inability to trade in certain 
jurisdictions. An actual regulatory breach 
could lead to a default under relevant 
financial undertakings.
The Group has internal Legal and Compliance Departments 
that provide advice and help define and implement  
Group policies. 
Sector and subject matter expertise exists within the Group’s 
Divisions. Informa also engages with industry trade associations 
and governments to keep abreast of changes to legislation.
Policies and procedures have been established which 
include systems to improve the detection of any possible 
non-compliance.
Training is provided to staff on an ongoing basis, and 
completion rates are tracked through routine reporting activity.

SUSTAINABILITY AT INFORMA
reports to the Director of Investor 
Relations, Corporate Communications 
and Brand. Informa tracks and reports its 
progress on sustainability based on these 
four priorities. More information on this 
and sustainability at Informa can be found 
in the full Informa Sustainability Report 
and at www.informa.com/sustainability.
INFORMA’S CONTENT: 
MAINTAINING QUALITY  
AND TRUST 
Creating and providing content is 
common to all of Informa’s Divisions.  
The quality of that content is fundamental; 
its integrity, reliability and trustworthiness 
attract and retain customers and ultimately 
create value for Shareholders. 
Informa has editorial codes in place 
where data, insight and content are 
produced or edited, and is involved in 
initiatives that promote best practice 
across the industry. 
The Academic Publishing Division 
provides resources on publication ethics 
and peer review standards. In 2015 it 
undertook a comprehensive study into 
peer review, surveying more than 7 ,000 
people to explore best practice in 
academic peer review. It works with the 
industry bodies Sense About Science and 
the Committee on Publication Ethics to 
raise research and publication standards.
Academic Publishing also employs 
fraud screening and peer review to  
ensure content it receives from third 
parties is original.
Business Intelligence has 
an editorial and content code to which  
all its journalists and editorial employees 
must adhere.
Several major events within Global 
Exhibitions and Knowledge & 
Networking employ independent 
advisory boards to ensure only original 
content is presented.
IMPROVING CONTENT 
ACCESSIBILITY
The accessibility of Informa’s content is 
also a factor in maintaining its integrity 
and value. 
The vast majority of Informa’s 
information products are available in digital 
format. In Business Intelligence over 
95% of the Division’s revenues come from 
digital subscription products. In 
Academic Publishing all journals and 
new book titles are available in a digital 
format, as is over 60% or 75,000 titles  
on the books backlist.
Steps to improve digital accessibility  
in 2015 included investing in enhanced 
data tools in Lloyd’s List Intelligence and 
undertaking accessibility audits across 
Informa’s full web estate. This has led to 
the introduction of minimum standards 
and best practice guidelines for all Informa 
GROWTH AND 
SUSTAINABILITY
Informa’s principal sustainability issues relate  
to providing trustworthy content and insight,  
and delivering it in an accessible way. 
I
nforma is committed to 
pursuing its growth strategy, 
as depicted on page 19, 
in a sustainable manner, 
minimising any detrimental 
business impacts and generating 
positive impacts where possible. This 
approach is embedded within the 
Group’s core values, in the belief that 
over the long term it can yield benefits  
for Shareholders and other  
stakeholders alike. 
In 2015, this commitment was 
recognised through Informa’s inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good index of companies 
demonstrating strong environmental, 
social and governance practices, of 
which Informa has been a constituent 
for over 10 years. 
Informa’s principal sustainability issues 
relate to providing trustworthy content 
and insight and delivering it in an 
accessible way. This sets the Group apart 
from many companies. The other strands 
of the Group’s sustainability priorities are 
common with other businesses and 
include minimising the environmental 
impact of operations, the office estate and 
technology, attracting and developing its 
people and managing the impact the 
business has on society and specific 
communities. 
Sustainability at Informa is developed 
and delivered by a dedicated team that 
28 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com sites, including a target to conform to 
AA accessibility criteria.
The availability and accessibility of 
academic content is a critical factor in 
stimulating the development of the global 
academic community. The Academic 
Publishing Division’s activities in this  
area include: 
• Offering open access options on virtually 
all its journals. The number of articles it 
published in 2015 under open access 
schemes increased by over 85%.
• Providing free and low-cost access  
to its publications for individuals and 
not-for-profit institutions in resource-
constrained developing markets. It 
operates STAR, Special Terms for 
Authors and Researchers, to make 
scholarly content more accessible  
to individual academic authors.
REDUCING INFORMA’S 
OPERATIONAL IMPACTS 
Informa seeks to mitigate the physical 
and environmental impacts of Exhibitions 
and conferences run by the Global 
Exhibitions and Knowledge & 
Networking Divisions. 
• A new global health and safety 
programme, Operating Safely, was 
launched in 2015 to ensure the 
application of consistently high health 
and safety standards for visitors, 
exhibitors, employees and business 
partners attending large Informa events.
• Informa developed a Sustainable 
Exhibitions Ladder in association with 
Greenbuild, one of the Global 
Exhibitions Division’s largest US 
Exhibitions, the world’s leading event  
for green building and sustainable 
development and a leader in the 
move towards zero waste events. The 
Sustainable Exhibitions Ladder assesses 
the environmental performance of 
Informa’s other major Exhibitions against 
five sustainability pillars, highlighting 
strengths and areas for improvements. 
It is being piloted with 10 events in 2016 
before being rolled out more widely. 
At a Company level, Informa’s most 
significant environmental impact is the 
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions arising 
from its office estate. The Company aims 
to reduce emissions from its larger offices 
where it controls the energy bill for the 
building, setting a target to decrease  
GHG emissions from its 10 largest 
offices by 10% compared with 2013. 
This target was not met, with a 
reduction of 8.2% achieved between 2013 
and 2015. Informa’s total GHG emissions 
decreased by 8.4%. The Sustainability 
Team runs an annual programme of 
events each September that educates 
employees on environmentally friendly 
work practices and lifestyles. 
PEOPLE, TALENT AND 
SUSTAINABILITY 
Ensuring the Company operates 
successfully and grows sustainably relies 
on attracting new talent and developing 
the skills of existing colleagues. In 2015, 
Informa launched its first Graduate 
Fellowship Scheme to bring skilled 
graduates into the business, and the 
second intake of the scheme will join 
in 2016. More information can be found 
on page 52.
The Group strongly believes in the 
value of diversity. It takes a broad and 
deep approach, according to factors 
including but not limited to gender, 
ethnicity, professional experience, 
educational background, nationality and 
age. In 2016, Informa is heightening its 
focus on diversity and inclusion, and will 
be concentrating on gathering greater 
data, implementing mentoring and 
coaching schemes and conducting 
policy reviews overseen by the Boards 
of each Operating Division.
Informa continues to support the 
principles laid out in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. The 
Company’s major human rights impacts 
relate to employees and contractors, 
product supply chain and the products 
themselves. The Academic Publishing 
Division has a global print supply chain, 
and potential impacts around labour 
standards in print factories. Informa uses 
its membership of the publishing supply 
chain initiative PRELIMS to communicate 
its expectations to suppliers and assess 
working conditions.
In 2016, as part of the Group’s 
activities in relation to the UK Modern 
Slavery Act 2015, it will be reviewing  
the Company’s risks around modern 
slavery and the mechanisms in place 
to manage them.

information and services. 
In Pharma & Healthcare for instance, one 
of Informa’s products provides specialist 
intelligence on worldwide pharmaceutical 
clinical trials. In Construction, Informa 
produces the premier global event 
dedicated to the Commercial Concrete 
and Masonry industry. For researchers 
and academics in Materials Science, a key 
specialist publication is The Philosophical 
Magazine, first printed in 1798. 
The highly specialist nature of Informa’s

STRATEGIC REPORT
INVESTMENT CASE
WHY 
INVEST?
Informa offers investors exposure to the burgeoning Knowledge and Information Economy.
The Group believes it has a growth opportunity in this market and can deliver attractive 
and sustainable returns over the long term, due to the strength of its Brands in niche 
markets, its growing international presence and its attractive financial characteristics. 
Informa has a track record of consistent dividends funded by strong and visible cash flows.
The Knowledge and Information Economy 
is growing at around 4% per annum 
according to Outsell. 
News and information are proliferating globally, 
and this trend has placed increased 
importance on specialist, actionable insight 
and intelligence from which trends and 
conclusions can be drawn. Niche communities, 
whether professional or academic, have 
become more segmented and increasingly 
global at the same time. These communities 
value platforms that enable them to connect 
and network with like-minded professionals 
and gain knowledge. 
Informa has offices in over 20 countries 
and sells its products and services into 
many more. Expanding this presence to 
meet customer needs and capture growth 
opportunities remains a priority for the Group.

FINANCIAL 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Informa has a stable and flexible financial 
operating model. 
There is a high level of visibility and predictability 
on revenue streams. More than half of revenue 
is recurring or booked in advance, including 
subscriptions and advance bookings for 
Exhibitions and events. 
Informa’s Divisions have attractive margins and 
high levels of cash conversion. This generates 
strong free cash flow, providing the Group with 
the flexibility to invest back into the business 
and producing attractive returns.
At the same time, Informa has a track record of 
delivering a consistent dividend to Shareholders. 
The Group committed to increasing the annual 
Dividend Per Share by a minimum of 2% a year 
for the period of the Growth Acceleration Plan . In 
201 5, the total Dividend Per Share was increased 
by 4. 1 % and the minimum commitment for the 
duration of the Plan was also increased to 4 %.

ACADEMIC PUBLISHING IN 2015
Informa’s Academic Publishing  
Division produces high quality, 
peer reviewed books and journals 
in specialist subject areas for upper 
level university students (typically 
second or third year undergraduates 
and postgraduates), researchers and 
academic institutions worldwide. 
Books and journals are purchased 
in print and digital formats by academic 
libraries, university departments and 
specialist institutions, by the institution 
or through consortia arrangements. 
They can also be bought or rented by 
individuals. Alternatively, some journal 
content is made available free at the point 
of use through the open access option, 
where the author, institution or research 
body pays the publisher to publish and 
make freely available the content.
Academic Publishing is 
characterised by a robust financial  
and operating performance, delivering 
consistent growth across a well-balanced 
portfolio of products. 
In 2015, the Division reported consistent 
growth in revenue and profit, with 
revenues of £447 .4m and organic revenue 
growth of 1.6%. In line with one of the 
Division’s key goals, performance 
remained at or ahead of the wider 
academic market, albeit organic growth 
was marginally lower than in 2014 due 
to some short-term volatility in book 
purchasing behaviour and softness in 
US Medical Books and the wider 
textbook market.
Revenue remained relatively evenly 
balanced between Humanities & Social 
Sciences (“HSS”) and Sciences, Technical  
& Medical (“STM”) content. Similarly, the  
mix of subscription revenue and one-off 
copy sales remained broadly constant.
The Division made two notable 
acquisitions during 2015, further 
strengthening its position in key  
niche subject areas and adding scale  
to the Group’s overall portfolio of  
specialist content. 
The Division’s Books business added 
Ashgate Publishing, an independent 
publisher of Social Sciences, Arts and 
Humanities content, which contributed  
over 12,000 high quality titles to the Books 
catalogue of approximately 120,000 titles. 
The Division’s Journals business added 
Maney Publishing, an independent 
publisher of international HSS and STM 
journals, contributing 170 titles to the 
Journals portfolio. 
Both companies were fully integrated 
into the Division’s existing structure and 
incorporated into its sales model in time 
for the 2016 renewal season.

ACADEMIC PUBLISHING (CONTINUED)
In tandem, the Division will invest in 
building its capabilities to support future 
growth through the Growth Acceleration 
Plan. In 2016 a key focus is on building  
a platform to enable customers to more 
easily discover content at a granular level, 
driving usage. This will also enable greater 
customer analytics, providing valuable 
insight into changing market trends and 
customer demand. The launch of a 
dedicated Research Analytics Team 
for the Books business, mirroring an 
existing service in Journals, underlines 
the value the Division puts on long-term 
relationships with authors and the broader 
academic community. 
The Division is also taking steps to 
further simplify its operating structure by 
consolidating operations into a single 
global business for Books and a single 
global business for Journals. This will 
improve efficiencies and further increase 
customer focus. 
It will continue to invest in developing 
the Cogent OA business and expanding 
the Division’s portfolio of open access 
journals, offering further flexibility for 
authors and funders alike. 
The Academic Publishing Division is 
increasingly global, both in sales and 
the origination of content. Over 50% of 
revenue came from North America in 2015 
and sales to emerging markets increased 
to represent around 13% of revenue.
NOTABLE MARKET TRENDS
The global educational market has faced 
some significant changes over the long 
term; as the structure of education 
in different countries continues to evolve, 
digital technology becomes more 
prevalent and customer demand for 
innovation and flexibility rises. 
The academic segment of the  
market where Informa focuses looks 
comparatively resilient in the short to 
medium term, and is underpinned by 
positive global trends in research volumes 
and the number of academics. However, 
there is nuance by region and subject area 
due to differences in research funds, 
library purchasing budgets and student 
enrolment trends. 
There remains a good opportunity for 
growth in developing markets. Investment 
in educational infrastructure, including 
universities, creates new demand for 
access to specialist content and expands 
the pool of authors wishing to publish their 
work in respected global publications.
Informa’s Academic Publishing 
Division takes an entirely flexible and 
customer-led approach to format. All 
origination and editorial processes are 
digital. Whether the final product is in a 
print or digital format is selected by the 
customer. The development of print-on-
demand technology and the Division’s 
highly efficient production model mean 
this can be managed in a practical and 
cost-effective manner. 
In 2015, ebooks represented 24% of 
the Books business’s revenue, about two 
percentage points higher than in 2014. 
This is consistent with market trends, 
where print versions remain the most 
popular format in education and 
academia. All journals are instead 
delivered digitally, reflecting the nature 
and use of peer reviewed research and 
allowing users to perform a granular 
search across a discipline or specific 
subject and access content by citation 
or reference.
Growth in open access content 
remains a feature of the academic market 
and the Division continues to invest in this 
area. This is most evident in Journals and 
comes from author demand for recognition 
of their research and a desire for broad 
distribution by research funding bodies. 
PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS 
FOR 2016 
In 2016, Academic Publishing will 
continue to target organic growth that is 
in line or ahead of the wider academic 
market, underpinned by its leading 
publishing Brands, strong editorial 
relationships, increasingly international 
reach and growing portfolio of specialist 
content. The Division will continue to look 
for accretive acquisitions that strengthen 
and complement the portfolio and 
increase its scale.

Managing Director  
Taylor & Francis China  
Beijing, China
I chose publishing as a career nearly 20 years ago because I’m 
passionate about information. Information gives advantage, 
whatever field you work in. I feel proud to be part of an industry 
that expands knowledge and promotes understanding. 
At Informa I manage sales and editorial for Books and 
Journals within the Chinese academic community. It’s a 
fantastic time to be working in China. The academic market 
is rapidly evolving, and there’s a thirst for access to content 
plus a desire from Chinese authors to reach a global audience. 
In a typical day I might design a subscription and licensing 
package for a major Chinese university, brainstorm how 
to promote our new digital formats or look for business 
opportunities for our products in light of external events, 
such as the interest in Beijing’s smog cloud.
I also speak at events to explain the long-term partnerships 
we offer authors and researchers. We’re increasingly well 
known here; in 2015, the Chinese-language version of our 
Visible Learning for T eachers book was singled out as the 
most-wanted book amongst Chinese teachers by China 
Educational News Web.
There’s a deep focus on people within the Academic 
Publishing Division. Everyone works closely together ,  
there’s lots of trust and success is recognised. The relationship 
I have with my Senior Managers and team is excellent  
and rewarding.

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE IN 2015
Business Intelligence provides 
data-driven intelligence and insight to 
businesses and professionals in specialist 
niche communities around the world, 
enabling customers to make decisions 
better and quicker.
It owns leading Brands in these 
niches, from Citeline and Scrip in Pharma 
& Healthcare to Lloyd’s List in Maritime 
and Ovum in Telecoms, Media & 
Technology. Over 85% of revenue is 
derived from subscription products, the 
vast majority of which are delivered 
digitally. It generates the remainder of its 
income from one-off data sales, bespoke 
consulting projects and a small amount  
of advertising. 
Following a number of years of 
declining organic revenue, a new 
Divisional Leadership Team was 
appointed in the second half of 2014.  
In 2015, the team started to implement  
a programme of change designed  
to reverse this trend. This included 
reorienting the business towards five  
key verticals – Agribusiness, Pharma, 
Maritime, Finance, and Telecoms, Media 
& Technology – as well as refocusing on 
subscription renewals and customer 
management and investing in product  
and technology capabilities. 
The Division made good operational 
progress with this plan in 2015. The 
reorganisation of the sales operation and 
an increased customer focus led to a 
steady improvement in retention rates  
and the sales pipeline. This resulted in 
an improving quarter by quarter revenue 
trend and culminated in a return to  
positive organic growth in the fourth 
quarter of 2015.
Management took steps to streamline 
the business in 2015, further increasing 
the focus on its five priority verticals where 
it has strong Brands, proprietary data  
and intelligence products. This led to  
the sale of its portfolio of Consumer 
Information businesse s for £25m in  
July, a collection of mass-forecasting 
information products in a widely defined, 
highly competitive vertical. 
Business Intelligence also began 
the process of investing in its product 
capabilities and delivery platforms. Each 
vertical now has a detailed product 
development roadmap. While these 
initiatives will start to deliver benefits only 
towards the end of 2016, when combined 
with a refocused and reinvigorated sales 
operation they are critical to achieving 
consistent levels of organic growth 
across the business.

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (CONTINUED)
Capital investment has been matched  
by an investment in talent, including  
the appointment of a Chief Technology 
Officer, experienced leaders for each 
vertical and a Head of Client Services, 
underlining the increased focus  
on customers. 
NOTABLE MARKET TRENDS 
Business Intelligence operates in a  
fast moving area of the Knowledge and 
Information Economy, and the global 
market for specialist business information 
that helps customers make faster and 
better decisions is attractive and growing. 
Analysts Outsell, Inc. estimate that the 
total market for business-to-business 
media, in which the Division operates, 
stands at $31.8bn and is growing at  
a rate of 4% a year. 
Information continues to proliferate, 
with increasing volumes of data and  
news available online and through  
social media, often free at the point of 
consumption. This has put pressure on 
the value of basic information and news, 
but also made it more difficult to obtain 
specialist information, identify trends 
and draw conclusions.
This trend has led to increasing 
demand for specialist data, trusted 
sources of market intelligence and 
analysis that can parse the volume of 
information now available. Increasingly, 
businesses are looking for market  
insight and intelligence that directly 
informs commercial decisions and 
validates investments, giving them  
a competitive advantage. 
The vast majority of this market 
comprises digital rather than print 
products, and digital formats are being 
developed and used in increasingly 
sophisticated ways. Among the most 
valuable products to customers are those 
where data and intelligence can be 
directly integrated and embedded into 
their workflow and working practices, and 
those that enable predictive and even 
prescriptive decision making about 
future events. 
Informa’s Business Intelligence 
Division focuses on the attractive 
and increasingly valuable market for 
intelligence and analysis. In common with 
Informa’s other three Operating Divisions, 
it operates in niche markets, with a 
narrow and deep focus on specialist 
areas where it is often the definitive 
source of granular data and intelligence. 
Such strong market positions within 
niches give the Division strong potential 
for growth. 
For example, within the Pharma 
vertical, the Division’s largest product 
collection is within Citeline. Citeline 
provides data and intelligence on  
clinical trials and drug development 
pipelines, a must-have resource for  
certain professionals within major 
pharmaceutical companies, academic 
institutions, government agencies and 
consultancies worldwide. 
The market for specialist business 
information is increasingly international 
but the US remains by far the largest 
single market. Correspondingly it is 
where Business Intelligence derives 
the majority of its revenue.
PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS 
FOR 2016
The Division’s immediate priority is to 
maintain the momentum created in 2015 
and further improve subscription renewals, 
new customer wins and annualised 
contract values. 
Having reported positive organic 
growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 and 
a robust performance in the important 
November to January renewal season, 
the Group’s expectations for Business 
Intelligence in 2016 have increased, 
and the Division’s objective is now to 
target positive organic revenue growth 
across the year.
In the medium term, the Division believes it 
can build a strong position in the specialist 
business intelligence market, with the 
potential to deliver consistent organic 
growth of between 3% and 5%. 
In 2016, the continued focus on 
subscription renewals and customer 
management will be complemented by 
further targeted investment in products 
and technology through the Growth 
Acceleration Plan, building further 
capability in marketing automation,  
insight and analytics and intelligent 
product platforms.
Since the launch of the Growth 
Acceleration Plan, no acquisition capital 
has been committed to the Business 
Intelligence Division and efforts have 
instead focused on restructuring and 
refocusing the business. As the Division 
builds capability and capacity and 
progressively returns to positive organic 
growth, the Group will more actively scan 
the market for attractive opportunities. 
These would include businesses that add 
a capability to the Division or strengthen 
its position in a key vertical or related area. 
Building presence in the US remains a 
focus, a market that is estimated by 
Outsell, Inc. to account for up to 75% of 
the global market for specialist business 
information, compared with approximatelly 
50% of current revenue in the Division.

Sagient Content Manager  
Business Intelligence  
San Diego, California, USA 
I joined Informa in 2012 by way of its acquisition of Sagient, 
a provider of intelligence on pharmaceuticals and medical 
devices. My career began years earlier when Sagient was 
a small independent company. I was initially responsible 
for data research and content creation for BioMedTracker, 
progressing to work on content planning, consulting 
projects and eventually team management. Beginning 
in Content gave me an understanding of our products, the 
industry and client needs: a solid foundation as I advanced 
in my career.
Since being integrated into Business Intelligence’s 
Pharma vertical, my role has developed and I’ve taken 
on new responsibilities. In the last year, I’ve been 
given two new products to oversee – Medtrack and 
MedDeviceTracker – and I focus increasingly on strategic 
planning and operations. 
Part of my role is also to grow and develop staff, and it’s 
been rewarding to see individuals achieve their goals. I also 
serve as a bridge, building connections between my team, 
other Informa colleagues and our clients. Much of the 
success we’ve experienced is due to our attentive customer 
service and philosophy of working closely with clients to 
create products they need. Year-on-year clients give us 
consistently high customer satisfaction scores. It validates 
the work we do and creates a sense of pride in what we deliver .

GLOBAL EXHIBITIONS IN 2015 
Global Exhibitions organises 
transaction-oriented Exhibitions that 
enable specialist communities to meet 
face to face, develop relationships and 
conduct business. It is a global business, 
running events in all major regions, with  
a growing presence in the world’s largest 
Exhibitions market, the US. 
The Division’s strategy for 2015 was  
to continue to internationalise its portfolio 
of events, strengthen its position in key 
verticals and maintain its strong recent 
operating performance. Global 
Exhibitions reported organic revenue 
growth of 10.5% in 2015, a rate that was 
comfortably ahead of growth within the 
wider Exhibitions market. This performance 
was despite the absence of the two major 
non-annual events that took place in 2014, 
Ipex and Formobile.
It also focused on integrating the two 
larger acquisitions made in 2014, Virgo 
and Hanley Wood Exhibitions, and 
pursuing further targeted, accretive 
portfolio additions. Businesses added to 
the portfolio in 2015 included Dwell on 
Design, which complements shows 
already in the Division’s US Construction 
& Real Estate vertical, and FIME, a medical 
trade show based in Miami with a similar 
proposition to Arab Health in Dubai but  
for the Americas. 
The Virgo and Hanley Wood Exhibitions 
acquisitions completed in 2014 performed 
well during Informa’s first full year of 
ownership. Construction & Real Estate 
events were particularly strong  
and reported profits comfortably ahead  
of plan. Good progress was made on 
integrating the businesses, with back-
office functions successfully incorporated 
into the Group’s Shared Services Centres 
and early synergies realised in areas such 
as Exhibitions services.
The year also marked a transition 
of leadership. Divisional CEO Will Morris 
retired in September 2015 and was 
replaced by Charlie McCurdy, an 
experienced events and business-to-
business media executive and Chairman 
of the US Society of Independent Show 
Organizers. Charlie will look to build on 
the strong business inherited from Will, 
further strengthening its position in vertical 
markets internationally and leveraging  
its digital and data capabilities.

NOTABLE MARKET TRENDS
The worldwide Exhibitions market  
is sizeable and growing attractively. 
Consultants AMR International estimate 
that the industry was worth $29bn in 
2014, and forecast it will grow at an 
annualised rate of 4.5% between 2014 
and 2019, albeit with regional variations. 
The Exhibitions market remains 
fragmented, comprising international 
for-profit Exhibition organisers, local and 
regional event organisers, not-for-profit 
companies, government-backed 
organisations and industry associations 
or trade bodies. This creates 
considerable opportunities for 
expansion through acquisitions 
and partnerships with societies 
and associations. 
estimates they make up 79% of total 
industry revenue – and they are 
increasingly making decisions based 
on more granular data about attendees. 
Organisers with the marketing technology 
to enable this can provide additional value 
and generate supplementary income. 
For the leading, Branded Exhibitions 
in an industry, a significant amount of 
exhibitor re-booking can take place onsite, 
a year in advance of the next show. This 
provides organisers with strong, visible 
revenue streams and a high degree  
of predictability.
PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS 
FOR 2016 
The opportunity for the Global 
Exhibitions Division in 2016 is to move 
When competing against established 
events, the barriers to entry for new 
Exhibition organisers are high, and 
companies that run established, leading 
events within a particular vertical or region 
typically have strong defensible positions. 
The Exhibitions market has been a 
beneficiary of global digitisation because 
the value of face-to-face interaction with 
customers has increased. For many 
specialist communities, particularly 
international industries with large supply 
chains, making connections face to face  
is intrinsic to their commercial success. 
Digital technology has created additional 
opportunities for engaging with customers 
away from the show floor, year-round. 
Exhibitors are by the far the largest 
source of revenue at Exhibitions – AMR 
from being a strong and high performing 
Exhibitions organiser to a best-in-class 
international Exhibitions business. Having 
built and acquired a global portfolio of 
leading Brands, the Division has the 
potential to further expand in the Americas, 
benefit from scale in procurement and 
focus more strongly on data management 
under Charlie McCurdy’s leadership. 
Two initiatives are intrinsic to the 
Division’s progress. It already has an 
attractive international portfolio of leading 
Brands, and in the first instance, even 
greater emphasis will be placed on 
developing true global positions in vertical 
markets. By internationalising further and 
deepening cross-border links with 
industries such as Construction & Real 
estate, Life Sciences and Health & 
Nutrition, the Division has the potential 
to develop powerful and globally 
recognised Brands.
The second initiative is to use digital 
and data services to deepen customer 
engagement and help inform and connect 
communities year-round. The Division is 
strengthening its capabilities in this area 
through the Growth Acceleration Plan. The 
combination of a global vertical Brand and 
a strong, complementary digital offering 
has the potential to generate incremental 
revenue and extend the Division’s position 
from Exhibition organiser to market maker 
within key industries.
Pursuing targeted acquisitions in a 
disciplined manner continues to be part  
of the Division’s strategy. Focus will remain 
on businesses that expand the Group’s 
presence in key territories such as North 
America and strengthen its position in  
key verticals. 
The Division’s expansion has created 
a better balanced Exhibitions portfolio. 
Divisional revenue is now broadly split 
between 40% North America, 30% Middle 
East and 30% other regions. This 
international breadth, combined with the 
Division’s strong Brands, helps it operate 
successfully and deliver a strong 
performance during periods of weak 
market-specific economic data. In 2016 
slowing economic growth in Brazil and 
China creates potential short-term 
headwinds for the Division’s local operations, 
although the Exhibitions market as a whole 
benefits from advance bookings.

2015 was one of the busiest years of my career. I joined 
Hanley Wood in 2000 to manage several trade Exhibitions 
including Surfaces, North America’s leading event for the 
flooring industry. 
Hanley Wood was acquired by Informa in 2014, and 2015 
was our first full year as part of the Global Exhibitions 
Division. I’ve found the Group to be very agile. There’s a 
strong growth agenda and a global reach that has created 
opportunities for me and the events portfolio.
Over the year my role enlarged and became more 
international. As well as managing the International 
Surface Event, I took on Dwell on Design, the largest design 
trade show in the US and designjunction, a leading UK 
design event. 
We see potential to extend these Brands globally through 
strategic partnerships, and I’m proud to have negotiated 
a multi-year partnership between Dwell on Design and the 
European furnishing and interiors show imm cologne 
that will kick-start this process. Our US and 
European teams are increasingly co-ordinating 
to enhance how we promote our range of design 
and architecture events and help exhibitors 
reach their target markets. 
Outside of the office, I’m also involved with 
the Society of Independent Show Organizers

and Events. It’s an enjoyable industry to work in: 
fun, dynamic and exciting.

KNOWLEDGE & NETWORKING 
IN 2015
The Knowledge & Networking Division 
connects communities by creating and 
sharing insights and learning. Its face-to-
face and online events, and its digital 
services, help professionals build their 
knowledge and network with peers.
Knowledge & Networking was 
created in 2014 through the introduction  
of the Group’s new operating model, 
which separated Informa’s events 
businesses between those predominantly 
focused on Exhibitions and commercial 
transactions, and those based on 
knowledge sharing and networking. 
2015 was a year of repositioning  
and transition for the Division. Its new 
Management Team launched a strategy  
to streamline the business and increase  
its focus on the regions and sectors where 
it has strong Brands plus an opportunity 
to build leading positions as a knowledge 
provider for niche communities. 
This led to the sale of operations 
in Sweden and Denmark and two 
businesses in the Netherlands, all of 
which operate smaller, local language 
conferences with less potential for 
international expansion. More recently, 
the Division sold a majority stake in Adam 
Smith, its Russian conferences business, 
to a local conference operator. This 
outcome creates efficiencies and partners 
the Division with a connected local player 
that can leverage its strong content  
and Brands in what remains a very 
challenging market. 
With these actions, the Division is now 
focused on three major operating centres 
– the UK, the US and Dubai – supported 
by several regional offices, and is more 
concentrated on three vertical markets, 
Global Finance, Life Sciences and 
Telecoms, Media & Technology. Internal 
reorganisation during 2015 has also 
created a simpler, more coherent 
operating structure, geared towards  
the customer. These changes were 
introduced gradually through the year  
to avoid disruption to major events. 
The Division’s performance improved 
towards the end of 2015, with positive 
organic revenue growth in the fourth 
quarter. Highlights included the growth 
of delegate numbers at the BIO-Europe 
Spring conference and the successful 
launch of the Internet of Things event in 
California, which demonstrated the value 
of timely and compelling digital and 
face-to-face content, delivered to a 
targeted audience in a growing market.

KNOWLEDGE & NETWORKING (CONTINUED)
NOTABLE MARKET TRENDS
The global market for knowledge-based 
events is large and competitive, with 
barriers to entry relatively low. The internet 
and social media networks have made  
it easier to identify and market to 
communities of professionals. At the same 
time, the internet has provided a flexible 
distribution channel for some content that 
was previously exclusive to specialist 
conferences, and created a platform for 
professional audiences to connect with 
peers. These factors have put pressure  
on the traditional spot conference model 
and put the onus on organisers to 
maximise engagement and the onsite 
customer experience.
The perceived value of face-to-face 
media continues to rise, supporting the 
case for the most successful events.  
In a world of increasing digitisation, the 
opportunity for face-to-face interaction 
with professional customers and peers 
has decreased, and platforms that provide 
this connection and increase learning and 
understanding remain powerful. Such 
events typically have strong, well-known 
Brands and are synonymous with a niche 
community within an industry. People 
return to such events every year to learn 
about the latest developments and 
network with peers, and associate 
themselves with the Brand through 
sponsorship and speaker engagements. 
Increasingly, they also engage with the 
Brand online to find additional content. 
As with all events, success can be 
impacted by industry and market-specific 
economic conditions. In 2015 for instance, 
falling oil prices led to huge volatility in 
Energy & Resource markets, affecting 
the profitability of companies operating 
in the sector and the economic growth of 
countries heavily exposed to the industry, 
such as Russia. This affected all events 
focused on the sector, as companies 
cut back on discretionary expenditure. 
Exposure to Russia and the Energy & 
Resource market is now a relatively small 
part of Knowledge & Networking at 
around 7% of revenue, but was still a 
significant drag on performance in the year. 
Face-to-face events are also affected 
by any incidents or epidemics that prevent 
people travelling or impact the location 
where events are due to take place. 
Sponsorship and speaker arrangements 
are secured in advance but a significant 
proportion of delegate bookings are 
confirmed close to the date of the 
event. Even if an event takes place and 
attendance is low, the delegate experience 
can be poor, impacting perception for the 
future. In this situation, typically events are 
postponed and rescheduled to later in the 
year, although this is not always possible. 
PRIORITIES AND 
PROSPECTS FOR 2016 
Following the repositioning of the 
business in 2015, the Knowledge & 
Networking Division enters 2016 more 
streamlined, with much greater focus 
and operational direction. 
The target for 2016 is to return the 
Division to at least flat organic revenue 
performance, allowing for the Division’s 
ongoing exposure to the Energy & 
Resource sector, a market that is likely to 
remain as challenging in 2016 as it was  
in 2015.
Within the Division, the development 
of content has been separated from the 
commercial function. A Chief Product 
Officer has been appointed, with 
responsibility for ensuring digital and 
face-to-face products and services 
provide valuable, cutting-edge content 
and experiences by engaging with 
customers and adapting to their needs. 
A separate Delivery function is responsible 
for developing commercial relationships  
in a more structured and co-ordinated 
way. These changes are symptomatic  
of the Division’s more focused,  
customer-led approach.
Through the Growth Acceleration 
Plan, further investment will be made 
in Knowledge & Networking’s 
transformation programme. A major focus 
is on developing its digital capabilities, 
which are increasingly important not just 
for marketing and transactions but as a 
way to engage customers and promote 
learning before, after and at the event. By 
creating interactive, Branded, content-rich 
online community platforms, the Division 
can connect audiences year-round. 
As part of the restructuring within 
Knowledge & Networking, its bespoke 
training and learning operations have been 
consolidated into a single business named 
Professional Development and Learning. 
In 2016, it will launch its own strategy for 
growth, as it seeks to tap into increased 
demand for professional skills training  
and accreditation.

One of my 2015 highlights was getting positive feedback 
from very discerning Chief Risk Officers on the interactive 
labs at our RiskMinds International Conference. And at our 
flagship FundForum and SuperReturn events, we introduced 
a popular new ‘Live’ service, capturing and distributing real-

The new operating structure in Knowledge & Networking 
will enable us to develop our products further and better 
engage with customers. Fintech is a particularly interesting 
sub-sector. It’s been a topic at larger conferences, and 
we intend to build this capability out into standalone

GLOBAL SUPPORT IN 2015
Global Support is Informa’s fifth  
Division. It is the team behind the teams, 
comprising a central group of experts in 
specialist functions including Finance, 
Tax & Treasury, Technology and 
Intellectual Property. The three largest 
locations for Global Support are the 
UK, the US and Singapore.
The Division provides business 
services that support the Group’s four 
Operating Divisions, enabling them to 
focus on implementing their commercial 
plans. It also supports the Group entity, 
providing essential services to help 
Informa function effectively and fulfil its 
ambitions to return all parts of the 
business to sustainable growth. These 
include Group-wide leadership, planning 
and investment decisions, and risk 
management principles and procedures. 
In 2015, the focus within Global 
Support was to strengthen capabilities 
and infrastructure in key areas, ensuring 
it could effectively support the growth 
and progress being pursued by the four 
Operating Divisions. 
Global Support established an 
Operating Executive Team to monitor and 
improve the Division’s engagement with 
other parts of the Group, with the aim of 
creating a consistent approach to how its 
various business services are provided. 
Several functions were expanded over 
the year, notably Risk Management and 
Business Planning. This has created a 
more disciplined approach to monitoring 
and reporting on risk described on page 
20. The investment in Business Planning  
is part of a programme to embed more 
detailed long-term planning within the 
Divisions and provide greater support  
and oversight centrally.
The Group’s Treasury Team, which 
aims to reduce risk and optimise Informa’s 
Balance Sheet through efficient funding 
and effective cash management, 
relocated from the Netherlands to London. 
This change enables the team to work 
more closely with other Global Support 
functions, particularly the central Finance 
Team, and to attract experienced Treasury 
professionals more easily.

of funding for the Investment Programme. 
This team will continue to report, monitor 
and control the overall programme 
in 2016. 
The central Talent & Transformation 
team retains responsibility for identifying 
and investing in existing and new 
employees, to ensure Informa has 
the skills and capabilities it needs as it 
moves through the 2014–2017 Growth 
Acceleration Plan. This includes overseeing 
the 2016 intake of the Informa Graduate 
Fellowship Scheme as described overleaf. 
Other priorities for Global Support 
are to ensure Informa meets all its legal 
obligations and follows best practice in 
areas such as information security, 
technology, risk and compliance. Global 
Support’s dedicated teams continue to be 
responsible for protecting Informa’s assets 
and intellectual property, and managing the 
Company’s Brand and reputation. 
Several Global Support initiatives 
commenced in 2015 designed to improve 
Informa’s operational effectiveness. This 
included the standardisation of employee 
data, which will provide greater insight into 
Informa’s international workforce, improve 
the ability to manage talent proactively 
and make on-boarding new employees 
following business acquisitions a 
smoother process. 
In 2014, the Global Support Shared 
Service Centres were consolidated into 
three regional hubs to increase operational 
efficiency. This process of centralisation 
continued in 2015. The Division is 
implementing a simplified and updated 
finance system that can adequately 
support the growth of the Operating 
Divisions and provide better data and 
information for financial decision making. 
Following the introduction of the 
Group’s new operating model and the 
launch of the Growth Acceleration Plan in 
2014, Global Support’s Communications 
Team completed a relaunch of the Informa 
Brand in 2015. Informa’s visual identity 
and assets such as the informa.com 
website were updated to create a more 
distinctive, modern and consistent 
representation of the Company, making  
it easier for Shareholders and other 
stakeholders to understand its purpose 
and ambition. 
PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS 
FOR 2016
In 2016, Global Support will continue  
to focus on providing effective professional 
services to enable each part of Informa 
to meet its financial and operational 
objectives. 
Within Global Support, there 
remains a small Project Management 
Office that oversees the Growth 
Acceleration Plan. Its main focus is on 
controlling and managing the release

CLAIRE  
CARPENTER
Business Architect  
Global Support  
London, UK
I’ve worked for Informa for nearly 10 years, across many 
different projects in HR and IT. As a Business Enterprise 
Architect I now look at the link between business strategy 
and technology, analysing and advising on how technology 
can be aligned to enable the Group’s growth objectives. 
A highlight of 2015 was working on the Growth Acceleration 
Plan. I’m part of the central group of specialists that assesses 
each project at every major stage before funding is given. 
My role is to understand what project teams are trying 
to achieve and ensure they have fully considered their 
technology needs and impacts, from planning and process 
changes to platform choices. 
It’s been fascinating to be part of a major strategic initiative 
for the Group, and being chosen to work alongside different 
teams and consultants has expanded my skills and network. 
Being part of Global Support means providing services 
and support to all four Operating Divisions. It’s a privileged 
position because you get insight into the whole Company, 
which brings a real breadth of experience, and everyone is 
open to collaborating. It’s a diverse business – we’re in many 
different locations and end markets with a variety of products 
– and that’s what makes the day-to-day both challenging 
and interesting.

graduates as part of its focus on 
attracting talent to the Group and 
developing the skills of its colleagues.

52 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com 015 was the inaugural year  
of the Informa Graduate 
Fellowship Scheme, a 
two-year programme 
designed to attract high 
achieving graduates to the Group  
and give them a broad base of skills, 
knowledge and experience from 
which to develop a rewarding long-term 
career at Informa. 
The graduates, or Fellows as they are 
known, became Informa’s first intake in 
September 2015. Tom Moloney, Director 
of Talent & Transformation and member 
of the Executive Management Team, 
described the genesis of the Scheme. 
“The new operating structure Informa 
introduced in 2014 really enabled us to 
launch the scheme,” Tom said. “It created a 
central resource within the Global Support 
Division dedicated to cross-Company 
strategic HR matters. We’ve spent time 
identifying specific areas in which Informa 
needed to build capabilities and increase 
skills to support the Company’s growth, 
and hiring talent at a graduate level 
has become one of our focal points. 
The Scheme is all about bringing new 
thinking and energy to the company.”
Whilst Informa’s Divisions recruit 
many starter-level positions, the Graduate 
Fellowship Scheme was designed to give 
successful candidates the opportunity 
to explore many different areas of 
the Company, both in the UK and 
internationally, whilst being mentored 
by senior Informa managers. 
Meshall Sen, Graduate Recruitment 
and Training Manager, explained: “We 
wanted to design a programme that 
was flexible, so it could be tailored to 
each graduate’s interests, but also create 
a structure we could refine and repeat 
in the future.
“So far everyone has responded 
brilliantly. The Fellows have been 
enthusiastic and have actively 
contributed to a range of live projects, 
and colleagues have valued their 
willingness to take responsibility and 
get involved. This early success has been 
very encouraging, and we’re already 
searching for our 2016 intake at careers 
fairs around the UK and through social 
media,” she added. 
The Fellows completed their first 
three-month placement in 2015, and 
will undertake a further three UK-based 
placements in different Informa divisions 
in 2016 before spending six months in an 
office outside of Europe. They have the 
chance to transition to a permanent role 
at the end of the two-year period. 
One of the 2015 Fellows, Sarah Weir, 
said: “It was Informa’s focus on knowledge 
and research, and all the ways information 
can be disseminated, that first attracted 
me to the Company. I’ve already learnt 
a lot about the business from getting 
involved in digital content initiatives and 
from simply working with colleagues. 
Everyone has been very welcoming 
and I feel I’m developing my skills and 
contributing to the Company at the 
same time.”

REVENUE AND ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT
The Group’s revenue grew by 6.6% in 2015 to £1,212.2m (2014: £1,137 .0m). This was a 5.2% increase on a constant currency basis 
and a 1.0% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted operating profit of £365.6m was 9.5% higher than the prior year, which is a 6.0% 
increase on a constant currency basis and 0.1% increase on an organic basis. This growth in revenue and adjusted operating profit 
reflected growth in Global Exhibitions and Academic Publishing that more than offset declines in the other two Divisions.  
The adjusted operating margin grew by 80 basis points from 29.4% in 2014 to 30.2%.

ADJUSTED AND ORGANIC MEASURES
Informa prepares adjusted results in addition to statutory results to provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business 
performance compared with the previous year. This is in line with the adjusted measures used by peers and facilitates comparisons 
with them. Adjusted results exclude adjusting items such as intangible asset amortisation arising from acquisitions and impairment 
charges. A full list of adjusting items is provided in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements described below. 
Organic measures of revenue and adjusted operating profit are measures adjusted for material acquisitions and disposals,  
as well as the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. All results in this review are based on continuing operations.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries and other operations stood at 
£9.1m in 2015 (2014: £2.8m loss). This arose from a £7 .4m profit 
from the disposal of the Consumer Information businesses,  
a £1.4m profit from the disposal of the conference businesses  
in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands and £0.3m from  
other disposals.
ADJUSTED NET FINANCE COSTS
Adjusted net finance costs, which are principally interest costs on 
private placement loan notes and bank borrowings net of interest 
receivable, increased by £1.5m to £25.9m. Additional debt was 
used to fund acquisitions completed in the latter part of 2014, 
which created higher average net debt levels in 2015 and led to 
this increased finance cost. 
TAXATION
The Group tax charge on statutory profit before tax (“PBT”) 
was 21.4% (2014: 63.5% credit). The statutory effective tax rate 
reported for 2014 and 2015 was affected by impairment charges 
that were not deductible for tax purposes. 
Tax has been provided on adjusted PBT at an adjusted tax 
rate of 17 .7%. This rate reflects the impact of profits generated  
in low tax jurisdictions. Calculation of the adjusted tax rate was 
amended in 2015 to reflect the benefit of amortisation of goodwill 
for tax purposes only in the US, arising from certain acquisitions. 
This has resulted in a restated adjusted tax rate of 18.9% for 
2014, versus the rate of 20.3% previously reported. This change 
more closely aligns the cash taxes the Group pays with the 
adjusted tax charge, and brings the way adjusted tax is 
calculated into line with other groups in the sector. 
The Group benefits from tax efficient internal financing 
structures. Certain structures, which currently have an annual 
value of approximately £7m to the Group’s profits after tax, will  
be affected by changes in UK tax legislation, which are due  
to be introduced from 1 January 2017 .
During 2015, the Group paid £30.7m (2014: £44.3m) of 
Corporation and similar taxes on profits, including approximately 
£23.4m (2014: £25.0m) of UK Corporation Tax. The reduction in 
Corporation Tax payments is largely due to a one-off reduction in 
US tax payments arising from the treatment of the Hanley Wood 
Exhibitions acquisition for US tax purposes. The small reduction 
in UK tax payments reflects the reduction in UK Corporation  
Tax rates.
ADJUSTING ITEMS
The following table summarises adjusting Items excluded from 
adjusted results. The total charge to operating profit for adjusting 
items was £129.1m (2014: £336.8m) with the largest element 
being amortisation of acquired intangible assets at £99.5m

  Intangible asset amortisation is in respect of acquired intangibles and

Redundancy and restructuring costs totalled £16.0m  
(2014: £25.4m). These related to costs incurred in non-recurring 
business restructuring, changes made to the operating model  
to align with the Group’s Growth Acceleration Plan strategy  
in Business Intelligence and Knowledge & Networking,  
and the integration of acquisitions in Academic Publishing.
There was a £13.9m charge from goodwill impairments  
in 2015, consisting of a £12.8m impairment of goodwill in a 
cash-generating unit of Knowledge & Networking and £1.1m 
in Business Intelligence. In 2014 goodwill impairments totalled 
£193.4m, which included £189.0m from Business Intelligence 
due to impairment to the carrying value of goodwill across the 
Consumer Information businesses (subsequently disposed of in 
2015) and Pharma & Healthcare business. 
56 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) calculated on the 
statutory profit for the year for equity Shareholders of £171.4m, 
resulted in an EPS of 26.4p, compared with the loss per share  
of 8.6p in 2014. 
The Group’s adjusted diluted EPS of 42.9p for 2015 was 
4.6% higher than in 2014 (2014: 41.0p as restated). This reflects 
the 11.4% increase in adjusted profit, partly offset by a 6.6% 
increase in the average number of shares due to the full year 
effect of a placement of 45.0m shares in November 2014. 
The calculation of adjusted diluted EPS in 2015 reflects the 
benefit of the amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes only 
in the US arising from certain acquisitions. To allow better 
comparison, the 2014 figure has been recalculated on a 
consistent basis to 2015. This shows a restated adjusted  
diluted EPS of 41.0p, where the 2014 adjusted diluted EPS  
was previously stated at 40.3p.
TRANSLATION IMPACT
The Group is particularly sensitive to movements in the US Dollar 
(USD) against Pounds Sterling (GBP), with the Euro the next most 
significant currency.
In 2015 the Group received approximately 55% (2014: 48%) 
of its revenues and incurred approximately 43% (2014: 39%) 
of its costs in USD or currencies pegged to USD. Each 1 cent 
movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa £4.4m 
(2014: £3.4m) impact on revenue, a circa £2.0m (2014: £1.5m) 
impact on adjusted operating profits and a circa 0.23p (2014: 
0.16p) impact on adjusted diluted EPS. 
In 2015 the Group received approximately 7% (2014: 8%) 
of its revenues and incurred approximately 6% (2014: 7%) of 
its costs in Euros. Each 1 cent movement in the Euro to GBP 
exchange rate has a circa £0.6m (2014: £0.7m) impact on revenue, 
a circa £0.2m (2014: £0.2m) impact on adjusted operating profit 
and a circa 0.02p (2014: 0.03p) impact on adjusted diluted EPS. 
The average and closing exchange rates for the two 
currencies are:
Average rate Closing rate
2015 2014 2015 2014
USD 1.53 1.65 1.48 1.56
EUR 1.38 1.24 1.36 1.28
For debt covenant testing purposes, both profit and net debt are 
translated using the average rate of exchange throughout the 
relevant period. 
The adjusted tax charge reconciles to cash taxes paid as follows:
2015
£m
2014

Tax charge on adjusted PBT per 
Consolidated Income Statement 60.2 58.5
Deferred taxes (13.2) (7.3)

Total corporate taxes paid 30.7 44.7
Taxes refunded from  
German authorities – (0.4)
Net income taxes paid per 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 30.7 44.3
The tax charge on adjusting items is now stated after the benefit 
of goodwill amortisation for tax purposes only in the US. A further 
£11.5m (2014: £11.7m) of current tax deductions were taken on 
the amortisation of intangible assets. These remain treated as 
an adjusting item and are included in the current tax deductions 
in respect of adjusting items noted above.
The Group’s total tax contribution (“TTC”), made up of all 
material taxes paid out of profits and other material taxes 
generated by Informa’s businesses, totalled £154.7m in 2015 
(2014: £168.1m). The UK element of the Group’s TTC was £79.9m 
(2014: £81.6m). The fall in worldwide TTC was largely due to the 
one-off reduction in US corporate tax payments arising from 
additional tax deductions attributable to the Hanley Wood 
acquisition. The small reduction in UK TTC reflects lower 
Corporation Tax rates in the UK and VAT refunds arising from 
investments in technology and systems in the UK, partly offset 
by higher employment taxes.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)
The Group’s net capital expenditure of £33.5m in 2015 included 
£18.9m of capital investment as part of the 2014–2017 Growth 
Acceleration Plan. 
Working capital inflows improved by £39.4m to £23.9m  
(2014: outflow of £15.5m). This was largely driven by the receipt  
of a delayed payment of £15m from a subscription agent to 
Academic Publishing. 
Acquisitions and disposals of £149.1m (2014: £372.8m) 
included £93.2m (2014: £14.0m) of spend on other intangible 
assets and investments and £68.8m (2014: £357 .4m) on the 
acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, offset by net 
proceeds from disposals of £12.9m.

PENSIONS
The Group’s financial obligations to its pension schemes remain 
relatively small compared with the size of the Group. Net pension 
liabilities at 31 December 2015 were £4.0m (2014: £10.1m) and 
the cash contributions paid towards reducing the scheme deficits 
were £0.5m in 2015. Contributions for the ongoing service will be 
£nil in 2016; both schemes are closed to the future accrual of 
benefits and there is no deficit funding requirement.
CASH FLOW
The level, consistency and sustainability of the Group’s cash flow 
is a key focus for Informa’s management, because it provides 
flexibility for future investment and indicates whether the business 
is achieving its required returns. 
The Group continues to generate strong cash flows and 
recorded an operating cash flow of £377 .7m in 2015. This 
strength is reflected in the cash conversion rate, expressed as a 
ratio of operating cash flow to adjusted operating profit, of 103% 
(2014: 97%). Together with reductions in taxation payments, this 
resulted in the Group generating over £300m of free cash flow 
for the first time.
The following table shows the adjusted operating profit and 
free cash flow reconciled to movements in net debt. Free cash 
flow is a key financial measure of how much cash the business 
generates from operations and is stated before cash flows arising

58 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com FUNDING
Funding, and specifically maintaining a robust and flexible 
financing framework to fund investment and acquisitions, is  
one of the six key disciplines of the Growth Acceleration Plan.
Funding discipline was enhanced in two important ways in 
2015. The Group issued USD 250m of private placement loan 
notes, with a maturity of seven years (USD 120m) and ten years 
(USD 130m) and an average interest rate of 4.0%. This financing 
funded the USD 110m of private placement loan notes that 
matured in December 2015. The Group also extended its 
five-year £900m revolving credit facility by a further year, meaning 
that it now matures in October 2020.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group had committed funding 
of £1,474.6m available, comprising a £900.0m revolving credit 
facility and £574.6m of private placement loan notes. The 
revolving credit facility was £359.1m drawn down at 31 December 
2015 (31 December 2014: £455.2m). 
The Group had £574.6m of private placement loan notes at 
31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: £462.2m) and these 
range in maturity from December 2017 to October 2025. 
The average maturity length of the loan notes is 5.5 years  
(2014: 4.3 years). 
The principal financial covenant ratios under the private 
placement and revolving credit facility stand at a maximum net 
debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum EBITDA interest cover 
of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2015 both 
financial covenants were comfortably achieved. The ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times (at 31 December 2014: 2.2 times) 
calculated as per the Group’s facility agreements, using average 
exchange rates and adjusted for a full year’s trading for 2015 
acquisitions. The ratio of EBITDA to net interest payable was 
14.9 times (at 31 December 2014: 14.4 times).

Net debt increased by £19.1m in 2015, primarily driven by the 
foreign exchange effect of the USD strengthening from 1.56 to 
1.48 over the year (£43.0m) and partly offset by the reduction in 
net debt arising from cash flows (£25.1m).
STRATEGIC  
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
59 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com ACQUISITION STRATEGY
Another key discipline of the Growth Acceleration Plan is the Group’s Acquisition strategy: a targeted and disciplined approach  
to build scale and capability across priority industry verticals and geographic markets. 
Acquisitions are assessed on a case-by-case basis against a broad set of financial and strategic criteria. For bolt-on acquisitions, 
these have to meet strict acquisition criteria. These include delivering returns in excess of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
in the first full year and being earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership. However for certain acquisitions, the Group will take 
a longer-term view to allow time for full integration of the acquired business, coupled with additional investment to maximise the 
long-term returns generated. 
In 2015 there was total cash spend of £162.0m (2014: £371.4m) on the acquisition of subsidiaries and other intangible assets.  
This focused on Academic Publishing and Global Exhibitions. Principal acquisitions and asset intangible acquisitions are shown 
in the table below:

Total net cash paid on acquisition of subsidiaries and other intangible asset acquisitions 162.0 371.4
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Continually reassessing the mix and focus of the Group is an additional discipline within the Growth Acceleration Plan. This enables 
Informa to ensure it is allocating capital to the right areas, where the potential to improve returns are greatest. 
In 2015 this led to the disposal of the Consumer Information businesses and in Europe the disposal of the conference businesses 
in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Details of all disposals are provided in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The total profit on disposal of subsidiaries and operations was £9.1m and net cash proceeds were £12.9m. 
The combination of the Portfolio Management strategy, and the drive to improve the operational performance of the business 
inherent in the Growth Acceleration Plan, results in an improved 2015 Group Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) of 9.2% 
(2014: 8.8%).
DIVIDEND
As outlined in the Group Chief Executive’s Review, there will be a 4.1% increase in the Dividend Per Share for 2015. The proposed  
final dividend is 13.55p per share (2014: 12.90p per share) representing a 5.0% increase. Subject to Shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”), the final dividend will be paid on 26 May 2016 to Ordinary Shareholders registered as at the close of  
business on 29 April 2016. This will result in total dividends for the year of 20.1p per share (2014: 19.3p per share). The improved 
earnings performance means the dividend cover on an adjusted earnings basis has remained consistent at 2.1 times total earnings 
(2014: 2.1 times).
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS 
A description and consideration of the critical accounting judgements made in preparing these financial statements is set out in 
Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

64 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com the Group. The Board and Senior Management firmly 
believe that as a knowledge and information business, 
Informa succeeds when its people are supported, 
motivated, and given freedom to innovate. 
Informa’s focus is on creating a culture where Colleagues 
have the opportunity to collaborate and develop their skills 
whilst contributing to the Company. This produces a 
creative and discursive working environment, which helps 
develop the specialist products and services that our 
customers expect. 
The best exponents of Informa’s culture and values are 
its colleagues. This Annual Report contains accounts 
from individuals in each Division talking about their 
experience in the Company, as well as members of the 
Informa Graduate Fellowship Scheme. What stands out 
for me is how these colleagues have been able to develop 
their career at Informa, the pride they take in their roles 
and how they enjoy and are stimulated by their work and 
by the dynamism of the Group.
ROLE AS CHAIRMAN
As Chairman, I work very closely with the Group Chief 
Executive. Stephen and I have worked together for over 
five years, as Executive and Non-Executive colleagues. 
We have formal meetings to plan agendas and Board 
meetings. Given the speed and diversity of the markets in 
which Informa operates, this is supplemented by regular 
informal discussions and exchanges. 
I ensure that there is sufficient time at each meeting to 
discuss all items and that each Director has an opportunity 
to contribute and actively engages in our deliberations. In 
addition to the usual meetings, we hold a strategy meeting 
each September at which strategic issues and Divisional 
and Group three-year plans are discussed in depth with 
our Senior Executives. Nearly all Board meetings involve 
a team from Informa presenting on a key topical area. 
One Board meeting per year is held outside the UK, and 
before each Board meeting Board Members have the 
opportunity to meet the Executive Team for dinner to 
discuss a wider range of issues. The Board also has a 
good level of interaction with the wider top leadership 
group within Informa.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
The Board is committed to its standards of governance 
and to the principles of corporate governance contained in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) published 
in September 2014. I am pleased to confirm that Informa 
complied with all the principles contained within the Code. 
Our compliance statement on page 66 contains more 
information on Informa’s compliance with the Code and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (”FCA”).
DEREK MAPP 
CHAIRMAN
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Informa’s 
2015 Governance Report to Shareholders. As the previous 
pages of the report illustrate, it was another year of 
improved performance and strategic progress, during 
which the Board continued to oversee the implementation 
of the Group’s strategy whilst discharging its other defined 
governance and supervisory responsibilities.
LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
One of the Board’s key priorities is to challenge, motivate 
and support Informa’s Executive Management Team and 
its Divisions, and the Nomination Committee continues to 
focus on ensuring the Board has the range and balance of 
skills, knowledge, independence, experience and diversity 
to discharge this responsibility effectively. 
The Board underwent a number of changes in 2015 that 
have strengthened and broadened its skillset. During 2015 
the Nomination Committee identified the need for two new 
Non-Executive Directors, one to replace Geoff Cooper and 
one with extensive US market experience, to reflect and 
support the Group’s continuing focus and growth in the region. 
Geoff Cooper stepped down as a Non-Executive Director  
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 30 March 
2015 and I would like to thank him for his contribution to 
the Board and the Committee. Gareth Bullock acted as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee from 30 March 
2015 until 1 September 2015 when we welcomed Stephen 
Davidson and David Flaschen to the Board as independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Stephen was appointed as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 1 September 
2015 and David joined the Audit Committee on 1 October 
2015. Both will stand for election at our AGM on 19 May 2016.
After serving 10 years as a Non-Executive Director, 
John Davis will step down from the Board at May’s AGM. 
I would like to thank John for his extensive contribution, 
service and dedication to the Board over the last decade.

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT AND RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Informa is committed to maintaining good communications  
with investors. It has a full-time Director of Investor Relations, 
Corporate Communications and Brand and engages with investors 
on a regular and ad hoc basis in a variety of ways and formats.
Financial information was reported on a quarterly basis in 2015. 
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director give 
presentations on the half-yearly and full year results in face-to-face 
group meetings with institutional investors, analysts and the media, 
which are also accessible via webcast on www.informa.com. 
After the release of the trading updates, which replaced the 
Interim Management Statements from 2015 onwards, the 
Company holds conference calls with institutional investors, 
analysts and the media.
In addition to these group presentations, meetings are held with 
individual institutional Shareholders after the announcement of 
the Group’s half-yearly and full year results. These meetings also 
take place outside of the post-results period, with the Group 
undertaking regular investor roadshows in different geographies 
and responding to individual ad hoc requests for discussions. 
They typically cover issues related to the Group’s performance, 
including strategy, governance, risks and opportunities. In 2015, 
investor meetings were held in London, Edinburgh, New York, 
Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, 
Toronto, Paris, Barcelona and Frankfurt.
The Group hosts an annual Investor Day, when it focuses on 
a particular Division, topic or theme, inviting investors and 
analysts to a series of detailed presentations and meetings, 
often giving them the opportunity to meet members of the 
wider management team. The 2015 Investor Day was held in 
Washington DC, to coincide with one of the Group’s major US 
Exhibitions, Greenbuild. It included a tour of the show, alongside 
presentations from both the Executive Management Team and 
members of the Senior Management Teams from the Academic 
Publishing and Global Exhibitions Divisions.
The Director of Investor Relations, Corporate Communications 
and Brand provides the Board with a monthly report on investor 
activity, including feedback from analysts and institutional investors, 
the latest analyst reports on the Group, movements in the share 
register and related market activity. Following meetings held 
with Shareholders after the half-yearly and full year results 
announcements, the Board is provided with detailed feedback 
from the Executive Directors, the Director of Investor Relations, 
Corporate Communications and Brand, the Group’s stockbrokers 
and its communications advisers on investor perceptions.
Derek Mapp as Chairman and Gareth Bullock as Senior 
Independent Director also provide the Board with feedback 
on any issues raised with them by Shareholders.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Informa’s Board is accountable to the Group’s Shareholders 
for its standards of governance, and is committed to the 
principles of corporate governance contained in the Code of 
the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) published in September 
2014 which can be viewed online at www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/
Publications/Corporate-Governance/UK-Corporate-Governance-
Code-2014.pdf.
The Board is pleased to report that Informa complied with the 
provisions of the Code during 2015. 
This report, along with reports from the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Report explain 
how Informa applied the principles of good governance set  
out in the Code.
2015 was the Group’s first year of compliance with the 
amendments introduced to the Code in September 2014. This 
included changes around risk management, internal controls and 
the reporting of the ongoing viability of the business, specifically: 
• Providing a robust risk assessment – the Code requires  
the Directors to confirm that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company,  
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. This is included 
within the principal risk section of the Strategic Report on 
pages 22 to 25.
• Providing a long-term viability statement – the Code requires 
the Directors to provide an annual statement on the long-term 
viability of the business. This is included within the Strategic 
report on page 21.
In accordance with the Code, the Audit Committee has also 
provided assurance to the Board that the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable. All the matters that have been brought to the 
attention of the Board during the year have been reflected  
in the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

In 2016, the Board will continue to oversee the delivery of the 
Growth Acceleration Plan as it enters its third year, and the 
performance of Informa’s Divisions and the Group as a whole,  
as well as reviewing, discussing and approving matters including:
• Group strategy;
• the Growth Acceleration Plan;
• Group acquisitions and disposals;
• the Group’s full year and half-yearly results, divisional trading 
and Annual Report and Financial Statements;
• Group culture and values;
• the Group’s risk profile, principal risks, risk management and 
internal control systems; and
• succession planning of the Board, its Committees and 
Senior Managers.
DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE
The Board includes independent Non-Executive Directors who 
constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. 
They bring strong, independent judgement, knowledge and 
experience to the Board’s deliberations and have been selected 
for their calibre and number to ensure their views carry significant 
weight in the Board’s decision-making process. The Board 
considers all of its Non-Executive Directors to be independent  
in character and judgement.
There is an agreed procedure in place for the Directors to obtain 
independent professional advice, at the Group’s expense, should 
they consider it necessary to carry out their responsibilities. The 
Directors’ contracts are available for inspection at the registered 
office during normal business hours and will be available for 
inspection at the AGM.
INFORMATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On appointment, the Directors receive a formal induction to the 
Group and its position in the broader Knowledge and Information 
Economy. This is designed to enable them to understand the 
Divisions and the markets they operate in, so they can be 
effective Board Members from the outset. This includes receiving 
information about the Group, the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and 
Membership of the principal Board Committees, the Group’s 
corporate governance policies and procedures and the latest 
financial information about the Group. This is supplemented 
by introductory meetings with key divisional and Group level 
Senior Executives who provide detailed information about the 
Company, the relevant markets, the Divisions and their trading. 
On appointment and from time to time, Directors are reminded 
of their legal and other duties and obligations as a Director of 
a listed company. The Chairman reviews the Directors’ training 
and development needs.
On joining the Board, Stephen Davidson and David Flaschen 
received detailed information about the Group and attended 
presentations from each member of the Executive 
Management Team and the Divisional Leadership Teams. 
In addition, they were given the opportunity to meet with 
the external and internal auditors and to visit the Group’s 
Divisional offices.
The Directors are regularly updated on the Group’s business 
and the environment in which it operates by written briefings 
and by meetings with Senior Executives, who are invited to 
attend and present at Board meetings from time to time. They 
are also updated on any changes to the legal and governance 
requirements of the Group and those which affect their duties  
as Directors. They are able to obtain training, at the Group’s 
expense, to ensure that they are kept up to date on relevant  
new legislation and changing commercial risks.
Regular reports and papers are circulated to the Directors in a 
timely manner in preparation for Board and Committee meetings. 
These papers are supplemented by any information specifically 
requested by the Directors.
Non-Executive Directors receive management reports prior to 
each Board meeting from the Group Chief Executive and the 
Group Finance Director which enable them to scrutinise the 
Group’s and management’s performance.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE BOARD  
AND ITS COMMITTEES
Informa’s Directors are made aware from their appointments  
that their performance will be subject to evaluation. 
The Board has a formal and rigorous process for evaluating the 
performance of its principal Committees and individual Directors 
on an annual basis. This process is led by the Chairman. The 
Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
meet at least annually to appraise the Chairman’s performance.
A full and extensive external Board evaluation was carried out  
at the end of 2014 following significant changes to the Board 
composition during that year. This review was carried out by 
Independent Board Review, a division of Independent Audit 
Limited. Independent Audit Limited has no other connection  
with the Company. The evaluation was fully independent and 
concluded that overall, the Board was making clear progress  
and becoming increasingly effective following its restructure. 
Certain key areas were identified as having scope for further 
development, although it was acknowledged that most of  
these areas had already been identified by Informa for further 
consideration. The Board monitored the progress of these areas 
during 2015. The next external Board evaluation will be carried 
out within two years, in compliance with the Code.
STRATEGIC  
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
71 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is responsible for Informa’s system of internal  
controls and reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. It can only provide reasonable rather than 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, a 
concept that recognises that the cost of control procedures 
should not exceed its expected benefits.
Responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group 
rests with the Group Chief Executive, supported by the 
Executive Management Team (“EMT”). The EMT includes the 
CEO of each of the four Divisions and met weekly by call and 
monthly in person in 2015 to consider the implementation of 
Group strategies, plans and policies, to monitor operational 
and financial performance and to manage risks. Each Division 
is given operational autonomy, as far as possible, within an 
internal control framework. The Strategic Report on pages 
2 to 60 details the activities of the Operating Divisions.
The Board has a risk management process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. 
This process was strengthened and enhanced in 2015 and was 
in place throughout the year, up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements, and is in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Informa has a number of internal control and risk management 
systems and procedures around financial reporting, including:
• Business planning – all Operating Divisions produce and agree 
an annual business plan against which the performance of the 
business is regularly monitored. This function and process 
strengthened in 2015.
• Financial analysis – each Division’s operating profitability and 
capital expenditure are closely monitored. Management 
incentives are tied to financial results. These results include 
explanations of variance between forecast and budgeted 
performance, and are reviewed in detail by Executive 
Management on a monthly basis. Key financial information 
is regularly reported to the Board.
• Group Authority Framework – the framework provides clear 
guidelines on approval limits for capital and operating 
expenditure and other key business decisions for all Divisions.
• Risk assessment – risk assessment is embedded into the 
operations of the Group and is reported upon to the EMT, Risk 
Committee, Audit Committee and the Board. The Risk 
Management Framework, governance and reporting structures 
are explained in the risk report on pages 20 to 25. 
RE-ELECTION
The Articles of Association (“the Articles”) provide for all Directors 
to be subject to annual re-election at the AGM. The performance 
evaluation of the Board concluded that each Director remains 
effective and committed to their role. In addition, as a result  
of the evaluation, the Board is satisfied that each Non-Executive 
Director remains independent. All Directors will stand for 
re-election at the 2016 AGM except for Stephen Davidson and 
David Flaschen, who will stand for election for the first time, and 
John Davis, who will step down as Non-Executive Director after 
serving 10 years on the Board.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
The Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors, to the 
extent permitted by English law and the Articles, in respect of 
any liability arising out of, or in connection with, the execution 
of their powers, duties and responsibilities. This relates to their 
roles as Directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or as 
a Trustee of an occupational pension scheme for employees of 
the Company. The indemnity would not provide coverage where 
the Director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
Information on appointments to the Board in 2015 can be found 
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 74 and 75. The 
Company has purchased and maintains Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance cover against certain legal liabilities and costs for 
claims in connection with any act or omission by its Directors  
and officers in the execution of their duties.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Articles include provisions covering Directors’ conflicts of 
interest. They allow the Board to authorise any matter that would 
otherwise involve a Director breaching his or her duty to avoid 
conflicts of interest. The Company has procedures in place to 
deal with a situation where a Director has a conflict of interest. 
As part of this process, the Board will endeavour to:
• consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts;
• consider the conflict situation in conjunction with the Articles;
• keep records and Board minutes on authorisations granted 
by Directors and the scope of any approvals given; and 
• regularly review conflict authorisations.
In 2015, none of the Directors had any unauthorised conflicts of 
interests. The Board acknowledges that Dr Brendan O’Neill is a 
Non-Executive Director of Willis Towers Watson Inc. and Willis 
Towers Watson is an adviser to the Remuneration Committee. 
It also acknowledges that Stephen A. Carter’s brother is Vice 
Chairman of KPMG LLP , the Company’s internal auditors, and 
Stephen Davidson is Deputy Chairman of Jaywing. Jaywing is a 
consultancy firm involved in the Company’s Growth Acceleration 
Plan projects taking place within the Company’s Business 
Intelligence Division. This potential conflict was in place prior to 
Stephen Davidson’s appointment to the Board on 1 September 
2015 and was noted by the Board.
GOVERNANCE
LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS (CONTINUED)
72 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls, risk management and the Group’s high  
level internal control arrangements. The Audit Committee has 
been charged by the Board with oversight of the above controls 
and has considered the following factors in determining the 
overall effectiveness of the Group’s risks and associated  
control environment:
• The Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Audit 
Committee, reports on the effectiveness of risk management, 
governance and compliance activity within the Group. Through 
this process the Group has identified nine principal risks, which 
are discussed on pages 22 to 25. 
• The Audit Committee has approved a schedule of work to  
be undertaken by the Group’s nominated external auditor 
during the period and receives reports on any issues identified 
in the course of its work, including internal control reports 
on control weaknesses. Any identified issues are reported 
to the Audit Committee and are tracked until conclusion. 
• The Audit Committee has approved a schedule of work to  
be undertaken by the Group’s Internal Audit Team during the 
period. It receives reports on any issues identified around 
the Group’s business processes and control activities over 
the Group’s key risk areas, including following up on the 
implementation of management action plans to address any 
identified control weaknesses, and reporting any overdue 
actions to the Audit Committee.
KPMG LLP is engaged to provide the Group with Internal Audit 
services and acts as Head of Internal Audit. 
Separate reports from the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees can be found on pages 74 to 90.

* John Davis will step down from the Board at the AGM on 19 May 2016. BOARD AND COLLEAGUE DIVERSITY
Informa believes that embracing diversity in its many forms 
creates competitive advantage. Informa is a people-led 
knowledge business: its differentiation and performance are a 
direct result of recruiting and retaining exceptional individuals.
The Group’s approach to diversity is broad and deep. It includes 
but is not limited to gender, ethnicity, professional experience, 
educational background, nationality and age.
The Group has also established a Diversity and Inclusion working 
group. The working group is the direct initiative of a cross-
Company team and was created under the Group Chief 
Executive’s sponsorship. It reports to the Director of Talent & 
Transformation, and has regular discussions with the Chief 
Executive and the Divisional Management teams to develop 
practical approaches to supporting diversity that challenge 
accepted wisdoms, and to stimulate new approaches to 
recruitment and career development.
In 2016 there will be a heightened focus on relevant data 
gathering and analysis, the introduction of supportive Group-
wide recruitment practices, training for Senior Managers, 
increased communication on the importance of inclusion 
and specific mentoring activities to help groups of colleagues 
network with each other, helping the Company help everyone 
fulfil their potential.
A breakdown of Informa’s global workforce can be found in 
the Sustainability Report on page 29. In terms of diversity by 
gender within the Group in 2015, 59% of all colleagues, 39% 
of our group of around 130 leaders and future leaders, and 20% 
of Non-Executive Directors were female. Furthermore, nearly 
60% of those recruited to the Group during the year were 
female and over 70% of 2015 new joiners were born after 1980.
The Group’s approach to people and diversity is equally reflected 
at Board level. The Board’s composition and size are kept under 
constant review, to ensure that the independent Non-Executive 
Directors have an appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
diversity and knowledge of the Group and the market it operates 
in, and that the Board has the right combination of talent.
ACTION PLAN FOR 2016
• Continue to review succession planning for the Board 
and for key roles Group-wide
• Identify future talent pipeline and support greater diversity 
amongst Senior Managers and the broader workforce  
as well as inclusion activities
• Develop initiatives for Directors
• Provide Group-wide exposure for Non-Executive Directors

CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE DURING THE YEAR
The Committee met three times in 2015 to address changes to 
Board and Committee composition. Following the resignation of 
Geoff Cooper as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, the Company worked with search 
agency Odgers Berndtson to find a replacement Non-Executive 
Director. The Committee also worked with Russell Reynolds 
Associates to conduct a search for a US-based Director. On  
1 September 2015, Stephen Davidson and David Flaschen were 
appointed to the Board. Stephen Davidson was also appointed 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on this date, and 
David Flaschen became a Member of the Audit Committee 
on 1 October 2015. The Committee also discussed and 
appointed Gareth Bullock to act as the interim Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee between 30 March and 
1 September 2015. He stepped down as a Member of the 
Remuneration Committee on 10 November 2015.
John Davis has now served more than nine years on the Board, 
having been elected at the 2006 AGM. While he was re-elected 
as a Director at the 2015 AGM, he will stand down from the 
Board at the 2016 AGM. He also stood down from the 
Nomination Committee with effect from 31 December 2014, 
with Dr Brendan O’Neill joining the Committee with effect from 
1 January 2015.
The Committee also reviewed its terms of reference and 
discussed the composition and the mix of skills, knowledge, 
independence, experience and diversity of the Board. It also 
reviewed the ability of the Non-Executive Directors to devote 
such time as is necessary to properly perform their duties 
and the Committee was satisifed that the existing and newly 
appointed Non-Executive Directors were able to do so.
EXECUTIVE AND NON-EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR SEARCHES
The Committee uses the services of specialist Executive search 
consultants to seek suitable external candidates for appointment 
to the Board and its Committees. The Committee identifies the 
specific experience and skills that the Company is looking for and 
works with those search consultants to identify candidates who 
match those criteria. External candidates, together with any 
internal candidates, are interviewed by the Committee and the 
successful candidate is proposed by the Committee to the Board 
for approval. During the year the Committee was supported by 
Odgers Berndtson and Russell Reynolds Associates in the 
search for two Non-Executive Directors. Both firms are entirely 
independent of the Company.

75 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com DEAR SHAREHOLDER
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. One of the 
core requirements of the Code is for the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements to provide a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal control policies, and procedures for the 
identification, assessment and reporting of risk and that 
these remain effective. The Audit Committee devotes 
significant time to each of these matters.
This Committee complies with the revised Code issued in 
September 2014. The Committee’s terms of reference were 
revised in February 2015 to take account of the changes 
and reviewed and re-adopted in December 2015. 
The Audit Committee’s agenda for 2015 included the usual 
review of our financial results and controls, our business 
operations and the management of risk. The Board 
considers that the Committee’s Members have broad 
commercial knowledge and a suitable mix of business 
and financial experience. The experience of John Davis, 
Cindy Rose, Gareth Bullock and myself was supplemented 
in 2015 by the addition of David Flaschen to the Committee. 
His broad experience is detailed on page 63.

COMMITTEE COMPOSITION
The Committee’s Membership is set out above. It met three times 
during 2015. David Flaschen attended the one meeting that was 
held following his appointment to the Board and the end of the 
year. It meets as appropriate with the Executive Directors and 
management, as well as privately with external and internal 
auditors. During the year the Committee received sufficient, 
reliable and timely information from the Senior Managers to 
enable it to fulfil its duties.
GOVERNANCE
The Committee’s Chairman, Dr Brendan O’Neill, is a qualified 
Management Accountant and has extensive experience of Audit 
Committee procedures. John Davis is a qualified Chartered 
Accountant and until November 2010 was the Chief Financial 
Officer of Yell Group plc (renamed Hibu plc in July 2012).
The meetings of the Committee are structured to investigate  
key accounting, audit and risk issues relevant to the Group. The 
varied experience of its Members assists in providing a robust 
environment in which these issues are discussed and challenged. 
The Group Finance Director, Director of Risk and Compliance, 
Head of Internal Audit and Head of Group Tax attend all or part of 
proceedings to provide information to, and be questioned by, the 
Committee. The composition of the Committee was reviewed 
during the year and the Board and Committee are satisfied that 
it has the expertise and resource to fulfil its responsibilities 
effectively, including those relating to risk and control.
DUTIES
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website. The Committee’s terms of reference allow 
it to obtain independent external advice at the Company’s 
expense. No such advice was obtained during 2015.
The Committee is responsible for:
• reviewing the content of the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements and advising the Board on whether, taken as a 
whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy;
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s 
performance;
• monitoring the effectiveness of the external audit process 
and evaluating the external auditor;
• making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and remuneration of the 
external auditor;
• ensuring that an appropriate relationship between the Group 
and the external auditor is maintained, including setting policy 
for and reviewing non-audit related services and fees; 
• annually reviewing the Group’s system of internal controls  
and the process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group. These responsibilities  
are principally carried out through the Risk Committee whose 
activities are overseen by the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
on behalf of the Board;

a view that the external loan was not fully recoverable. 
Performance of the PI business is reviewed by Informa 
management on a quarterly basis and the Committee 
continues to monitor the receivable closely.
• Accounting for acquisitions:
The Committee reviews the judgements involved in identifying 
and valuing the consideration and the assets acquired in a 
business combination or in the acquisition of businesses’ trade 
and assets. During the year, there were three major business 
combinations: WS Maney & Son Limited, Ashgate Publishing 
Ltd and Inc. and Boston Biotech Conference LLC. The total 
consideration for each of these acquisitions was between 
£10m and £50m, therefore intangible assets were valued 
internally. The Committee reviewed the valuation methodology 
and challenged management on its assumptions supporting 
the fair value of intangible and net assets acquired for each 
significant acquisition in the year. The Committee concluded 
that the valuation basis appeared reasonable.
Management completed the acquisition of Hanley Wood 
Exhibitions in November 2014 but, given the proximity of the 
acquisition to the year end, at the 2014 year end it provisionally 
recognised all the excess of consideration over net assets 
acquired as goodwill. The purchase price adjustment and 
associated intangible asset valuation was completed in 2015. 
The Committee reviewed the judgements taken by management 
and concluded that the 2014 Balance Sheet has been 
appropriately restated to reflect the finalised valuations.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Committee is also responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external 
audit. The policy assigns oversight responsibility for monitoring 
the independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and 
regulatory requirements to the Committee, and day-to-day 
responsibility to the Group Finance Director. It states that the 
external auditor is jointly responsible to the Board and the 
Committee and that the Committee is the primary contact. The 
policy also sets out the categories of non-audit services which 
the external auditor will and will not be allowed to provide to the 
Group, subject to de minimis levels.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditor, the Committee reviewed:
• the external auditor’s plan for the current year, noting the role  
of the senior statutory audit partner, who signs the audit report 
and who, in accordance with professional rules, has not held 
office for more than five years, and any changes in the key 
audit staff;
• the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit 
relationship;
• a report from the external auditor describing its arrangements 
to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; and
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND SIGNIFICANT 
JUDGEMENT AREAS
In evaluating the appropriateness of the financial statements, the 
Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have 
been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews accounting 
papers prepared by management which provide details on the 
main financial reporting judgements. The Committee also reviews 
reports by the external auditor on the full year and half-yearly 
results which highlight any issues with respect to the work 
undertaken on the audit. During the year end process, the 
Committee concentrated on the following significant 
judgement areas:
• Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets: 
The Committee considered whether the carrying value of 
goodwill and intangible assets held by the Group should be 
impaired. The value of goodwill and intangible assets is highly 
material in the context of the Group’s Balance Sheet and could 
be impacted by fluctuations in market and economic 
conditions. The Committee focused on the significant 
management judgements and assumptions underlying 
management’s impairment analysis for goodwill and 
intangibles. The Committee challenged key assumptions  
such as discount rates and terminal growth rates applied, 
comparing rates to industry peers and historical performance. 
The Committee took assurance on discount rates and terminal 
values through management’s use of an independent valuation 
expert, who provided risk adjusted discount rates specific to 
each cash generating unit. It also challenged management 
growth forecasts through analytical review and assessment  
of the ability to achieve these forecasts. Having taken into 
account all of the above factors, the Committee concluded that 
the key assumptions and judgements made by management 
in its impairment analysis appeared reasonable and 
appropriate and that the carrying value of the goodwill 
and intangible assets was fairly stated.
• Recoverability of long-term receivables:
The Committee considered whether the long-term receivable 
held by the Group was fully recoverable. The Group has a 
long-term external loan provided to the acquirer of the Informa 
Corporate Training (“PI”) business in 2013. The loan is 
repayable in 2020. The recoverability of the capital and interest 
payments is dependent on the financial success of the 
acquirer in managing the PI business over the coming years. 
The Committee considered various factors when assessing 
management’s judgement. The PI business is backed by a 
large private equity business. Monitoring of the performance of 
the PI business shows that it continued to perform reasonably 
in 2015. The current estimated fair value of the PI business was 
calculated by applying industry appropriate multiples to 
EBITDA consistent with current market valuation assumptions. 
This fair value calculated was then compared to the first lien 
borrowings of the PI business and the Informa loan fair value at 
31 December 2015. Under these scenarios there is an excess 
in value, and the Committee was content that this supported

Non-audit services, other than audit-related services, provided  
by the external auditor during 2015 related mainly to consulting 
for the Knowledge & Networking and Academic Publishing 
Divisions. These services were approved in accordance  
with policy.

• the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor, in addition to its approval of the provision 
of non-audit services by the external auditor that exceed 
the pre-approval threshold.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the 
Committee reviewed:
• the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity;
• the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 
and any variations from the plan; 
• the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor in its 
handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
• the content of the external auditor’s reporting on internal 
control.
In accordance with best practice, once a year management 
reviews the performance of external audit to assess the delivery 
of the external audit service and identify areas for improvement. 
Deloitte’s performance is assessed as to whether it exceeds, 
meets or was below expectations for a variety of factors. An 
assessment questionnaire is completed by key stakeholders  
at both Group and Divisional levels across key geographic 
locations. The results of this assessment process are reviewed 
by the Committee.
Following this process, the Committee has recommended to  
the Board that Deloitte LLP is reappointed as the Group’s 
external auditor at the 2016 AGM. Deloitte LLP has been the 
Group’s external auditor since 2004 when the last external audit 
tender was carried out. The Committee considers that the 
relationship with the external auditor is working well and remains 
satisfied with its effectiveness. In 2015 William Touche replaced 
Anthony Morris as the senior statutory audit partner. There are  
no contractual obligations restricting the Group’s choice of 
external auditor. The Committee has reviewed the requirements 
of the Code and the non-binding suggested transitional 
arrangements in the FRC guidance relating to the new provision 
for FTSE 350 companies to put the external audit contract out  
to tender at least every 10 years. In compliance with the 
provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014,  
the Committee has concluded that its current intention is to 
conduct a re-tender process in 2016, for appointment for the 
2017 financial year, with a decision to be taken in the middle  
of the year.
The Group has in place a policy for the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor. This policy ensures the firm’s 
services may only be provided where auditor objectivity and 
independence may be safeguarded and where fees payable 
either for assigned work or in any year overall do not exceed the 
amount of fees payable for its audit work, except in exceptional 
circumstances. The Committee considers that certain non-audit 
services should be provided by the external auditor, because its

REMUNERATION REPORT
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
present the Remuneration Report for 2015. This is my first 
report as Chairman of Informa’s Remuneration Committee 
having taken on the role on 1 September 2015. I would like 
to thank my predecessors, Gareth Bullock and Geoff 
Cooper, for their contributions during 2015.
SUMMARY OF 2015
This year Informa has delivered improved operational 
performance, and made good progress in the 
implementation of the Growth Acceleration Plan, including 
on its Portfolio Management and Acquisition strategies 
summarised previously in this report.
The highlights are:
• increase in Group revenue by 6.6% to £1,212.2m;
• increase in adjusted operating profit by 9.5% to £365.6m;
• higher adjusted EPS by 4.6% to 42.9p; and
• increase in total Dividend Per Share by 4.1% to 20.1p, and 
an increase in the minimum dividend commitment from 
2% to 4% for 2016/17.
In light of the above and following a solid trading 
performance in the year, the 2015 Short-Term Incentive 
Plan (“STIP”) incentive outcome for Executive Directors 
was just above the targeted level and the 2013 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) was above the median as illustrated 
in the table below.
Further details are contained in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (“the Report”) on pages 82 to 90. The Report 
was approved at the 2015 AGM with over 99% of the votes 
cast in favour and we will put this year’s report to 
Shareholders for an advisory vote at the 2016 AGM.
The Remuneration Policy (“the Policy”) was approved 
at the 2015 AGM with over 98% of the votes cast in favour. 
We will not be asking Shareholders to approve the Policy at 
the 2016 AGM in accordance with the Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Policy can be 
viewed in full on our website at www.informa.com/
investors/remunerationpolicy.pdf.
LOOKING FORWARD TO 2016 AND BEYOND
Having taken various factors into consideration, including 
the average pay increase of Informa colleagues, the Group 
Chief Executive will receive a 1.0% basic pay increase in 
2016. The Group Finance Director, Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors will receive a 1.5% increase in his basic 
pay and their fees in 2016. 
To further strengthen the link to strategy under the current 
Policy, we are introducing organic revenue growth as an 
additional STIP measure for 2016, alongside EPS.

For Senior Management and Informa colleagues more broadly, we started to re-design some of the Divisional incentives 
in 2015, as the Executive Directors’ performance metrics were used more broadly. I am pleased to also report steady 
progress in the uptake of our employee share ownership scheme, ShareMatch, with over 16% of eligible employees 
participating. The aim is to have greater consistency of incentives across the Group and increase equity ownership  
among Informa’s colleagues, so they can participate in the Company’s continued success. 
As the Group’s shape and focus evolve, we will continue to review the incentive plans to maintain a strong link between 
pay and performance. In that context, we will review the Policy this year. If any changes to the Policy are proposed, 
we will engage with Executives and Shareholders to ensure appropriate dialogue.

 Geoff Cooper stepped down from the Board and the Remuneration Committee on 30 March 2015.
The Company Chairman, Derek Mapp, usually attends the meetings by invitation only but is not present when matters relating to his 
own remuneration are discussed. The Committee met six times during 2015 and there was full attendance at each meeting. Gareth 
Bullock attended three meetings in 2015 prior to stepping down as a Member of the Committee. Geoff Cooper attended one meeting  
in 2015 prior to stepping down from the Board and as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 30 March 2015. None of the Members 
who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest (other than as a Shareholder of the Company) or conflicts 
of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals; no Executive Director 
played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration. The Company Secretary and the Director of Talent & Transformation 
also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”) was appointed by the Committee as its remuneration adviser in 2010 following a formal tender process, 
and continued to provide advice during the year. The Committee has satisfied itself that WTW’s advice is independent and objective, 
taking into account the fact that WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and follows its voluntary code of conduct. 
WTW does not provide any other material services to the Group. Dr Brendan O’Neill is a member of the WTW board and does not 
and has never taken part in any discussions on the selection of advisers or their contract. Fees paid to WTW in respect of services 
during the financial year ended 31 December 2015 amount to £101,861 and are primarily related to attendance at Committee 
meetings, incentive plan performance monitoring, Shareholder consultation and AGM support, and incentive plan design. The  
Committee has not requested advice from any other external firms apart from WTW during the year ended 31 December 2015.

Performance will be measured over three consecutive financial years commencing 1 January 2015 and are subject to the following 
equally weighted performance conditions:
Performance conditions and the associated weighting
TSR relative to FTSE Comparator Group 
in the FTSE 51–150 EPS CAGR
Stephen A. Carter 50% 50%
Gareth Wright 50% 50%
TSR will be measured relative to the performance of the comparator group of companies (FTSE 5–150) at the end of the performance 
period. If Informa ranks at median, 20% of the award subject to this measure will vest. This increases on a straight line basis to full 
vesting for ranking at or above the 80th percentile. A ranking below median will result in the relevant part of the award lapsing.
In addition to the TSR measure, the Committee introduced an EPS compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) measure for the 2015 
LTIP awards, replacing the individual strategic measures applied in 2014. 
In setting the targets, the Committee took into account the internal and external projections for the EPS CAGR at the time of grant. 
Threshold performance (2%) would result in the vesting of 20% of the EPS CAGR award; on target performance (4%) would result 
in 50% of the EPS award vesting; and at the maximum (6% or above), 100% of the EPS award would vest. 
The Committee will disclose details of its assessment of performance following the conclusion of the performance period.

The Company launched ShareMatch in 2014, a global Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) (tax qualifying in the UK), under which eligible employees 
can invest up to the limit of £1,800 per annum out of net salary (gross salary in the UK) in the Company’s shares through monthly 
contributions or a one-off lump sum. The scheme includes a matching element, whereby for every two shares purchased, the Company 
gives members one matching share subject to a holding period of three years.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIRECTORS’ PAY POLICY IN 2016
In 2016 the base pay of the Group Chief Executive was increased by 1% with effect from 1 January. The base pay of the Group 
Finance Director and the fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors were increased by 1.5%. In determining those 
pay rises, the pay rises for employees (averaging 1.8%) and other factors were taken into consideration.
For 2016 the Committee has introduced organic revenue growth (“ORG”) as a second performance measure for the annual bonus. Both 
Executive Directors may earn a maximum bonus equivalent to 150% of base salary, with the maximum award for EPS performance 
being 120% of base salary and the maximum award for ORG being 30%. Performance below 95% of the EPS target will result in no 
EPS-related bonus. On target performance will result in a bonus equivalent to 90% of salary. A below threshold performance for ORG 
will result in no ORG-related bonus. An on target performance will result in a 10% ORG-related bonus. 
The 2016 LTIP awards follow the same structure as the 2015 awards. The initial award is equivalent to 200% of the Group Chief 
Executive’s base salary and 150% of the Group Finance Director’s base salary. The same performance measures will apply, namely 
relative TSR against the FTSE 51 – 150 companies and EPS CAGR, with equal weighting to both, together with the same performance 
ranges. The performance ranges were determined after the Committee took into account a variety of factors, including the internal and 
external projections for the Group’s performance. 
The introduction of the new annual bonus measure and the continuing use of the LTIP measures provide a clear line of sight to the 
priorities set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan (see pages 10 and 11) and align incentive awards with success in delivering against 
the Plan. These measures seek to balance sustainable and efficient revenue growth, while continuing to deliver against EPS 
expectations and driving long-term Shareholder value. The Committee will set appropriately stretching targets for each performance 
cycle, taking into account factors including the internal goals, analyst expectations, cost of capital and peer performance.
HISTORICAL TSR AND GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE PAY
The following graphs illustrate the Group’s TSR performance compared with the performance of the FTSE All-Share Media Index and 
the FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts, in the seven-year period ended 31 December 2015. These indices have been selected 
for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of both and performance relative to these indices informs vesting 
or partial vesting under the 2013 LTIP award.

results presentations. Furthermore an adapted version of 
half-yearly and full year results presentations is created and 
delivered to employees by the Group Chief Executive, with a Q&A 
facility giving every colleague the opportunity to ask questions 
directly and feedback. 
The Group actively seeks feedback from colleagues and will  
be running a global employee engagement survey in 2016. It 
continues to participate in the UK Top Employers ranking and has 
been accredited a Top Employer for 2016. The ranking involves 
questioning on many factors, including links to employee 
consultation and engagement. 
ShareMatch, a global Share Incentive Plan, is offered to the 
majority of staff. Eligible employees in the UK, the US, the UAE, 
Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Sweden  
are invited to purchase shares in the Company up to an annual 
maximum value of £1,800. Further information on ShareMatch 
can be found in the Remuneration Report on page 85. The 
intention of this scheme is to increase employee engagement  
and align employees’ interests with those of the Company and 
Shareholders by increasing employee ownership of the 
Company’s shares. To support this aim, materials describing  
the scheme have been reformulated and refreshed for re-launch 
in 2016.
Restrictions on transfer of securities in the Company
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the 
Company except that:
• the Directors may from time to time refuse to register a transfer 
of a certificated share which is not fully paid, provided it meets 
the requirements given under the Articles; 
• transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out using 
CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of 
an uncertificated share in accordance with the regulations 
governing the operation of CREST;
• legal and regulatory restrictions may be put in place from time 
to time, for example insider trading laws;
• in accordance with the Listing Rules of the FCA the Directors 
and certain employees of the Company require approval to 
deal in the Company’s shares;
• where a Shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest in the 
Company’s certificated shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company  
with information concerning interests in those shares; or 
• the Directors may decide to suspend the registration of 
transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of 
Shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the registration 
of transfers of any uncertificated shares without obtaining 
consent from CREST.
There are no agreements between holders of Ordinary Shares 
that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions 
on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Shares held on trust
Shares are from time to time held by a Trustee in order to satisfy 
entitlements of employees to shares under the Group’s share 
schemes. Usually the shares held on trust are no more than 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Group’s share schemes 
for one year. The shares held by these trusts do not have any 
special rights with regard to control of the Company. While these 
shares are held on trust their rights are not exercisable directly 
by the relevant employees. The current arrangements concerning 
these trusts and their shareholdings are set out on page 89.
Purchase of own shares
At the end of the year, the Directors had authority, under a 
Shareholders’ resolution passed on 22 May 2015, to purchase 
through the market up to 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary 
Shares. This authority expires at the conclusion of the AGM of 
the Company to be held on 19 May 2016.

The Group sensitises its projections to reflect possible changes in 
trading performance and cash conversions, taking into account 
its substantial deferred revenues (£385.7m at 31 December 
2015). In making its statement on viability on page 21 the 
Directors describe the process they have undertaken to sensitise 
its forward projections to reflect plausible adverse scenarios 
which could arise as a consequence of the most financially 
material of the Group’s principal risks crystallising. The 
projections support the view that for the period up to 30 June 
2017 the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level 
of its current financing and meet its covenant requirements for 
a period of one year from the date of the signing of the Group’s 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that there are no material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and  
Financial Statements.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
94 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
he Directors, whose names are set out on pages 
62 and 63, are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the 
European Union and issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.
International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 1 requires that financial 
statements present fairly the Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows for each financial year. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation  
of financial statements”.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved 
by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, the Directors 
are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for:
• keeping proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the Consolidated 
Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
• safeguarding the assets of the Company and taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities; and
• the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with DTR 4.1.12R, the Directors whose names  
and roles appear on pages 62 and 63, confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
• the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared  
in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards 
and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the 
Strategic Report, includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risk factors.
In addition, each of the Directors as at the date of this report 
considers the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information for Shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.

GOING CONCERN AND THE DIRECTORS’ 
ASSESSMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL RISKS THAT 
WOULD THREATEN THE SOLVENCY OR LIQUIDITY 
OF THE GROUP
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within Note 2 to the financial 
statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term 
viability of the Group contained within the Strategic Report on 
page 21.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation on pages 21 and 22 that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 22 to 25 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in Note 2 to the financial statements 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and 
their confirmation that there are no material uncertainties to 
the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at 
least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
financial statements;
• the Director’s explanation on page 21 as to how they have 
assessed the prospects of the Group over the three-year 
period to 31 December 2018 and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we have not identified any material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. However, because not 
all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
INDEPENDENCE 
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit 
services referred to in those standards.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL 
MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.
In describing how the scope of our audit responded to each risk 
we have focused on those procedures that focus specifically on 
the risk identified. As part of our audit, in addition to substantive 
audit procedures, we also test the design and implementation 
of the internal controls over the financial reporting of each risk.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INFORMA PLC
96 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com REVENUE RECOGNITION
RISK
The specific nature of the risk of material misstatement in revenue 
recognition varies across the Group’s four Operating Divisions. 
The Group’s revenue recognition accounting policies are 
disclosed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements with 
an analysis by revenue stream and by segment in Notes 4 and 5 
respectively.
In respect of the Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & 
Networking Divisions customers are often billed in advance and 
the key risk in revenue recognition is that revenue from events 
and conferences is recognised in the wrong period, particularly 
for events held close to year end.
In respect of both Academic Publishing and Business 
Intelligence we identified the risk that the deferral and release of 
subscription revenues did not appropriately match the underlying 
terms of customer contracts.
We also identified the cut-off risk within Academic Publishing in 
relation to the sales of books in the period around the year end 
and the sale of ebooks.
In addition, auditing standards require special focus on revenue 
recognition as a presumed area of potentially fraudulent 
management manipulation.
AUDIT RESPONSE
We reconfirmed our understanding of each of the Divisions’ 
business models to ensure we understood the contracting 
process with the Group’s customers.
We then reconfirmed our understanding of the design and 
implementation of controls and performed sample transaction 
walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of the revenue 
recording process from order processing to the raising of invoices 
and receipt of cash in the Group’s Shared Service Centres. This 
enabled us to design and perform procedures to respond to each 
of the specific risks of material misstatement we identified.
The substantive audit procedures we performed across the 
Group included:
• obtaining evidence of invoices, payments, exhibitor contracts 
and evidence of event occurrence to determine whether 
revenue was recognised at the appropriate time;
• performing a trend analysis of revenue over the course of the 
year, plotting revenue against the calendar of events for the 
entities tested and verifying that these events had occurred 
to third party sources;
• for a sample of transactions close to the year end, examining 
supporting documentation to determine that revenue 
recognition criteria had been met and the revenue had been 
appropriately recognised in the period or deferred at the period 
end; and
• for a sample of subscription transactions, obtaining and 
reviewing the relevant order confirmations and contracts to 
validate that revenue was properly allocated across the term 
of the contract in the correct accounting period.
CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL  
AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
RISK
The Group has expanded through acquisition and continues 
to do so with the largest acquisitions in the year being in 
the Academic Publishing and Global Exhibitions Divisions. 
At 31 December 2015, total goodwill and intangible assets 
were stated at £1.7bn and £1.0bn, respectively.
Accounting standards require that management performs an 
annual impairment test, to compare the recoverable amount 
normally based on “value in use” (an accounting term for the 
estimated net present value to the current owner) to the Balance 
Sheet carrying value of each “cash generating unit”.
The assumptions used in management’s review include 
preparing forecasts for five years, using the budget for year one, 
the strategic plan for years two and three, forecast growth rates 
for years four and five and then applying a terminal value, using 
growth factors and discount rates in respect of each cash 
generating unit. The selection of the growth rate and the discount 
rate assumptions applied is fundamental to this audit risk.
This is described in Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and the impairment of assets is identified as a critical 
accounting judgement in Note 3.
In 2015, based on this methodology, an impairment of £13.9m 
has been recorded (2014: £204.5m) (see Note 7 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).
AUDIT RESPONSE
We audited the assumptions used in management’s impairment 
testing of goodwill and other intangible assets. Our procedures 
included:
• considering the process by which management had prepared 
its forecasts;
• assessing recent forecasting accuracy against actual 
performance;
• determining whether the 2016 projections for each cash 
generating unit were consistent with the budget for 2016 
as adopted by management and approved by the Board 
of Directors;
• determining whether the cash flow projections for 2017 and 
2018 (as included in management’s three-year plan), and for 
2019 and 2020 were in line with our understanding of trends 
in the business and how they compared to analyst forecasts;
• involving our internal valuation specialists to assess the 
accuracy of the model used in the impairment test and the 
appropriateness of the key components of the discount rate 
calculation noting that management employed its own third 
party specialist to assist in deriving the discount rates applied;
• determining whether the growth rates selected by 
management in computing the terminal value were in line with 
accounting standards which require consideration of long-term 
economic growth rates for relevant territories checking that the 
impairment loss recorded was mechanically accurate based 
on the assumptions used; 
STRATEGIC  
REPORT GOVERNANCE
FINANCIAL  
STATEMENTS
97 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com • considering the reasonableness of sensitivities applied by 
management; and
• performing further sensitivity analysis on the impairment model.
ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND 
ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
RISK
The Group’s strategy includes growth by acquisition and during 
2015 the Group completed seven business combinations and 
recorded a total net cash outflow for these of £62.5m. The most 
significant business combinations in the year were Ashgate, 
Maney and Boston Biotech. The Group also finalised the 
provisional accounting for the Hanley Wood Exhibitions 
acquisition that completed in November 2014.
The accounting for each of these involves judgement and is 
based on assumptions about the fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired, and the consideration paid. As described in the critical 
accounting judgement in respect of the identification or intangible 
assets acquired in business combinations in Note 3, management 
commissions independent valuation experts to assist with the 
identification and valuation of separate intangible assets for 
acquisitions involving consideration in excess of £50m.
Information in respect of the acquisitions made in the year is 
presented in Note 17 . In Note 3 the identification of intangible 
assets in business combinations is identified as a critical 
judgement with the valuation and asset lives of separately 
identifiable intangible assets noted as a key source of 
estimation uncertainty.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED
For a sample of transactions, including each material business 
combination and asset acquisition, we analysed the sale and 
purchase agreements, and challenged the acquisition accounting 
applied by management. This included:
• testing the validity and completeness of consideration to 
the underlying agreements and consideration paid;
• evaluating management’s assumptions and methodology 
supporting the fair values of intangibles and net assets 
acquired and the useful lives applied to the intangible 
assets acquired; and
• assessing the terms of the acquisition to assess whether 
components of compensation and remuneration had been 
correctly identified and that acquisition costs had been 
expensed as required by accounting standards.
In respect of the Ashgate, Maney and Boston Biotech 
acquisitions in 2015 and the finalisation of the accounting for 
the Hanley Wood Exhibitions acquisition in 2014 we involved 
our internal valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness 
of the nature and valuation of the intangible assets identified. 
This assessment included testing the assumptions used 
including discount rates, useful economic lives, growth rates 
and the expected rate of return from customer relationships.
In 2014 we also reported the recovery of long-term receivables 
as a risk in our audit report. We have not reported on this again 
in 2015 due the fact that the consideration of this risk has taken 
significantly less audit effort than the risks identified above 
and the magnitude of the items is also significantly less than 
those above. The description of risks above should be read 
in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the 
Audit Committee discussed on pages 77 and 78.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £16.5m which 
we determined as not greater than 5% of statutory pre-tax 
profit adjusted for the impairment charges of £13.9m and 
amortisation of intangible assets acquired in business 
combinations of £99.5m. In 2014 we determined materiality 
for the Group to be £10.0m which was not greater than 5% 
of statutory pre-tax profit adjusted for impairment charges of 
£219.0m and restructuring and reorganisation costs of £16.8m.
We agreed this change of approach with the Audit Committee 
as the Group is acquisitive and this approach derives a more 
appropriate and stable measure in the context of the Group’s 
adjusted profits, the measure focused on by analysts and other 
users of the financial statements. 2015 materiality represents 
7 .5% of statutory pre-tax profit (2014: principally because of 
impairment charges materiality represented 32% of statutory 
pre-tax loss) and 1% (2014: 1%) of equity. We confirmed to the 
Audit Committee that our change in approach would not affect 
the selection of locations in our audit scoping.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £300,000 
(2014: £200,000), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INFORMA PLC (CONTINUED)
100 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Informa PLC (‘the Company’) is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered number is 08860726. The address of the registered office is 5 Howick Place, 
London SW1P 1WG. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 91.
The Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2015 and for year then ended comprise those of the Company and its 
subsidiaries and its interests in joint ventures (together referred to as “the Group”).
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (“GBP”), the functional currency of the Parent Company, Informa PLC. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further detail is contained in the Strategic 
Report on page 21.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and 
hedged items which are measured at fair value. The principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, 
are set out below.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Control is achieved where 
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity, has the rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold 
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by other members of the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity and consist  
of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the Group has the rights to the net assets through joint control with a third party.  
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant 
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises 
significant influence, usually from 20%–50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of the financial and operating policy.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures and associates using the equity method. Under the equity method, the 
investment in the joint venture or associate is initially measured at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures or associates since the acquisition date. The income statement reflects 
the Group’s share of the results of operations of the entity. The statement of comprehensive income includes the Group’s share of any 
other comprehensive income recognised by the joint venture or associate. Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive the 
payment is established. Where an associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Group’s share of liabilities 
where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the associate or joint venture.
Joint operations arise where there is a joint arrangement in which the Group is one of the parties that has joint control of the 
arrangement and has rights to the assets, and obligation for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. This typically arises when the 
joint arrangement is not structured through a separate legal entity. The Group accounts for its share of joint operations under the 
proportional consolidation method, where it recognises its share of the joint operation’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. 
108 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of 
the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the rates 
ruling at that date. These translation differences are disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date 
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains 
and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also 
recognised directly in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the closing rates of exchange. The income statement 
results are translated at an average exchange rate, recalculated for each month between that month’s closing rate and the equivalent 
for the preceding month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate are 
taken directly to the translation reserve. In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries’ 
results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences 
are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of. The translation 
movement on matched long-term foreign currency borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39, are also taken directly 
to the hedging reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The acquisition of subsidiaries and other asset purchases that are assessed as meeting the definition of a business under the rules of 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in adjusting items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance 
with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, 
it should not be re-measured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value 
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
REVENUE 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and provisions for returns and cancellations. 
Subscription income for online services, information and journals is deferred and recognised evenly over the term of the subscription. 
Revenue from Exhibitions, trade shows, conferences and learning events is recognised when the event is held, with advance receipts 
recognised as deferred income in the Balance Sheet. 
Unit sales revenue is recognised on the sale of books and related publications when title passes. 
Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the related publication or over the period of the advertising subscription.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
PENSION COSTS AND PENSION SCHEME ARRANGEMENTS
Certain Group companies operate Defined Contribution Pension Schemes for employees. The assets of the Schemes are held 
separately from the individual companies. The pension cost charge associated with these Schemes represents contributions payable 
and is charged as an expense when incurred.
The Group also operates funded Defined Benefit Schemes for employees. The cost of providing these benefits is determined using 
the Projected Unit Credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date. There is no service cost due to the 
fact that these Schemes are closed to future accrual. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the opening net defined 
benefit liability or asset and shown in finance costs, and the administration costs are shown as a component of operating expenses. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement and 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group’s 
Defined Benefit Schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available 
in the form of refunds from the Schemes or reductions in future contributions to the Schemes. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at date of grant. 
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for an 
estimate of the share awards that will actually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate.
For awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) where the proportion of the award is dependent on the level of Total 
Shareholder Return the fair value is measured using a Monte Carlo model of valuation, which is considered to be the most appropriate 
valuation technique. The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. For awards issued under ShareMatch the fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period,  
based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For cash-settled share-based payments a liability is recognised  
over the period of service, with the fair value re-measured at each reporting date, with any changes recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
Own shares are deducted in arriving at total equity and represent the cost of the Company’s Ordinary Shares acquired by the 
Employee Share Trust (“EST”) in connection with the Group’s employee share schemes.
INTEREST INCOME
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
A current tax provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is the best 
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit. 
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties. A deferred tax liability is recognised 
to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form 
part of the associated goodwill on acquisition. 
110 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly 
to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
GOODWILL
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of the fair value of purchase 
consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition. It is recognised as an asset 
at cost, assessed for impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. Fair value 
measurements are based on provisional estimates and may be subject to amendment within one year of the acquisition, resulting 
in an adjustment to goodwill. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (“CGUs”), as defined by the 
Executive Directors for internal management purposes, expected to benefit from the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Where an impairment test is performed a discounted 
cash flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the CGU compared with the carrying value of that goodwill. Management 
estimates the discount rates as the risk adjusted cost of capital for the particular CGUs. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less 
than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to 
the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a business which includes all or part of a CGU, any attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit  
or loss on disposal.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. For intangible assets acquired in business combinations, cost is calculated based on 
the Group’s valuation methodologies (Note 16). These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, 
which are as follows:
Book lists 20 years
1
 
Journal titles 20 years
1
 
Customer relationship database and intellectual property 3–20 years 
Large scale events and Exhibitions
2
 3–20 years 
Software 3–10 years
¹ Or licence period if shorter.
2
 Included in this intangible asset category are the value of Brands, customer relationships and non-compete agreements.
Software which is not integral to a related item of hardware is included in intangible assets. Capitalised internal-use software costs 
include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and other direct 
costs for employees who devote substantial time to the project. Capitalisation of these costs ceases when the project is substantially 
complete and available for use. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
Product development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of certain conditions are met, with all research 
costs and other development expenditure being expensed when incurred. The capitalisation criteria are as follows:
• An asset is created that can be separately identified, and which the Group intends to use or sell.
• It is technically feasible to complete the development of the asset for use or sale.
• It is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefit.
• The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually. The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite 
lives (excluding goodwill).
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided 
to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years 
Leasehold land and buildings Over life of the lease  
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3–15 years 
Freehold land is not depreciated
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale proceeds  
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant  
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
INVENTORY 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in bringing 
the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less marketing and 
distribution costs expected to be incurred. Pre-publication costs are included in inventory, representing costs incurred in the 
origination of content prior to publication. These are expensed systematically reflecting the expected sales profile over the estimated 
economic lives of the related products.
LEASING
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and 
depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets. The corresponding liability 
to the lessor is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation. Finance charges are allocated over the period 
of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term. Lease 
incentives where received from the lessor are treated as a reduction in lease rentals and spread over the term of the lease.
Rental income from sub-leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
112 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are recognised in the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale 
investments. 
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been negatively impacted.
For unlisted shares classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost  
is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are 
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past  
the average credit period of 30 days, and observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with increased 
default risk on receivables. A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the  
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties  
of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments  
(more than 90 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the provision account. Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY THE GROUP
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

BORROWINGS
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Consolidated 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
NET DEBT
Net debt consists of cash and cash equivalents inclusive of bank overdrafts, borrowings and other loan receivables where these are 
interest bearing and do not relate to deferred consideration arrangements.
FINANCE COSTS 
Debt issue costs are capitalised and are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method. 
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method.
OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method, as set out above, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps and cross-currency 
swaps. The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their 
fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
• hedges of a change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge);
• hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
• hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as 
its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values 
or cash flows of the hedged item.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit  
or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. 
The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are 
recognised in the line of the Consolidated Income Statement relating to the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of  
a financial asset or financial liability, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are 
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss in the same line of the Consolidated 
Income Statement as the recognised hedged item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity 
and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
114 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com Hedges of net investment in foreign operations
Hedges of net investment in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument in relation to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
foreign currency translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in the 
foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is disposed of. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
equity is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 28.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated 
to the affected parties.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)
Standards and interpretations in issue, not yet effected (continued)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group, except for the following: 
• IFRS 9 is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the 
accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities and reduces complexity. IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether 
a financial asset is measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39. This standard is effective 
for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9. 
• IFRS 15 is a new standard, based on a five-step model framework, which replaces all existing revenue recognition standards. 
The standard’s requirements will also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of certain non-
financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g. sales of property, plant and equipment or intangibles). 
This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Adoption of the new standard is likely 
to have an impact on the Group and management is currently assessing the impact. 
• IFRS 16 is a new leasing standard replacing the current leasing standard (IAS 17). The new standard requires all leases to be treated 
in a consistent way to the current rules on finance leases, requiring all leases, with limited exceptions, to be disclosed in the Balance 
Sheet. IFRS 16 does not require a lessee to recognise assets or liabilities for short-term leases (12 months or less) or low value 
leases. The most significant effect of the new requirements will be an increase in lease assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 16 
changes the nature of expenses related to those leases, replacing the straight line operating lease expense with a depreciation 
charge for the lease asset (included within operating costs) and an interest expense on the lease liability (included within finance 
costs). The new standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. Adoption of the new standard 
is likely to have an impact on the Group and management is yet to assess the impact.
3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
In addition to the judgement taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the Directors  
have made the following judgements concerning the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairment of assets
Identifying whether there are indicators of impairment for assets involves a high level of judgement and a good understanding of the 
drivers of value behind the asset. At each reporting period an assessment is performed in order to determine whether there are any 
such indicators, which involves considering the performance of our businesses, any significant changes to the markets in which we 
operate and future forecasts. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is allocated to the specific CGUs which are expected to 
benefit from the acquisition. When there are changes in the business structure, management judgement is required in identifying  
any changes to the identification of CGUs. 
There are a number of assumptions management has considered in performing impairment reviews of assets; Note 15 details the 
assumptions that have been applied. The determination of whether assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of 
the CGUs to which assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows 
expected to arise from each CGU and determine a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Identification of intangible assets acquired in business combinations
There are significant judgements involved in assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations, 
in particular the amount attributed to separate intangible assets such as titles, Brands, acquired customer lists and the associated 
customer relationships. These judgements impact the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisitions. The fair values of assets 
recognised are based on recognised valuation techniques built, in part, on assumptions around the future performance of the business; 
see Note 16. The Group has built considerable knowledge of these valuation techniques but notwithstanding this, for major acquisitions, 
defined as when consideration is over £50m, management considers the advice of third party independent valuers in identifying and 
calculating the valuation of any intangible assets arising on acquisition.
116 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com Recoverability of long-term receivables
The Group has a number of external receivables which are repayable over the next two to five years, mostly vendor loan notes 
receivable in relation to disposed businesses. The recoverability of the capital and interest payments is dependent on the financial 
success of the counterparties over the coming years. In making its judgement in respect of recoverability, management assesses  
for each significant loan receivable whether a credit risk provision is required. 
Adjusted results
Management presents adjusted results and adjusted Earnings Per Share (Note 7) to provide additional useful information on 
underlying performance and trends to Shareholders. These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive 
compensation arrangements for employees. Adjusted results exclude items that are common across the Media sector: amortisation 
and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets relating to businesses acquired and other intangible asset purchases, costs of 
acquisition charged to the Consolidated Income Statement, profits or loss on disposal of businesses, restructuring costs and other 
non-recurring items that in the opinion of the Directors would distort underlying results. The term “adjusted” is not a defined term 
under IFRSs, and may not therefore be comparable to similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies. It is not 
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit. Refer to Note 7 for details of adjusting items recorded  
for the year.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised. 
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on a business combination, management is required 
to make estimates when utilising the Group’s valuation methodologies. Associated with this is deferred tax on these intangibles. 
These methodologies include the use of discounted cash flows and revenue forecasts. For major acquisitions, defined as when 
consideration is over £50m, management considers the advice of third party independent valuers in identifying and calculating  
the valuation of any intangible assets arising on acquisition.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions is recognised initially based on management estimates of the most likely outcome 
(Note 17) and discounted appropriately to fair value. However, any subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration is 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Payments made to former owners are assessed to consider if these represent 
consideration related to the acquisition or remuneration for services provided in the post-acquisition period.
Pension assumptions
There are a number of assumptions management has considered which have an impact on the results of the valuation of the pension 
scheme liabilities at year end. The most significant assumptions are those relating to the discount rate, the rates of increase in salaries 
and pensions and mortality assumptions. Note 34 details the assumptions which have been adopted based on the advice received 
from independent actuaries.

Adjusting items in profit/(loss) for the year 106.8 302.1
122 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com The principal adjustments made are in respect of:
• redundancy, reorganisation and vacant property costs – these are costs incurred by the Group business restructuring and 
changing the operating model to align with the Group’s revised strategy, the Growth Acceleration Plan;
• acquisition and integration costs – the costs incurred by the Group in acquiring and integrating share and asset acquisitions;
• intangible asset amortisation – the amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets acquired through business combinations 
or the acquisition of trade and assets is excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading;
• impairment – the Group tests for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an indicator exists. Impairment 
charges are individually disclosed and are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading;
• subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration is recognised in the period as a charge or credit to the Consolidated 
Income Statement unless these qualify as measurement period adjustments arising within one year from the acquisition date.  
They are excluded from adjusted results as they do not relate to underlying trading; 
• (profit)/loss on disposal of subsidiaries and operations – the profit on disposal includes the fair value of consideration less the 
net assets/(liabilities) disposed, non-controlling interest and costs directly attributable with the disposal;
• early repayment fee relating to the revolving credit facility – capitalised facility fees are amortised over the loan periods but where 
revolving credit facilities have been terminated early, the unamortised fees are immediately expensed. This accelerated expense  
is not viewed as being part of the underlying results and is thus excluded from the adjusted results; 
• share of results of joint ventures – the share of results includes intangible asset amortisation and impairment charge related to joint 
ventures, which is excluded from adjusted results in line with the presentation of the Group’s intangible asset amortisation and 
treatment of impairment; and
• the tax related to adjusting items is the tax effect of the items above, and any significant tax items are excluded from underlying results.
The tax credit in respect of prior year items is mainly attributable to adjustments relating to historical disposals.

9 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group LTIPs provide for a grant price equal to the closing share price from the day prior to the grant date. The performance period 
is three years starting with the year in which the grant is made. LTIP awards are conditional share awards with specific performance 
conditions. To the extent they are met or satisfied then awards will vest following the end of the relevant performance period. LTIP 
allocations are equity-settled and will lapse if the employee leaves the Group before an LTIP grant vests, unless the employee meets 
certain eligibility criteria.
The Group recognised total expenses of £2.9m (2014: £1.7m) related to share-based payment transactions in the year ended 
31 December 2015 with £2.4m (2014: £1.7m) relating to equity-settled LTIPs, £0.2m (2014: £nil) relating to equity-settled ShareMatch 
and £0.3m (2014: £nil) relating to cash settled time-based awards. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The 2015 LTIP award was granted on 13 February 2015. The performance conditions of the 2015 LTIP awards to Executive Directors 
were relative TSR (TSR for FTSE 51–150 constituents excluding financial services and commodities) and EPS CAGR. 
The 2014 LTIP award was granted on 5 September 2014. The performance conditions of the 2014 LTIP awards were relative TSR 
equally split between two peer groups: (i) the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index, excluding Investment Trusts, and (ii) the constituents 
of the FTSE All-Share Media Index and Personal Strategic Measures. Further details are set out in pages 84 to 90 in the remuneration 
section of this report.
The 2013 LTIP award was granted on 7 March 2013 and 1 September 2013. The performance conditions of the 2013 LTIP awards to 
Executive Directors were based on relative TSR. These were equally split between TSR performance relative to the constituents of the 
FTSE 350 Index, excluding Investment Trusts, and TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Media Index.

 From 1 January of year in which grant made.
In order to satisfy share awards granted under LTIPs, the share capital would be increased by up to 1,57 4, 197 shares (2014: 1,215,877 
shares) taking account of the shares held in the EST (Note 30). The Company is planning to issue additional share capital  
to satisfy the awards although if circumstances change it may instead buy the shares as needed on the open market. 
The weighted average share price during the year was £5.65 (2014: £4.99).
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over one, two and three years back 
from the date of grant. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
SHAREMATCH (SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN)
In June 2014, the Company launched ShareMatch, a global Share Incentive Plan (tax qualifying in the UK), under which eligible employees 
can invest up to the limit of £1,800 per annum out of net salary (gross salary in the UK) in the Company’s shares. The scheme includes 
a matching element, whereby for every two shares purchased, the Company will award the participant one matching share. Matching 
shares are subject to forfeiture if the purchased shares are withdrawn from the scheme within three years of purchase or if the 
employee leaves the Group. In addition, both the purchased and matching shares are eligible to receive any dividends payable by the 
Company, which are reinvested in more shares. Employee subscriptions can be made on a monthly or one-off, lump sum basis and 
matching shares are purchased on a monthly basis, through a UK Trust. Further details are set out on page 85 of the remuneration 
section of the financial statements.

  The tax charge on adjusted profits is now stated after the benefit of goodwill amortisation for tax purposes only in the US which was previously taken in arriving 
at adjusted profits after taxation. There is no impact on the total charge for the year. The tax credit on adjusting items was previously stated at £43.0m for 2014 
and the effect of this change was to reduce the tax credit on adjusting items by £4.3m.
The current and deferred tax is calculated on the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation is calculated on each jurisdiction 
based on the prevailing rates of that jurisdiction.
The total tax charge/(credit) for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows:
 2015 2014

14 EARNINGS PER SHARE
BASIC
The basic EPS calculation is based on a profit attributable to equity Shareholders of the parent of £171.4m (2014: £52.4m loss). This 
profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (less those non-vested shares 
held by the EST, which is 648,203,977 (2014: 608,258,772).
DILUTED
The diluted EPS calculation is based on the basic EPS calculation above except that the weighted average number of shares includes 
all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting 
period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 648,660,616 (2014: 608,309,328). 
The table below sets out the adjustment in respect of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares:

  The restatement of goodwill relates to the finalisation of our valuation of separately identifiable intangible assets of the Hanley Wood Exhibitions acquisition 
completed in 2014 together with the elimination of goodwill and prior impairment on disposals in prior year. This resulted in a reduction in goodwill totalling 
£82.0m, offset by an increase of £116.4m in intangible assets and a £34.4m increase in deferred tax liabilities.

 Included within disposals is fully amortised goodwill written off of £150.0m.

As goodwill is not amortised, it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. The testing 
involves comparing the carrying value of assets in each CGU with value in use calculations derived from latest management cash 
flow projections. In 2015 there was impairment of goodwill totalling £13.9m, with a charge of £1.1m in Business Intelligence relating 
to the Telecoms, Media & Technology (“TMT”) CGU and £12.8m in Knowledge & Networking relating to the International events 
CGU (2014: £193.4m total goodwill impairment, with £189.0m in Business Intelligence and £4.4m in Global Exhibitions). 
130 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com In 2015 the number of CGUs has remained at 21 (2014: 21). For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into four reportable 
segments which each have their own Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer (Academic Publishing, Business Intelligence, 
Global Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking). The carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the major groups of CGUs is set 
out below:

Knowledge & Networking 8 6 279.4 281.5
 21 21 1,709.6 1,666.9
During the year the Knowledge & Networking Division underwent a reorganisation of its Divisional structure to bring more of an 
industry sector focus to the division. As part of this restructure, new CGUs had been determined within this division in the year.
The movements in the carrying amount relate primarily to acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange movements and other internal 
reclassifications arising when acquisition intangible valuations are completed.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined as the greater of the value in use calculations or fair value less costs to sell, 
which are based on the cash flow projections for each CGU. The key assumptions are those regarding the revenue and operating 
margin growth rates together with the long-term growth rate and the discount rate applied to the forecast cash flows. 
Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to the latest budget and forecasts for the next five years after which a 
long-term perpetuity growth rate is applied. The most recent financial budget approved by the Board of Directors has been prepared 
after considering the current economic environment in each of our markets. The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with 
past experience adjusted for management’s estimates of future performance. 
Long-term market growth rates Pre-tax discount rates
Key assumptions 2015 2014 2015 2014
Academic Publishing 2.4% 3.0% 10.3% 10.5%
Business Intelligence 2.0–2.4% 2.0% 10.1–11.4% 10.5%
Global Exhibitions 2.0–3.5% 3.0% 8.3–14.4% 11.5%
Knowledge & Networking 1.8–2.4% 2.0% 10.2–11.5% 11.5%
During the year, the pre-tax discount rates used in the value in use calculations reflect the Group’s assessment of the current market 
and other risks specific to the CGUs. Long-term growth rates are applied after the forecast period of five years and do not exceed the 
long-term average growth prospects for the markets in which the CGUs operate. Long-term growth rates are sourced from an external 
study of long-term inflation rates for each CGU. 
Management has undertaken a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising 
from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with 
the sensitivities summarised as follows:
• an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1.0%; and
• a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 0.5% for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that there would be an impairment of £5.9m in TMT which sits within the Business Intelligence Division 
when applying the 1.0% increase in pre-tax discount rate sensitivity, and an impairment of £2.0m in TMT when applying the 0.5% 
decrease in terminal growth rate sensitivity. When applying the above criteria combined, an impairment of £7 .6m would arise in TMT, 
£4.4m in Pharma & Healthcare, and £0.8m in Agra; all within the Business Intelligence Division. For the other CGUs, no additional 
impairments would result from the scenarios tested in our sensitivity analysis.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 31 days (2014: 30 days). The Group has provision policies for its Divisions 
determined by references to past default experience. Under the normal course of business, the Group does not charge interest  
on its overdue receivables.
Other non-current receivables primarily consist of a long-term receivable of £35.7m provided as consideration for the disposal 
of the Corporate Training businesses in 2013 by the acquirer. The non-current receivable is repayable in 2020. In 2014 there was 
an impairment of £14.5m of long-term receivables related to China Medical Data Services and Expo Vinis.
The Group’s exposures to credit risk and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are disclosed in Note 28.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

No suppliers represented more than 10% of the total balance of trade payables in either 2014 or 2015.
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame.  
Under the normal course of business, the Group is therefore not charged interest on overdue payables.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

Deferred tax liability 183.3 160.0
Deferred tax asset (0.6) –

The Finance (No.2) Act 2015 enacted prospective legislation to reduce the UK Corporation Tax rate to 18%, as follows:
Year to 31 March 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
Corporation Tax rate 20% 20% 19% 19% 19% 18%
Deferred tax has been provided in respect of temporary differences arising on UK intangible assets at the enacted rate of 20% which 
will apply at the next balance sheet date. Had deferred tax been provided on UK intangible assets at the future substantively enacted 
rates of 19% or 18% the impact would have been as follows: 19% – to decrease the Group’s deferred tax liability at the balance sheet 
date by £2.2m; 18% – to decrease the Group’s deferred tax liability at the balance sheet date by £4.5m.
Deferred tax has been provided at the rate of 20% on all other UK temporary differences which are expected to reverse at the 
prevailing rate.
At 31 December 2015 the Group has unused tax losses of approximately £36.6m (2014: £36.6m) available for offset against future 
profits. A deferred tax asset of £10.6m (2014: £12. 1m) has not been recognised due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.
At the reporting date, the aggregate amount of withholding tax on post-acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities 
have not been recognised was £13.3m (2014: £13.3m). No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control 
the timing of the distribution of intra-Group dividends and has no intention to distribute intra-Group dividends in the foreseeable future 
that would trigger withholding tax.

There were no breaches of covenants under the Group’s bank facilities and private placement loan notes during the year. The bank 
and private placement borrowings are guaranteed by material subsidiaries of the Group. The Group does not have any material 
amount of its property and equipment and other intangible assets pledged as security over loans. 
The Group issued private placement loan notes amounting to US Dollar (“USD”) 737 .5m (2014: USD 597 .5m), pound sterling (“GBP”) 
40.0m (2014: GBP 40.0m) and Euro (“EUR”) 50.0m (2014: EUR 50.0m). As at 31 December 2015, the note maturities ranged between 
two and ten years (2014: one and six years), with an average duration of 5.5 years (2014: 4.3 years), at a weighted average interest rate 
of 4.3% (2014: 4.3%).
The Group maintains the following lines of credit:
• £900.0m (2014: £900.0m) revolving credit facility, of which £359.1m (2014: £452.2m) has been drawn down at 31 December 2015. 
Interest is payable at the rate of LIBOR plus a margin based on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. 
• £32.6m (2014: £39.1m) comprising a number of bilateral bank uncommitted facilities that can be drawn down to meet short-term 
financing needs. These facilities consist of GBP 16.0m (2014: GBP 16.0m), USD 13.0m (2014: USD 15.0m), EUR 8.0m (2014: EUR 8.0m), 
Australian Dollar (“AUD”) 2.0m (2014: AUD 2.0m), and Canadian Dollar (“CAD”) 2.0m (2014: nil). Interest is payable at the local base 
rate plus a margin.
• The Group has two bank guarantee facilities comprising EUR 7 .0m (2014: EUR 7 .0m) and AUD 1.5m (2014: AUD 1.5m).
The effective interest rate as at 31 December 2015 is 3.4% (2014: 3.0%).
The Group had the committed undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 December 2015 relating to the undrawn amount of the revolving 
credit facility of £540.9m (2014: £448.8m).

28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
(A) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Capital risk management
• Market risk
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital, and the 
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s Risk Management Framework. 
The Board has established a Treasury Committee, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk 
management policies. The Treasury Committee meets and reports regularly to the Audit Committee on its activities.
The Group Treasury function provides services to the Group’s businesses, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial 
markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. These risks include market risk (including 
currency risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Treasury Committee has put in place policies to identify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group and has set appropriate 
limits and controls. These policies provide written principles on funding investments, credit risk, foreign exchange and interest rate risk. 
Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Treasury Committee. This Committee is assisted in its oversight role 
by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
In October 2014, the Group entered into a new five-year revolving credit facility of £900.0m, of which £359.1m (2014: £455.2m)  
was drawn down at 31 December 2015. The facility was extended during the year and now matures in October 2020.
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising  
the return to stakeholders and sustaining the future development of the business. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the  
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to Shareholders, return capital to Shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets  
to reduce debt. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings (Note 27), cash and cash equivalents (Note 23), 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital (Note 29), reserves and retained earnings.
Cost of capital
The Group’s Treasury Committee reviews the Group’s capital structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, the Committee 
considers the weighted average cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Gearing ratio
The principal financial covenant ratios under the Group’s borrowing facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and 
minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually. At 31 December 2015 both financial covenants were comfortably 
achieved, with the ratio of net debt (using average exchange rates) to EBITDA of 2.2 times (2.2 times at 31 December 2014). The ratio 
of EBITDA to net interest payable in the year ended 31 December 2015 was 14.9 times (2014: 14.4 times).

(C) MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income  
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. 
The Group manages these risks by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate, and currency borrowings using derivatives where  
necessary. The Group is able to achieve a level of natural hedge of both the Consolidated Balance Sheet net currency assets  
and also the currency earnings due to the currency interest payable. Refer to both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk  
in Note 28(d) and (e) respectively.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by a central Treasury department under policies 
approved by the Board of Directors. 
Risk is measured in terms of impact, inherent risk and residual risk, and takes account of management’s control actions in mitigating 
both external and internal risk events

(D) INTEREST RATE RISK
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets at floating rates, but is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group 
borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest  
rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
This risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap 
contracts, where necessary.
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this Note.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
A high percentage of loans are at fixed interest rates; hence the Group’s interest rate sensitivity would only be affected by the exposure 
to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year 
would have decreased or increased by £3.6m (2014: £4.5m).
(E) FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Group is a business with significant net USD and net EUR transactions; hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.  
In the absence of any currency conversion, cash positions in USD and other trading currencies, such as the EUR, would develop 
imbalances by growing GBP debt. 
Allied to the Group’s policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net 
investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries’ functional currencies, primarily EUR and USD. 
This policy has the effect of partially protecting the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet from movements in those currencies to  
the extent that the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.
148 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
In 2015 the Group received approximately 55% of its revenues and incurred approximately 43% of its costs in USD or currencies 
pegged to the USD. The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the USD against the GBP . Each $0.01 movement in the USD 
to GBP exchange rate has a circa £4.4m impact on revenue and a circa £2.0m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be 
reductions to the value of USD borrowings, interest and tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest 
rates, remain constant. 
In 2015 the Group received approximately 7% of its revenues and incurred approximately 6% of its costs in EUR. The Group is therefore 
sensitive to movements in the EUR against the GBP . Each €0.01 movement in the EUR to GBP exchange rate has a circa £0.6m 
impact on revenue and a circa £0.2m impact on operating profits. Offsetting this will be reductions to the value of EUR borrowings, 
interest and tax liabilities. This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
(F) CREDIT RISK
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables (Note 22) and cash and cash equivalents, which represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables. The amounts presented in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience  
and its assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss 
from defaults. 
The Group’s exposure and the creditworthiness of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions 
concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed 
and approved as part of the Group’s Treasury policies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk.
Non-current other receivables
Non-current other receivables arose from disposals made in the current and prior years as disclosed in Note 22. The Risk Committee 
reviews these receivables and the credit quality of the counterparties on a regular basis.

(F) CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographic areas, and the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities. Concentration of credit 
risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year. 
The Group establishes a provision that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and 
investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The main components of this provision are a specific loss 
component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets 
in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss provision is determined by reference to past 
default experience. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit assessment system to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality.
All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment for each division. As the Global 
Exhibitions and Knowledge & Networking Divisions work on a prepaid basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and 
have a low bad debt history. The Group is exposed to normal credit risk and potential losses are mitigated as the Group does not have 
significant exposure to any single customer.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired. For trade receivables 
that are more than three months past due for payment, there are debtors with a carrying amount of £7 .5m (2014: £2.0m) which the 
Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are considered recoverable. 
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. 
A provision relating to returns on books of £13.1m (2014: £13.2m) has been disclosed separately in the table above. This provision 
is based on management’s best estimate of previous seasonal sales and returns trends, and is included as part of the overall 
provision balance.

 23.2 26.0
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the above amounts.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total gross balance of trade receivables in both 2015 and 2014. 
(G) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity 
risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by Group Treasury. Group Treasury has built  
an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding. The 
Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and debt facilities, together with continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in Note 27 is a summary of additional 
undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal. 
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position. The Group’s 
policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP , USD and EUR; thereby 
providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial assets and liabilities.
The table below has been drawn up based on the contractual maturities of the financial assets including interest that will be earned 
on those assets except where the Group anticipates that the cash flow will occur in a different period.

(H) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between 
informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value. 
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets 
is determined with reference to quoted market prices.
• The fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) is determined in accordance with 
generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market 
transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
• The fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted 
cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing 
models for optional derivatives.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest at rates approximate 
to the market.
The fair value of all the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities is the same as the carrying amounts.
152 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com (I) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS RECOGNISED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

29 SHARE CAPITAL
On 30 May 2014 under a Scheme of Arrangement between Informa plc (“Old Informa”), the former holding company of the Group, 
and its Shareholders, under Article 125 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, and as sanctioned by the Royal Court of Jersey, all the 
issued shares in Old Informa were cancelled and an equivalent number of new shares in Old Informa were issued to Informa PLC 
(“the Company”) in consideration for the allotment to Shareholders of one Ordinary Share in the Company for each Ordinary Share 
in Old Informa that they held on the record date, 29 May 2014.
The Company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 on 24 January 2014, as a private company limited by shares with 
the name Informa Limited and re-registered on 14 May 2014 as a public company limited by shares called Informa PLC. The Company 
became the Parent Company of the Informa Group and the previous Parent Company, Old Informa, was renamed Informa 
Switzerland Limited.
The Company was incorporated with an issued share capital of £2 divided into two ordinary shares of 100p each which were taken 
by the subscribers and were paid up in full in cash. On 13 May 2014 the two Ordinary Shares of 100p each were converted into two 
Redeemable Deferred Shares of 100p each and an additional 49,998 Redeemable Deferred Shares were issued to the subscribers. 
The 50,000 issued Redeemable Deferred Shares of 100p each were redeemed on 11 June 2014. 
On 13 May 2014 one Ordinary Share of 435p in the Company was issued and subsequently cancelled on 30 May 2014. 
Under the Scheme of Arrangement 603,941,249 Ordinary Shares of 435p each in the Company were allotted to Shareholders 
on 30 May 2014. 
On 4 June 2014 the nominal value per share of the issued share capital of the Company was reduced from 435p per share 
to 0.1p each pursuant to sections 645 to 649 of the Companies Act 2006.

156 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com 34 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
CHARGE TO OPERATING PROFIT
The charge to operating profit for the year in respect of pensions, including both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Schemes, 
was £9.5m (2014: £8.9m). This consisted of a £0.3m (2014: £0.3m) charge to operating profit related to administration costs for the 
Defined Benefit Schemes and a £9.2m charge to operating profit relating to Defined Contribution Schemes (2014: £8.6m).
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
The Group operates two Defined Benefit Pension Schemes, the Informa Final Salary Scheme and the Taylor & Francis Group Pension 
and Life Assurance Scheme (“the Group Schemes”) for all qualifying UK employees providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. 
Both schemes are closed to future accrual. Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations 
using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 
The Defined Benefit Schemes are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the Company. The Trustees are 
responsible for running the Group Schemes in accordance with the Group Schemes’ Trust Deed and Rules, which sets out their 
powers. The Trustees of the Group Schemes are required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the Group Schemes. There 
is a requirement that one third of the Trustees are nominated by the members of the Group Schemes. The Trustees of the pension 
fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. Neither of the Schemes has any reimbursement rights.
The Group’s pension funding policy is to provide sufficient funding, as agreed with the Trustees, to ensure that any pension deficit 
will be addressed to ensure that pension payments made to current and future pensioners will be met.
The investment strategies adopted by the Trustees of the Group Schemes include some exposure to index-linked gilts and corporate 
bonds. These assets are held to provide some protection to the Group Schemes’ funding levels in the event of interest rates falling. 
Through the Group Schemes the Company is exposed to a number of potential risks as described below:
• Asset volatility: the Group Schemes’ Defined Benefit obligation is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate 
bond yields; however, the Group Schemes invests significantly in equities. These assets are expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long term, but provide volatility and risk in the short term.
• Changes in bond yields: a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the Group Schemes’ Defined Benefit obligation; 
however, this would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the Schemes’ bond holdings.
• Inflation risk: a significant proportion of the Group Schemes’ Defined Benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore higher inflation 
will result in a higher Defined Benefit obligation (subject to the appropriate caps in place). The majority of the Group Schemes’ 
assets are either unaffected by inflation, or only loosely correlated with inflation, therefore an increase in inflation would also increase 
the deficit.
• Life expectancy: if the Group Schemes’ members live longer than expected, the Group Schemes’ benefits will need to be paid 
for longer, increasing the Group Schemes’ Defined Benefit obligations.
The Trustees and the Company manage risks in the Group Schemes through the following strategies:
• Diversification: investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact 
on the overall level of assets.
• Investment strategy: the Trustees are required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis.
There are three categories of pension scheme members:
• Employed deferred members: currently employed by the Company
• Deferred members: former employees of the Company
• Pensioner members: in receipt of pension
The Defined Benefit obligation is valued by projecting the best estimate of future benefit payments (allowing for future salary increases 
for employed deferred members, revaluation to retirement for deferred members and annual pension increases for all members) and 
then discounting to the balance sheet date. The majority of benefits receive increases linked to inflation (subject to a cap of no more 
than 5% pa). The valuation method used is known as the Projected Unit Credit Method. The approximate overall duration of the 
Schemes’ Defined Benefit obligation as at 31 December 2015 was 18 years (2014: 20 years). This number can be subdivided into 
the duration related to:
• Deferred members: 21 years (2014: 22 years)
• Retired members: 13 years (2014: 13 years)

Informa Final Salary Scheme
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The result of this valuation determines the level 
of contributions payable by the Group. 
The last actuarial full valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for the Trustees as at 
31 March 2014. This valuation revealed a funding shortfall of £0.2m. Contributions paid since 31 March 2014, in respect of the 
recovery plan put in place following the 31 March 2011 valuation, were in excess of those required to recover the deficit of £0.2m. 
That recovery plan has now expired and no further deficit contributions are required.
An actuarial valuation was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The Scheme 
was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000 and closed to future accrual on 1 April 2011. The Group’s contribution over the year was 
£0.1m (2014: £3.2m). The Employer expects to pay no contributions to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January 
2016 in respect of the deficit. 
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the Informa Final Salary Scheme liabilities are set out below:
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on Scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by £1.6m
Rate of price inflation pre-retirement Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase/decrease by £4.0m

Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The Trustees are required to carry out an actuarial valuation every three years. The result of this valuation determines the level of 
contributions payable by the Group. 
The last actuarial full valuation of the Taylor & Francis Life Assurance and Pension Scheme was performed by the Scheme Actuary for 
the Trustees as at 30 September 2014. This valuation revealed a funding surplus of £1.3m. No further contributions are therefore required.
An actuarial valuation was carried out for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 December 2015 by a qualified independent actuary. The Scheme 
was closed to new entrants on 1 April 2000 and closed to future accrual on 1 April 2011. The Group’s contribution over the year was 
£0.3m (2014: £0.3m). The Employer expects to pay no contributions to the Scheme during the accounting year beginning 1 January

COMPANY BALANCE SHEET
AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2015
168 INFORMA PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.informa.com 1 CORPORATE INFORMATION
Informa PLC (“the Company”) is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 on 24 January 2014, 
as a private company limited by shares. The address of the registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY AND BUSINESS REVIEW
Informa PLC is the Parent Company of the Informa Group (“the Group”) and its principal activity is to act as the ultimate holding 
company of the Group.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (“FRS 100”) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 102, The Financial Reporting 
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under FRS 102 issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. The last financial statements under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“GAAP”) were for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and the date of transition to FRS 102 was therefore 1 January 2015. There were no material adjustments recorded 
for the transition from UK GAAP to FRS 102. As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure 
exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-based payments, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet 
effective and related party transactions. The Directors’ Report, Corporate Governance Statement and Directors’ Remuneration Report 
disclosures are on pages 91 to 94, 65 and 80 to 90, respectively, of this report. The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis and on the going concern basis as explained in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the 
exception of the merger reserve accounting treatment arising from the Scheme of Arrangement in 2014; see Note 8 for further details.
The Company’s financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the Company’s functional currency. 
PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
As permitted by FRS 102, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the period and show a single 
statement of comprehensive income. The Company’s revenue for the year is £nil, and profit after tax for the year is £28.5m (2014: £141.6m).
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Where the recoverable amount of the investment 
is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.

On 30 May 2014 under a Scheme of Arrangement between Old Informa, the former holding company of the Group, and its 
Shareholders, under Article 125 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, and as sanctioned by the Royal Court of Jersey, all the 
issued shares in Old Informa were cancelled and an equivalent number of new shares in Old Informa were issued to Informa PLC 
(“the Company”) in consideration for the allotment to Shareholders of one Ordinary Share in the Company for each Ordinary Share 
in Old Informa that they held on the record date, 29 May 2014.
The Company was incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 on 24 January 2014, as a private company limited by shares with the 
name Informa Limited and re-registered on 14 May 2014 as a public company limited by shares called Informa PLC. The Company 
became the Parent Company of the Informa Group and the previous Parent Company, Old Informa, was renamed Informa 
Switzerland Limited. 
The Company was incorporated with an issued share capital of £2 divided into two Ordinary Shares of 100p each which were taken 
by the subscribers and were paid up in full in cash. On 13 May 2014 the two Ordinary Shares of 100p each were converted into two 
Redeemable Deferred Shares of 100p each and an additional 49,998 Redeemable Deferred Shares were issued to the subscribers. 
The 50,000 issued Redeemable Deferred Shares of 100p each were redeemed on 11 June 2014.
On 13 May 2014 one Ordinary Share of 435p in the Company was issued and subsequently cancelled on 30 May 2014. Under the 
Scheme of Arrangement 603,941,249 Ordinary Shares of 435p each in the Company were allotted to Shareholders on 30 May 2014. 
On 4 June 2014 the nominal value per share of the issued share capital of the Company was reduced from 435p per share to 0.1p per 
share pursuant to sections 645 to 649 of the Companies Act 2006. On 18 November 2014, the Company also issued 45,000,000 
Ordinary Shares of 0.1p for consideration of £207 .0m. This resulted in issued share capital of £0.6m, comprising 681,941,249 issued 
and fully paid shares, at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015.

PROTECTING YOUR INVESTMENT FROM SHARE REGISTER FRAUD
Over the last few years a number of companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls  
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically from brokers who target existing shareholders offering to sell 
what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. They can be extremely persuasive and very persistent. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation.
• Check that they are properly authorised by the FCA before getting involved. You can check at www.fca.org.uk.
• Report the matter to the FCA by completing an online form at www.fca.org.uk. 
• Inform Computershare on +44 (0)370 707 1679.
TIPS ON PROTECTING YOUR SHAREHOLDING
• Ensure that all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
• Keep all correspondence from Computershare in a safe place, or destroy correspondence by shredding it.
• If you change address inform Computershare. If you receive a letter from Computershare regarding a change of address and you 
have not recently moved, contact them immediately.
• Know when the dividends are paid and consider having your dividend paid directly into your bank. If you change your bank account, 
inform Computershare of the details of your new account. Respond to any letters Computershare send to you about this.
• If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers registered in the UK or in your country of residence.

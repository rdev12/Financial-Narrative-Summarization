FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2015
The financial data presented in the Overview and Strategic 
report is taken from the Investment basis financial 
statements. The Investment basis is described on page 33 
and the differences from, and the reconciliation to, the IFRS 
Audited financial statements are detailed on pages 33 to 37 .
The key measures of total return and NAV are equal under 
both bases.
TOTAL RETURN  
ON EQUITY
20%
The strong performance across all three 
businesses generated an increase in NAV  
per share to 396p (2014: 348p).
PRIVATE EQUITY
REALISATION PROCEEDS
£831 m
CASH INVESTED
£369 m
Good investment returns of 24% were driven 
by strong earnings growth and realisations 
which generated a 27% uplift over opening 
value (excluding refinancings).
We continued to invest selectively, focused 
on our core sectors and expertise, and 
committed £369m, of which £328m was 
in four new investments.
INFRASTRUCTURE 
GROSS INVESTMENT RETURN
20%
CASH INCOME
£47 m
Gross investment return of £96m benefited 
from a total shareholder return of 25% 
delivered by 3iN, which was driven by the sale 
of Eversholt Rail and value uplifts across the 
Core infrastructure portfolio.
AUM growth and strong investment 
performance led to a 4% increase in advisory 
fee and dividend cash income to £47m.
DEBT MANAGEMENT 
AUM RAISED
£2.4bn
FEE INCOME
£34m
Active fundraising with six new CLOs closed, 
a €250m first close on our European Middle-
Market Loan Fund and a further $78m of  
AUM added to our US Senior Loan fund.
Fee income improved by 6% to £34m 
(2014: £32m) following the 12% growth  
in AUM.
ASSETS UNDER  
MANAGEMENT (“AUM”)
£1 3.5bn
AUM increased by 4% to £13.5bn  
(2014: £12.9bn) as the ongoing fundraising 
momentum in Debt Management offset the net 
divestment seen in Private Equity. 
OPERATING CASH  
PROFIT
£28m
Cash income grew by 20% to £158m, due to 
the 12% growth in Debt Management AUM, 
improved portfolio income cash generation in 
Private Equity and dividend proceeds from 3i 
Infrastructure plc (“3iN”).
Demonstrating the improved operational 
efficiency in the business, income exceeded 
costs by £28m (2014: £5m).

When I joined 3i in 2010, I believed that it 
was fundamentally a strong business 
which had not recovered purpose and 
direction since the financial crisis. The 
appointment of Simon Borrows as Chief 
Executive in 2012, and the subsequent 
strategic review, resulted in a clear set  
of objectives designed to enable 3i to 
generate long-term value through the 
economic cycle. 3i has focused back to its 
core sectors and geographies, underpinned 
by a strengthened investment process  
and by a disciplined approach to cost 
management. I am pleased to report that 
Simon and his management team have 
made excellent progress against these 
objectives and the 3i of today is a more 
resilient and high performing operation.
PERFORMANCE
In 2015 all three businesses contributed to the good 
performance. Against an unstable macro-economic 
environment and geo-political landscape we generated 
strong realisations of £841 million (2014: £677 million).  
We added four new companies to our Private Equity 
portfolio with total cash invested of £369 million  
(2014: £276 million). With significant levels of capital 
searching for good investment and returns as well as  
the continuation of central bank measures such as 
quantitative easing, we have invested selectively. We have 
focused on companies where our sector expertise and 
international experience can generate enhanced returns. 
Our Infrastructure business performed well and our 
holding in 3i Infrastructure plc delivered a 25% total 
shareholder return, its strongest annual return since  
its IPO in 2007 . Debt Management benefited from a very 
good year of fund raising in its CLO funds and, in an 
important diversification, launched a €250 million 
European Middle Market Loan fund.
DIVIDEND
The Board has declared a total dividend of 20.0p (2014: 
20.0p) for 2015. This is made up of an 8.1p base dividend 
and an 1 1.9p additional dividend, making a total of 20.0p for 
the year after taking into account the interim dividend paid 
in January 2015. Due to net divestment in the year and our 
robust balance sheet, we have proposed an additional 
dividend above the top end of our 15% – 20% distribution 
range, equivalent to 23% of gross realised proceeds. 
Subject to shareholder approval, we will pay the final 
dividend of 14.0p (2014: 13.3p) in July 2015.
OUTLOOK
We remain cautious about the current environment.  
Many financial markets are at or near all time highs and 
currencies are subject to increased volatility. We are 
focused on enhancing the value of our existing investment 
portfolio as well as pursuing investment opportunities if 
the strategic and financial case is strong. 
BOARD CHANGES
I will be stepping down as Chairman after the AGM in June 
2015. The Board has announced that Simon Thompson  
will succeed me as Chairman. Simon is an experienced 
FTSE 100 chairman and non-executive director. He joined 
the Board in April and will take over from me in June. It 
has been a great privilege to serve in the role of Chairman 
over the last five years as 3i has progressively recovered 
its poise, and I am confident that, in its 70th year, I am 
leaving the Group in very capable hands. 
I wish 3i, its employees, investors and all of its 
stakeholders every success for the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
 “ This has been a strong year for 3i with all 
three of our businesses performing well.  
We have reshaped our business model 
and our shareholders are benefiting from 
attractive returns and dividends. We look 
forward with confidence.”
INTRODUCTION
We are now at the end of our three-year 
restructuring and have met or exceeded  
all of the priorities set out in our scorecard. 
Since 2012, we have made considerable 
progress by streamlining and refocusing  
3i into a more resilient business capable  
of generating long-term value through the 
economic cycle. This is reflected in this 
year’s strong performance and good 
progress against all of the Group’s KPIs 
over the last three years. 
This year’s financial results build on the momentum 
established last year. 3i generated a total shareholder 
return of 27%, compared to 6% for the FTSE 100. All three 
of our businesses performed well and contributed to the 
Group’s total return on shareholders’ funds of 20% (2014: 
16%) and 14% increase in NAV per share to 396p (31 March 
2014: 348p). The strong performance was achieved 
despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, with the 
euro alone depreciating by 13% against sterling, reducing 
the NAV per share by 12 pence.
HOW WE PERFORMED IN THE YEAR
Private Equity had another very successful year, 
generating a gross investment return of £719 million,  
or 24% on opening value (2014: £647 million, 24%).  
This reflected strong earnings growth and a flow of 
realisations ahead of our expectations at this time  
last year. Earnings growth of 19% was driven by our  
larger assets such as Action, Element and Basic-Fit,  
and a significant reduction in investments with  
declining earnings. 
During the year, our Private Equity team generated  
total proceeds of £831 million (2014: £669 million) from 
realisations. These included £155 million returned as a 
result of refinancings (2014: £59 million). Favourable debt 
markets have allowed us to enhance capital structures 
and introduce higher leverage in a number of our best 
performing and highly cash generative assets. Despite 
this, average debt to EBITDA within the portfolio remained 
stable at 3.1x (2014: 3.1x). Proceeds from refinancings  
are generally returned as a repayment of shareholder 
loans, and do not usually generate a profit over value. 
Excluding refinancings, we realised profits of £144 million 
over opening valuation, an overall uplift of 27%, from a 
combination of asset sales and IPOs (2014: £190 million, 
45%), including sales of Hilite at 2.1x and Vedici at 2.0x 
original cost. 
In particular, the sustained, constructive market backdrop 
for realisations has meant that we have made very good 
progress in selling some of our smaller, more challenged 
investments and the number of portfolio companies has 
reduced to 65 at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 81).  
The sale of Azelis, signed in February 2015 and completed 
in May 2015, is an excellent example of the potential for 
recovery, when we are able to focus on more intensive 
asset management. Over the last few years we have 
changed the Chairman and management at Azelis  
and agreed a new plan and financial structure  
which has underpinned its successful recovery and exit.  
We recognised £40 million of value growth in the year  
against an opening value of £26 million at 31 March 2014. 
Simon Borrows 
Chief Executive
05 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT
In strong equity markets, we have also had the opportunity 
to IPO investments such as Eltel, Refresco and Phibro.  
We generated £273 million in proceeds from quoted equity 
sales at, or post, IPO. Strong performance from our quoted 
portfolio, including prior listings such as Quintiles, has 
meant that the Private Equity quoted portfolio generated 
£177 million in value growth and realised profits of 49% 
on the opening value.
Notwithstanding the strong overall performance, our 
portfolio companies are not immune to wider macro 
issues and we had to reduce the value of one investment 
materially during the course of the year. Inspecta, which 
had been impacted by the economic environment in 
Finland and Russia, declined in value by £32 million during 
the year. We announced the sale of Inspecta in April 2015 
and expect it to complete in the first half of FY2016,  
with proceeds in line with our 31 March 2015 valuation.
Although we have continued to be net divestors, we have 
maintained the investment momentum started in FY2014. 
Our approach remains selective, as the availability of 
competing capital can quickly move prices outside our 
target returns. However, our sector and market expertise 
has continued to deliver attractive opportunities during the 
year. We invested in two US headquartered businesses,  
Q Holding and Dynatect, and a UK business, Aspen Pumps, 
which have ambitious plans to grow internationally. 
Together with our Eurofund V investors, we also invested 
in Christ, a German-based jewellery retailer, alongside our 
existing investment in Amor. During the year our portfolio 
companies made over 20 acquisitions, representing a 
combined enterprise value of over €400 million, funded 
almost entirely out of the companies’ own finances. These 
acquisitions are an important part of building the strategic 
value of our portfolio companies, including delivering their 
international growth potential. In total we made cash 
investments of £457 million, of which £369 million was  
3i’s proprietary capital (2014: £372 million, £276 million). 
We continue to review a wide number of opportunities, but 
many are not pursued if we judge that the sale price is 
likely to move beyond where we see value.
Our longer term hold investments now account for 
approximately 50% of our portfolio value, and their strong 
performance, together with realisations, has led to 
material improvement in Eurofund V and the Growth 
Capital Fund, with multiples of 1.4x and 1.7x of invested 
capital respectively (31 March 2014: 1.1x, 1.3x respectively).
Infrastructure had a good year as gross investment return 
increased to £96 million, or 20% (2014: £2 million, 0%). The 
European portfolio continued to perform well and the 
dividends and advisory fees from 3iN generated a good 
level of cash income for the Group. 
3iN’s total shareholder return was 25% in the year, 
following the highly successful sale of its holding in 
Eversholt Rail. This transaction demonstrates how 
competitive the environment for large European Core 
infrastructure investments has become, as sovereign 
wealth and pension funds increase their investment 
appetite in the face of prolonged low interest rates. The 
team achieved a good level of new investment for 3iN, 
with £1 14 million of total investment commitments in the 
year (2014: £80 million). The Infrastructure team used its 
expertise gained through an existing investment in 
Oystercatcher and its strong relationship with Oiltanking 
to invest €107 million in two oil storage facilities in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. The team also completed five 
PPP deals, committing a total of £37 million. 
3iN has a portfolio of high quality Core infrastructure 
assets and this is reflected in significant increases in value 
in addition to Eversholt Rail. Core infrastructure accounted 
for 83% of 3iN’s total investments at 31 March 2015. 
3i has recognised £30 million of advisory and 
management fees (2014: £24 million) and £45 million of 
performance fees during the period (2014: nil). £35 million 
of these fees was accrued as carry payable to the 
investment team (2014: nil). This carry will be paid out to 
the team over a number of years.
The more favourable credit markets ensured that  
Debt Management had a good year of fundraising, 
launching six CLOs in Europe and North America and 
increasing AUM by 12% to £7 .2 billion (31 March 2014: 
£6.5 billion). The team also launched a European Middle 
Market Loan Fund with an investment mandate that 
permits a wider range of investments, typically investing in 
smaller businesses than CLOs. In the US, our Senior Loan 
Fund passed the $100 million milestone which has created 
more investor interest in the product. Both initiatives were 
important steps in diversifying the business beyond CLOs 
and generating additional fee income. In total, Debt 
Management recognised fee income of £34 million in 
FY2015 (2014: £32 million), as new fundraising offset the 
effect of the run-off of older funds. 
The CLO markets are subject to increased regulatory 
change. Regulators in Europe have mandated that CLO 
managers hold a minimum amount of capital investments 
in their products. The US market has introduced a similar 
practice although the corresponding legislation does not 
come into force until December 2016. 3i is well placed to 
comply with these changes given its proprietary capital.  
3i supported the development of the business and invested 
£79 million in new CLOs in the year (2014: £40 million). 
These equity investments generate a good cash yield 
which, together with the fee income, is an important 
component of our operating cash profit. 
Chief Executive’s review continued
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 06 STRATEGIC REPORT
In 2012 we were operating with a substantial annual 
operating cash loss and, as this was diluting capital 
returns to investors, we set a KPI to achieve an  
operating cash profit. We undertook a significant 
transformation programme, focusing on recurring fee 
income and operational efficiencies and as a result, in 
FY2014, we recorded a first annual profit of £5 million.  
This measure improved significantly to £28 million  
in FY2015. All of the businesses have contributed to 
increased cash income with additional fundraising in  
Debt Management and strong portfolio income from 
Private Equity and Infrastructure. Operating expenses  
also declined in FY2015 to £131 million or 1.0% of AUM 
(2014: £136 million, 1.0%). These costs included £12 million 
relating to acquisitions made since 2012 and £1 million  
of restructuring costs (2014: £6 million, £9 million).  
To reflect increased activity levels, we have recruited  
to support origination in both Private Equity and 
Infrastructure and fundraising in Debt Management.  
The Group has also now launched a Graduate Programme 
and will welcome its first graduates in the Autumn. 
Looking forward, further cost efficiencies are not expected 
and expenses will increase marginally as the businesses 
continue to grow. 
Maintaining the profitability of the combined fund 
management platform is a key component of operating 
cash profit. This measure improved in the year, as Debt 
Management’s fundraising offset the expected decline in 
Private Equity fees as a result of its strong realisations. 
Actual fund management profit grew strongly to 
£26 million, with a margin of 21% (2014: £19 million, 15%). 
Underlying profit, after restructuring and acquisition costs, 
was stable at £33 million, with a margin of 26% (2014: 
£33 million, 26%).
Reflecting our confidence in the future growth and cash 
generation capacity of the business, we have announced a 
final dividend ahead of our established guidance. We 
propose to pay a total dividend for the year of 20 pence per 
share (2014: 20 pence per share). This results in a final 
dividend for 2015 of 14.0p, subject to shareholder approval.
Our financial performance is reviewed in more detail on 
pages 21 to 32. 
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IN THE LAST 
THREE YEARS
To strengthen 3i both commercially and financially,  
our emphasis has been on asset management, cash 
generation, cost control and fund management margins. 
We have now completed our transformation programme 
and our performance against our June 2012 objectives  
is summarised on the page overleaf and detailed below.
The six asset management initiatives were an essential 
part of the strategic plan as Private Equity is, and will 
continue to be, the biggest contributor to value growth for 
the Group. Since 2012 we have rebalanced the Private 
Equity business, selling off non-core or underperforming 
assets and refocusing on a smaller number of high growth 
middle-market companies. Over the longer term we aim to 
have a portfolio of fewer than 40 investments and, to date, 
we have made very good progress. The number of assets 
has reduced to 65 at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2012: 124) 
and 89% of assets by value are now held in our core 
geographies of northern Europe and North America 
(31 March 2012: 77%). The improvement in asset 
management is also producing quantifiable results.  
Unrealised value growth over the last three years has 
principally been driven by earnings which have improved 
to 19% in 2015 (2012: 9%). This was driven by excellent 
performance in our largest assets and a material 
reduction in smaller and non-core assets with negative 
earnings growth. 22% of the portfolio by value at 31 March 
2012 had negative earnings growth compared to 7% at 
31 March 2015. Early indications on the new investments 
made since 2012 are very promising. 
This stronger portfolio of assets was valued at an average 
of 10.5x EBITDA (post discount) at 31 March 2015 
compared to 14.6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250.
The Group’s AUM has increased by 9% per annum to 
£13.5 billion at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2012: £10.5 billion) 
predominantly driven by Infrastructure and Debt 
Management. Infrastructure acquired a PPP platform in 
2013, which is delivering deal flow to 3iN, and Debt 
Management expanded in the US via an acquisition in 2012. 
Debt Management, in particular, has successfully raised 
new funds in both Europe and the US in the last two years. 
A critical part of our strategic plan was to reduce the 
operating cost base in order to use shareholders’ capital 
for distribution or reinvestment. Against a March 2012 
run-rate cost base of £185 million, we achieved savings of 
£70 million and reduced costs to 1.0% of AUM (2012: 1.6%). 
Headcount reduced by 45% to 240 at 31 March 2015, 
excluding acquisitions, and 276 including acquisitions 
(31 March 2012: 435).

In 2012 we set out a target capital allocation model to 
rebalance returns to our investors. Over the last three 
years we have generated £2,124 million of realisation 
proceeds, invested £766 million in new Private Equity 
investments, and £189 million to support Debt 
Management fundraising. Following the reduction of gross 
debt of £542 million, we initiated an enhanced shareholder 
distribution policy in July 2013. Including the proposed final 
dividend for this year, we will have returned £506 million  
of dividends to shareholders, whilst reaching a net cash 
position and maintaining a robust balance sheet to support 
longer term net asset growth. 
At the end of our three-year restructuring, the Group 
has three diverse, but complementary, businesses 
underpinned by the expertise of our people and 
differentiated by our selective investment approach 
and disciplined focus on returns. 
OUR BUSINESS TODAY
Today 3i offers a differentiated and attractive value 
proposition. By combining proprietary capital investing  
and the management of third-party capital, our business 
model generates capital returns and recurring fund 
management income. 3i is the largest single investor in its 
Private Equity and Infrastructure funds and this ensures 
that the interests of our shareholders, our fund investors  
and co-investors are aligned. It also enables us to retain  
a material share of the “alpha-generating” returns from 
mid-market private equity and infrastructure investing. 
Recurring management fee income contributes to the 
financial resilience of the business and eliminates the 
capital dilution caused by the costs of running the 
business. Capital growth and regular dividends evidence 
our progress and provide long-term value for our 
shareholders.
In Private Equity, our strong international network of  
local investment teams and proven ability to develop 
businesses internationally allows us to build credibility 
with management and vendors. Our proprietary capital 
affords us flexibility and speed, which differentiates our 
competitive position. 
Combining our focus on driving operational excellence 
within our portfolio companies and an institutional 
approach to the process of investment management 
supports our strategic objective to achieve our target of 
at least 2x our money invested over three to five years. 
Monetary policy across the developed world has led  
to an abundance of equity and debt capital chasing  
a limited supply of investment opportunities. So the 
principal constraint on our activity is investment 
opportunity at sensible prices. We expect to invest  
in four to seven new investments a year and commit  
€500 – €750 million. But we will only do this if investments 
meet our demanding strategic and financial criteria.  
Given the strength of the Group’s financial position,  
and the scale of potential investment, we intend to fund 
this activity principally from proprietary capital.  
As a result, we have decided not to initiate a new  
third-party fundraising in the short to medium term, 
notwithstanding our improved performance. 
The impact of central bank intervention on sovereign 
wealth and pension fund managers’ appetite for 
infrastructure investing is expected to persist. Although 
the Infrastructure team is actively participating in bidding 
processes, our priority, as investment adviser to 3iN, is to 
maintain a disciplined approach to new investments.  
The team continues to monitor and review opportunities in 
adjacent markets, including new sectors and geographies. 
In the meantime, significant value growth in the existing 
portfolio is supporting 3iN’s NAV appreciation and the 
business will continue to be an important contributor  
to our fund management profitability and to operating 
cash profit. 
Our Debt Management business is principally a fund 
management platform; its calls on 3i’s proprietary capital 
are limited to regulatory requirements and seed capital for 
new product development. Aided by the positive market 
conditions throughout FY2014 and FY2015, our US and 
European teams were very successful in raising new 
funds. We expect this general environment to persist as 
banks continue to actively manage their lending exposures 
by syndicating assets to alternative funds such as CLOs. 
The current appetite for yield is also supportive for our 
new product offerings such as the European Middle 
Market Loan Fund and the US Senior Loan Fund.
OUTLOOK
3i is demonstrably a more resilient business, both 
commercially and financially, than it was when we started 
the restructuring three years ago. The focus we have 
placed on embedding institutional quality investment 
management processes throughout the businesses and 
our ongoing cost discipline has generated real results.  
We are confident that this, along with the expertise and 
integrity of our people, will underpin our aim to generate 
attractive shareholder returns through the cycle. 
None of this progress would have been possible without 
the dedication and hard work of the 3i team. I would like  
to thank them for their application and good work over the 
period to bring 3i back to today’s healthy position. I would 
also like to take this opportunity to thank Sir Adrian 
Montague, our departing Chairman. He has been a 
pleasure to work with over the last three years and he  
has revamped our Board in line with the restructuring  
of the Group. 
We look to the future with confidence in the knowledge 
that there is still much more to achieve at 3i.

STRATEGIC REPORT
11 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 STRATEGIC REPORT
How we performed
Rationale
GIR is how we measure the performance 
of proprietary investments portfolio 
 
 
2015 progress
  Strong Private Equity performance 
demonstrates the benefits of the asset 
management improvement initiatives
  Good flow of Private Equity realisations 
delivered realised profits over opening 
value of £144m representing an uplift  
of 27% (excluding refinancings)
  Value uplifts and realisations from the 
European infrastructure portfolio led to 
a material increase in the value of 3iN
  Negative foreign exchange movements 
in the year of £154m on our investment 
portfolio 
 
Key risks
  Investment rate or quality of 
investments is lower than expected 
  Subdued M&A activity and high pricing 
in 3i’s core markets could impact the 
timing of exits, cash returns and 
investments
  Operational underperformance 
of portfolio companies impacting 
earnings growth and valuations
  Failure to invest in people to support  
our activities
Rationale
NAV is a measure of the fair value of our 
proprietary investments after the net costs 
of operating the business 
 
2015 progress
  Good progression in NAV per share 
to 396p, up 14% over the year
  Strong Private Equity and Infrastructure 
GIR, the primary contributors to 48p 
NAV growth
  Sterling materially strengthened against 
the euro in the year, offset by its 
weakening against the US dollar, 
resulting in a net translation loss of 
£1 14m on net assets in the year, which 
reduced NAV by 12p 
 
 
 
Key risks
  G20 political and economic uncertainty 
affects 3i’s core markets, impacts 
valuations and increases foreign 
exchange volatility
  Unplanned increase in cost base  
eg due to regulatory changes
Rationale
TSR measures the return to our 
shareholders through the change in  
share price and dividends paid during 
the period  
2015 progress
  TSR of 27% reflecting an increase in 
share price from 398p at close 28 March 
2014 to 482p at close 31 March 2015,  
the final FY2014 dividend of 13.3p paid  
in July 2014 and the interim FY2015 
dividend of 6.0p paid in January 2015
  Good flow of realisations and strong 
balance sheet resulted in proposed 
additional dividend of 1 1.9p per share  
for the year over base annual dividend  
of 8.1p per share, bringing the total for 
FY2015 to 20.0p per share 
 
 
Key risks
  Lower NAV due to investment  
underperformance or political and 
economic uncertainty
  Volatility in equity markets 
  The appeal of our business model 
  Regulatory or legal change materially 
affecting one or more of the Group’s 
businesses

AUM forms the basis on which 
management fee income is generated. 
For funds out of their reinvestment period, 
this is measured at residual cost 
2015 progress
  Total AUM grew by 4% to £13.5bn
  Growth in third-party AUM to £10.2bn 
(75% of total AUM)
  New funds raised in the year included 
six new CLOs and the first close of a 
€250m European Middle Market Loan 
Fund which offset the effect of Private 
Equity realisations and the normal 
attrition in Debt Management as 
funds mature
  Proprietary Capital AUM stable at £3.3bn 
as the good flow of Private Equity 
realisations largely replaced with 
new investments 
Key risks
  Portfolio performance is  
weak or impacted by a legal,  
macroeconomic/political  
conditions and/or regulatory event
  Regulatory change limits 3i’s ability  
to raise third-party capital
Rationale
Underlying Fund Management profit allows 
us to assess the performance of our Fund 
Management business 
 
2015 progress
  Underlying Fund Management profit 
remained stable at £33m in the year, 
as reduced fees from Private Equity 
were offset by growth in fees from 
Debt Management and Infrastructure
  Divestment activity led to a reduction of 
8% in Private Equity AUM and a 
reduction in total fee income (including 
synthetic fee) of 14%
  Infrastructure fee income increased by 
25% as we recognised a full year of 
income from the BIFM PPP funds
  Debt Management AUM increased by 
12% and fee income increased by 6% 
Key risks
  G20 political and economic uncertainty 
affects investment opportunity or 
fundraising appetite 
  Adverse fluctuations in financial 
markets impact our fee-based 
businesses
  Regulatory change adds to 3i’s cost base
Rationale
Covering the annual cost of running our 
business with the annual cash income 
eliminates capital return dilution 
 
2015 progress
  Operating cash profit improved

Financial performance is summarised in the Chief Executive’s review 
and reported in detail in the Financial review.

Private Equity
 “ A strong performance across  
all aspects of the business,  
including £457 million of  
investment.”
Alan Giddins and Menno Antal 
Managing Partners and Co-heads of Private Equity
BUSINESS LINES
Private Equity is the largest contributor 
to the Proprietary Capital returns; 
accounting for 81% of the Proprietary 
Capital portfolio at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: 82%). The portfolio’s 
performance was strong in the year; 
driven by growth of 19% in earnings 
and good realisations, through sales and 
IPOs as well as refinancings. The gross 
investment return was £719 million for  
the year, or 24% on the opening portfolio 
(2014: £647 million, 24%).
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
We increased the amount of investment in the year and 
completed four new transactions. In total £457 million was 
invested; including £369 million of 3i’s Proprietary Capital 
(2014: three, £372 million, £276 million). 
Each new investment demonstrates our origination and 
investment execution strengths. We invested in Q Holding 
and Dynatect, which are both leading US headquartered 
industrial businesses with clear strategies to accelerate 
their growth internationally. Our sector focus and proven 
experience in achieving international growth and 
diversification, recently demonstrated by Mold-Masters 
and Hilite, were important as key differentiators against 
competing US private equity firms for both investments.
We also invested in Christ, a German-based jewellery 
retailer, and Aspen Pumps, a UK-based specialist 
manufacturer of condensate removal pumps. Christ was 
acquired through Eurofund V, alongside our investment in 
Amor. We had followed Christ as a potential target since 
late 2012. This positioned us well when the process 
started, allowing us to move quickly and secure the 
investment. Similarly, we had followed Aspen since early 
2014, allowing us to develop a good understanding of the 
business and broader market environment as well as build 
relationships with management, which gave us good 
insight when a sales process was initiated.
In June 2014, we took the opportunity to purchase a small 
additional stake in Eurofund V at the 31 March 2014 NAV, 
adjusted for cash flows, which further increased our 
exposure to investments we know well.
An important part of building the strategic value of our 
portfolio companies, including achieving international 
expansion, is an active acquisition programme. Our 
portfolio companies made over 20 acquisitions in the year, 
with a combined enterprise value of over €400 million, 
primarily funded from the companies’ own cash and 
banking facilities.

REALISATIONS ACTIVITY
Realisations, refinancings and IPOs generated £831 million 
of proceeds during the year. Excluding refinancings of 
£155 million, this represented an uplift over opening value 
of £144 million, or 27% (2014: £190 million, 45%). The uplift 
was lower than the prior year due to a number of 
investments being valued on an imminent sales basis at 
31 March 2014. Proceeds from refinancings are 
usually recognised primarily as a repayment of 
shareholder loans with minimal uplifts as a result.
In addition to the number of notable larger exits and IPOs, 
we continued to sell smaller and non-core assets. At 
31 March 2015, there were 65 investments in the Private 
Equity portfolio, down from 81 at 31 March 2014. In the 
longer term, we expect to hold a portfolio of fewer than 40 
Private Equity investments.

ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
AUM declined to £3.8 billion at 31 March 2015 (31 March 
2014: £4.1 billion) as a result of net divestment activity. 
AUM is calculated as the original cost of our managed 
portfolio and, while this has reduced, the value of the 
portfolio has increased to £4.8 billion (2014: £4.6 billion) as 
a result of strong value growth.
The performance of Eurofund V and the Growth Capital 
Fund continued to improve with money multiples at 
31 March 2015 of 1.4x and 1.7x respectively (31 March 
2014: 1.1x, 1.3x). The investments made in the second half 
of Eurofund V, post 2010, are showing a particularly 
strong performance, with a money multiple of 2.6x 
at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 2.1x).
The Group is well placed to fund the current level of 
activity from current resources and future realisations. 
Consequently we have no plans to initiate a new Private 
Equity fundraising in the short to medium term, 
notwithstanding the success of the team in improving 
the performance of our most recent funds. 
The results of the business have been delivered by an 
internationally cohesive team, further strengthened by 
recruitment at associate level in the year.

Infrastructure
BUSINESS LINES
Infrastructure generates returns for 
Proprietary Capital, primarily through our 
holding in 3iN, and Fund Management 
returns from advisory and management 
fees from 3iN, PPP funds and the legacy 
India Infrastructure fund. 
Infrastructure performed strongly in the year with a gross 
investment return of £96 million, or 20% on the opening 
portfolio (2014: £2 million, 0%). The business generated 
£30 million (2014: £24 million) of advisory and 
management fees across its funds and £10 million  
of net performance fees (2014: nil).
INVESTMENT ADVISER TO 3iN 
In its capacity as 3iN’s investment adviser, 3i advised on 
six new investments including the acquisition of holdings 
in two further oil storage facilities and a number of 
primary PPP projects. In total, 3iN committed £1 14 million 
to new investment in 2015 (2014: £80 million).
We also advised 3iN on the exit of its holding in Eversholt 
Rail, one of the three leading rail rolling stock companies 
in the UK. Eversholt Rail was acquired by 3iN in December 
2010 as part of a consortium. In January 2015, all of the 
consortium partners agreed to sell the business. This 
resulted in proceeds of approximately £381 million for 3iN, 
inclusive of a £15 million dividend received by 3iN in 
December 2014. This compares to a 31 March 2014 
valuation of £160 million.
In July 2014, 3iN’s shareholders approved a number of 
amendments to its Investment Advisory Agreement with 
3i. These included the extension of the fixed term of the 
agreement for a period of four years, with one year’s 
rolling notice thereafter.
Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement,  
3i received an advisory fee of £1 7 million (2014: £16 million) 
and a NAV-based performance fee of £45 million (2014: 
nil), of which £34 million (2014: nil) is accrued as payable  
to the team. Actual payments will be made over a number 
of years. A further £1 million in performance fees payable 
to the team has been accrued as a result of performance 
of other reward schemes. 
3iN PERFORMANCE
In addition to its role as investment adviser, 3i holds a 34% 
(2014: 34%) stake in 3iN. 3iN performed strongly in the 
year; the share price increased by 19% to 160 pence at 
31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: 135 pence) and it delivered 
a 25% total shareholder return in the year, the strongest 
annual return since the IPO in 2007 . 
In total, 3i’s investment in 3iN contributed £77 million of 
value growth (2014: £5 million) and £20 million of dividend 
income in 2015 (2014: £21 million). This uplift was 
underpinned by the exit of Eversholt Rail, and value growth 
across its Core infrastructure portfolio, supported by the 
continued returns compression and consequent reduction 
in discount rates applied.
ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT
Due to the growth in 3iN’s NAV, AUM increased to 
£2.5 billion (31 March 2014: £2.3 billion). 3iN’s strong 
performance offset a small value reduction in the India 
Infrastructure Fund following the first realisations of 
investments in the Fund, and where the portfolio continues 
to face a number of challenges. 3i’s share of the Indian 
portfolio is now valued at £64 million (2014: £75 million).
In line with our strategy to grow Infrastructure’s 
contribution to our Fund Management profits, we continue 
to explore opportunities to grow AUM. Our acquisition of 
BIFM in 2013 broadened the Infrastructure team’s skill set 
and market access and, as the business grows, we expect 
to continue to enhance both our investment and support 
capabilities.
 “The business delivered a  
strong result, driven by the  
performance of its investment  
in 3i Infrastructure plc.”

Debt Management
Debt Management is principally a Fund 
Management business which primarily 
generates returns through managing 
third-party capital through CLOs and other 
senior debt focused funds. We also 
generate Proprietary Capital returns from 
3i’s investment in funds managed by Debt 
Management. Such investments are made 
to support new products or for regulatory 
purposes and totalled £105 million during 
the year (2014: £61 million). 
The Debt Management team had a good year of 
fundraising, closing six new CLOs and a new €250 million 
European Middle Market Loan Fund. AUM grew to 
£7 .2 billion at the end of the year (31 March 2014: 
£6.5 billion) as £2.4 billion of new AUM was offset by 
run-off and foreign exchange movements of £1.7 billion  
of AUM. The business generated £34 million of fee income 
in the year (2014: £32 million).
FUNDRAISING ACTIVITY
In the year the team closed three CLOs in Europe and three 
in the US, raising a total of £2.2 billion new CLO AUM. We 
continue to operate CLO warehouse vehicles in both 
Europe and the US ahead of establishing new CLO 
vehicles. We also held a first close of the European Middle 
Market Loan Fund at €250 million, entirely with third-party 
funds. This is a new fund established to invest in smaller 
businesses than we typically target in the CLOs and is an 
important diversification.
The US Senior Loan Fund, an open-ended fund, performed 
strongly and outperformed its benchmarks in the year. 
AUM increased to $157 million at 31 March 2015 (31 March 
2014: $79 million).
The team was able to take advantage of strong CLO 
markets and grow AUM without increasing resource in the 
year but is likely to require some incremental additional 
resource for further AUM growth, particularly as we look 
to diversify and grow our non-CLO product offering.
Table 4 details Debt Management AUM.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
The regulatory environment continues to evolve. European 
regulation now in force requires CLO sponsors or 
originators to retain a 5% minimum stake in each CLO 
raised. Similar rules are being introduced in the US and 
many new US CLOs are being structured to comply with 
both the European rules and the future US rules. This is 
concentrating the CLO market to those managers with 
access to long-term capital, such as 3i, but it is also giving 
rise to new business models and vehicles to support 
future CLOs, which 3i continues to monitor.
VALUATIONS AND INCOME 
Debt Management generated a negative gross investment 
return of £10 million (2014: £16 million profit), primarily as 
a result of an unrealised value reduction of £25 million 
during the year (2014: £10 million gain). As noted above,  
3i is required to hold at least 5% of the European CLOs it 
manages. We typically invest in the most junior ranked 
level subordinated notes, which we account for as equity 
given its characteristics. During the year, we typically 
invested at or near par in the most junior ranked 
subordinated notes to satisfy the 5% holding requirement. 
In most cases, third-party investors have invested at a 
discount to 3i’s investment, which sets an external 
reference point for valuation. This resulted in a fair value 
reduction of £5 million in the year. Value also reduced as a 
result of strong distributions from the CLO portfolio; 
£16 million of income was recognised. Finally, in our older 
European CLOs and Palace Street 1, there were a small 
number of underlying assets that were restructured in the 
year, contributing to value losses. 
The performance of all of the CLOs launched in the last 
two years is very good, with early performance ahead of 
plan. There were no defaults and distributions are 
providing an annualised yield of between 8% and 20%.

Financial review continued
BASIS
3i adopted IFRS 10 in 2014 as its investment entity 
exception prevented the risk of investment companies, 
such as 3i, having to consolidate their portfolio 
investments.
However, as described in our 2014 Annual Report and 
Accounts, we also report using a non-GAAP “Investment 
basis” as we believe it aids users of our report to assess 
the Group’s underlying operating performance. Total 
return and net assets are the same under the Investment 
basis and IFRS and we provide more detail on IFRS 10, as 
well as a reconciliation of our Investment basis financial 
statements to the audited IFRS statements, at the end of 
this section. 
Total return
The Group generated a total return of £659 million, or 
a profit on opening shareholders’ funds of 19.9% (2014: 
£478 million or 16.3%) in 2015, reflecting further progress 
and achievement of our strategic priorities. Operating 
profit before carry for the Proprietary Capital business 
was £721 million (2014: £539 million). Strong underlying 
portfolio performance generated a gross investment 
return of £805 million, despite negative foreign exchange 
movements on the portfolio of £154 million (2014: 
£665 million and negative £1 13 million). Fund Management 
operating profit before carry was £26 million (2014: 
£19 million). Further details regarding the performance 
during the year is provided below.

PROPRIETARY CAPITAL RETURNS
Operating profit before carry on our Proprietary Capital 
increased by 34% to £721 million (2014: £539 million) due 
to strong value growth in the portfolio and good uplifts on 
realisations. This performance is despite foreign exchange 
losses of £1 14 million (2014: £1 16 million) which have 
principally resulted from the weakening of the euro against 
sterling. 
By business line, the gross investment return on the 
opening portfolio was 24% from Private Equity (2014: 24%) 
and 20% from Infrastructure (2014: 0%) while Debt 
Management recorded a loss of 7% (2014: profit of 20%) as 
a result of mark to market movements which reduced CLO 
equity valuations. Private Equity accounts for 81% of the 
Proprietary Capital portfolio at 31 March 2015 (31 March 
2014: 82%) and remains the primary driver of Proprietary 
Capital returns. 
Realised profits
Realised profits of £162 million in the year to 31 March 
2015 (2014: £202 million) were driven by another year of 
strong exits, with realisation proceeds totalling 
£841 million (2014: £677 million). Realisations, excluding 
refinancings, were achieved at an uplift over opening value 
of 27%, which was lower than the 45% achieved in 2014 
due to a number of assets being valued on an imminent 
sales basis at the beginning of the year. This past year also 
saw a higher level of refinancing activity, which results in 
cash proceeds with limited realised profit but concentrates 
value in the remaining investment. We continue to pursue 
realisations through careful exit planning, and in the 
current environment of high prices, will take advantage of 
opportunities to divest should they arise. 
The majority of the realisations were from the Private 
Equity portfolio, which contributed £831 million (2014: 
£669 million), including £155 million of refinancing 
proceeds (2014: £59 million). Table 2, in the Private Equity 
section, details the Private Equity realisations in the year 
and sets out the accounting uplift reflected in this year’s 
total return and the longer-term cash-to-cash results. The 
Private Equity realisations completed in the year have 
generated a money multiple of 2.0x over their 
investment life.
We also made our first realisation from our Indian 
Infrastructure portfolio, with the partial sale of the quoted 
shares held in Adani Power. This generated £10 million of 
proceeds at an uplift over the opening value of £1 million. 
Unrealised value movements
Unrealised value movement was very positive in the year, 
predominantly due to strong value growth from the Private 
Equity portfolio. The table below summarises the 
revaluation movement by category and each category is 
discussed further below.

Private Equity unrealised value growth 
The Private Equity portfolio performed strongly with value 
growth of £641 million in the year (2014: £478 million). This 
was underpinned by good value weighted earnings growth 
of 19% (2014: 19%) and a multiple increase of 6% (2014: 
20%), following rises in quoted comparable multiples 
during the year and the re-rating of a small number of 
assets. Net debt remained stable at 3.1x EBITDA 
notwithstanding the fact that we took advantage of 
favourable debt conditions to refinance a number of our 
high quality companies (2014: 3.1x). The majority of the 
portfolio (93% by value, 2014: 87%) grew its earnings in the 
year and the larger investments continue to perform 
very well.
Consistent with good performance and strong equity 
markets, our opening quoted portfolio and the successful 
IPOs of Phibro, Eltel, Dphone and Refresco during the year, 
resulted in unrealised value growth of £46 million in 
addition to realised profits of £63 million in the year.

Performance 
Improvements in the performance of the portfolio valued 
on an earnings basis resulted in an increase in value of 
£417 million (2014: £182 million). Value weighted earnings, 
the most relevant measure of NAV impact, increased by 
19% (2014: 19%) in the year. Action, as our largest asset, 
with over 30% earnings growth in the 12 months, is a big 
contributor to this measure. Excluding Action, the earnings 
growth is still a very robust 16% and now includes all our 
recent investments. Acquisitions, principally funded from 
portfolio companies’ balance sheets, contributed 2% of the 
19% growth. 
Although performance overall was good, there were a 
small number of investments where company and 
geography specific issues impacted value. In total, value 
reductions of £44 million, in relation to seven assets, offset 
the general improvement. The largest single negative 
movement related to Inspecta where performance was 
impacted by the economic environment in Finland and 
Russia. Inspecta reduced in value from £34 million at 
31 March 2014 to £6 million at 31 March 2015. After the 
year end, we agreed an exit for this investment which is in 
line with the year-end valuation.
Forecast earnings, used when the forecast EBITDA outlook 
is lower than the last 12 months’ data, were used for only 
two investments at 31 March 2015, representing 6% of the 
portfolio by number and 3% by value (2014: four, 9% by 
number and 3% by value). Chart 1 shows the earnings 
growth rates across the portfolio.
In the case of Action, the Dutch headquartered discount 
retailer, EBITDA for valuation purposes is adjusted to 
reflect a run-rate basis. Action is growing strongly due, in 
part, to its successful store roll-out programme. We 
believe this run-rate methodology fairly reflects the high 
growth characteristics of this business, and therefore its 
maintainable earnings. Following a number of IPOs by 
more directly comparable businesses in the discount retail 
sector in the last 18 months, we have also reviewed the 
valuation comparable set for Action. We have increased 
the EBITDA multiple applied to Action’s run-rate earnings 
to 14.2x pre-liquidity discount and 13.5x post-discount 
(2014: 13.2x, 12.5x). Based on the run-rate earnings and 
capital structure at 31 March 2015, a 1x movement in the 
EBITDA multiple applied would increase or decrease 
Action’s value by £56 million. At £592 million (2014: 
£501 million), Action is the largest Private Equity 
investment by value, representing 19% of the Private 
Equity portfolio (2014: 17%).

Multiple movements 
Equity markets performed strongly throughout the year 
and the average EBITDA multiple in the FTSE 250 
increased by 10% to 14.6x in the year (source: Capital IQ, 
excluding investment companies and banks). As a matter 
of policy, we select an appropriate multiple for each 
investment based on a comparable set of quoted 
companies and adjust these comparable multiple sets with 
discounts and occasionally premiums to take account of 
relevant size, sector, growth and cycle considerations as 
appropriate. Against a strong market backdrop, we have 
continued to apply a high level of adjustments to reflect 
our caution about realistic valuation uplifts.

discount (2014: 10.6x) and 10.5x after liquidity discount 
(2014: 9.9x). This translated into a positive movement in the 
year of £64 million (2014: £216 million), including 
£45 million relating to the Action multiple change. 
Excluding Action, the average EBITDA multiple increased 
by 3% to 10.1x pre discount (2014: 9.8x) and 9.3x (2014: 9 .0x) 
post discount.
Imminent sale
Four exit processes were sufficiently progressed to value 
on an imminent sales basis at 31 March 2015 and the uplift 
to imminent sale was £22 million (2014: £9 million). All four 
have been announced since 31 March 2015 and are: Azelis, 
Inspecta, Touchtunes and Soyaconcept.
Discounted cash flow
The largest investment valued using DCF in the Private 
Equity portfolio is the Danish/German ferry group, 
Scandlines, which recorded value growth of £94 million. 
Scandlines’ largest ferry route, Rødby-Puttgarden, is 
expected to have direct competition from a new tunnel (the 
Fehmarn Belt project) at some point in the future. In light of 
recent public commentary around expected potential 
delays to the opening of this new tunnel, we have moved 
back our assumption for the likely tunnel opening date in 
the latest 31 March 2015 DCF valuation of Scandlines. This 
change, combined with the profitable sale of a JV route in 
the year, were the primary drivers of the increase in the 
value of our investment in Scandlines in the period.
Quoted portfolio
The Private Equity quoted portfolio, including IPOs in the 
year, generated unrealised value growth of £46 million 
(2014: £70 million). The investments in Gain and Phibro 
were fully divested in the year and are noted in the 
realisations table on page 16. Table 8 details the movement 
in the year and closing quoted portfolio. 
Infrastructure unrealised value movement
The Infrastructure portfolio primarily consists of our 34% 
holding in 3iN. 3iN grew strongly in value during the year, 
as a result of the divestment of Eversholt Rail and a 
re-rating of a number of the remaining Core infrastructure 
investments following a year of returns compression in the 
market. 3iN generated value growth of £77 million for  
3i Group in the year, driven by a 19% increase in the share 
price to 160 pence (2014: 135 pence). This was slightly 
offset by further modest falls in value of the Indian 
Infrastructure portfolio as the investments continued to 
face a number of challenges.
Debt Management unrealised value movement
The unrealised value movement in Debt Management 
comprises mark-to-market valuations on both the CLO 
equity and the direct investments held through 
warehouses, the US Senior Loan Fund and Palace Street I.
Of the unrealised loss of £25 million in the year (2014: 
£10 million gain), £22 million has been recognised on CLO 
equity. Three factors have driven the CLO prices. Firstly, as 
funds make distributions, they effectively convert value to 
portfolio income; £16 million of distributions were received 
by 3i in the year. Secondly, new investments into European 
CLOs have typically been made by 3i, as sponsor, at par 
value but other investors often invest at a discount. This 
can result in a fall in value in the short term as the 
independent market prices we source typically trend 
towards the non-sponsor trades. This resulted in a fair 
value reduction of £5 million in the year. Long-term cash 
returns remain unaffected (ie the valuation volatility at the 
time of issue is not considered to be an indicator of 
long-term cash returns of the CLO). Finally, a number of 
the older CLOs had exposure to two poorer performing 
pre-crisis assets, which were restructured in the year and 
further reduced value. 
The remaining £3 million value loss related principally to 
the wind down of Palace Street I, which had exposure to 
the same two restructured assets.

Portfolio income
Income from the portfolio increased by 15% and 
was £1 13 million in the year to 31 March 2015 (2014: 
£98 million) of which £80 million was received in cash 
(2014: £57 million). Dividends of £45 million were received 
(2014: £44 million), including £20 million from 3iN (2014: 
£21 million) and £16 million from Debt Management CLO 
investments (2014: £10 million). Interest income totalled 
£62 million (2014: £50 million), with £56 million (2014: 
£46 million) generated from Private Equity investments 
and £6 million (2014: £4 million) generated from Debt 
Management investments. Approximately 75% of Private 
Equity interest income is capitalised and received on exit, 
although activity in the portfolio during the year resulted in 
a higher element of interest being received as cash.
Net foreign exchange movements
The total net foreign exchange loss of £1 14 million 
(2014: £1 16 million) was driven by the strengthening of 
sterling against the euro (12.5%), Brazilian real (20.9%) and 
Swedish krona (15.7%) resulting in losses of £175 million, 
£6 million and £13 million respectively. Sterling weakened 
against the US dollar (12.4%) and Indian rupee (7 .8%) 
during the year, resulting in gains of £76 million and 
£5 million respectively. The net foreign exchange loss 
reflects losses on non-sterling denominated portfolio 
assets, as well as the translation of non-portfolio net 
assets, including non-sterling cash held at the balance 
sheet date and gross debt. 
As at 31 March 2015, a 1% movement in the euro, US dollar 
and the Swedish krona would give rise to a £16 million, 
£8 million and £1 million movement in total return 
respectively. 
The net assets of the Group by currency are shown in

Proprietary Capital costs
Proprietary Capital costs include 100% of costs in relation 
to the CEO, Group Finance Director and General Counsel 
and elements of finance, IT, property, legal and regulatory, 
strategy and human resources. Operating expenses 
increased by 14% to £32 million (2014: £28 million) as the 
Group recognised the costs of regulatory changes. 
Synthetic fees, as defined in the glossary, of £45 million 
(2014: £51 million) reflect the lower level of Proprietary 
Capital being managed as a result of net divestment 
activity, predominantly in Private Equity. 
Net interest payable
The gross interest paid was £49 million (2014: £54 million) 
and 18% below the target set in 2012 to reduce interest 
paid to £60 million per annum. Included within this year’s 
expense is £1.5 million of arrangement fees in relation to 
the Group’s Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) which were 
written off when it was replaced with a new £350 million 
facility. The new facility will reduce ongoing financing costs 
by £1.5 million per year. 
The current gross debt position is detailed further in the 
Balance Sheet section of this Financial Review and in  
Note 16 of the Accounts.
Cash interest received remained stable at £3 million 
(2014: £3 million).

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 26 STRATEGIC REPORT
The Group’s Fund Management income is driven by  
total AUM, which was £13.5 billion at 31 March 2015 
(31 March 2014: £12.9 billion). The launch of six CLOs,  
the European Middle Market Loan Fund and further 
commitments to the US Senior Loan Fund in the Debt 
Management business offset a fall in AUM arising from  
net divestment activity in Private Equity. The proportion  
of third-party assets under management grew marginally 
to 75% (2014: 74%). 
An increase in third-party fee income and a fall in 
operating expenses were offset by a fall in synthetic fees 
applied from the Proprietary Capital business as a result 
of net divestment in Private Equity. 
As a result of the completion of our transformation plan, 
Fund Management improved both its absolute profit and 
profit margin to £26 million and 21% respectively (2014: 
£19 million, 15%). Excluding restructuring and amortisation 
costs, underlying operating profit and margin remained 
stable at £33 million (2014: £33 million) and 26% 
(2014: 26%).

NET CARRIED INTEREST AND PERFORMANCE 
FEES PAYABLE
Net carried interest and performance fees payable 
decreased in the year, with a net payable of £62 million 
(31 March 2014: £82 million payable). On a gross basis, 
carried interest and performance fees payable increased 
to £142 million (2014: £85 million) and the receivable 
increased to £80 million (2014: £3 million).
Our largest Private Equity fund, Eurofund V, which  
includes assets purchased in 2007–12, has not yet met  
the performance hurdle due to the performance of the 
2007–09 vintages. Although we have seen a strong 
recovery in that fund’s multiple to 1.4x (March 2014: 1.1x)
invested capital, with 2010-12 investments valued at 2.6x 
(March 2014: 2.1x), the drag from these earlier investments 
means that we have not yet recognised carry receivable 
from this fund.
Assets in the Growth Capital Fund include Quintiles, 
Refresco-Gerber, Touchtunes and BVG and, as a result of 
their strong performance, its multiple on invested capital 
is now 1.7x (March 2014: 1.3x). We are now recognising 
carry receivable on an accruals basis and £25 million was 
recognised in the year (31 March 2014: nil). 
We pay carry to our Private Equity investment teams on 
proprietary capital invested and share a proportion of 
carry receivable from third-party funds. This total carry 
payable is provided through schemes which have been 
structured historically over two or three year vintages to 
maximise flexibility in resource planning. The improved 
performance of the Private Equity portfolio over the last 
two years means that the majority of assets by value are 
now held in carry payable schemes that have met their 
performance hurdles, assuming the portfolio was realised 
at its 31 March 2015 valuation. Carry payable typically will 
increase or decrease in line with the gross investment 
return at rates between 10% and 15%. The gross 
investment return in Private Equity of £719 million (2014: 
£647 million) resulted in an accrual of £103 million carry 
payable in the year, or 14% of gross investment return 
(31 March 2014: £82 million, 13%). Carry is usually only 
paid once the hurdles are passed in cash terms and, 
during the year, £7 million was paid (2014: £19 million).
3iN pays a performance fee on an annual basis, subject to 
a hurdle rate of return and a high-water mark based on 
net asset value. The strong performance of the European 
assets held by 3iN, including the exit of Eversholt Rail, 
resulted in an accrual of £45 million of performance  
fees receivable in the year (31 March 2014: nil).  
Our Infrastructure investment team shares in the 
performance fee receivable from 3iN, with the majority  
of individual payments deferred over a number of years. 
Carry payable to the Infrastructure team of £35 million  
has been accrued (2014: nil) including £34 million in 
relation to the 3iN performance fee. 
PENSION
The IAS19 liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes have been impacted by decreases in their 
discount rates, driven by the AA corporate bond yields. 
This resulted in a re-measurement loss of £14 million 
(2014: £1 1 million gain) for the year. On an IAS19 basis the 
pension scheme remains in a significant surplus.
The 2013 triennial valuation of the UK defined benefit 
pension scheme was completed in March 2014. It resulted 
in a very small surplus and consequently no further 
contributions were made, or are planned, as a result 
of this valuation.

Third-party fees increased during the year following the 
launch of six Debt Management CLOs and the European 
Middle Market Loan Fund. Alongside growth in third-party 
fees we have focused on generating cash income from the 
portfolio. Increased investment into cash yielding Debt 
Management funds has generated good income and the 
Private Equity portfolio has benefited from increased deal 
fees on higher levels of activity. Consequently, the Group 
has been able to materially improve its operating cash 
income to £158 million (2014: £132 million) despite the net 
divestment activity in Private Equity. 
Total operating expenses declined by 4% to £131 million 
(2014: £136 million) as restructuring costs, which comprise 
redundancy, office closures and organisational changes, 
reduced to £1 million (2014: £9 million) as we reached the 
end of our transformation plan. Excluding restructuring 
costs, operating expenses increased by 2% to £130 million 
(2014: £127 million) principally due to an increase in 
variable compensation resulting from share based 
payments. Operating expenses as a percentage of 
weighted average AUM remained stable at 1.0% (2014: 
1.0%), as a result of the continuing cost focus combined 
with the new CLO fund launches in the year. We expect 
costs to rise marginally as we look to grow the business, 
increase activity and deal with increased regulation but 
we expect costs to remain at c1.0% of AUM.
In total, the operating cash profit position increased 
strongly to £28 million (2014: £5 million).

The Proprietary Capital portfolio increased to £3,877 million 
at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: £3,565 million) as cash 
investment of £474 million and unrealised value growth of 
£684 million offset the good realisations and the negative 
impact of foreign exchange movements.
The mix of the portfolio remained broadly stable. The 
marginal decline in Private Equity to 81% (31 March 2014: 
82%) was offset by a 1% increase in Debt Management to 
5% (31 March 2014: 4%). The weighting of the Infrastructure 
portfolio remained stable at 14% (31 March 2014: 14%).
Net divestment activity and an operating cash profit led 
to cash on the balance sheet increasing to £864 million 
(31 March 2014: £697 million). Combined with a reduction 
in the sterling equivalent of the 2017 euro denominated 
bond, the Group was in a net cash position of £49 million 
at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014: £160 million net debt) 
ahead of paying the final dividend for FY2015.

Gearing nil 5%
Gearing reduced to nil at 31 March 2015 (31 March 2014:

Overall shareholders’ funds increased to £3,806 million 
(31 March 2014: £3,308 million) following the total return of 
£659 million in the year to 31 March 2015.
Liquidity
Total liquidity was substantially unchanged at 31 March 
2015 compared to 31 March 2014 at £1,214 million 
(31 March 2014: £1,197 million). Cash and deposits 
increased to £864 million (31 March 2014: £697 million) as 
a result of net divestment and undrawn facilities reduced 
to £350 million (31 March 2014: £500 million) following the 
RCF refinancing. 
Foreign exchange hedging
As a result of the reduction in non-sterling gross debt, and 
the increased concentration of the portfolio into a smaller 
number of individually significant assets, the use of 
derivatives for portfolio value hedging purposes is less 
effective. As a result, derivatives are no longer used to 
hedge currency movements on a portfolio basis and 
foreign exchange risk is considered as an integral part of 
the investment process. Specific short-term hedging on 
entry or exit of an investment may be used as appropriate. 
Diluted NAV
The diluted NAV per share at 31 March 2015 was 396 
pence (31 March 2014: 348 pence). This was driven by the 
total return in the year of £659 million (2014: £478 million), 
and partially offset by dividend payments in the year of 
£183 million (2014: £1 14 million).
Dividend
The Board has declared a total dividend of 20.0p (2014: 
20.0p) for 2015. This is made up of a 8.1p base dividend and 
an 1 1.9p additional dividend. Due to our current net 
divestment activity and robust balance sheet, we have 
proposed an additional dividend above the top end of our 
15%–20% distribution range, equivalent to 23% of gross 
realised proceeds. Subject to shareholder approval, we 
will pay the final dividend of 14.0p (2014: 13.3p) on 24 July 
2015 to shareholders on the register at 19 June 2015.
Key accounting judgements
In preparing these accounts, the key accounting 
judgement relates to the carrying value of our 
investment assets which are stated at fair value.
Given the importance of this area, the Board has a 
separate Valuations Committee to review the 
valuations policies, process and application to 
individual investments. However, asset valuations for 
non-quoted investments are inherently subjective, as 
they are made on the basis of assumptions which may 
not prove to be accurate. At 31 March 2015 80% of the 
investment assets were non-quoted (31 March 2014: 
84%). A report on the activities of the Valuations 
Committee is included in the Governance section of 
this report and Note 10 of the Accounts provides 
further detail on sensitivity.
Accounting for investment entities: an assessment is 
required to determine the degree of control or 
influence the Group exercises and the form of any 
control to ensure that the financial treatment is 
accurate. IFRS 10 has resulted in a number of 
intermediate holding companies being presented at 
fair value which has led to reduced transparency of 
the underlying investment performance. As a result 
the Group continues to present an alternative 
non-GAAP investment basis set of financial 
statements to ensure that the commentary in the 
Strategic report remains fair, balanced and 
understandable.

Reconciliation of Investment basis to IFRS
BACKGROUND TO INVESTMENT BASIS 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group makes investments in portfolio companies 
directly, held by 3i Group plc, and indirectly, held through 
intermediate holding company and partnership structures 
(“Investment entity subsidiaries”). It also has other 
operational subsidiaries which provide services and other 
activities such as employment, regulatory activities, 
management and advice (“Trading subsidiaries”). 
The application of IFRS 10 requires us to fair value a 
number of intermediate holding companies that were 
previously consolidated line by line. This fair value 
approach, applied at the intermediate holding company 
level, effectively obscures the performance of our 
proprietary capital investments and associated 
transactions occurring in the intermediate holding 
companies. The financial effect of the underlying portfolio 
companies and fee income, operating expenses and 
carried interest transactions occurring in Investment entity 
subsidiaries are aggregated into a single value. Other 
items which were previously eliminated on consolidation 
are now included separately.
As a result we introduced separate non-GAAP “Investment 
basis” Statements of comprehensive income, financial 
position and cash flow in our 2014 Annual report and 
accounts to aid understanding of our results. The Strategic 
report is also prepared using the Investment basis as we 
believe it provides a more understandable view of our 
performance. Total return and net assets are equal under 
the Investment basis and IFRS; the Investment basis is 
simply a “look through” of IFRS 10 to present the 
underlying performance. The two diagrams below 
illustrate these changes, together with an illustrative 
example to show how information can be aggregated.
RECENT IFRS 10 DEVELOPMENTS 
The IASB issued a narrow scope amendment to IFRS 10 in 
December 2014, and subsequently the Group has revisited 
its initial assessment of all of its subsidiaries, resulting in a 
small number of entities now being consolidated rather 
than fair valued in the IFRS financial statements. The 
Group has chosen to adopt the changes provided in the 
narrow scope amendment, and has accounted for the 
change in treatment retrospectively. The change has no 
effect on total return or net asset value as reported in the 
Group’s IFRS financial statements. The Investment basis 
statements are unchanged, as the entities now being 
consolidated in the IFRS statements have always been 
consolidated in the Investment basis. Given the judgement 
involved in interpreting the standard, and ongoing 
discussion amongst the IASB and practitioners, similar 
changes in future years remain possible.

Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of comprehensive income consolidates the line items of a number of previously consolidated 
subsidiaries into a single line item “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. In the “Investment basis” accounts we have 
disaggregated these line items to analyse our total return as if these investment entity subsidiaries were fully consolidated, consistent 
with prior years. The adjustments simply reclassify the Statement of comprehensive income of the Group, and the total return is equal 
under the Investment basis and the IFRS basis. 
2 Realised profits, unrealised profits, and portfolio income shown in the IFRS accounts only relate to portfolio companies that are held 
directly by 3i Group plc and not those portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries. Realised profits, unrealised profits, 
and portfolio income in relation to portfolio companies held through investment entity subsidiaries are aggregated into the single “Fair 
value movement on investment entity subsidiaries” line. This is the most significant reduction of information in our IFRS accounts. 
3 Foreign exchange movements have been reclassified under the Investment basis as foreign currency asset and liability movements 
within the investment entity subsidiaries are included within “Fair value movements on investment entities”.
4 Other items also aggregated into the “Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries” line include fees receivable from external 
funds, audit fees, custodian fees, bank charges, other general and administration expenses, carried interest and tax.

35 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  STRATEGIC REPORT
Reconciliation of consolidated statement of financial position continued
Notes:
1 Applying IFRS 10 to the Statement of financial position aggregates the line items into the single line item “Investment in investment 
entities”. In the Investment basis we have disaggregated these items to analyse our net assets as if the investment entity subsidiaries 
were consolidated. The adjustment reclassifies items in the Statement of financial position. There is no change to the net assets, although 
for reasons explained below, gross assets and gross liabilities are different. 
 The disclosure relating to portfolio companies is significantly reduced by the aggregation, as the fair value of all investments held by 
investment entity subsidiaries is aggregated into the “Investments in investment entities” line. We have disaggregated this fair value and 
disclosed the underlying portfolio holding in the relevant line item, ie, quoted equity investments, unquoted equity investments or loans 
and receivables. 
 Other items which may be aggregated are carried interest and other payables, and the Investment basis presentation again disaggregates 
these items.
2 Cash balances held in investment entity subsidiaries are also aggregated into the “Investment in investment entities” line. At 31 March 
2015 £3 million (2014 restated: £23 million) of cash was held in subsidiaries that are now classified as investment entity subsidiaries and 
is therefore included in the “Investment in investment entities” line. 
3 Intercompany balances between investment entity subsidiaries and trading subsidiaries also impact the transparency of our results 
under the IFRS basis. If an investment entity subsidiary has an intercompany balance with a consolidated trading subsidiary of the 
Group, then the asset or liability of the investment entity subsidiary will be aggregated into its fair value, while the asset or liability of the 
consolidated trading subsidiary will be disclosed as an asset or liability in the Statement of financial position for the Group. Prior to the 
adoption of IFRS 10, these balances would have been eliminated on consolidation. 
4 Investment basis financial statements are prepared for performance measurement and therefore reserves are not analysed separately 
under this basis.

Notes:
1 The Consolidated cash flow statement is impacted by the application of IFRS 10 as cash flows to and from Investment entity subsidiaries 
are disclosed, rather than the cash flows to and from the underlying portfolio. 
 Therefore in our Investment basis financial statements, we have disclosed our cash flow statement on a “look through” basis, in order to 
reflect the underlying sources and uses of cash flows and disclose the underlying investment activity.
2 There is a difference between the change in cash and cash equivalents of the Investment basis financial statements and the IFRS financial 
statements because there are cash balances held in investment entity subsidiary vehicles. Cash held within investment entity subsidiaries 
will not be shown in the IFRS statements but will be seen in the Investment basis statements.
37 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  STRATEGIC REPORT
Key risks and mitigations
Effective risk assessment underpins the 
successful delivery of our strategy. Integrity 
and responsibility are central to our values 
at 3i and are embedded in our approach to 
risk management.
This section explains how we control and manage the risks 
in our business. It outlines the key risks, our assessment of 
their potential impact on our business in the context of the 
current environment and how we mitigate them. 
APPROACH TO RISK GOVERNANCE
The Board seeks to achieve an appropriate balance 
between taking risk and generating returns for 
shareholders and is responsible for risk assessment, the 
risk management process and for the protection of the 
Group’s reputation and brand integrity. It considers the 
most significant risks facing the Group and uses 
quantitative analyses, such as the vintage control and 
weekly liquidity reporting, where appropriate. Non-
executive oversight of the risk management process is 
exercised through the Audit and Compliance Committee 
with respect to standards of integrity, financial reporting, 
risk management, going concern and internal control. The 
Audit and Compliance Committee’s activities are discussed 
further in that Committee’s report on page 65.
The Board has delegated the responsibility for risk 
oversight to the Chief Executive. He is assisted by the 
Group Risk Committee (“GRC”) in managing this 
responsibility, guided by the Board’s appetite for risk and 
any specific limits set. The GRC maintains the Group risk 
review, which summarises the Group’s principal risks, 
associated mitigating actions and key risk indicators, and 
identifies any changes to the Group’s risk profile. The risk 
review is updated quarterly and the Chief Executive 
provides an update at each Audit and Compliance 
Committee meeting where the Committee members 
contribute views and raise questions. The last risk 
appraisal was completed in early May 2015.
Following the implementation of AIFMD in July 2014, 
we further augmented risk governance with a separate 
Risk Management Function. This group meets ahead of the 
GRC meetings to consider separate risk reports for 
each AIF managed by the Group, including areas such 
as portfolio composition, operational updates and team 
changes, which are then also considered by the GRC.
Assurance on the robustness and effectiveness of the 
Group’s overarching risk management processes and 
compliance with relevant policies is provided to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee through the independent 
assessment by Internal Audit and the work of Group 
Compliance on regulatory risks.
In addition to the above, a number of other committees 
contribute to the Group’s overall risk governance structure, 
as set out in the diagram on page 39.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to 
support the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The key principles that underpin risk management in the 
Group are:
  The Board and Group Executive Committee promote a 
culture in which risks are identified, assessed and 
reported in an open, transparent and objective 
manner; and
  The over-riding priority is to protect the Group’s 
long-term viability and reputation and produce 
sustainable, medium to long-term cash-to-
cash returns.
Managing the Group’s Environmental, Social and 
Governance risks is central to how we do business and is 
integral to our risk management framework.
Risk management is embedded within all areas of the 
business. Members of the Executive Committee have 
responsibility for their own business areas and the Group 
expects individual behaviours to mirror the culture and 
core values of the Group. All employees share the 
responsibility of upholding 3i’s control culture and 
supporting effective risk management to enable us to 
deliver our strategy. Senior managers are required to 
confirm their individual and business area compliance.  
In addition, all staff are assessed on their awareness of  
the Group’s values and compliance with them as part of 
their annual appraisal.
In practice, the Group operates a “three lines of defence” 
framework for managing and identifying risk. The first line 
of defence against undesirable outcomes is the business 
function and the respective Managing Partners across 
Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.  
Line management is supported by oversight and control 
functions such as Compliance, Finance and Legal which 
constitute the second line of defence. The Compliance 
monitoring programme reviews the effective operation  
of our processes in meeting regulatory requirements. 
Internal Audit provides retrospective, independent 
assurance over the operation of controls and is the third 
line of defence. The internal audit programme includes  
the review of risk management processes and 
recommendations to improve the control environment. 
RISK REVIEW PROCESS
The Group risk review process includes the monitoring of 
key strategic and financial metrics considered to be 
indicators of potential changes in its risk profile. The 
review includes, but is not limited to, the following 
reference data:
  Financial performance and strategic dashboards;
  Vintage control and asset allocation analysis;
  Macroeconomic and M&A market overview;
  Liquidity management;
  Capital adequacy, including stress testing;
  Operating expenses;
  Portfolio performance reports for Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management;
  Risk reports for managed Alternative Investment 
Funds; and 
  Quarterly Group risk log.
In addition to the above, the GRC considers the impact of 
any changes and developments on its risk profile, strategic 
delivery and reputation quarterly. 
The GRC uses the above to identify a number of key risks. 
It then evaluates the impact and likelihood of each key risk, 
with reference to associated measures and key 
performance indicators. The adequacy of the mitigation 
plans is then assessed and, if necessary, additional actions 
are agreed and then reviewed at the subsequent meeting.
A number of focus topics are also agreed in advance of 
each meeting. In FY2015 the GRC covered topics such as 
business continuity; cyber and physical security; 
Responsible Investing (“RI”)/Environmental, Social and 
Governance (“ESG”) reporting; investment concentration 
risk; and the Group’s progress on implementing 
regulatory changes.
There were no significant changes to the Group’s approach 
to risk governance or its operation in FY2015 but we have 
continued to refine our framework for risk management 
and reporting further to the implementation of AIFMD and 
the Group’s approach to RI/ESG.

REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS
The disclosures on the following pages are not an 
exhaustive list of risks and uncertainties faced by the 
Group, but rather a summary of those principal risks 
which are under active review by the GRC and Board,  
and have the potential to affect materially the achievement 
of the Group’s strategic objectives and impact its financial 
performance, reputation and brand integrity.
The Group’s risk profile and appetite remains broadly 
stable. While there have been a number of emerging 
external risks separately identified this year, for example 
cyber crime, the Group believes that its consistent 
strategy, institutional approach to investment and strong 
culture have helped it to maintain its stable risk profile. 
External
The external environment remains challenging. The key 
economies in which the Group operates are showing signs 
of recovery against a background of low interest rates  
and the effects of quantitative easing in the Eurozone.  
The potential for increased volatility or shocks, however, 
remains; for example, from increased geopolitical 
instability. In addition the regulatory environment 
continues to evolve and conduct of business risk remains 
in sharp focus. 
The Group is subject to a range of additional regulatory 
and tax reporting requirements. These include the 
European Alternative Investment Fund Management 
Directive (“AIFMD”), regulations under the European Market 
Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), Capital Requirements 
Directive IV (“CRDIV”), revisions to the Client Asset rules 
(“CASS”) and the introduction of the Foreign Account Tax 
Compliance Act (“FATCA”). These changes have resulted  
in a significant increase in reporting requirements, 
operational complexity and cost to the business. However, 
they have had limited practical effect on 3i’s ability to 
deliver its strategy. Managing these changes has been a 
key priority and the subject of regular updates to Executive 
Committee and the Board. Future developments include 
possible changes to the international tax system arising 
from the OECD G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
(“BEPS”) project. 
Investment
The most significant risks are our ability to source 
attractive investment opportunities, maximise the value 
available from our portfolio and manage the timings of 
exits and cash returns. These risks are closely linked to 
the economic environment noted above. We continue to 
focus on sectors and geographies where our expertise and 
network can drive significant outperformance. The ability 
to invest and realise successfully and to minimise the risk 
of issues in the portfolio is also key to maintaining the 
Group’s reputation and networks in its markets. 
The Executive Committee actively monitors investments 
from origination to realisation with robust monthly 
management information supported by Valuation 
Committee and Board oversight. 
In addition there are a number of risks specific to each 
business line as follows:
Private Equity
As the investment portfolio becomes more concentrated, 
additional steps have been taken to increase the frequency 
and scope of monitoring of the more material assets. 
Individual portfolio company failures could have adverse 
reputational consequences for the Group, even if the value 
impact is not material.
Infrastructure
Strong investor demand for yield is challenging the 
business’ ability to maintain investment rates in quality 
assets. The business is adapting its strategy but remains 
focused on pursuing new investments while considering 
fund raising options and inorganic opportunities. Many of 
the investments in the infrastructure portfolio provide 
essential services to their community and the rigorous 
management of their performance is therefore critical.
Debt Management
The principal risk is the ability to grow AUM profitably,  
in line with its business plan. The business is also exposed 
to potential volatility in the fixed income markets and the 
effects of regulatory changes, including the Risk Retention 
and Volcker rules (effective from 201 6 and 201 7 respectively) 
which will impact the structure of the US CLO funds. 
Specifically, during the warehouse phase of establishing 
CLOs, we are exposed to market volatilities and potential 
for further capital calls.
Operational 
The key areas of potential operational risk include the  
loss of key people and whether the investor skill sets and 
business development capabilities can support the Group’s 
strategic delivery. Detailed resource plans are in place at 
the business line level and the Board conducts an annual 
review of the Group’s organisational capability and 
succession assessment. The last review was conducted 
in September 2014. 
The GRC also received regular updates on regulation, 
currency risk and cyber security. In response to the 
growing threat posed by cyber crime, we conducted 
a detailed review of the threat posed by the external 
environment, the adequacy of the Group’s internal control 
framework and our ability to respond to such an event. 
The Group also conducted a review of its business 
continuity capabilities. The findings and proposed 
enhancements were discussed and are being 
implemented across the Group.

Corporate responsibility
3i is committed to acting as a responsible 
company, a responsible employer and a 
responsible investor. We take responsibility 
for our actions, carefully consider how 
others will be affected by our choices and 
ensure that our values and ethics are 
integrated into our formal business 
policies, practices and plans.
A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY
Governance
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and its 
activities and is critical to the delivery of value to our 
stakeholders. For full details of our governance structure 
and processes, please see the Corporate governance 
section of this report and visit the Governance section of 
our website at www.3i.com.
Transparency
As a publicly-listed company, 3i operates within a 
framework of formal legal and regulatory disclosure 
requirements as well as meeting the high expectations for 
transparency of our shareholders, fund investors, staff and 
the media. We are committed to communicating both our 
financial and non-financial performance in a clear, open 
and comprehensive manner.
Anti-bribery and corruption
3i does not offer, pay or accept bribes and we only work 
with third parties whose standards of business integrity 
are substantively consistent with ours. We expect the 
businesses we invest in to operate in compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations and, where appropriate, 
work towards meeting relevant international standards 
where these are more stringent. This includes, in 
particular , upholding high standards of business integrity, 
avoiding corruption in all its forms and complying with 
applicable anti-bribery, anti-fraud and anti-money 
laundering laws and regulations.
Environmental impact
In the year to 31 March 2015 our measured Scope 1 and 2 
emissions were 41 1.8 tonnes CO2e. This comprised:
Scope Emissions source
CO2e emissions 
(tonnes) for  
year to  
31 March 2015 
CO2e emissions 
(tonnes) for  
year to  
31 March 2014 
1 Combustion of fuel  
and operation of  
our facilities
12.6 28.0
2 Electricity, heat, and 
cooling purchased  
for our own use
399.2 358.2
 Total 411.8 386.2
This equates to 1.52 tonnes CO2e per employee for the year 
to 31 March 2015 (2014: 1.39 tonnes CO2e per employee), 
based on an average number of employees during the 
year of 271 (2014: 277 employees).
We have restated the emissions figures for the year to 
31 March 2014 to reflect improved data collection and 
analysis techniques which allows a more accurate 
comparison between 2014 and 2015. Our total Scope 1  
and 2 emissions have increased by 6.6% due principally  
to better data coverage as well as an increase in overall 
emissions from electricity usage due to business growth.
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall 
within our consolidated financial statements. 
We quantify and report our organisational greenhouse gas 
emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and 
Defra’s Environmental Reporting Guidelines. Results are 
reported in tCO
2
e although Scope 2 emissions for overseas 
electricity have been calculated in tCO
2
 as the UK 
Government’s overseas electricity emissions factors 
currently account for CO
2
 emissions only. Emissions for all 
of our sites have been included and we have chosen to 
exclude fugitive Scope 1 emissions from a cooling unit 
located at our London office as it is considered immaterial 
to our overall footprint. The greenhouse gas sources that 
constitute our operational boundary are:
- Scope 1: natural gas combustion within boilers; and 
- Scope 2: purchased electricity for own use.
In some cases, missing data has been estimated using 
either extrapolation of available data or data from the 
previous year as a proxy. We have worked with Carbon 
Credentials Energy Services to verify our greenhouse  
gas emissions. 
3i also reports its greenhouse gas emissions and climate 
change data to the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
Community
We focus our charitable activities on the disadvantaged, on 
young people and on education. Charities are supported on 
the basis of their effectiveness and impact and we also 
support staff giving and sponsorship through matching 
donations. Our charitable giving for the year to 31 March 
2015 totalled £255,000.
A RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER
Graduate scheme
We are proud to have launched our new graduate 
recruitment scheme during the year which is designed to 
develop our next generation of world-class investment 
professionals and business leaders. Following a rigorous 
process, we selected five high-quality graduates from 
across Europe and a variety of disciplines to join us in 
September 2015. The programme will consist of 
comprehensive and high quality training followed by 
rotations through each of our Private Equity, Infrastructure 
and Debt Management businesses as well as our Strategy 
and Finance teams. The top performers will be fast-
tracked into the business in April 2018.

Human rights
Whilst 3i does not have a formal human rights policy, our 
policies are consistent with internationally-proclaimed 
human rights principles. In particular, 3i is an equal 
opportunities employer and has clear grievance and 
disciplinary procedures, an employee assistance 
programme and an independent, external “whistle 
blowing” hotline service. 
3i is committed to ensuring that the businesses we invest 
in comply with all applicable laws in relation to their

standards (such as the ILO Fundamental Conventions) 
where these are more stringent. Summaries of relevant 3i 
policies, including our policies on people, recruitment and 
selection, equal opportunities and diversity, health and 
safety and responsible investment are available at

3i is an accredited London Living Wage Employer. This 
means that every member of staff based in London, 
including contracted maintenance and reception teams,

the UK minimum wage and is set independently, updated 
annually and based on the cost of living in the UK.
At 31 March 2015, 3i had a total of 276 employees 
(calculated under the investment basis) and this is how 
they broke down by gender:

28 people who were directors of undertakings included in the 
consolidation, of whom 26 are male and two are female.

Case study:
The Passage
3i has supported The Passage for over five years 
and is currently supporting the Employment Training 
and Welfare Rights department 
The Passage is a UK charity which aims to provide 
homeless people in London with support to transform 
their own lives by providing homelessness prevention 
projects, resource centre services, outreach services, 
hostel accommodation and supported semi-
independent accommodation. 
Our donation funds the Employment Training and 
Welfare Rights (“ETWR”) Department which provides 
The Passage’s clients with support to find a way back 
into employment as well as to explore training and 
educational options. 
During 2014, 390 homeless or insecurely housed 
people visited the ETWR Department. The majority of 
clients received benefit advice, life skills and IT skills 
training, with 57 finding regular work. 
The ETWR department also operates a work club 
which helps clients look for work and overcome 
obstacles such as a lack of relevant IT skills, given 
so many jobs are now advertised online. To that end, 
the ETWR department carried out 1,410 internet job 
search sessions with clients. In addition, the work 
club helped 15 clients prepare and study for the 
Construction Skills Certification Scheme, supported 
three clients who undertook work trials with local 
employers in order to get used to being at work after 
long periods of unemployment, and assisted 17 clients 
who took part in voluntary work.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
 “ Robust and effective 
governance is critical to the 
successful delivery of value  
to the Group’s stakeholders.”
This section of the report describes how 
3i is governed and managed. It gives 
details on our Board and Executive 
Committee members and explains how 
the Board is organised and operates. 
It also explains the roles and composition 
of Board Committees and the division of 
responsibilities between the Directors, 
including between the Chairman and 
Chief Executive. This section also includes 
the Directors’ remuneration report, the 
Audit and Compliance Committee report 
and the Valuations Committee report.
Good corporate governance is fundamental to 3i and  
its activities. Governance and oversight of the Group’s 
business model and strategy are critical to the delivery  
of value to the Group’s stakeholders. 
This is more important than ever given the volatile and 
uncertain economic and political environment and the 
changing regulatory landscape that our sector faces.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall 
management and oversight of the Group and for its 
long-term success. In particular, the Board is responsible 
for agreeing the Group’s strategy, monitoring financial 
performance, setting and monitoring the Group’s  
risk appetite and maintaining an effective system of 
internal controls.
It is the Board’s responsibility to ensure that the Group has 
a clear strategy and that the necessary people, resources 
and structures are in place to support the delivery of 
this strategy.

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
49 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board and Committees
BOARD AND COMMITTEES STRUCTURE 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that there is an 
effective organisational and reporting structure in place 
such that there are clear reporting lines within the Group 
and well defined roles and responsibilities. This is to 
ensure that the right decisions are being made with 
involvement from the right people. 
The Board is assisted by various Principal Committees 
of the Board which report regularly to the Board. 
The Board committee structure is outlined on page 51.  
The membership of these Committees is regularly 
reviewed by the Board. When considering Board 
Committee membership and chairmanship, the Board 
aims to ensure that undue reliance is not placed on 
particular Directors. 
These Board Committees have clearly defined terms 
of reference. The terms of reference of the Audit and 
Compliance Committee, the Nominations Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Valuations Committee 
are available at www.3i.com. 
Day-to-day management of the Group is the responsibility 
of the Chief Executive. To assist him in this role, the Chief 
Executive has established a number of additional 
Committees. These are also outlined on page 51. 
HOW THE BOARD OPERATES 
The Chairman leads the Board and ensures its effectiveness. 
He also organises its business and sets its agenda. 
In addition to the Chairman, there are currently six 
independent non-executive Directors who have a range 
of strong and complementary skills. 
Attendance at meetings of the Board and its Principal 
Committees during the last year is shown on page 58. 
Before each Board and Committee meeting, relevant 
reports and papers, including financial performance data 
and detailed updates on the progress and implementation 
of the strategic plan where appropriate, are circulated to 
Directors. The Board has the opportunity to discuss these 
reports and updates and to challenge directly the 
Executive Directors and other senior management, who 
attend all or part of the Board meetings where relevant. 
The key responsibilities and areas of focus for the 
Board are: 
  Strategy – contribute to the development of, and agree, 
the Group’s strategy. This includes through review and 
discussion of reports and updates at Board meetings as 
well as through the annual strategy review meeting 
which is attended by the Board and, where relevant, 
members of the Executive Committee.
  Group financial and operational performance – review 
and monitor the performance of the Group, including 
through regular reporting and discussions with the 
Executive Committee and other senior management. 
  Senior management – ensure that the Executive 
Committee has the skills and resources to deliver 
the strategy and that appropriate succession and 
contingency planning is in place. 
  Evaluation and composition – review the performance 
of the Board and its Committees to ensure that they are 
effective. Ensure that the Board and its Committees 
comprise competent and capable individuals with a 
range of skills and experience who bring independent 
views to the decisions being made. 
  Internal controls – maintain an appropriate internal 
control framework.
  Risk – ensure that there are effective risk management 
policies and processes in place and an appropriate 
governance structure. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it 
and its duly authorised Committees for decision. This is 
described on page 57 . Matters delegated by the Board to 
management include implementation of the Board 
approved strategy, day-to-day management and operation 
of the business, the appointment and remuneration of staff 
below the Executive Committee and the formulation and 
implementation of risk management policies and processes.

DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Board approved division of responsibilities between the Directors is summarised below. 
Role of the Chairman Role of the Chief Executive Role of non-executive Directors
  Leads the Board in setting its 
agenda, agreeing strategy, 
monitoring financial and 
operational performance, and 
establishing the Group’s risk 
appetite. 
  Responsible for organising the 
business of the Board, ensuring 
its effectiveness, and 
maintaining an effective system 
of internal controls. 
  Ensures that non-executive 
Directors receive relevant and 
accurate information to facilitate 
an open and effective discussion. 
This includes ensuring that the 
non-executive Directors receive 
regular reports on shareholders’ 
views on the Group. 
  Responsible for the composition 
of the Board and facilitates 
the effective contribution of 
non-executive Directors and 
constructive relations between 
Executive and non-executive 
Directors. 
  Direct charge of the Group on a 
day-to-day basis and is 
accountable to the Board for the 
financial and operational 
performance of the Group.
  Leads the Executive Committee 
to develop and implement the 
Group’s strategy and manage 
risk and the internal control 
framework. 
  Chairs the Investment 
Committee to review the 
acquisition, management and 
disposal of investments.
  Reports to the Board on financial 
and operational performance 
and progress in delivering the 
strategic objectives. 
  Regularly engages with 
shareholders and other key 
stakeholders on the Group’s 
activities and progress.
  Scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed 
objectives and monitor the 
reporting of performance. 
  Seek assurance on the integrity 
of the financial information and 
that financial controls and 
systems of risk management are 
robust and defensible. 
  Determine appropriate levels of 
remuneration for Executive 
Directors and Executive 
Committee and have a prime 
role in appointing Directors and 
in succession planning. 
  Constructively challenge and 
help develop proposals on 
strategy; this occurs at meetings 
of the Board, and in particular at 
the annual review meeting to 
discuss ongoing strategy, the 
most recent of which took place 
in December 2014. 
EFFECTIVENESS 
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its Committees and 
individual Directors. On this occasion, the process was led 
by the Chairman and conducted internally; the performance 
evaluation had been externally facilitated two years 
previously by Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited. 
The Chairman held one-on-one discussions informed by 
a checklist with all Directors and the Company Secretary. 
The results of the evaluation process were reported to, 
and discussed by, the Board. In addition, the Chairman 
provided individual feedback to Directors.
The evaluation included consideration of the overall 
composition of the Board including plans for non-executive 
Director succession over time. Directors identified the 
backgrounds and experiences which would be desirable in 
future non-executive Directors to complement the Board’s 
existing skills. The recent Board meeting held in 
Amsterdam combined with visits to investee companies 
was judged to have been valuable to non-executive 
Directors and it was decided to hold further Board 
meetings in non-UK locations in future. Directors identified 
for further consideration specific topics which they 
believed would be particularly relevant to the Group in the 
coming year.
Following enhancements to Board processes made in 
the previous year, suggestions were made for further 
improvements. These included plans to improve the way 
in which the Board as a whole could engage more fully in 
and support the work of Valuations Committee and 
Remuneration Committee. 
In his role as Senior Independent Director, Mr J P Asquith 
led a review by the Directors of the performance of the 
Chairman and subsequently reported back to the Board 
and provided feedback to the Chairman. 
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 52 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statutory and corporate governance information
INVESTMENT POLICY
The UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules require 3i, as a 
closed-ended investment fund, to publish an investment 
policy. Shareholder approval is required for material 
changes to this policy. Non-material changes can be made 
by the Board. The current investment policy is set 
out below. 
Investment policy
  3i is an investment company which aims to provide its 
shareholders with quoted access to private equity, 
infrastructure and debt management investment 
returns. Currently, its main focus is on making quoted 
and unquoted equity and/or debt investments in 
businesses and funds across Europe, Asia and the 
Americas. The geographies, economic sectors, funds 
and asset classes in which 3i invests continue to evolve 
as opportunities are identified. Proposed investments 
are assessed individually and all significant 
investments require approval from the Group’s 
Investment Committee. Overall investment targets are 
subject to periodic reviews and the investment portfolio 
is also reviewed to monitor exposure to specific 
geographies, economic sectors and asset classes.
  3i seeks to diversify risk through significant 
dispersion of investments by geography, economic 
sector, asset class and size as well as through the 
maturity profile of its investment portfolio.
  Although 3i does not set maximum exposure limits for 
asset allocations, it does have a maximum exposure 
limit that, save as mentioned below, no investment will 
be made unless its cost does not exceed 1 5% of the 
investment portfolio value as shown in the last 
published valuation. A further investment may be 
made in an existing investee company provided the 
aggregate cost of that investment and of all other 
investments in that investee company does not exceed 
1 5% of the investment portfolio value as shown in the 
last published valuation. A higher limit of 30% will 
apply to the Company’s investment in 3i Infrastructure 
plc. For the avoidance of doubt, 3i may retain an 
investment even if its carrying value is greater than 
1 5% or 30% (as the case may be) of the portfolio value 
at the time of an updated valuation. 
  Investments are generally funded with a mixture of 
debt and shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising 
returns to shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong 
capital base. 3i’s gearing depends not only on its level of 
debt, but also on the impact of market movements and 
other factors on the value of its investments. The Board 
takes this into account when, as required, it sets a 
precise maximum level of gearing. The Board has 
therefore set the maximum level of gearing at 1 50% 
and has set no minimum level of gearing. If the gearing 
ratio should exceed the 1 50% maximum limit, the 
Board will take steps to reduce the gearing ratio to 
below that limit as soon as practicable thereafter . 3i is 
committed to achieving balance sheet efficiency.
TAX AND INVESTMENT COMPANY STATUS
The Company is an investment company under section 
833 of the Companies Act 2006. HM Revenue & Customs 
has approved the Company as an investment trust under 
section 1 158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and the 
Company directs its affairs to enable it to continue to 
remain so approved.
REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT 
ARRANGEMENTS
3i Investments plc, 3i Debt Management Investments 
Limited, 3i BIFM Investments Limited, 3i Europe plc and 
3i Nordic plc, all of which are subsidiaries of the Company, 
are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (“FCA”) under the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000. Where applicable, certain Group subsidiaries’ 
businesses outside the United Kingdom are regulated 
locally by relevant authorities.
3i Investments plc acts as investment manager to the 
Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Contracts for 
these investment management and other services, for 
which regulatory authorisation is required, provide for 
fees based on the work done and costs incurred in 
providing such services. These contracts may be 
terminated by either party on reasonable notice.
3i plc provides the Group with certain corporate and 
administrative services, for which no regulatory 
authorisation is required, under contracts which provide 
for fees based on the work done and costs incurred in 
providing such services together with a performance fee 
based on realised profits on the sale of assets. 
3i Investments plc is authorised by the FCA to, among 
other things, manage Alternative Investment Funds 
(“AIFs”). It is currently the Alternative Investment Fund 
Manager (“AIFM”) of four AIFs, namely, 3i Group plc, 
3i Growth Capital Fund, 3i Eurofund V and the 3i European 
Middle Market Loan Fund. In compliance with regulatory 
requirements, 3i Investments plc has ensured that a 
depository has been appointed for each AIF . This is 
Citibank International Limited. The Annual report and 
accounts meet the investor reporting requirements as 
set out in FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 3.2.5R and 3.2.6R of the 
FCA’s Investment Funds sourcebook for 3i Group plc as 
a standalone entity. The Company’s profit for the year 
is stated in its Statement of changes in equity and its 
Financial position is shown on page 88. The Company 
performs substantially all of its investment related 
activities through its subsidiaries and therefore the 
Group’s consolidated Statement of comprehensive 
income is considered to be more useful to investors 
than a Company statement.
53 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statutory and corporate governance information continued
Furthermore, in some instances the relevant FUND 
disclosures have been made in relation to the Group on a 
consolidated basis rather than in respect of 3i Group plc as 
a standalone entity. This is because 3i Group plc, as a 
standalone entity, operates through its group subsidiaries 
and therefore reporting on the Group’s activities provides 
more relevant information on the Company and its 
position. There have been no material changes to the 
Company’s operations in the past year. 
Although the disclosures required by FUND 3.2.2R, 3.2.3R, 
3.2.5R and 3.2.6R of the FCA’s Investment Funds 
sourcebook are covered in this Annual report they are 
also, for convenience, summarised on the 3i website at 
www.3i.com. This will be updated as required and 
changes noted in future Annual reports. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
Total comprehensive income for the year was £659 million 
(2014: £478 million). An interim dividend of 6.0p 
(comprising a base dividend of 2.7p and an additional 
dividend of 3.3p) per ordinary share in respect of the year 
to 31 March 2015 was paid on 7 January 2015. The 
Directors recommend a final dividend of 14.0p (comprising 
a base dividend of 5.4p and an additional dividend of 8.6p) 
per ordinary share be paid in respect of the year to 
31 March 2015 to shareholders on the Register at the close 
of business on 19 June 2015.
The trustee of The 3i Group Employee Trust (“the 
Employee Trust”) has waived (subject to certain minor 
exceptions) dividends declared on shares in the Company 
held by the Employee Trust and the Trustee of The 3i Group 
Share Incentive Plan has waived dividends on unallocated 
shares in the Company held by it.
SHARE CAPITAL AND DEBENTURES
The issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
1 April 2014 was 971,803,122 ordinary shares and at 
31 March 2015 was 972,453,819 ordinary shares of 73
19
/ 22p 
each. It increased over the year by 650,697 ordinary shares 
on the issue of shares to the trustee of The 3i Group Share 
Incentive Plan and on the issue of shares under The 3i 
Group Discretionary Share Plan. 
At the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 17 July 2014, the 
Directors were authorised to repurchase up to 97 ,000,000 
ordinary shares in the Company (representing 
approximately 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital as at 13 May 2014) until the Company’s AGM 
in 2015 or 16 October 2015, if earlier. This authority was not 
exercised in the year. 
The issued B share capital of the Company as at 1 April 
2014 was 4,635,018 B shares (cumulative preference 
shares of 1p each). At the AGM on 17 July 2014, the 
Directors were authorised to repurchase that number of  
B shares in the Company until the Company’s AGM in 2015 
or 16 October 2015, if earlier. In order to simplify the 
Company’s capital structure, this authority was exercised 
on 13 June 2014 when the outstanding 4,635,018 B shares 
in issue with a total nominal value of £46,350.18 were 
repurchased by the Company for an aggregate 
consideration of £6,092,100.80 and subsequently 
cancelled. These shares represented 0.0006% of the 
Company’s called up share capital at the date of 
acquisition.
As detailed in Note 16 to the Accounts, as at 31 March 2015 
the Company had in issue Notes issued under the 3i Group 
plc £2,000 million Note Issuance Programme. 
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS AND 
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES 
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid conflicts of interest 
with the Company. The Company’s Articles of Association 
enable Directors to approve conflicts of interest and 
include other conflict of interest provisions. The Company 
has implemented processes to identify potential and actual 
conflicts of interest. Such conflicts are then considered for 
approval by the Board, subject, if necessary, to appropriate 
conditions. 
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association 
during the year and as at the date of this Directors’ report, 
there were in place Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity 
Provisions (as defined under relevant legislation) for the 
benefit of the Company’s Directors and for the benefit of 
Directors of one associated company. 
EMPLOYMENT 
The employment policy of the Group is one of equal 
opportunity in the selection, training, career development 
and promotion of employees, regardless of age, gender, 
sexual orientation, ethnic origin, religion and whether 
disabled or otherwise.
3i treats applicants and employees with disabilities fairly 
and provides facilities, equipment and training to assist 
disabled employees to do their jobs. Arrangements are 
made as necessary to ensure support to job applicants 
who happen to be disabled and who respond to requests 
to inform the Company of any requirements. Should an 
employee become disabled during their employment, 
efforts would be made to retain them in their current 
employment or to explore the opportunities for their 
retraining or redeployment within 3i. Financial support is 
also provided by 3i to support disabled employees who are 
unable to work, as appropriate to local market conditions. 
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 54 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
3i’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of 
its employees is through employee appraisals, informal 
consultations, team briefings, and staff conferences. 
Managers throughout 3i have a continuing responsibility to 
keep their staff fully informed of developments and to 
communicate financial results and other matters of 
interest. This is achieved by structured communication 
including regular meetings of employees. 
3i is an equal opportunities employer and has clear 
grievance and disciplinary procedures in place. 3i also has 
an employee assistance programme which provides a 
confidential, free and independent counselling service and 
is available to all UK staff and their families in the UK. 
3i’s employment policies are designed to provide a 
competitive reward package which will attract and retain 
high quality staff, whilst ensuring that the relevant costs 
remain at an appropriate level. 
3i’s remuneration policy is influenced by 3i’s financial and 
other performance conditions and market practices in the 
countries in which it operates. All employees receive a 
base salary and are also eligible to be considered for a 
performance-related annual variable incentive award. For 
those members of staff receiving higher levels of annual 
variable incentive awards, a proportion of such awards is 
delivered in 3i shares, vesting over a number of years. 
Remuneration policy is reviewed by the 3i Group plc 
Remuneration Committee, comprising 3i Group plc 
non-executive Directors.
Where appropriate, employees are eligible to participate in 
3i share schemes to encourage employees’ involvement in 
3i’s performance. Investment executives in the Private 
Equity business line may also participate in carried 
interest schemes, which allow executives to share directly 
in any future profits on investments. Similarly, investment 
executives in the Infrastructure and Debt Management 
business lines may participate in asset-linked and/or 
fee-linked incentive arrangements. Employees participate 
in local state or company pension schemes as appropriate 
to local market conditions. 
POLITICAL DONATIONS 
In line with Group policy, during the year to 31 March  
2015 no donations were made to political parties or 
organisations, or independent election candidates, and  
no political expenditure was incurred.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS 
As at 31 March 2015, the Company was party to one 
agreement that is subject to a renegotiation period on a 
change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. 
This agreement is a £350 million multi-currency Revolving 
Credit Facility Agreement dated 5 September 2014, 
between the Company, Barclays Bank PLC and 1 1 other 
banks. The Company is required to notify Barclays Bank 
PLC, as agent bank, within five days, of a change of control. 
This opens a 20-day negotiation period to determine if the 
Majority Lenders (as defined in the agreement) are willing 
to continue the facility. Failing agreement, amounts 
outstanding would be repayable and the facility cancelled.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
report and accounts in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) which have been adopted by the 
European Union. 
Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the 
Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they present fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. 
The Directors consider that this Annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy. In preparing the Group 
financial statements the Directors: 
(a) select suitable accounting policies in accordance with 
International Accounting Standard 8: Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then 
apply them consistently; 
(b) present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
(c) provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group’s financial 
position and financial performance; 
(d) state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and 
(e) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable. 
55 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Statutory and corporate governance information continued
The Directors have a responsibility for ensuring that 
proper accounting records are kept which are sufficient to 
show and explain the Group’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have a general responsibility for taking such steps  
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets  
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and  
other irregularities. 
In accordance with the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules, the Directors confirm to the best of their 
knowledge that: 
(a) the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
(b) the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face. 
The Directors of the Company and their functions are listed 
in the Board of Directors and Executive Committee section. 
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have acknowledged their responsibilities  
in relation to the financial statements for the year to 
31 March 2015.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Business review section. The 
financial position of the Group, its capital structure, gearing 
and liquidity positions are described in the Financial review 
section. The Group’s policies on risk management, 
including treasury and funding risks, are contained in the 
Risk section. Further details are contained in the Financial 
statements and Notes including, in particular, details on 
financial risk management.
The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have 
considered the uncertainties inherent in current and 
expected future market conditions, their possible impact 
upon the financial performance of the Group and a report 
from the Group Finance Director on the outlook for 
liquidity. After consideration, the Directors are satisfied 
that the Company has and will maintain sufficient financial 
resources to enable it to continue operating in the 
foreseeable future and therefore continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Annual report  
and accounts.
AUDIT INFORMATION
Pursuant to section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, 
each of the Directors confirms that:
(a) so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditors are 
unaware; and
(b) they have taken all steps they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditors are aware of 
such information.
APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS

a resolution proposing the reappointment of Ernst &  
Young LLP as the Company’s Auditors will be put to 
members at the forthcoming AGM.

Corporate governance statement
This section of the Directors’ report 
contains the corporate governance 
statement required by FCA Disclosure 
and Transparency Rule 7.2.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company seeks to comply with established best 
practice in the field of corporate governance. The Board 
has adopted core values and global policies which set out 
the behaviour expected of staff in their dealings with 
shareholders, customers, colleagues, suppliers and others 
who engage with the Company.
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) published by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2012 and which is available on the 
FRC website.
THE BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES 
AND PROCESSES
The Board’s key responsibilities are described on page 50.  
It is responsible to shareholders for the overall management 
of the Group and may exercise all the powers of the 
Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, the 
Company’s Articles of Association and any directions given 
by special resolution of the shareholders. The Articles of 
Association empower the Board to offer , allot, grant options 
over or otherwise deal with or dispose of the Company’s 
shares as the Board may decide. The Companies Act 2006 
authorises the Company to make market purchases of its 
own shares if the purchase has first been authorised by a 
resolution of the Company.
At the AGM in July 2014, shareholders renewed the Board’s 
authority to allot ordinary shares and to repurchase 
ordinary shares on behalf of the Company subject to 
certain limits and also renewed the Board’s authority to 
repurchase B shares on behalf of the Company subject to 
certain limits. Details of the authorities which the Board 
will be seeking at the 2015 AGM are set out in the 2015 
Notice of AGM.
The Articles of Association also specifically empower the 
Board to exercise the Company’s powers to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge the Company’s assets and any 
uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities.

The Board has approved a formal schedule of matters 
reserved to it and its duly authorised Committees for 
decision. These include:

day operation of the business, the appointment and

APPOINTMENT AND RE-ELECTION 
OF DIRECTORS
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Companies Acts and satisfactory performance evaluation, 
non-executive Directors are appointed for an initial 
three-year term. Before the third and sixth anniversaries 
of first appointment, the Director discusses with the Board 
whether it is appropriate for a further three-year term to 
be served.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, the minimum 
number of Directors is two and the maximum is 20, unless 
otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary 
resolution. Directors are appointed by ordinary resolution 
of shareholders or by the Board. The Company’s Articles of 
Association provide for Directors to retire by rotation at an 
AGM if they were appointed by the Board since the 
preceding AGM, they held office during the two preceding 
AGMs but did not retire at either of them, they held 
non-executive office for a continuous period of nine years 
or more at the date of that AGM, or they choose to retire 
from office. Shareholders can remove any Director by 
special resolution and appoint another person to be a 
director in their place by ordinary resolution.
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, retiring 
Directors are eligible for reappointment. The office of 
Director is vacated if the Director resigns, becomes 
bankrupt or is prohibited by law from being a Director or 
where the Board so resolves following the Director 
suffering from ill-health or being absent from Board 
meetings for 12 months without the Board’s permission.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors are subject to 
reappointment every year. Accordingly, at the AGM to be 
held on 25 June 2015, all the Directors will retire from 
office. All the Directors are eligible for and seek 
reappointment other than Sir Adrian Montague who will 
retire as a Director at the conclusion of the AGM. The 
Board’s recommendation for the reappointment of 
Directors is set out in the 2015 Notice of AGM.
THE ROLES OF THE CHAIRMAN, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR 
INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
The Board approved division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive is 
described on page 52.
During the year, Mr R H Meddings served as Senior 
Independent Director until 17 July 2014 when he retired 
from the Board and Mr J P Asquith served as Senior 
Independent Director from that date. 
DIRECTORS
Directors’ biographical details are set out on page 48. The 
Board currently comprises the Chairman, six independent 
non-executive Directors and two Executive Directors. Sir 
Adrian Montague served as Chairman and Mr J P Asquith, 
Mr S A Borrows, Mr A R Cox, Mr D A M Hutchison, Ms M G 
Verluyten and Mrs J S Wilson served as Directors 
throughout the year under review. Mr R H Meddings 
served as a Director until 1 7 July 2014 and Mrs C J Banszky 
served as a Director from 17 July 2014. Following the year 
end, Mr S R Thompson was appointed as a non-executive 
Director on 13 April 2015.
In addition to fulfilling their legal responsibilities as 
Directors, non-executive Directors are expected to bring 
an independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct, and to 
help the Board provide the Company with effective 
leadership. Further details of their role are set out on page 
52. Non-executive Directors are expected to make 
available sufficient time to meet the requirements of the 
appointment. The average time commitment is expected to 
be around 15 days a year together with additional time for 
serving on the Board’s committees.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s 
strategic plan and annual budget, provide the non-
executive Directors with the opportunity to contribute to 
and validate management’s plans and assist in the 
development of strategy. The non-executive Directors 
receive regular management accounts, reports and 
information which enable them to scrutinise the 
Company’s and management’s performance against 
agreed objectives.
Directors’ independence 
All the non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman, 
who was independent on appointment) were considered 
by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the 
Code in the year to 31 March 2015. 
The Board reviews non-executive Director independence 
at least annually, having regard to the potential relevance 
and materiality of a Director’s interests and relationships. 
No Director was materially interested in any contract or 
arrangement subsisting during or at the end of the 
financial period that was significant in relation to the 
business of the Company. 
Directors’ employment contracts 
Mr S A Borrows and Mrs J S Wilson each have 
employment contracts with the Group with notice periods 
of 12 months where notice is given by the Group and six 
months where notice is given by the Director. Save for 
these notice periods the employment contracts have no 
unexpired terms. None of the other Directors has a service 
contract with the Company.

Corporate governance statement continued
Training and development 
The Company has a training policy which provides a 
framework within which training for Directors is planned 
with the objective of ensuring Directors understand the 
duties and responsibilities of being a director of a listed 
company. All Directors are required to update their skills 
and maintain their familiarity with the Company and its 
business continually. Presentations on different aspects of 
the Company’s business are made regularly to the Board. 
On appointment, all non-executive Directors have 
discussions with the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
following which appropriate briefings on the 
responsibilities of Directors, the Company’s business and 
the Company’s procedures are arranged. The Company 
provides opportunities for non-executive Directors to 
obtain a thorough understanding of the Company’s 
business by meeting members of the senior management 
team who in turn arrange, as required, visits to investment 
or support teams. 
The Company has procedures for Directors to take 
independent legal or other professional advice in relation 
to the performance of their duties. 
THE BOARD’S COMMITTEES 
As described on page 51, the Board is assisted by various 
principal committees of the Board which report 
regularly to it. 
Audit and Compliance Committee 
The membership and activities of the Audit and 
Compliance Committee are described in its report on 
pages 65 to 68.
Remuneration Committee 
The membership and activities of the Remuneration 
Committee are described in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 72 to 81. 
Valuations Committee 
The membership and activities of the Valuations 
Committee are described in its report on pages 69 to 71.
Nominations Committee 
The Nominations Committee comprises Sir Adrian 
Montague (Chairman), Mrs C J Banszky, Mr J P Asquith, 
Mr A R Cox, Mr D A M Hutchison, Mr S R Thompson, and 
Ms M G Verluyten, all of whom served throughout the year, 
save for Mrs Banszky who served from her appointment 
as a Director on 17 July 2014 and Mr Thompson who 
served from his appointment as a Director on 13 April 
2015. Mr R H Meddings was a member of the Committee 
until his retirement from the Board on 17 July 2014 and 
Mr S A Borrows was a member of the Committee until 
24 September 2014. 
During the year, the Nominations Committee held six 
meetings. Attendance of members at those meetings is 
shown on the table on page 58. The Committee: 
  Considered the balance and composition of the Board, 
including succession planning, and the needs of the 
Company in terms of the desirable experience and 
qualifications of future appointees as non-executive 
Directors;
  Recommended Mr Asquith for appointment as Senior 
Independent Director;
  Considered candidates for appointment as Chairman of 
the Board in succession to Sir Adrian Montague;
  Considered candidates for appointment as non-
executive Director and recommended to the Board the 
appointment of Mrs Banszky; and
  Considered and put in train arrangements for selecting 
further candidates for recommendation to the Board for 
appointment as non-executive Director. 
The Company has a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process for the appointment of Directors with the objective 
of identifying the skills and experience profile required of 
new Directors and identifying suitable candidates. The 
procedure includes the appraisal and selection of potential 
candidates by the Committee, including (in the case of 
non-executive Directors) whether they have sufficient time 
to fulfil their roles. Specialist recruitment consultants 
assist the Committee to identify suitable candidates for 
appointment. The Committee’s recommendations for 
appointment are put to the full Board for approval. 
Further to the publication of the Davies Report on Women 
on Boards, and Code Provision B.2.4, the Board strongly 
supports the principle of boardroom diversity, of which 
gender is one important aspect. The Board’s aim is to have 
a diverse Board in terms of gender, industry experience, 
skills and educational background, and nationality. The 
Board makes appointments on merit and against objective 
criteria. External search consultancies engaged by the 
Company are instructed to put forward for all Board 
positions a diversity of candidates including women 
candidates. External search consultancies engaged by the 
Committee during the year were Egon Zehnder, Russell 
Reynolds Associates and The Zygos Partnership. Egon 
Zehnder and Russell Reynolds Associates also provided 
other recruitment services to the Group during the year.
THE COMPANY SECRETARY 
Directors have access to the advice and services of  
the General Counsel and Company Secretary, who advises 
the Board, through the Chairman, on governance matters. 
The Company’s Articles of Association and the schedule  
of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised 
committees for decision provide that the appointment  
and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for  
the full Board.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS 
AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS
Approach to Investor Relations
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a 
purposeful relationship with shareholders. The Group has 
a comprehensive Investor Relations programme to help 
existing and potential investors to understand its activities, 
strategy and financial performance. The Chief Executive 
and the Group Finance Director meet with the Company’s 
principal shareholders to discuss relevant issues as they 
arise. The Chairman maintains a dialogue with 
shareholders on strategy, corporate governance and 
Directors’ remuneration as required. The Board receives 
reports from the Company’s brokers on shareholder 
issues and non-executive Directors are invited to attend 
the Company’s presentations to analysts and are offered 
the opportunity to meet shareholders.
Board oversight
The Executive Directors brief the Board on a regular  
basis on the implementation of the Investor Relations 
programme and on feedback received from analysts and 
investors. Any significant concern raised by shareholders 
in relation to the Group is also communicated to the Board. 
In addition, research reports published by investment 
banks on 3i are circulated to the Board on a regular basis. 
The Board also receives periodic feedback from existing 
shareholders and potential investors through 3i’s 
corporate brokers, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  
and Barclays. 
Institutional investor programme
Meetings with principal shareholders
The Executive Directors meet with the Group’s principal 
shareholders on a twice yearly basis, following the 
publication of annual and half yearly results and as 
required during the year. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director are also available to meet with 
shareholders as required. The Investor Relations 
department also manages a programme of engagement 
with smaller shareholders, implemented through regular 
presentations and meetings. 
Meetings with potential investors
During the year, the Executive Directors and the Investor 
Relations team held regular meetings with potential 
investors internationally to communicate the strategy  
and performance of 3i. 
Annual and half yearly results presentations
The Executive Directors present the annual and half yearly 
results to a broad group of institutional investors and 
analysts. These presentations are webcast live on 3i’s 
website, and the on-demand webcast remains available 
on the website for a period of 12 months. 
Capital markets day
The 2014 capital markets day, held in June, consisted of a 
presentation to significant shareholders and analysts by 
senior 3i executives and the management team of Action, 
3i’s largest investment, followed by a tour of Action’s 
distribution centre in the northern Netherlands. The 
presentation focused on Action’s business model and 
strategy and on its recent financial performance. The 
presentation materials used on the day were made 
available on 3i’s website to enable those investors and 
analysts that could not attend to access the information 
provided at the meeting. 
Industry conferences
Throughout the year, the Executive Directors also 
participated in a number of industry conferences 
organised by investment banks for their institutional 
investor base. These included conferences organised by 
Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, KBW, Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch and Citi. 
Individual investors
Individual investors are encouraged to engage with the 
Group and provide feedback through the Investor Relations 
team and the Company Secretary, whose contact details 
are available on the website.

current operations and strategy, as well as an archive of 
over 10 years of news and historical financial information 
on the Group and details of forthcoming events for 
shareholders and analysts. Annual and half-year results 
presentations are also webcast live and on-demand on  
3i’s website. 
Annual General Meeting
The Company also uses its AGM as an opportunity to 
communicate with its shareholders. At the Meeting, 
business presentations are generally made by the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive. The Chairmen of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Compliance, and Nominations 
Committees are generally available to answer 
shareholders’ questions. Business to be discussed at the 
meeting is notified to shareholders in advance through the 
Notice of Meeting and covers matters such as the annual 
election of Directors, the appointment of the Auditors and 
the dividend declaration. During the meeting, shareholders 
are also asked to approve the financial statement and 
report of the Directors and Auditors. In addition, 
shareholders are asked to approve the Directors’ 
remuneration report. 
The 2014 Notice of AGM was dispatched to shareholders 
not less than 20 working days before the Meeting.  
At that Meeting, voting on each resolution was taken on  
a poll and the poll results were made available on the 
Company’s website.
RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS ATTACHING 
TO SHARES
A summary of the rights and restrictions attaching to 
shares as at 31 March 2015 is set out below.
The Company’s Articles of Association may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders in general meeting. 
Holders of ordinary shares enjoy the rights set out in the 
Articles of Association of the Company and under the laws 
of England and Wales. Any share may be issued with or 
have attached to it such rights and restrictions as the 
Company by ordinary resolution or, failing such resolution, 
the Board may decide.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak 
and vote at general meetings and to appoint proxies and, in 
the case of corporations, corporate representatives to 
attend, speak and vote at such meetings on their behalf. To 
attend and vote at a general meeting a shareholder must 
be entered on the register of members at such time (not 
being earlier than 48 hours before the meeting) as stated 
in the Notice of general meeting. On a poll, holders of 
ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each 
share held. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the 
Company’s Annual report and accounts, to receive such 
dividends and other distributions as may lawfully be paid 
or declared on such shares and, on any liquidation of the 
Company, to share in the surplus assets of the Company 
after satisfaction of the entitlements of the holders of any 
shares with preferred rights as may then be in issue.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of fully paid 
shares in the Company, save as follows. The Board may 
decline to register: a transfer of uncertificated shares in 
the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001; a transfer to more than four joint 
holders; a transfer of certificated shares which is not in 
respect of only one class of share; a transfer which is not 
accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which  
it relates; a transfer which is not duly stamped in 
circumstances where a duly stamped instrument is 
required; or a transfer where in accordance with section 
794 of the Companies Act 2006 a notice (under section 793 
of that Act) has been served by the Company on a 
shareholder who has then failed to give the information 
required within the specified time. In the latter 
circumstances the Company may make the relevant 
shares subject to certain restrictions (including in respect 
of the ability to exercise voting rights, to transfer the 
shares validly and, except in the case of a liquidation, to 
receive the payment of sums due from the Company). 
There are no shares carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. There are no restrictions placed 
on voting rights of fully paid shares, save where in 
accordance with Article 12 of the Company’s Articles of 
Association a restriction notice has been served by the 
Company in respect of shares for failure to comply with 
statutory notices or where a transfer notice (as described 
below) has been served in respect of shares and has not 
yet been complied with. Where shares are held on behalf 
of former or current employees under employee share 
schemes, those participants can give instructions to the 
holder of such shares as to how votes attached to such 
shares should be exercised.
In the circumstances specified in Article 38 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association the Company may  
serve a transfer notice on holders of shares. The relevant 
circumstances relate to: (a) potential tax disadvantage to 
the Company, (b) the number of “United States Residents” 
who own or hold shares becoming 75 or more, or (c) the 
Company being required to be registered as an investment 
company under relevant US legislation. The notice would 
require the transfer of relevant shares and pending such 
transfer the rights and privileges attaching to those shares 
would be suspended. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of its securities that may restrict the transfer of 
shares or exercise of voting rights.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT  
AND VOTING POLICY 
In relation to unquoted investments, the Group’s approach 
is to seek to add value to the businesses in which the 
Group invests through the Group’s extensive experience, 
resources and contacts and through active engagement 
with the Boards of those companies. In relation to quoted 
investments, the Group’s policy is to exercise voting rights 
on all matters affecting its interests. 
INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and reviews its effectiveness at least annually. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly 
authorised committees for decision, the Board aims  
to maintain full and effective control over appropriate 
strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. 
The Board has put in place an organisational structure 
with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority. The Board considers and approves a strategic 
plan and budget on an annual basis and receives regular 
updates. In addition, there are established procedures and 
processes for planning and controlling expenditure and 
the making of investments. There are also information and 
reporting systems for monitoring the Group’s businesses 
and their performance. 
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee 
formed by the Chief Executive and its purpose is to review 
the business of the Group in order to ensure that business 
risk is considered, assessed and managed as an integral 
part of the business. There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
significant risks. This process was in place for the year to 
31 March 2015 and up to the date of this report. Details  
of the risk management framework can be found in the 
Risk section. 
The overall internal control process is regularly reviewed 
by the Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee 
and complies with the internal control guidance for 
Directors on the Code issued by the Turnbull Committee. 
The internal control process established for the Group 
includes: 
Policies 
  Core values and global policies together comprising the 
Group’s high-level principles and controls, with which 
all staff are expected to comply; 
  Detailed policies and procedures, with processes for 
reporting weaknesses and for monitoring corrective 
action; and 
  A Compliance manual, with procedures for reporting 
compliance therewith. 
Processes 
  Appointment of experienced and professional staff, 
both by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary 
calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities; 
  A planning framework which incorporates a Board 
approved strategic plan, with objectives for each 
business unit; 
  Formal business risk reviews performed by 
management which evaluate the potential financial 
impact and likelihood of identified risks and possible 
new risk areas; 
  The setting of control, mitigation and monitoring 
procedures and the review of actual occurrences, 
identifying lessons to be learnt; 
  A comprehensive system of financial reporting to the 
Board, based on an annual budget with monthly 
reporting of actual results, analysis of variances, 
scrutiny of key performance indicators and regular 
re-forecasting; 
  Regular reports to the Board, which analyse funding 
requirements, track the generation and use of capital 
and the volume of liquidity, measure the Group’s 
exposure to exchange rate movements and record the 
level of compliance with the Group’s funding objectives; 
  A Group Compliance function whose role is to integrate 
regulatory compliance procedures and best practices 
into the Group’s systems; and 
  Well defined procedures governing the appraisal and 
approval of investments, including detailed investment 
and divestment approval procedures, incorporating 
appropriate levels of authority and regular post-
investment reviews.

examination of business units and processes and 
recommends improvements in controls to 
management;
  The external Auditors who are engaged to express an 
opinion on the annual financial statements; and
  An Audit and Compliance Committee which considers 
significant control matters and receives reports from 
Internal Audit, the external Auditors and Group 
Compliance on a regular basis.
The internal control system is monitored and supported  
by Internal Audit and Group Compliance, which operate  
on an international basis and report to management and 
the Audit and Compliance Committee on the Group’s 
operations. The work of Internal Audit is focused on the 
areas of greatest risk to the Group determined with 
reference to the Group’s risk management process.
The external Auditors independently and objectively review 
the approach of management to reporting operating 
results and financial condition. They also review and test 
the system of internal financial control and the information 
contained in the annual financial statements to the extent 
necessary for expressing their opinion. 
FINANCIAL REPORTING
In the context of the above internal control framework, 
there are specific processes in place in relation to 
Financial Reporting, including:
  Comprehensive system of key control and oversight 
processes, including regular reconciliations, line 
manager reviews and systems’ access controls;
  Updates for consideration by the Audit and Compliance 
Committee of accounting developments, including draft 
and new accounting standards and legislation;
  A separate Valuations Committee which considers the 
Group’s investment valuation policies, application 
and outcome;

Audit and Compliance Committee report
 “ The Audit and Compliance 
Committee’s priorities 
remain the effectiveness of 
internal control and ensuring 
the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting.”
INTRODUCTION
With the retirement in July 2014 of Richard 
Meddings, who had been Chairman of the 
Audit and Compliance Committee (“the 
Committee”) since October 2010, Caroline 
Banszky was appointed as Chairman with 
effect from January 2015 after a period of 
familiarisation with the business. In the 
interim, Jonathan Asquith chaired the 
Committee as Acting Chairman. 
MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDEES
The Board is satisfied that Mrs Banszky and Mr Asquith 
both have recent and relevant financial experience as 
outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further 
detail on each Director’s experience can be found in the 
Directors’ biographies on page 48.
Throughout the year, the Committee received regular 
reports on a number of matters including the valuation 
of the investment portfolio, internal audit findings and 
follow-up work, accounting issues and judgements, and 
legal and regulatory matters. The Committee received 
presentations from members of senior management 
including the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, 
General Counsel, Group Financial Controller, the Director, 
Internal Audit and the Director, Group Compliance, as well 
as from the external Auditors Ernst & Young LLP .
Other attendees were invited from time to time depending 
on the nature of agenda items.
The Chairman of the Committee also had meetings with 
a number of these individuals separately, providing an 
additional forum to discuss specific issues. During the 
year, the Committee held private discussions with the 
Group Finance Director, the Director, Internal Audit, the 
Director, Group Compliance and with the external Auditors 
in the absence of management.
For the first time, this Annual Report includes a separate 
report from the Valuations Committee. The role of the 
Committee to review and recommend the valuation of the 
investment portfolio remains unchanged. However the 
detail on the key valuation considerations and the review 
and challenge undertaken in the year is now included in 
the Valuation Committee Report on page 69.

WHAT THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWED IN THE YEAR 
The Committee met six times during the year and the attendance of members at meetings is shown in the table on 
page 58. During the year the Committee’s activities included considering the following: 
In addition to the areas of significant accounting judgement 
(set out opposite) and monitoring the effectiveness of 3i’s 
risk management, discussed further below, the Committee 
particularly focused on the changing regulatory 
environment, the finalisation of implementing a new 
Private Equity accounting system and the increasing 
materiality of carried interest payable accrual.
The regulatory and tax environment has been going 
through a period of unprecedented change. There has 
been a significant increase in reporting to regulators and 
tax authorities as well as changes to our operating model 
in accordance with the new requirements of AIFMD, EMIR, 
CRD IV, CASS rules and FATCA. This has placed additional 
burdens on the compliance and finance functions in 
particular. The Committee has received quarterly updates 
on the key regulatory and tax developments and 
outstanding projects from both Finance and Group 
Compliance. Where necessary external professional 
service firms have been engaged to review both our 
interpretation of the requirements and the ongoing 
compliance as well as the processes implemented to 
gather new data. The Committee also requested that 
Internal Audit undertake a series of reviews to further test 
implementation of our new regulatory reporting processes 
and systems and ongoing compliance with the new 
requirements which were found to be satisfactory.
The Committee assessed how the risks associated with a 
new system implementation and related process changes 
had been mitigated. The Committee requested that 
Internal Audit undertake periodic reviews of the project, 
including the change management process and a post 
implementation review. It also requested a report on the 
effectiveness of the system from the Group Financial 
Controller. In addition the external Auditors considered the 
effective working of the system and application controls as 
part of the external audit. The Committee was satisfied 
that the risks were being appropriately managed.
The improved investment performance and good flow  
of realisations led the Committee to review the carried 
interest payable accrual and payment processes. Internal 
Audit undertook a review of the processes and accounting 
policies. Following the completion of this review and 
discussion with the external Auditors, the Committee was 
satisfied that carried interest was being appropriately 
managed and accounted for.

Area of significant accounting judgement What the Committee reviewed and concluded
Valuation of the Proprietary Capital portfolio
The most material area of judgement in the financial statements, 
and noted as a key risk by the external Auditor, relates to the 
valuation of the unquoted Proprietary Capital portfolio, which at 
31 March 201 5 was £3, 1 14 million, or 80% of net assets, under  
the Investment basis.
In recognition of the importance of this area the Board has 
established a separate Valuations Committee to review the 
valuations policy, process and application to individual 
investments. This Committee provides quarterly 
recommendations to the Committee and the Board.
On behalf of the Board, the Committee considered quarterly 
reports from the Chairman of the Valuations Committee and the 
Group Finance Director, with particular focus on the assumptions 
supporting the unquoted asset investments, any valuation 
uncertainties and the proposed disclosure in the financial 
statements. 
For further information see the report of the Valuation 
Committee on pages 69 to 71.
Fair , balanced and understandable 
Under the UK Corporate Governance Code the Board should 
establish arrangements to ensure the Annual Report presents a 
fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s 
position and prospects.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit and Compliance Committee 
considered the procedures required to ensure that this statement 
could be made.
The Committee reviewed the Interim and Annual financial 
statements as well as the quarterly trading updates with 
management, focusing on the integrity and clarity of disclosure 
and to enable the Board ultimately to provide the fair, balanced  
and understandable confirmation to shareholders in the  
Annual report. The Committee considers that the Annual report 
is consistent with its understanding of the business.
The 2015 Annual report has been enhanced, in parallel with the 
FRC’s Clear and Concise reporting programme, to ensure that it 
is less cluttered and duplication is removed.
A report highlighting the relevant considerations was reviewed 
by the Committee in advance of the year end and a summary  
of the procedures undertaken was prepared alongside the 
Annual report.
Ongoing development of IFRS 10 and the presentation of 3i’s results 
The Group adopted IFRS 10 in its 2014 accounts and introduced the 
non-GAAP Investment basis financial statements to ensure that its 
results remained understandable.
The Committee monitored feedback received from external 
users of the financial statements on the presentation of the 
non-GAAP Investment basis and was satisfied that maintenance 
of the Investment basis financial statements was appropriate.
The Committee continued to receive regular updates on 
developments in IFRS 10, including the amendment in 2014, and 
to endorse the engagement of management with the FRC, IASB 
and relevant industry bodies.
The external Auditors also confirmed that the inclusion of the 
Investment basis remained consistent with the prior year.
RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROL REVIEWS
The Committee has responsibility on behalf of the Board 
for overseeing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. It monitors the 
activities of the Group Risk Committee (“GRC”), the risk 
management processes in place and the activities of the 
Internal Audit function, including its reporting on the 
effectiveness of controls, the use of the Group’s 
whistleblowing facility and any changes in approach or 
issues relating to the UK Bribery Act.
A report summarising each quarterly GRC meeting, along 
with the risk report considered, is circulated to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee for review and discussion.  
The risk report details the principal risks, which are 
derived from the Group Risk process, along with 
commentary on how the exposure to these risks has 
moved in the quarter. The Committee also receives reports 
from Internal Audit quarterly, covering change 
management and other areas of identified higher risk. 
67 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Audit and Compliance Committee report continued
The General Counsel and Group Finance Director prepare 
an annual report on the internal controls framework for 
presentation to the Committee. The review documents  
the components of the internal control framework and 
highlights the key developments in the year. A separate 
commentary on the operation and effectiveness of the 
internal control framework over the year is independently 
prepared by Internal Audit. The Group maintains a 
framework of controls related to key financial processes 
and management of the associated risks. The 
effectiveness of such controls is reviewed by Internal 
Audit, either through dedicated reviews or in the course  
of other reviews over the course of the year. Group 
Compliance carries out desk based monitoring, business 
unit and thematic reviews in relation to compliance 
policies and other regulatory matters. 
The Committee reviewed the scope, activity and 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and met 
privately with the Director, Internal Audit. 
EXTERNAL AUDIT
Ernst & Young LLP has been the Group’s statutory external 
Auditor since before the Company was listed on the 
London Stock Exchange in 1994. The Committee assesses 
the independence and objectivity, qualifications and 
effectiveness of Ernst & Young LLP on an annual basis. 
The Committee also concludes on whether to recommend 
the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors to 
the Board.
Auditor appointment and independence
The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring the 
independence and objectivity of the Company’s Auditors. It 
reviews the nature and extent of the services provided by 
them, the level of their fees and the element comprising 
non-audit fees.
The Committee reviewed the Auditors’ fee structure, 
resourcing and terms of engagement in the year. The total 
audit fee for the year was £2.0 million (2014: £2.0 million). 
The Committee is satisfied that this fee is appropriate in 
respect of the audit services provided and that an effective 
audit can be provided. The Committee oversees the 
Group’s policy on the provision of non-audit services by the 
external Auditor. The Committee continues to see benefits 
for the Group in engaging Ernst & Young LLP where:
  Work is closely related to the audit;
  A detailed understanding of the Group is required; and
  Ernst & Young LLP is able to provide at least an 
equivalent quality and/or value service than other 
potential providers.
The Committee Chairman approves all assignments 
allocated to Ernst & Young LLP over a defined limit, other 
than those related to due diligence within the Group’s 
investment process. The key principle of our policy is that 
permission to engage the external Auditor will be refused 
when a threat to independence and/or objectivity is 
perceived. Appointments in relation to the investment 
process are independent of the audit team and are 
approved separately by the Investment Committee  
but are reported to the Committee Chairman. 
Details of the non-audit fees paid to the Auditors are 
disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements. The 
Committee concluded that all of these fees fell within its 
criteria for engaging Ernst & Young LLP and that the 
activities did not undermine the Auditor’s independence  
or objectivity.
Assessing external audit effectiveness
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of Ernst & Young 
LLP through the use of questionnaires completed by 
management, by considering the extent of their 
contribution at its meetings throughout the course  
of the year and in one-to-one meetings. 
The 2015 evaluation also reviewed the quality of the audit 
process, the use of Ernst & Young LLP’s valuation practice 
to support the audit of the portfolio valuations, the 
technical knowledge of the team and staff turnover within 
the Ernst & Young LLP audit team and the Committee 
concluded that the audit was effective. 
Audit tender
During the year the Committee reviewed the effect of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the EU Audit Regulation 
2014 and the Statutory Service Order 2014 issued by  
the UK Competitions and Market Authority (“CMA”) with 
respect to audit relationships. Due to the extent of the 
changes to the business following the Strategic Review in 
2012, the adoption of IFRS 10 and the extent of existing 
relationships with alternative audit firms across the Group, 
the Committee concluded that it would take advantage of 
the transitional arrangements in relation to auditor 
rotation as outlined by the Financial Reporting Council and 
the CMA. The Committee currently plans that Ernst & 
Young LLP will be retained at least until the conclusion of 
the term of its current lead partner in 2018. A full tender 
will therefore be conducted no later than 2018.

V aluations Committee report
 “The Valuations Committee 
plays an important role in 
providing the Board with 
assurance that the valuation 
process is sound and 
independently challenged.”
INTRODUCTION
The Committee has been in operation since 
before the Company’s flotation in 1994 but 
is reporting directly to shareholders for the 
first time this year. The Valuations 
Committee reports to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and the Board on 
the valuation of the Group’s investment 
assets. It meets quarterly, to coincide with 
the Group’s external financial reporting 
requirements. It reviews and challenges 
the assumptions behind management’s 
proposed investment asset valuation.
The Committee’s activity is principally focused on the 
Private Equity investments as a high level of judgement is 
required to value the unquoted portfolio. The Committee 
has increased its review of the Group’s Debt Management 
investments during the year as the capital allocation to 
that business has grown. Limited time is devoted to 
Infrastructure due to the fact that its principal investment 
in 3i Infrastructure plc is quoted.
The Committee is responsible for keeping the Group’s 
valuation policy under review and recommending any 
changes to the policy to Audit and Compliance Committee 
and the Board. The policy is reviewed at least annually.  
The Group’s valuation policy is based on the International 
Private Equity and Valuation (“IPEV”) guidelines which set 
out recommended practice for fair valuing unquoted 
investments within the IFRS framework. 
OVERVIEW OF THE VALUATION PROCESS
The Committee receives a detailed report from the Group 
Finance Director recommending a proposed valuation of 
the investment portfolio. This report highlights the key 
themes by business line and the main drivers of value 
movement analysed between performance, multiple 
movements and other factors. The Committee also 
reviews selected material assets in further detail; 
examples of such assets covered during the year included 
Action, Basic-Fit, Scandlines and new investments made 
during FY2015.
In advance of the full year and half year reporting, 
management hold detailed individual portfolio company 
reviews with the respective investment teams. All 
non-executive Directors are free to attend these meetings. 
Non-executive Directors, including members of the 
Valuations Committee, attended a significant proportion of 
all the meetings held in September 2014 and March 2015 
and were represented at all of the top five Private Equity 
portfolio company review meetings. 
As part of its external audit, Ernst & Young LLP undertakes 
a separate review of the proposed investment portfolio 
valuation to determine that the valuation policy is being 
complied with and that there is consistent application and 
support for the underlying assumptions. Ahead of the 
year-end audit, Ernst & Young LLP’s specialist valuations 
team independently reviews a selection of assets to 
provide further assurance on their overall audit conclusion 
on the appropriateness of 3i’s portfolio valuation.

Chairman, Valuations Committee
69 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
V aluations Committee report continued
FY2015 UPDATE
The Committee focused on the following significant issues in the year:
Areas of judgement What the Committee did
Private Equity
Earnings and multiple assumptions
The majority of the portfolio is valued using a multiple of EBITDA 
earnings. This requires judgement as the earnings of the portfolio 
company may be adjusted so that they are considered 
“maintainable”. 
There is also a significant degree of judgement in selecting the 
appropriate set of comparable quoted companies to determine the 
appropriate multiple to generate an enterprise value. Multiples are 
selected by reference to quoted comparable companies, M&A 
transactions and input in certain cases from corporate finance 
advisors. We also take into account growth profile, diversification 
and leverage/refinancing risk.
The multiple implied by the quoted comparable may be reduced if 
the longer-term view (cycle or exit plan) supports the use of more 
conservative multiples.
Earnings data is received monthly from Private Equity portfolio 
companies and monitored closely by management. Actual 
earnings may be adjusted in management’s proposed valuations, 
for example, to reflect a full year’s trading of an acquired 
business, removing profit from discontinued activities or 
excluding exceptional transaction costs. Material adjustments 
are highlighted to the Committee in the quarterly report for 
review and approval.
Given the strong performance of many quoted markets in the 
year, management proposed reducing a significant proportion of 
multiples used to below the multiple implied by the quoted 
comparable levels. Any such adjustments are reviewed by the 
Committee. Ernst & Young LLP also specifically review and 
consider the appropriateness of any such adjustments and 
reports to the Committee.
Imminent sale assets
At any point in time it is likely that a number of potential exit 
processes from the portfolio are underway. Judgement is applied 
by management as to the likely eventual exit proceeds and 
certainty of completion. This means that in some cases an asset 
may not be moved to an imminent sales basis until very shortly 
before completion; in other cases the switch may occur on signing. 
However as a general rule an asset moves to an imminent sale 
basis only when a process is materially complete and the 
remaining risks are estimated to be minimal, given the normal 
completion risk around unquoted equity transactions.
Assets that are within active sales processes are reviewed by 
the Committee including details such as the timeline to potential 
completion, the number and make-up of bidders for investments, 
execution and due diligence risks and regulatory or competition 
clearance issues. Management propose a treatment for each 
asset which the Committee reviews.
Assets valued using a DCF basis
For assets valued using DCF techniques the key valuation 
judgements relate to longer-term assumptions that drive the 
underlying business plan and appropriate discount rates.
Material assumptions and changes to these assumptions are 
reviewed by the Committee. This may include third-party 
support if available. Sensitivity to assumptions is also noted.
Discount rates are selected by management with reference to 
market transactions, weighted average cost of capital 
calculations and other public data. Any material changes are 
reviewed by the Committee.
Debt Management
Valuation process
The level of capital deployed into Debt Management investments  
at 31 March 201 5 was £1 76 million (March 2014: £143 million).  
70% of this relates to investment in CLO equity where there is 
limited trading and therefore limited third-party evidence of value. 
Consequently, judgement is required on the choice of basis to use, 
including use of internal DCF models. 
As the level of capital invested in Debt Management investments 
has continued to increase, the Committee has also continued to 
review the valuations policy and refine the process. The use by 
management of independent data supporting the proposed 
valuations has been increased, and the quarterly valuation report 
includes a range indicated from all available data points, 
including internal DCF models, against the proposed valuation. 
The range and actual values are reviewed by the Committee.
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 70 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
As part of its challenge and review process, the 
Committee:
  Considered the management information provided to 
support the Committee’s review of the matter, including 
the strength and operation of the internal controls and 
management’s responses to any challenges raised by 
the Committee members or Ernst & Young LLP;
  Sought assurance from the external Auditors as to 
whether and how they had considered each of 
these areas; 
  Reviewed the consistency of the views of management 
and the external Auditors.
The Committee was satisfied that the application of the 
policy and process was appropriate during the period, and 
recommended the portfolio valuation to the Audit and 
Compliance Committee and the Board at each quarter end 
for approval by the Board.
PORTFOLIO TRENDS
The Committee Chairman and management conducted a 
review of the valuation outcomes in the portfolio since 
2012. The Committee Chairman and Group Finance 
Director reported to the Board in May 2015 on the key 
observations. 
It is intended to conduct similar reviews at least  
annually as an additional review of the overall  
portfolio development, alongside the specific  
quarterly valuation process.

Directors’ remuneration report
STATEMENT BY THE REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
As Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the financial 
year 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015 
(“the year” or “FY2015”) and to provide 
some details of the background against 
which the Committee’s decisions have 
been taken in the year. References to “the 
current year” or “FY2016” relate to the 
financial year 1 April 2015 
to 31 March 2016.
At our 2014 Annual General Meeting, our remuneration 
policy was approved. No changes are being made to that 
policy. The policy is also reproduced for reference from 
page 138 of this Annual Report. 
Last year’s Directors’ remuneration report was our first 
such report published under the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013, and we received some helpful feedback 
from a number of shareholders and their representatives 
on aspects of that report. That feedback, particularly in 
relation to disclosures linking performance to annual 
bonus outcomes, has assisted us in preparing the 
Directors’ remuneration report for the year.
PERFORMANCE IN THE YEAR
As we approach the end of the third year of the multi-year 
strategic plan announced in June 2012, I am pleased to 
report, as you will have read earlier in this Annual Report, 
that this has been another successful year for the 
Company. The business has continued to deliver a good 
flow of realisations and strong unrealised value growth 
driven by quality earnings growth. This, combined with the 
Company’s continued cost discipline, has generated a total 
return of 20% on opening shareholders’ funds. This return 
was achieved despite significant currency headwinds. In 
addition, all the objectives set out at the start of the 
strategic plan have been met or exceeded. 
The strong performance by the Company has been 
reflected in the share price which has increased by 21%  
in the year and a 177% total shareholder return since the 
June 2012 strategic announcement.
The Committee’s decisions concerning the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration were made in light of these 
achievements against the strategic priorities which were 
established for the year. Further information on this 
assessment is provided on pages 74 to 76. Highlights of 
these achievements include: 
Portfolio return
A combination of strong Private Equity portfolio 
performance, continued delivery of Private Equity 
realisations at material uplifts to opening value and a very 
good return on the Infrastructure portfolio, generated a 
gross investment return of £805 million or 23% of opening 
portfolio value. A significant portion of this return was 
driven by earnings growth in the Private Equity portfolio.
Investment
The improved levels of new investment activity in FY2014 
carried through to FY2015 with four key investments 
completed in Private Equity: Q Holding (precision 
engineered elastomeric components manufacturer), 
Dynatech (manufacturer of engineered, mission critical 
protective equipment), Aspen Pumps (manufacturer of 
pumps and accessories for the air conditioning, heating 
and refrigeration industry) and Christ (distributor and 
retailer of affordable jewellery). The Infrastructure 
business also completed a €107 million investment in two 
oil storage facilities and committed a total of £37 million to 
new PPP deals, while Debt Management successfully 
completed £2.2 billion of new CLO issuance in the year.
However, in light of the high-priced market conditions for 
Private Equity and Infrastructure assets, it was important 
that the Company maintained an emphasis on disciplined 
investing. Numerous potential investments were declined 
for pricing reasons and only a select number of investment 
opportunities were pursued and completed.
 “We remain committed to 
maintaining a remuneration 
framework which rewards 
progress in meeting the 
Group’s strategic objectives.”
Jonathan Asquith  
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 72 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Operating profit
For many years prior to FY2014, the Company had 
operated at a material annual operating cash loss, which 
diluted capital returns to our shareholders. Annual 
operating cash profits have further improved from 
£5 million in FY2014 to £28 million for FY2015. This 
significantly exceeded the FY2015 target due to the 12% 
growth in Debt Management AUM, improved portfolio 
income cash generation in Private Equity and dividend 
proceeds from 3iN.
Strategy, investor relations and culture
We are now at the end of the three year strategic plan 
that was set out by our Chief Executive, Simon Borrows, 
in June 2012. Each phase of the plan from the first year’s 
Restructuring, the subsequent Transition and delivery 
phase and now the achievement of the strategic goal 
has been well communicated to, and supported by, our 
shareholders. As a result of these strategic changes, 
the Company today is now a more robust, efficient and 
energised operation than three years ago.
The effects of this turnaround are reflected in the long-
term remuneration of the Executive Directors in two ways. 
We have operated LTIP schemes for key management for 
many years. This year is the first since 2008 in which any 
long-term incentive award has actually vested at 3i. The 
amounts received by the Executive Directors, which are 
entirely in line with policy, reflect the Company’s excellent 
performance under their guidance over the last three 
years and the appreciation in the share price from £1.97 
per share at the time of grant.
COMMITTEE PRIORITIES AND POTENTIAL 
CHANGES IN THE CURRENT YEAR
The Committee remains committed to maintaining a 
remuneration framework which rewards progress in 
meeting the Group’s strategic objectives.
We regularly monitor relevant guidelines and regulatory 
changes, and our current arrangements are fully in line 
with these. During the current year, the Committee will 
continue to follow developments, and in particular will 
assess the potential impact of the draft EBA guidelines on 
remuneration in relation to CRD IV, which may necessitate 
changes to our remuneration policy in FY2016. The 
Committee will also review its malus/clawback policies 
in FY2016.
The Remuneration Committee values all feedback from 
shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

POLICY REPORT 
The policy as set out in the 2014 Directors’ remuneration report was formally approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting on 17 July 2014. No amendments to the policy are required for this year and so shareholders will not be 
asked to vote on the policy at this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
The full policy is reproduced for reference from page 138. 
Following the publication of the 2014 Directors’ remuneration report, the Company issued a statement on its website 
providing further context on how the Committee would address the issue of an Executive Director participating in a 
carried interest scheme. For the avoidance of doubt, neither of the current Executive Directors participates in a carried 
interest scheme and any future Chief Executive or Group Finance Director will not be permitted to participate. Further 
details can be found on our website here: http:/ /www.3i.com/system/files/reports/3i_DirectorsRemunerationPolicy_

  Benefits include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and, for Mrs Wilson, the value of the Share Incentive Plan matching  
share awards. 
  Mr Borrows and Mrs Wilson received salary supplements in lieu of pension contributions of £15k and £45k respectively. 
  Annual bonus awards made in respect of the year are delivered as 50% cash immediately, and 50% payable in shares deferred for 
four years, subject to the malus/clawback policy. These shares are released in four equal annual instalments over the four years 
commencing June 2016 and carry the right to receive dividends and other distributions.
  In the case of Mrs C J Banszky the sum shown (which includes VAT) was paid to her principal employer, the Law Debenture  
Corporation p.l.c., which released her to serve as a non-executive Director.
  In addition to the table above, dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested deferred share awards were paid during the year 
(Mr Borrows £131k, Mrs Wilson £36k). 
  The value shown in the LTIP (no performance condition) for Mr Borrows represents the award made in 2011 on joining the Company

market price of 407.3 pence.
  The values shown in the LTIP (performance condition) represent the performance shares vesting from the 2012 LTIP . The shares have 
been valued using the 31 March 2015 closing share price (482.4 pence). Further detail is provided on page 76.
  The fees shown for the non-executive Directors include fees used to purchase shares in the Company.
  In addition to the fees shown above, Mr Borrows retained directors’ fees of £67k from The British Land Company PLC and £76k from 
Inchcape plc, and Mrs Wilson retained directors’ fees of £105k from Legal and General Group plc.
FY2015 ANNUAL BONUS
The annual bonuses for Executive Directors for the year were awarded against a balanced scorecard of both financial 
and strategic measures agreed by the Committee in May 2014. The Committee uses the scorecard as a prompt and 
guide to judgment and considers the performance outcomes in the wider context of personal performance (including 
values and behaviours), risk, market and other factors. 
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 74 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The scorecard review was completed in the context of a very strong performance by the business, resulting in a 20% 
total return for the year. Highlights of this performance included:
  A strong level of realisations (£831m) from the Private Equity portfolio, delivered at a significant premium (27%) to 
opening value;
  Unrealised value growth of £684m in the Private Equity portfolio, underpinned by growth in earnings in portfolio 
companies of 19%;
  Improved origination activity resulting in increased levels of investment in Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt 
Management, whilst retaining a disciplined and selective approach to investment opportunities; and
  Value uplifts and realisations from the European Infrastructure portfolio leading to a material increase in the 
value of 3iN.
Virtually all of the Group and business line KPIs, including those set out in the scorecard assessment shown below, have 
outperformed versus plan from the beginning of the year. Overall, performance for FY2015 not only exceeded plan but in 
all material respects improved further on the excellent performance in FY2014. 
The specific metrics considered by the Committee to assess the performance of the Executive Directors in each area 
of strategic focus are set out below, together, where appropriate, with their associated targets.
For some metrics, particularly in the area of new investments and realisations, the Board sets expectations rather than 
targets. This is because the timing of acquisitions and disposals is highly sensitive to market conditions, and a more 
prescriptive approach would run the risk of creating perverse incentives for executives. For example, to achieve a target 
level of realisations may result in the earlier sale of assets than would otherwise be appropriate, or to achieve a target 
level of investments may result in investing at inflated prices. In practice, the Board’s expectations in these areas were 
met or exceeded in each case.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
In the light of the achievements detailed above, and the exceptional performance of the Group in the year, the Committee 
awarded Mr Borrows a bonus in respect of FY2015 of £2,096k (being 92.5% of his maximum bonus opportunity) and 
awarded Mrs Wilson a bonus in respect of FY2015 of £850k (being 82.5% of her maximum bonus opportunity). In each 
case, 50% of the award will be paid in cash immediately, with the remaining 50% being deferred into shares vesting in 
equal instalments over four years.
SHARE AWARDS VESTING IN 2015 SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS
2012 Long-term incentive award
The long-term incentive awards granted in July 2012 to Mr Borrows and Mrs Wilson were subject to a performance 
condition based on annualised Total return on equity over the three financial years to 31 March 2015. The table below 
shows the achievement against this condition and the resulting proportion of the awards that will vest in July 2015.

and vest in four equal instalments annually from 1 June 2015.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN
During the year Mrs Wilson participated in the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan which during the year allowed 
employees to invest up to £150 per month from pre-tax salary in ordinary shares (“partnership shares”). For each 
partnership share, the Company grants two free ordinary shares (“matching shares”) which are normally forfeited if 
employment ceases within three years of grant. Dividends are reinvested in further ordinary shares (“dividend shares”).
During the year Mrs Wilson purchased 409 partnership shares, and received 818 matching shares and 549 dividend 
shares at prices ranging between £3.8173 and £4.923 per share, with an average price of £4.244. 
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Mr Borrows and Mrs Wilson received salary supplements in lieu of pension of £15k and £45k respectively. 
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS
No payments were made to past Directors in the year.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
No payments to Directors for loss of office have been made in the year.

STATEMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY IN THE COMING YEAR
The table below sets out how the Committee intends to operate the remuneration policy in FY2016. 
Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2016
Base salary A Group-wide 3% increase to salaries will take place in FY2016, which will also be applied to Executive 
Director salaries. Effective from 1 July 201 5, salaries for the Executive Directors will therefore be as 
follows:
  Chief Executive: £583,495 (+3%)
  Group Finance Director: £424,360 (+3%)
Pension No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016. The Executive Directors will continue 
to receive a pension contribution or salary supplement as follows:
  Chief Executive: £15k
  Group Finance Director: 1 2% of salary
Benefits No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016.
Benefits will continue to include a car allowance, provision of health insurance and any Share Incentive 
Plan matching share awards.
Annual bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunities for FY2016 will remain unchanged, in line with the 
remuneration policy, as follows:
  Chief Executive: 400% of salary
  Group Finance Director: 250% of salary
Awards over 75% of this maximum will be made only in exceptional circumstances.
Any bonus will be awarded based on a balanced scorecard of both financial and strategic measures 
agreed by the Committee, alongside a consideration of the wider context of personal performance 
(including values and behaviours) risk, market and other factors. 
Measures for the FY2016 scorecard are based 85% on financial measures (50% portfolio returns, 25% 
investment management and 10% operating performance) and 15% on strategic and people objectives. 
They are calibrated to current business strategy and will evolve year on year as the Group’s situation and 
priorities develop.
The Committee considers that the specific targets and expectations contained in the FY2016 scorecard 
are commercially sensitive and therefore will not be disclosed in advance. We will report to shareholders 
next year on performance and the resulting bonus outturns.
At least 50% of any bonus award will be deferred into shares vesting in equal instalments over four years.
Under the Company’s malus and clawback policy, any deferred bonus may be forfeited or reduced prior 
to vesting in exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair, reasonable and 
proportionate. This would include material misstatement of Group financial statements, or cases where 
an individual is deemed to have caused a material loss for the Group as a result of reckless, negligent or 
wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
79 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Policy element Implementation of policy during FY2016
Long-term incentive plan Awards under the long-term incentive plan in FY2016 will be made as follows:
  Chief Executive: 400% of salary
  Group Finance Director: 250% of salary 
Performance will be measured over a three year period and will be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee. Performance measures remained unchanged from the previous year and will be as follows:
50% of the award is based on absolute TSR measured over the performance period, and vests:
  0% vesting below 10% pa TSR;
  20% vesting at 10% pa TSR;
  Straight-line vesting between 10% and 18% pa TSR; and
  100% vesting at 18% pa TSR.
50% of the award is based on relative TSR measured against the FTSE 350 Index* over the performance 
period, and vests:
  0% for below median performance against the index;
  25% for median performance against the index;
  100% for upper quartile performance against the index; and
  Straight-line vesting between median and upper quartile performance. 
*Awards under the FY2015 plan were measured against the FTSE 250 Index. After a review, the
Committee has decided that the FTSE 350 Index is a more appropriate index to measure the Company’s 
relative TSR, as this Index reflects both the variety of the Company’s portfolio of international 
investments as well as the diverse currencies in which those investments are denominated.
Under the Company’s malus and clawback policy, any long-term incentive award may be forfeited or 
reduced prior to vesting in exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers fair, 
reasonable and proportionate. This would include material misstatement of Group financial statements, 
or cases where an individual is deemed to have caused a material loss for the Group as a result of 
reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values or behaviour.
Shareholding requirements No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016. Shareholding requirements will 
therefore remain as follows:
  Chief Executive: 300% of salary
  Group Finance Director: 150% of salary 
Non-executive Director fees No changes to the current arrangements are proposed for FY2016. Fees for the non-executive Directors 
will therefore remain as follows:
Chairman fee:  £265,000 plus £30,000 in 3i shares
Non-executive Directors:
Board membership fee: £50,000 plus 3,000 3i shares.
Deputy Chairman (including SID fee) £40,000
Senior Independent Director fee: £10,000
Committee Chairman:  £20,000
Committee member: £8,000
Committee fees are payable in respect of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Valuations Committee.

89 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORTING ENTITY
3i Group plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The Consolidated financial statements 
(“the Group accounts”) for the year to 31 March 2015 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
(collectively, “the Group”). 
The Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with Section 395 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its Company Statement of comprehensive income and related Notes. 
A number of key accounting policies are disclosed below, but where possible, accounting policies have been shown as part of the Note that they 
specifically relate to in order to assist the reader’s understanding. 
A COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (“IFRS”)
The Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with all relevant IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, endorsed by the European Union (“EU”). 
In the year the Group adopted the following amendment:
IFRS 10 (Revised) – Consolidated Financial Statements
The IASB issued a narrow scope amendment to IFRS 10 in December 2014, and subsequently the Group has revisited and is now consolidating 
two Debt Management entities and a small number of subsidiaries rather than fair valuing them in the IFRS financial statements. This is due to 
additional guidance in the narrow scope amendment clarifying the treatment of entities which invest for capital appreciation but also provide 
investment related services. The Group has chosen to adopt the changes provided in the narrow scope amendment early, and has applied the 
change retrospectively. The change has no effect on total return or net asset value as reported in the Group’s prior year IFRS financial statements. 
Comparative information has been restated and the effect is shown in Note 31. 
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued with implementation dates, subject to EU endorsement in some 
cases, which do not impact on these financial statements:
Effective for annual periods beginning on or after
IFRS Annual improvements 2010 to 201 2 and 201 1 to 2013 1 July 2014
IFRS Annual improvements 201 2 to 2014 1 July 2016
IFRS 1 5 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 201 7
IFRS 9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018
The impact of future standards and amendments on the financial statements is being assessed by the Group and the Company.
B BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as disclosed in the Directors’ Report.
C BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control, as defined by IFRS 10, is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
3i Group plc is an investment entity and, as such, does not consolidate the investment entities it controls. Most of the Group’s interests in 
subsidiaries are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Those subsidiaries which provide investment related services, such as advisory, 
management or employment services are not classified at fair value through profit and loss and continue to be consolidated unless they are 
deemed investment entities, in which case they are fair valued. 
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Under the acquisition method of accounting, with 
some limited exceptions, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Any non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net assets acquired. Acquisition 
related costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred, unless directly related to the issue of debt or equity securities. Any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over net assets is capitalised as goodwill. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments 
that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value even though the Group may 
have significant influence over those companies. 
(iii) Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
Significant accounting policies
3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 90 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(iv) Composition of the Group
The Group is made up of several different types of subsidiaries. The Group re-assesses the function performed by each type of subsidiary to 
determine its treatment under the IFRS 10 exception from consolidation. The types of subsidiaries and their treatment under IFRS 10 are 
as follows:
General Partners (GPs) – Consolidated
  General Partners provide investment management services and do not hold any direct investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not 
investment entities. 
Investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
  These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice. They do not hold any direct 
investments in portfolio assets. These entities are not investment entities. 
Investment managers/advisers which also hold investments – Consolidated
  These entities provide investment related services through the provision of investment management or advice and also hold investments in 
managed assets, typically due to regulatory reasons or investor expectations. The primary purpose of these entities is to provide investment 
related services and therefore they are not classified as investment entities. 
Holding companies of investment managers/advisers – Consolidated
  These entities provide investment related services through their subsidiaries. They do not hold any direct investment in portfolio assets and 
these entities are not investment entities. 
Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures – Fair valued 
  The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through its ultimate parent company as well as through other limited partnership and 
corporate subsidiaries which the Group has created to align the interests of the investment teams with the performance of the assets through 
the use of various carried interest schemes. The purpose of these limited partnerships and corporate holding vehicles, many of which also 
provide investment related services, is to invest for investment income and capital appreciation. These partnerships meet the definition of an 
investment entity and are classified at fair value through the profit and loss.
Portfolio investments – Fair valued
  Following the introduction of IFRS 10, the test for accounting subsidiaries has been altered to take wider factors of control as well as actual 
equity ownership into account. This has resulted in 30 investments being classified as accounting subsidiaries. In accordance with the 
investment entity exception, these entities have been held at fair value with movements in fair value going through the Statement of 
comprehensive income. With one exception (Palace Street I) none of these subsidiaries is a UK Companies Act subsidiary.
Structured entities – Fair valued
  The Group has interests in a number of unconsolidated structured entities, their current carrying value and a description of their activities is 
included in Note 29. 
D CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial 
statements. UK company law and IFRS require the Directors, in preparing the Group’s financial statements, to select suitable accounting policies, 
apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. The Group’s estimates and assumptions are 
based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically. The actual outcome may be materially different 
from that anticipated. 
The judgements and assumptions involved in the Group’s accounting policies that are considered by the Board to be the most important to the 
portrayal of its financial condition are the fair valuation of the investment portfolio and the fair valuation of each investment entity subsidiary. The 
investment portfolio is held at fair value and further detail on the valuation methodology is disclosed in Note 10. Given the importance of this area, 
the Board has a separate Valuations Committee to review the valuations policies, process and application to individual investments. A report on 
the activities of the Valuations Committee is included in the Governance section of the Annual report.
Further detail on the assessment as an investment entity is as follows:
(a) Assessment as an investment entity
Entities that meet the definition of an investment entity within IFRS 10 are required to account for most investments in controlled entities, as well 
as investments in associates and joint ventures, at fair value through profit and loss. 
The Board has concluded that the Company continues to meet the definition of an investment entity as its strategic objective of investing in 
portfolio investments and providing investment management services to investors for the purpose of generating returns in the form of 
investment income and capital appreciation remains unchanged. 
The Group is required to determine the degree of control or influence the Group exercises and the form of any control to ensure that the financial 
treatment is accurate. Following the IASB’s narrow scope amendment to IFRS 10, issued in December 2014, the Company revisited its assessment of 
all of its subsidiaries and has consolidated two Debt Management entities and reclassified a small number of subsidiaries. Comparative information 
has been restated to reflect the adoption of the amendment to IFRS 10 and the impact is shown in Note 31. Further detail on our detailed review of our 
application of IFRS 10, including the amendment, can be found at the end of the Financial Review section on pages 33 to 37 . 
91 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(b) Valuation of the defined benefit scheme
The Group also considers the valuation of the IAS 19 defined benefit scheme to be a significant estimate. The Group reviews its assumptions 
annually with its independent actuaries. Further detail on the scheme and the assumptions applied can be found in Note 26 of the financial 
statements. 
E OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
A) Revenue Recognition
Gross investment return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment 
portfolio net of deal-related costs and includes foreign exchange movements in respect of the investment portfolio. Investment income is 
analysed into the following components:
i. Realised profits or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received 
less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start of the 
accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
ii. Unrealised profits or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and 
end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
iii. Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries are the movement in the carrying value of Group subsidiaries which are classified as 
investment entities under IFRS 10. The Group makes investments in portfolio assets through these entities which are usually limited 
partnerships or corporate subsidiaries. 
iv. Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must be 
met before the income is recognised:
  Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders’ rights to receive 
payment have been established. Income received on the investment in the most junior ranked level of CLO capital is recognised as a 
dividend. £16 million was received in the year (2014: £10 million).
  Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the 
asset’s carrying value. When the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal value of a loan the Group recognises a 
provision against any interest accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the investment is assessed to have recovered  
in value. Income received on the instruments in the most junior level of CLO capital is recognised as a dividend. £16 million was received in 
the year (2014: £10 million).
  Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment. Fees that 
are earned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are 
recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are 
recognised as that service is provided.
v. Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in currencies that are different from the functional currency of the Group 
entity. Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each subsequent reporting date investments 
are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
B) Foreign currency translation
For the Company and those subsidiaries whose balance sheets are denominated in sterling which is the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange at the 
balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange over the year and exchange 
differences arising are taken to the income statement.
The balance sheets of subsidiaries and associates denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates. 
The Statements of comprehensive income for these subsidiaries and associates are translated at the average rates and exchange differences 
arising are taken to other comprehensive income. Such exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement in the period in which 
the subsidiary or associate is disposed of.
C) Treasury assets and liabilities 
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and minimise the overall costs  
of borrowing. 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits. Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet 
when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition occurs when rights to cash flows 
from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.

1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Operating segments are the components of the entity whose results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. 
The Chief Executive, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, manages the Group on two bases. Firstly, as business divisions 
determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, investment funding model and the Group’s management hierarchy. Secondly, in line 
with the strategy of the Group, he considers separate Proprietary Capital and Fund Management businesses focused on investment returns and 
Fund Management profits respectively. A description of the activities, including products and services offered by these divisions and the allocation 
of resources, is given in the Strategic report.
The segmental information that follows is presented on the Investment basis which is the basis used by the Chief Executive to monitor the 
performance of the Group. The remaining Notes are prepared on the IFRS basis.

7 INCOME TAXES
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. Tax is charged or credited in the 
Statement of comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt 
with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. This may differ from the profit included in the Statement of comprehensive 
income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax 
expected to apply when these differences crystallise. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set off. All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax 
assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 “Income taxes”.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

RECONCILIATION OF INCOME TAXES IN THE STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

explained below:

The Group’s realised profits, fair value adjustments and impairment losses are primarily included in the Company, the affairs of which are 
directed so as to allow it to be approved as an investment trust. An investment trust is exempt from tax on capital gains, therefore the Group’s 
capital return is substantially non-taxable.
Including £2 million of tax charges incurred in fair valued entities, the total tax charge for the Group was £4 million under the Investment basis 
presentation.

At 31 March 2015, the Group had carried forward tax losses of £1,409 million (2014: £1,360 million), capital losses of £98 million (2014: £78 million) 
and other temporary differences of £12 million (2014: £12 million). It is uncertain that the Group will generate sufficient taxable profits in the 
foreseeable future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses. Deferred income 
taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 20% (2014: 20%).

10 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
Investments are recognised and de-recognised on the date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms 
require the delivery or settlement of the investment and the risks and rewards attached to it. The Group manages its investments with a view to 
profiting from the receipt of investment income and capital appreciation from changes in the fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is 
measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted investments, including both equity and loans are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the 
balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines (IPEV), details 
of which are available in “Portfolio valuation – an explanation” on pages 136 and 137 .
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair 
value on a different basis, in accordance with 3i Group’s valuation policies. 
Interest bearing loans accrue interest which is either settled in cash or capitalised on a regular basis and included as part of the principal loan 
balance. The capitalisation of accrued interest is treated as part of investment additions during the year. If the fair value of an investment is 
assessed to be below the principal value of the loan the Group recognises a fair value reduction against any interest income accrued from the 
date of the assessment going forward. “Capitalisation at nil value” is the term used to describe the capitalisation of accrued interest which has 
been fully provided for. These transactions are disclosed as additions to portfolio cost with an equal reduction in portfolio value.
As a result of IFRS 10, and the exception from consolidation, the proportion of the investment portfolio held by the Group’s unconsolidated 
subsidiaries is now presented as part of the fair value of investment entity subsidiaries, along with the fair value of their other assets and 
liabilities. A reconciliation of the fair value of Investments in investment entities is included in Note 1 1.

The holding period of 3i’s investment portfolio is on average greater than one year. For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current. It is 
not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions include £69 million (2014: £98 million) in interest received by way of loan notes, of which £48 million (2014: £60 million) has been valued 
to nil. Included within the Statement of comprehensive income is £38 million (2014: £29 million) of interest income, which reflects the net additions 
after write downs noted above, £14 million (2014: £6 million) of cash income and the capitalisation of prior year accrued income and non-
capitalised accrued income is £3 million (2014: £(15) million).
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, including £18 million which relates to net cash 
returned (2014: £21 million net cash invested) from Debt Management warehouses.

11 INVESTMENTS IN INVESTMENT ENTITIES
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
Investments in investment entity subsidiaries are accounted for as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
These entities are typically Limited Partnerships and other intermediate investment holding structures which hold the Group’s interests in 
investments in portfolio companies (Investment Entity Holding Companies) and were consolidated prior to the adoption of IFRS 10. The fair value 
can increase or reduce from either cash flows to/from the investment entities or valuation movements in line with the Group’s valuation policy. 
The fair value of these entities is their net asset values subject to any adjustments where necessary.

All investment entities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, see Note 12 for details.
A 5% movement in the closing book value of investments in investment entities would have an impact of £104 million (2014: £95 million). 
RESTRICTIONS
3i Group plc, the ultimate parent company, receives dividend income from its subsidiaries. There are no significant restrictions on the ability to 
transfer funds from these subsidiaries to the Group. 
SUPPORT
3i Group plc provides ongoing support to its investment entity subsidiaries for the purchase of portfolio investments. During the year, the Group 
provided support to its unconsolidated subsidiaries, with a net cash flow as noted in the table above. The Group’s current commitments to its 
subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 24.

12 FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
Financial instruments, other than those held at amortised cost, are held at fair value and are designated irrevocably at inception. In particular, 3i 
designates groups of financial instruments as being at fair value when they are managed, and their performance evaluated, on a fair value basis 
in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, and where information about the groups of financial instruments is 
reported to management on that basis.

12 FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED
3i enters into warehouse arrangements to support the creation of debt portfolios ahead of future CLO launches and has designated these financial 
instruments at fair value. At 31 March 2015, 3i has invested £43 million (2014: £17 million) to these warehouses and the balance is included within 
the Group’s unquoted investments. Of this balance, £15 million has been invested to secured debt portfolios and £28 million is held by the 
warehouse provider either awaiting settlement or held as cash pending a return to 3i. For the Company, £28 million is included within the 
unquoted investments. 
Details of the commitments and contingent liabilities in relation to these warehouses can be found in Notes 24 and 25.
(B) VALUATION
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values with the exception of loans and 
borrowings. The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £997 million (2014: £942 million), determined with reference to their published market 
prices. The carrying value of the loans and borrowings is £815 million (2014: £849 million).
Valuation hierarchy
The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy:
Level Fair value input description Financial instruments
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) from active markets Quoted equity instruments
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable 
either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices)
Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments and loan instruments
Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital 
valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement. Further information regarding the 
valuation of unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments can be found in the section “Portfolio valuation – an explanation” on page 136.
The tables below show the classification of financial instruments held at fair value into the valuation hierarchy at 31 March 2015:

At the Company level, the disclosures remain the same, with the exception of unquoted investments. Unquoted investments in the Company 
of £1,163 million (2014: £1,283 million) are valued at Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
This disclosure only refers to the directly held investment portfolio. The fair value hierarchy also applies to Investments in investment entities, 
see Note 1 1 for details.
Investments in investment entities are fair valued at the entity’s net asset value with the significant part being attributable to the underlying 
portfolio. The underlying portfolio is valued under the same methodology as directly held investments with any other assets or liabilities within 
investment entities fair valued in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.

Unquoted investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the Statement of comprehensive income; realised profits over 
value on disposal of investment of £19 million (2014: £144 million), dividend income of £23 million (2014: £12 million) and foreign exchange losses 
of £52 million (2014: £48 million losses). The transfer of investment from Level 3 to Level 1 reflects the IPOs of Eltel and Refresco in the year. 
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation section.  
On an IFRS basis, of assets held at 31 March 2015, classified as Level 3, 44% (2014: 43%) were valued using a multiple of earnings and the 
remaining 56% (2014: 57%) were valued using alternative valuation methodologies. 
Valuation multiple – The valuation multiple is the main assumption applied to a multiple of earnings based valuation. The multiple is derived from 
comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples. Companies in the same industry and geography and, where possible, with 
a similar business model and profile are selected and then adjusted for factors including liquidity risk, growth potential and relative performance. 
The value weighted average multiple used when valuing the portfolio was 9.68x (2014: 9.08x). 
If the multiple used to value each unquoted investment valued on an earnings multiple basis as at 31 March 2015 decreased by 5%, the investment 
portfolio would decrease by £35 million (2014: £57 million) or 2% (2014: 4%). If the same sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by 
investment entities, this would have a negative impact of £121 million (2014: £101 million) or 5% (2014: 5%). 
If the multiple increased by 5% then the investment portfolio would increase by £33 million (2014: £57 million) or 2% (2014: 4%). If the same 
sensitivity was applied to the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have a positive impact of £122 million (2014: £103 million) 
or 6% (2014: 5%).
Alternative valuation methodologies – There are a number of alternative investment valuation methodologies used by the Group, for reasons 
specific to individual assets. The details of such valuation methodologies, and the inputs that are used, are given in the Portfolio valuation – an 
explanation section. Each methodology is used for a proportion of assets, by value and at year end the following techniques were used: 21% DCF , 
7% Imminent sale, 10% Industry metric, 13% broker quotes and 5% other. If the value of all of the investments under this methodology moved by 
5%, this would have an impact on the investment portfolio of £35 million (2014: £29 million) or 2% (2014: 2%). If the same sensitivity was applied to 
the underlying portfolio held by investment entities, this would have an impact of £6 million (2014: £7 million) or 0.3% (2014: 0.4%).

13 CARRIED INTEREST AND PERFORMANCE FEES
ACCOUNTING POLICY:
Carried interest and performance fees receivable
The Group earns a share of profits (“carried interest and performance fees receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties. 
These profits are earned when the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest and performance fees receivable include amounts receivable from Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management funds. 
Each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual for carried interest receivable is made once the performance 
conditions would be achieved if the remaining assets in that fund were realised at fair value. Fair value is determined using the Group’s valuation 
methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date. An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of profits in excess of the performance 
conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
The performance fee receivable from 3iN is based on 3iN’s most recently published NAV subject to a performance hurdle and a high 
water mark. 
Carried interest and performance fees payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments. “Carried interest and 
performance fees payable” is the term used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions. 
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest schemes. Carried 
interest payable is accrued if its performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in that 
scheme were realised at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place 
in the carried interest scheme, discounted to reflect the likely actual cash payment date, which may be materially later than the time of 
the accrual.
The Infrastructure performance fee is accrued when we become contractually liable to make payments to the team. 
Under IFRS 10, where carry payable reduces the fair value of an investment entity subsidiary, that movement is recorded through “Fair value 
movements on investment entity subsidiaries”. At 31 March 2015, an additional £142 million of carry payable was recognised in the Statement  
of financial position of these investment entity subsidiaries (2014: £81 million).

14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
ACCOUNTING POLICY:
Fund management contracts, such as those acquired by the Group in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary, are stated at their fair value 
at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the Statement of comprehensive income, included in operating expenses, on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of the fund management contract, typically five to 10 years.
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of subsidiaries when the cost of acquisition exceeds the net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at cost 
less any accumulated impairment, and is assessed annually for impairment.

ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses. They are reviewed  
at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows. Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the 
Statement of comprehensive income.

16 LOANS AND BORROWINGS
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. After initial recognition, these are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through 
the expected life of the liabilities. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.

facility, which may be granted at the discretion of each lender individually. The new £350 million facility has no financial covenants. 
The £50 million multi-currency facility was cancelled during the period.
All of the Group’s borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates. None of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group. 
The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £997 million (2014: £942 million), determined with reference to their published market prices. 
The loans and borrowings are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as detailed in Note 12.
Under AIFMD, the Group is required to calculate leverage in accordance with a set formula and disclose this to investors. In line with AIFMD, 
leverage is 1 17% (2014: 127%) under the gross method and 120% (2014: 133%) under the commitment method. More detail on the Group’s capital 
structure is included in Note 21.

17 PROVISIONS
ACCOUNTING POLICY:
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. The provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect is 
material. Changes in provisions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income for the period.

next year.
The Group has a number of leasehold properties whose rent and unavoidable costs exceed the economic benefits expected to be received. These 
costs arise over the period of the lease, and have been provided for to the extent they are not covered by income from subleases. The leases 
covered by the provision have a remaining term of up to 10 years.

25 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
ACCOUNTING POLICY:
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty, which could include a dependency on events not within 
the Group’s control, but where there is a possible obligation. Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included within the Statement 
of financial position.

The contingent liability at 31 March 2015 related to an investee company that has been sold post year end. The contingent liability was eliminated 
on the date of disposal.
OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has provided a guarantee to the Trustees of the 3i Group Pension Plan in respect of liabilities of 3i plc to the Plan. 3i plc is the 
sponsor of the 3i Group Pension Plan. On 4 April 2012, the Company transferred eligible assets (£150 million of ordinary shares in 3i Infrastructure 
plc as defined by the agreement) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The Company will retain all income and capital rights in relation to 
the 3i Infrastructure plc shares, as eligible assets, unless the Company becomes insolvent or fails to comply with material obligations in relation 
to the agreement with the Trustees, all of which are under its control. The fair value of eligible assets at 31 March 2015 was £193 million (2014: 
£162 million).
3i has entered into warehouse arrangements in Europe to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios ahead of future CLO fund 
launches. Whilst in the warehouse phase, 3i is subject to optional margin calls in the event of market falls. The current capital at risk is restricted 
to £15 million at 31 March 2015 (2014: £17 million) and further detail can be found in Note 29. 
At 31 March 2015, there was no material litigation outstanding against the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
ACCOUNTING POLICY:
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the Statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset, calculated using the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation, is recognised in the income statement. Re-measurement gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise in other 
comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the 
fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
(i) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group. The assets of these 
plans are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in France are members of a state managed 
retirement benefit plan operated by the country’s government. 3i Europe plc’s French branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund these benefits.
The total expense recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is £3 million (2014: £3 million), which represents the contributions 
payable to these plans. There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
113 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK (“the Plan”). The Plan is approved by 
HMRC for tax purposes and is operated separately from the Group and managed by an independent set of Trustees, whose appointment is 
determined by the Plan’s documentation. The Plan is subject to UK funding regulations, which require the Group and the Trustees to agree a 
funding strategy and contribution schedule where necessary.
Membership of the Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits 
by members with effect from 5 April 201 1, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals. Members of the Plan have been 
invited to join the Group’s defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 201 1. The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which 
are independent of the Company’s finances and are administered by the Trustees. The Trustees are responsible for managing and investing the 
Plan’s assets and for monitoring the Plan’s funding position. As the Plan is now closed to future accrual, measures have been taken to de-risk the 
Plan through changes to its investment policy. 
The valuation of the Plan has been updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2015.
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 3i Deutschland GmbH and the German and Spanish 
branches of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for their employees and have agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an 
employee’s investment policy should it arise. The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is £1 million 
(2014: £1 million) and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is £20 million (2014: £15 million). The amounts recognised 
in the income statement for the year and other comprehensive income for these schemes are a £1 million expense (2014: £1 million expense) 
and a £7 million expense (2014: £1 million gain) respectively.

Expected rate of salary increases 5.6% 5.9%
Expected rate of pension increases 3.2% 3.5%
Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation 3.1% 3.4%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation 2.1% 2.4%
In addition, it is assumed that members exchange 25% of pension for lump sum at retirement on the conversion terms in place at 31 March 2015 
with an allowance for the terms to increase in future. The duration of the Plan’s defined benefit obligation at the accounting date was around 
21 years. 
115 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
26 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2015 is 80% of the S1NA Light tables allowing for 
improvements from 2003 in line with the CMI 2012 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% (unchanged from 
31 March 2014). The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2035 (2014: 2034) is projected to be 33.4 (2014: 33.3) years compared  
to 31.1 (2014: 31.0) years for someone reaching 60 in 2015.
The sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:
Impact on defined benefit obligation
Change in assumption 2015 2014
Discount rate Decrease by 0. 1 % Increase by £1 2 million Increase by £9 million
Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation Increase by 0. 1 % Increase by £1 1 million Increase by £8 million
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by £16 million Increase by £1 1 million
The above sensitivity analysis is based on changing one assumption whilst all others remain constant. In practice this is unlikely to occur and 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
Through its defined benefit plan the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility A fall in the value of the Plan’s assets may reduce the value of the defined benefit surplus and could affect the future funding requirements.  
To reduce the volatility of the Plan’s assets, the Trustees have implemented an investment strategy that reduces the Plan’s equity holdings 
by switching them to bonds over time. The Plan’s assets are also diversified across different asset classes.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the Plan’s IAS 19 defined benefit obligation. However, the Plan holds a proportion of its 
assets in corporate bonds and so any increase in the defined benefit obligation would be partially offset by an increase in the value of the 
Plan’s assets.
Inflation risk The Plan’s defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the Plan’s 
assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation could reduce or eliminate the 
defined benefit surplus.
Life expectancy The Plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the Plan’s 
defined benefit obligation.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 201 1, the Group ceased to make regular contributions to 
the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2013 was completed in March 2014. The results of that valuation showed that the plan had 
an actuarial surplus of £1 million at 30 June 2013 and as a result the Group was not required to make contributions to the Plan in respect of that 
valuation. The contingent asset arrangement entered into during FY2013, details of which are provided in Note 25, remains in place. It is expected 
that the next triennial actuarial funding valuation exercise will be based on the financial position of the Plan as at 30 June 2016.

27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
ACCOUNTING POLICY: 
The Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions with certain employees. Equity-settled schemes are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant, which is then recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the period that employees 
provide services, generally the period between the start of performance period and the vesting date of the shares. The number of shares 
expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and services conditions included in the terms of the award will be met. 
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model which takes into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the 
risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and any other relevant factors. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is 
adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period. The movement in 
cumulative charges since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry 
in equity.
Liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payment transactions are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income over the 
vesting period. They are fair valued at each reporting date. The cost of cash-settled share-based payment transactions are adjusted for the 
forfeitures of the participants’ rights that no longer meet the plan requirements as well as for early vesting.
Share-based payments are in certain circumstances made in lieu of annual cash bonuses or carried interest payments. The cost of the share-
based payments is allocated either to operating expenses (bonuses) or carried interest depending on the original driver of the award. Executive 
Director Long Term Incentives are allocated to operating expenses.
The total cost recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income is shown below:

27 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
The features of the Group’s share schemes for Executive Directors are described in the Report of the Board on Directors’ remuneration on pages 
72 to 81. To ensure that employees’ interests are aligned with shareholders, a significant amount of variable compensation paid to higher earning 
employees is deferred into shares that vest over a number of years. For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may  
be granted “phantom awards” under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the 
participant to acquire shares. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2015 is £5 million 
(2014: £4 million). 
For the share-based awards granted during the year, the weighted average fair value of those options at 31 March 2015 was 323 pence 
(2014: 345 pence). 
The main assumptions for the valuation of certain share-based awards with market conditions attached comprised:

Expected volatility was determined from the historical three year volatility at the date of grant, commensurate with the performance period. 
MOVEMENTS IN SHARE AWARDS
Share-based awards have no exercise prices outstanding and the number of awards are as follows:
2015 
Number
2014

Outstanding at the start of the year 17,454,763 13,773,834

Weighted average remaining contractual life of awards outstanding in years 4.45 4.74
Exercisable at the end of the year 186,481 50,354
The weighted average market price at the date of exercise was 426 pence (2014: 369 pence)
HOLDINGS OF 3I GROUP PLC SHARES
The Group has established an employee benefit trust and the total number of 3i Group plc shares held in this trust at 31 March 2015 was 
24 million (2014: 27 million). Dividend rights have been waived on these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the 
year end share price of £4.82 (2014: £3.98) was £1 15 million (2014: £107 million).

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
INTRODUCTION
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section. This Note provides 
further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific 
financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to an individual risk assessment through an investment approval process. 
The Group’s Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section. The risk management 
processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group and both the Group and the Company share the same financial risks. 
FINANCIAL RISKS
Concentration risk
3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion of investments by geography, economic sector, asset class and size as well as through the 
maturity profile of its investment portfolio. Although 3i does not set maximum limits for asset allocation, it does have a maximum exposure limit. 
This is detailed in the Investment policy on page 53 of the Directors’ Report. Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio 
across geographies can be found in the Segmental analysis in Note 1 and in the 25 large investments table on pages 93 and 134.
Credit risk
The Group is subject to credit risk on its unquoted investments, derivatives, cash and deposits. The Group’s cash and deposits are held with 
a variety of counterparties with 6 1% of the Group’s surplus cash held on demand in AAA rated banks and 23% held in short-term reverse 
repurchase agreements with banks rated A or higher using Gilts as collateral. The balance is held on short-term deposit with banks with a credit 
rating of A or higher. The credit quality of unquoted investments, which are held at fair value and include debt and equity elements, is based on 
the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies. The credit risk relating to these assets is based on their enterprise value and 
is reflected through fair value movements. The credit quality of the assets is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio 
companies. Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Group’s policy is to record a provision for the 
full amount of the loan. Further detail can be found in the Price risk – market fluctuations disclosure in this Note and the sensitivity disclosure to 
changes in the valuation assumptions is provided in the valuation section of Note 12. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity outlook is monitored weekly by management and regularly by the Board in the context of periodic strategic reviews of the balance sheet. 
The new investment pipeline and forecast realisations are closely monitored and assessed against our vintage control policy. These are noted in 
the risk mitigation section on page 43 of the Risk section. The table below analyses the maturity of the Group’s gross contractual liabilities.

5 years is nil (2014: £8 million) and trade and other payables within one year is £327 million (2014: £292 million).
Market risk
The valuation of the Group’s investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the 
portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market 
fluctuations. The Group’s sensitivity to these items is set out below.
(i) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk has primarily been managed through a reduction in gross debt. The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively 
small as the Group’s outstanding debt is fixed rate. The sensitivities below arise principally from changes in interest receivable on cash  
and deposit. 
An increase of 100 basis points, based on the closing balance sheet position over a 12 month period, would lead to an approximate increase  
in total comprehensive income of £9 million (2014: £8 million increase) for the Group and £8 million income (2014: £6 million) for the Company.  
In addition, the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance and valuation of 
portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.

(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real and all other currencies combined is 
shown in the table below. This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group’s net assets to movements in foreign 
currency exchange rates assuming a 10% movement in exchange rates against sterling. The sensitivity of the Company to foreign exchange  
risk is not materially different from the Group.
The Group considers currency risk on specific investment and realisation transactions and has reduced hedging on a consolidated basis over 
time. Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided on page 26 in the Financial review section.

The Group has various related parties stemming from relationships with limited partnerships managed by the Group, its investment portfolio 
(including unconsolidated subsidiaries), its advisory arrangements and its key management personnel. In addition, the Company has related 
parties in respect of its subsidiaries. Some of these subsidiaries are held at fair value (unconsolidated subsidiaries) due to the treatment 
prescribed in IFRS 10. 
RELATED PARTIES

UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
The application of IFRS 12 requires additional disclosure on the Group’s exposure to unconsolidated structured entities. 
The Group has exposure to a number of unconsolidated structured entities as a result of its investment activities across its Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines. These structured entities fall into four categories, namely CLO’s, debt management 
warehouses, closed end limited partnerships (Private Equity and Infrastructure funds) and investments in certain portfolio investments. 
The nature, purpose and activities of these entities are detailed below along with the nature of risks associated with these entities and the 
maximum exposure to loss. 
123 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CLO structured entities
The Group manages CLO vehicles as part of its Debt Management business. These funds predominantly invest in senior secured loans and are 
financed by investors seeking credit rated, structured, investment returns. 
The Group manages these funds, in return for a management fee. The Group also typically invests into the equity tranche of these funds.  
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and performance  
fees are accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met. 
The risk and maximum exposure to loss arising from the Group’s involvement with these entities are summarised below:

At 31 March 2015, the total CLO assets under management were £6.5 billion (2014: £5.8 billion). The Group earned dividend income of £16 million 
(2014: £8 million) and fee income of £30 million (2014: £7 million) during the year from CLO structured entities.
Warehouse structured entities
Ahead of future CLO fund launches, warehouse facilities are usually established to support the creation of senior secured debt portfolios.  
These entities are financed by the Group along with the bank appointed to operate the warehouse facility. The Group makes a commitment  
to the warehouse, typically taking the first loss position and is at risk for margin calls if the portfolio underperforms. The Group’s attributable  
stakes in these warehouses are held at fair value.

of £6 million (2014: £2 million) during the year from warehouse structured entities. 
Closed end limited partnerships
The Group manages a number of closed end limited partnerships, which are primarily Private Equity or Infrastructure focused, in return for  
a management fee. The purpose of these partnerships is to invest in Private Equity or Infrastructure investments for capital appreciation.  
Limited Partners, which in some cases may include the Group, finance these entities by committing capital to them and cash is drawn down  
or distributed for financing investment activity. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value, fees receivable are recognised on an accruals basis and carried interest is 
accrued when relevant performance hurdles are met.

Investments that are structured entities
The Group makes investments on behalf of itself and third party funds that it manages, for capital appreciation purposes. In a small number of 
cases, these investments fall under the classification of a structured entity as they are funds managed by the General Partner under a limited 
partnership agreement. 
The Group’s attributable stakes in these entities are held at fair value.

REGULATORY INFORMATION RELATING TO FEES:
Under AIFMD, 3i Investments plc acts as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) to 3i Group plc. In performing the activities and 
functions of the AIFM, the AIFM or another 3i company may pay or receive fees, commissions or non-monetary benefits to or from third parties 
of the following nature:
  Transaction fees: 3i companies receive monitoring and directors’ fees from portfolio companies. The amount is agreed with the portfolio 
company at the time of the investment but may be re-negotiated. Where applicable, 3i may also receive fees on the completion of 
transactions such as acquisitions, re-financing or syndication either from the portfolio company or a co-investor. Transaction fees paid to 3i 
are included in portfolio income.
  Payments for third party services: 3i companies may retain the services of third party consultants; for example for an independent director 
or other investment management specialist expertise. The amount paid varies in accordance with the nature of the service and the length of 
the service period and is usually, but not always, paid/reimbursed by the portfolio companies. The payment may involve a flat fee, retainer or 
success fee. Such payments, where borne by 3i companies, are usually included in portfolio income. 
  Payments for services from 3i companies: One 3i company may provide investment advisory services to another 3i company and receive 
payment for such service.

30 PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES
The table below comprises the principal subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2015 all of which were wholly-owned, with the exception of  
3i Debt Management Limited, which is 75.4% owned and is in turn the 100% owner of 3i Debt Management Investments Limited, and 3i Debt 
Management US LLC which is 80% owned. The Group has entered into agreements to purchase the remaining 24.6% of the equity of 3i Debt 
Management Limited and 20% of 3i Debt Management US LLC, currently owned by management, over the next two years. They are incorporated 
in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales unless otherwise stated.
The introduction of IFRS 10 has resulted in a reassessment of the accounting subsidiaries of the Group. IFRS 10 has reduced the requirements for 
an entity to be classified as an accounting subsidiary and deems wider control issues, as opposed to equity ownership, as the key determinant 
when identifying accounting subsidiaries. Under IFRS 10, if the Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed an 
accounting subsidiary. This is inconsistent with the UK Companies Act where voting rights are the key determinant when identifying accounting 
subsidiaries, with a larger than 50% holding of voting rights resulting in an entity being classified as a subsidiary. The accounting treatment of 
each subsidiary is noted in the table below.
As at 31 March 2015, the entire issued share capital of 3i Holdings plc and 75.4% of the issued share capital of 3i Debt Management Limited was 
held by the Company. The entire issued share capital of all the other principal subsidiary undertakings listed in the table below and 80% of 3i Debt 
Management US LLC was held by subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
In addition, under the application of IFRS 10, 30 of the portfolio investments are considered to be accounting subsidiaries. As per the investment 
entity exception under IFRS 10, these are all held at fair value with movements shown in the Statement of comprehensive income. The largest 25 
portfolio companies by fair value are detailed on pages 134 and 135. The combination of the table below and that on pages 134 and 135 are 
deemed by the Directors to fulfil the IFRS 12 disclosure of material subsidiaries. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the number of undertakings in respect of which the Company is required to disclose information under 
Schedule 4 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group’s (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 is such that compliance would 
result in information of excessive length being given. The full disclosure will be annexed to the Company’s next annual return.

Opinion on Financial statements
In our opinion:
  the Financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
  the Group Financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs); 
  the parent Company Financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  the Financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
Financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the Financial statements of 3i Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2015 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of 
comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of changes in equity, the Consolidated and parent Company 
Statements of financial position, the Consolidated and Parent Company cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRS and, as regards the parent company Financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on pages 55 and 56, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
Financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the Financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the Financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited Financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement and our response to these risks
The risks included in the table below represent those material risks of misstatement that have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy and 
approach for the year ended 31 March 2015 (including the allocation of resources and the directing of efforts of the engagement team). The table 
also includes our audit response to each of these risks:
Risk identified Our response
Group and parent Company
Valuation of unquoted proprietary investments and 
resulting impact on the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income
Please refer to page 67 , Audit and Compliance 
Committee report and notes 10 and 1 1 to the 
audited Financial statements.
The proprietary investment portfolio comprises a 
large number of unquoted securities. The valuation 
policy followed by the Group is based on the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital 
Valuation (IPEV) guidelines. Owing to the illiquid 
nature of these investments the assessment of fair 
valuation necessitates significant and complex 
judgements by management. 
Inappropriate judgements made in the assessment 
of fair value, in particular, in respect of earnings 
multiples, liquidity discounts, discount rates and 
valuation multiple selection could have a significant 
impact on the value of the unquoted investment 
portfolio, and therefore on the return generated for 
the shareholders.
  We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls around the fair valuation of 
unquoted proprietary investments by performing walkthrough procedures, testing relevant controls and by 
reviewing the valuation governance structure and protocols around management’s oversight of the valuation 
of unquoted investments.
  We assessed that management’s valuation policies were in compliance with IFRS and the IPEV guidelines and 
that the valuation approach adopted by management was appropriate.
  With the assistance of our valuation experts, we formed an independent assessment of the valuation of a 
sample of unquoted investments to provide further assurance on the appropriateness of the portfolio 
valuation. Our valuation experts conducted this independent assessment by reference to relevant industry 
and market valuation considerations.
  In respect of the valuation model inputs, on a sample basis, we agreed the earnings and earnings multiples 
to investment company and comparable company results, transaction multiples, management accounts, 
and other information available from relevant external market sources. 
  We re-performed the calculation of the valuation models on a sample basis.
  We identified and discussed with management the rationale for any differences between the exit prices of 
investments realised during the year against the prior year fair value, to further assess the reasonableness of 
the current year valuation models and methodology adopted by management. 
  We confirmed the impact on the Consolidated Statement of comprehensive income of valuation  
movements – realised and unrealised.
Risk identified Our response
Group
Calculation of carried interest and resulting impact on 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income
Please refer to page 66, Audit and Compliance 
Committee report and note 13 to the audited 
financial statements.
The carried interest agreements are complex in 
nature. Carried interest reflects amounts payable to 
investment executives and amounts receivable in 
respect of the 3i managed funds. The valuation of 
carried interest is based on the underlying valuation 
of the investment portfolio. The process of 
calculating carry payable and receivable requires 
the use of manual calculations. 
The complexities inherent in the arrangements and 
the manual nature of the recognition process could 
have a significant impact on the value of carry 
payable and receivable and therefore on the return 
generated for the shareholders.
  We obtained an understanding of management’s processes and controls around the carried interest 
calculations by reviewing the terms and conditions set out in the underlying agreements, performing 
walkthrough procedures, testing relevant controls and reviewing the governance structure and protocols 
around management’s oversight of the carried interest arrangements.
  We performed analytical procedures in respect of carried interest based on our knowledge of investment 
realisations, and the performance of the reference investment portfolio. 
  On a sample basis we re-performed management’s calculation of carried interest; obtained corroborative 
audit evidence for the inputs used in the calculation and checked conformity with the provisions of the 
respective agreements.
In the prior year, the Auditor’s report included the first time adoption of IFRS10 as a risk. As the Group has followed the same approach to IFRS 10 
this year and as there have been limited changes to the standard, IFRS10 has not been included in the risks identified above, in respect of the 
current year.

3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015 130 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our application of materiality 
We applied the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on our 
audit and on the Financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the Financial statements are free from material misstatement 
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the Financial statements, would be changed or influenced.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected and undetected misstatements that we judged would be 
material for the Financial statements as a whole. We determined materiality for the Group to be £38 million (2014: £33 million), which is 1% of net 
asset value. Our evaluation of materiality requires professional judgement and necessarily takes into account qualitative as well as quantitative 
considerations implicit in the definition. We have derived our materiality calculation based on Net assets as we consider this, on balance, to be the 
most important financial metric used by shareholders.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgment was that overall 
performance materiality (that is our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group should be 50% of materiality, 
namely £19 million (2014: £16.7 million). Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total uncorrected and undetected audit 
differences in the Financial statements as a whole do not exceed our materiality of £38 million.
We agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.9 million, (2014: 
£1.6 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluated any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
We used a risk-based approach for determining our audit strategy, ensuring that our audit teams performed consistent procedures and focused 
on addressing the risks that are relevant to the business. This approach focused our audit effort towards higher risk areas, such as significant 
management judgments. 
The investments balance is the most significant part of the balance sheet. Control over the valuation of investments, wherever they are based, 
is exercised directly by 3i’s management in London, and as such is audited by the UK based audit team. In all locations where the Group has 
operations, the UK based audit team audited all items material to the Group Financial statements. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the Financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: 
  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial statements; or 
  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or 
  is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and 
the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
Branches not visited by us; or
  the parent Company Financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, set out on pages 55 and 56, in relation to going concern; and
  the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review.

25 LARGE INVESTMENTS
The 25 investments listed below account for 81% of the portfolio at 31 March 2015 (2014: 75%).
For each of our investments we have assessed whether they classify as accounting subsidiaries under IFRS and/or subsidiaries under 
the UK Companies Act. This assessment forms the basis of our disclosure of accounting subsidiaries in the financial statements. 
The UK Companies Act defines a subsidiary based on voting rights, with a greater than 50% majority of voting rights resulting in an entity being 
classified as a subsidiary. IFRS 10 applies a wider test and, if a Group is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee then it has control, and hence the investee is deemed 
an accounting subsidiary. Accounting subsidiaries under IFRS 10 within the 25 large investments below are noted. None of these investments 
are UK Companies Act subsidiaries. 
In accordance with Section 29 of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (“AIFMD”), 3i Investments plc, as AIFM, encourages 
all controlled portfolio companies to make available to employees and investors an Annual report which meets the disclosure requirements 
of the Directive. These are available either on the portfolio company’s website or through filing with the relevant local authorities.

135 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2015  PORTFOLIO AND OTHER INFORMATION
Portfolio valuation – an explanation
POLICY
The valuation policy is the responsibility of the Board, with additional 
oversight and annual review from the Valuations Committee. Our policy 
is to value 3i’s investment portfolio at fair value and we achieve this by 
valuing investments on an appropriate basis, applying a consistent 
approach across the portfolio. The policy ensures that the portfolio 
valuation is compliant with the fair value guidelines under IFRS and,  
in so doing, is also compliant with the guidelines issued by the 
International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation board (the 
“IPEV guidelines”). The policy covers the Group’s Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management investment valuations. Valuations 
of the investment portfolio of the Group and its subsidiaries are 
performed at each quarter end.
Fair value is the underlying principle and is defined as “the price that 
would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date” (IPEV guidelines, 
December 2012). Fair value is therefore an estimate and, as such, 
determining fair value requires the use of judgement.
The quoted assets in our portfolio are valued at their closing bid price 
at the balance sheet date. The majority of the portfolio, however, is 
represented by unquoted investments. 
PRIVATE EQUITY UNQUOTED VALUATION
To arrive at the fair value of the Group’s unquoted Private Equity 
investments, we first estimate the entire value of the company we have 
invested in – the enterprise value. We then apportion that enterprise 
value between 3i, other shareholders and lenders.
Determining enterprise value
This enterprise value is determined using one of a selection of 
methodologies depending on the nature, facts and circumstances of 
the investment.
Where possible, we use methodologies which draw heavily on 
observable market prices, whether listed equity markets or reported 
merger and acquisition transactions, and trading updates from our 
portfolio.
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active market, the 
Group adjusts the estimated enterprise value by a liquidity discount. 
The liquidity discount is applied to the total enterprise value and we 
apply a higher discount rate for investments where there are material 
restrictions on our ability to sell at a time of our choosing.
The table on page 137 outlines in more detail the range of valuation 
methodologies available to us, as well as the inputs and adjustments 
necessary for each.
Apportioning the enterprise value between 3i, other shareholders 
and lenders
Once we have estimated the enterprise value, the following steps 
are taken:
1. We subtract the value of any claims, net of free cash balances, 
that are more senior to the most senior of our investments.
2. The resulting attributable enterprise value is apportioned to 
the Group’s investment, and equal ranking investments by other 
parties, according to contractual terms and conditions, to arrive 
at a fair value of the entirety of the investment. The value is then 
distributed amongst the different loan, equity and other financial 
instruments accordingly.
3. If the value attributed to a specific shareholder loan investment in a 
company is less than its par or nominal value, a shortfall is implied, 
which is recognised in our valuation. In exceptional cases, we may 
judge that the shortfall is temporary; to recognise the shortfall in 
such a scenario would lead to unrepresentative volatility and hence 
we may choose not to recognise the shortfall.
Other factors
In applying this framework, there are additional considerations that are 
factored into the valuation of some assets.
Impacts from structuring
Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or cash at 
specific points in time or linked to specific events. For example, where 
a majority shareholder chooses to sell, and we have a minority interest, 
we may have the right to a minimum return on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights. In the 
valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders or holders of 
convertible instruments, fully exercise any structural rights they might 
have if they are “in the money”, and that the value to the Group may 
therefore be reduced by such rights held by third parties. The Group’s 
own structural rights are valued on the basis they are exercisable on 
the reporting date.
Assets classified as “terminal”
If we believe an investment has more than a 50% probability of failing 
in the 12 months following the valuation date, we value the investment 
on the basis of its expected recoverable amount in the event of failure. 
It is important to distinguish between our investment failing and the 
business failing; the failure of our investment does not always mean 
that the business has failed, just that our recoverable value has 
dropped significantly. This would generally result in the equity and loan 
components of our investment being valued at nil. Value movements in 
the period relating to investments classified as terminal are classified 
as provisions in our value movement analysis.
INFRASTRUCTURE UNQUOTED VALUATION
The primary valuation methodology used for infrastructure 
investments is the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”). Fair value is 
estimated by deriving the present value of the investment using 
reasonable assumptions of expected future cash flows and the 
terminal value and date, and the appropriate risk-adjusted discount 
rate that quantifies the risk inherent to the investment. The discount 
rate is estimated with reference to the market risk-free rate, a risk 
adjusted premium and information specific to the investment or 
market sector.
DEBT MANAGEMENT VALUATION
The Group’s Debt Management business line typically invests in traded 
debt instruments and the subordinated notes that it is required to hold 
in the debt funds which it manages. The traded debt instruments and 
the subordinated notes are valued using a range of data including 
broker quotes if available, 3i internal forecasts and discounted cash 
flow models, trading data where available, and data from third-party 
valuation providers. Broker quotes and trading data for more liquid 
holdings are preferred.

Earnings 
(Private Equity)
Most commonly used Private 
Equity valuation methodology
Used for investments which 
are profitable and for which we 
can determine a set of listed 
companies and precedent 
transactions, where relevant, 
with similar characteristics
Earnings multiples are applied to the earnings of the 
company to determine the enterprise value
Earnings
Reported earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, 
such as restructuring expenses, for significant 
corporate actions and, in exceptional cases, run-rate 
adjustments to arrive at maintainable earnings
Most common measure is earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
Earnings used are usually the management accounts 
for the 1 2 months to the quarter end preceding the 
reporting period, unless data from forecasts or the 
latest audited accounts provides a more reliable 
picture of maintainable earnings
Earnings multiples
The earnings multiple is derived from comparable 
listed companies or relevant market transaction 
multiples
We select companies in the same industry and, where 
possible, with a similar business model and profile in 
terms of size, products, services and customers, 
growth rates and geographic focus
We adjust for relative performance in the set of 
comparables, exit expectations and other company 
specific factors
A liquidity discount is applied to 
the enterprise value, typically 
between 5% and 15%, using 
factors such as our alignment 
with management and other 
investors and our investment

metrics
(Private Equity)
Used for investments in 
industries which have well 
defined metrics as bases for 
valuation – eg book value for 
insurance underwriters, 
or regulated asset bases 
for utilities
We create a set of comparable listed companies and 
derive the implied values of the relevant metric
We track and adjust this metric for relative 
performance, as in the case of earnings multiples 
Comparable companies are selected using the same 
criteria as described for the earnings methodology
An appropriate discount is 
applied, depending on the 
valuation metric used

Long-term cash flows are discounted at a rate which 
is benchmarked against market data, where possible, 
or adjusted from the rate at the initial investment 
based on changes in the risk profile of the investment
Discount already implicit in the

long-term cash flows – no 
further discounts applied
9%
Broker quotes (Debt 
Management)
Used to value traded debt 
instruments
Broker quotes obtained from banks which trade the 
specific instruments concerned, benchmarked to a 
range of other data such as DCF , trade data and other 
quotes
No discount is applied 5%

(Private Equity)
Used where elements of 
a business are valued on 
different bases
Values of separate elements prepared on one of the 
methodologies listed above
Discounts applied to separate 
elements as above
1%
For a small proportion of our smaller investments (less than 1% of the portfolio value), the valuation is determined by a more mechanical 
approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or net assets methodology. 
Fixed income shares and loan investments are measured using amortised cost and any implied impairment, in line with IFRS.
Consistent with IPEV guidelines, all equity investments are held at fair value using the most appropriate methodology and no investments are 
held at historical cost.

Performance conditions
The Committee selected the performance conditions used for 
determining the annual bonus and LTIP awards as they align directly 
with the short and long-term strategy of the business. These conditions 
are set annually by the Committee at levels that take into account the 
Board’s business plan.
Changes to the policy operated in FY2014
There have been no changes to the remuneration policy from that 
which was applied during the year, other than an increase in the 
proportion of the annual bonus that is deferred over four years from 
40% to 50%. This has been increased to align the Executive Directors’ 
interests more closely with those of shareholders.
Consistency with policy for all employees
All employees are eligible to receive salary, pension contributions 
and benefits and to be considered for a discretionary annual bonus, 
with the maximum opportunities reflecting the role and seniority of 
each employee. Other members of the Executive Committee are 
subject to the same bonus deferral arrangements as the Executive 
Directors. Higher-earning members of staff below Executive 
Committee have a portion of their bonus deferred into shares vesting  
in equal instalments over a three-year period.
Within each of the Group’s businesses, senior members of staff have 
a significant part of their compensation linked to the long-term 
performance of the Group’s and its clients’ investments through 
carried interest schemes or similar arrangements. 
Co-investment and carried interest plans
Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director, are permitted to participate in carried interest plans and 
similar arrangements. This was approved by shareholders on 4 July 
2001 and 6 July 201 1 when approving the Group’s Long-term Incentive 
Plan. No current Executive Director benefits from these arrangements.
Malus/Clawback policy
The Committee has agreed a policy, which applies to long-term 
incentive awards and deferred bonus share awards made during the 
year to Executive Directors (and certain other Senior Executives), under 
which awards may be forfeited or reduced prior to vesting in 
exceptional circumstances on such basis as the Committee considers 
fair , reasonable and proportionate. This would include material 
misstatement of Group financial statements, or cases where an 
individual is deemed to have caused a material loss for the Group  
as a result of reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate 
values or behaviour.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do 
not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid in its operation 
or implementation without seeking shareholder approval for 
a revised version of this Policy report.

RECRUITMENT POLICY
In determining remuneration arrangements for new executive 
appointments to the Board (including internal promotions), the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, including the 
calibre of the individual, the nature of the role, local market practice,  
the individual’s current remuneration package, 3i remuneration policy, 
internal relativities and existing arrangements for other Executive 
Directors. For external appointments, some variation may be 
necessary in order to attract the successful candidate and to reflect 
particular skills or experience specifically required. 
The maximum level of variable pay (as expressed as a multiple of base 
salary) which may be awarded to new Executive Directors in respect 
of their appointment shall be no more generous than the combined 
maximum limits expressed in the Remuneration policy table above in 
respect of the Chief Executive, with an appropriate mix between annual 
bonus and LTIP opportunity, excluding any awards made to 
compensate the Executive Director for awards forfeited by their 
previous employer. 
It may be necessary to compensate the new Executive Director  
for variable pay being forfeited from their current employer.  
The Committee’s intention is that any such award would be no  
more generous than the awards being forfeited and would be 
determined on a comparable basis at the time of grant, including 
the pay out schedule and performance conditions, where appropriate. 
In determining whether it is appropriate to use such judgment, the 
Committee will ensure that any awards made are in the best interests 
of both the Company and its shareholders. The Committee is at all 
times conscious of the need to pay no more than is necessary, 
particularly when determining buy-out arrangements.
For an internal appointment of a new Executive Director, any existing 
awards made prior to becoming a Director would be allowed to vest 
and pay out in accordance with the existing plan rules.
In the event of the appointment of a new non-executive Director, 
remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with those detailed 
in the relevant table above.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The main terms of the service contracts of the Executive Directors who served in the year were as follows:
Provision Policy
Notice period   12 months’ notice if given by the Company
  6 months’ notice if given by the Executive Director
  Company policy is that Executive Directors’ notice periods should not normally exceed one year.  
Save for these notice periods the contracts have no unexpired terms.
Dates of contracts   Mr S A Borrows – 17 May 2012
  Mrs J S Wilson – 1 October 2008
Termination payments   Mr Borrows’ contract entitles the Company to terminate employment without notice subject to making 
12 monthly payments thereafter equivalent to monthly basic pay and benefits less any amounts earned from 
alternative employment.
  All Directors’ contracts entitle the Company to give pay in lieu of notice.
Remuneration and benefits   The operation of all incentive plans, including being eligible to be considered for an annual bonus and 
Long-term Incentive Plan awards, is non-contractual.
  On termination of employment outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules.
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors do not have service contracts or contracts for services. Their appointment letters provide for 
no entitlement to compensation or other benefits on ceasing to be a Director. Service contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
headquarters in business hours.

PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
As outlined above, the Committee must satisfy any contractual 
obligations agreed with the Executive Directors. Details of the Directors’ 
notice periods are shown alongside the service contract information. 
An Executive Director may be eligible to receive a time pro-rated 
annual bonus in respect of the year up until he or she ceased 
employment. In determining whether to award any bonus, the 
Committee will assess performance during the financial year up to the 
date of cessation of active involvement in their management role. 
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant 
share plan rules. The following table and the note below it summarise 
the leaver categories and the impact on the share awards which 
employees (including Executive Directors) may hold.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, 
where the terms of that payment were agreed (i) before the policy 
came into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
Director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” includes the 
Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to an award or option over shares, the terms of the payment are 
“agreed” at the time the award is granted.

the Committee to reduce awards in exceptional circumstances to Good Leavers or permit vesting (in whole or in part) of awards which would otherwise lapse to 
Bad Leavers. The Committee will report on the use of this discretion if it is exercised in relation to any Executive Director.

  Actual – this represents the remuneration received by each 
Executive Director for their performance in the year;
  Maximum – this is calculated as the fixed elements and the 
maximum Annual Bonus and Long-term Incentive Plan awards; and
  Remuneration arising as a result of share price movements or 
rights to dividends and other distributions have been excluded.
CONSIDERATION OF WIDER EMPLOYEE PAY
As part of the annual Committee agenda, the Committee reviews the 
overall pay and bonus decisions in aggregate for the Group. This 
ensures that the pay and conditions in the wider Group are taken into 
account when determining directors’ pay. In particular:
  Salary increases awarded over time to other employees are taken 
into account when considering salary increases for the Executive 
Directors; and
  The bonus awards made to Directors are considered and made in 
the context of discretionary bonus awards made within the 
business. These are based upon Company performance, and are 
closely correlated to the Executive Director bonus awards.
The Company does not consult with employees when preparing the 
Executive Director remuneration policy. However, a number of our 
employees are shareholders and so are able to express their views 
in the same way as other shareholders.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
As part of the shareholder consultation process during 2012/13, the 
Company proposed moving the payment date for awards under the 
Long-term Incentive Plan to three years and six months following the 
date of award. The Committee received and considered feedback from 
shareholders on this point, and decided to retain the existing 
framework under which the awards have a performance period of 
three years and then are released in tranches on the third, fourth and 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant. 
The Committee will continue to be mindful of shareholder views when 
evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits 
to consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to 
remuneration policy.

BOILER ROOM AND OTHER SCAMS
In the past, some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters 
from organisations or persons claiming or implying that they have 
some connection with the Company. These are typically from overseas 
based “brokers” who target UK shareholders offering to sell them what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in UK or overseas 
investments. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
reports into the Company. These approaches are operated out of what 
is more commonly known as a “boiler room”. You may also be 
approached by brokers offering to purchase your shares for an upfront 
payment in the form of a broker fee, tax payment or de-restriction fee. 
This is a common secondary scam operated by the boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
  Always ensure the firm is on the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) 
Register and is allowed to give financial advice before handing over 
your money. You can check at www.fca.org.uk/register;
  Double-check the caller is from the firm they say they are – ask for 
their name and telephone number and say you will call them back. 
Check their identity by calling the firm using the contact number 
listed on the FCA Register. This is important as there have been 
instances where an authorised firm’s website has been cloned but 
with a few subtle changes, such as a different phone number or 
false email address;
  Check the FCA’s list of known unauthorised overseas firms. 
However, these firms change their name regularly, so even if a firm 
is not listed it does not mean they are legitimate. Always check that 
they are listed on the FCA Register; and
  If you have any doubts, call the Financial Conduct Authority 
Consumer Helpline on 0800 1 1 1 6768. If you deal with an 
unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment  
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) At 31 March 2015, 3i 
Investments plc as AIFM, managed four AIFs. These were 3i Group plc, 
3i Growth Capital Fund, 3i Eurofund V and the European Middle Market 
Loan Fund. 
Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) became 
effective from July 2013. As a result, at 31 March 2015, 3i Investments 
plc is registered as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”), 
which in turn manages four AIFs. 
Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) is the regulated 
manager of AIFs. Within 3i, this is 3i Investments plc.
Assets under management (“AUM”) A measure of the total assets that 
3i has to invest or manages on behalf of shareholders and third-party 
investors for which it receives a fee.
Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management business (“BIFM”) 
Acquired by 3i in November 2013 when it managed two active unlisted 
funds that invest in UK and European PPP and energy projects, with 
assets under management of over £700 million. 
Board The Board of Directors of the Company.
Capital redemption reserve is established in respect of the 
redemption of the Company’s ordinary shares.
Capital reserve The capital reserve recognises all profits that are 
capital in nature or have been allocated to capital. Following changes to 
the Companies Act the Company amended its Articles of Association at 
the 2012 Annual General Meeting to allow these profits to be 
distributable by way of a dividend.
Carried interest is accrued on the realised and unrealised profits 
generated taking relevant performance hurdles into consideration, 
assuming all investments were realised at the prevailing book value. 
Carry is only actually paid or received when the relevant performance 
hurdles are met, and the accrual is discounted to reflect expected 
payment periods.
Carry receivable is generated on third-party capital over the life of the 
relevant fund when relevant performance criteria are met. 
We pay carry to our investment teams on proprietary capital invested 
and share a proportion of carry receivable from third-party funds.  
This total carry payable is provided through schemes which have  
been structured historically over two year vintages to maximise 
flexibility in resource planning.
Collateralised Loan Obligation (“CLO”) A form of securitisation where 
payments from multiple loans are pooled together and passed on to 
different classes of owners in various tranches.
Company 3i Group plc.
Discounting The reduction in present value at a given date of a future 
cash transaction at an assumed rate, using a discount factor reflecting 
the time value of money. 
Dividend income from equity investments and CLO capital is 
recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation and is used as the typical measure of 
portfolio company performance.
EBITDA multiple Calculated as the enterprise value over EBITDA, it is 
used to determine the value of a company.
Executive Committee The Executive Committee is responsible for the 
day-to-day running of the Group and comprises: the Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director, the Managing Partners of the Private Equity, 
Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses and the Group’s 
General Counsel.
Fair value movements on investment entity subsidiaries The 
movement in the carrying value of Group subsidiaries, classified as 
investment entities under IFRS 10, between the start and end of the 
accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates at 
the date of the movement. 
Fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL ”) FVTPL is an IFRS 
measurement basis permitted for assets and liabilities which meet 
certain criteria. Gains and losses on assets and liabilities measured  
as FVTPL are recognised directly in the income statement.
Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an 
investment is first made and through the life of the investment. Fees 
that are earned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to 
a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are 
recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the 
basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are 
recognised as that service is provided. 
Fees receivable from external funds are fees received by the Group, 
from third parties, for the management of private equity, infrastructure 
and debt management funds. 
Foreign exchange on investments arises on investments made in 
currencies that are different from the functional currency of the Group 
entity. Investments are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. At each subsequent reporting date investments are 
translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Fund Management A segment of the business focused on generating 
profits from the management of private equity, infrastructure and debt 
management funds.
Fund Management Operating profit comprises fee income from third 
parties as well as a synthetic fee received from the Proprietary Capital 
business, less operating expenses incurred by the Fund Management 
business.
Gross investment return (“GIR”) GIR includes profit and loss on 
realisations, increases and decreases in the value of the investments 
we hold at the end of a period, any income received from the 
investments such as interest, dividends and fee income and foreign 
exchange movements. GIR is measured as a percentage of the opening 
portfolio value and is the principal tool for assessing our Proprietary 
Capital business.
Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues. When 
the fair value of an investment is assessed to be below the principal 
value of a loan the Group recognises a provision against any interest 
accrued from the date of the assessment going forward until the 
investment is assessed to have recovered in value.

Glossary continued
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) IFRS are 
accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”). The Group’s consolidated financial statements are 
required to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. 
Investment basis Accounts prepared assuming that IFRS 10 had not 
been introduced. Under this basis, we fair value portfolio companies  
at the level we believe provides the most comprehensive financial 
information. 
The commentary in the Strategic Report refers to this basis as we 
believe it provides a more understandable view of our performance.
Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”) This is a measure by reference to 
which the development, performance or position of the Group can be 
measured effectively.
Money multiple Calculated as the cumulative distributions plus any 
residual value divided by paid-in capital.
Net asset value (“NAV”) NAV is a measure of the fair value of our 
proprietary investments and the net costs of operating the business. 
Operating cash profit Defined as the difference between our cash 
income (cash fees from managing third-party funds and cash income 
from our proprietary capital portfolio) and our operating expenses, 
excluding restructuring costs.
Operating profit Includes gross investment return, management fee 
income generated from managing external funds, the costs of running 
our business, net interest payable, movements in the fair value of 
derivatives, other losses and carried interest. 
Portfolio income is that which is directly related to the return from 
individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably 
measured. It is comprised of dividend income, income from loans and 
receivables and fee income. 
Proprietary Capital A segment of the business focused on generating 
profits from shareholders capital which is available to invest. 
Proprietary Capital operating profit The profit comprises gross 
investment return, operating expenses, a fee paid to the Fund 
Management business and balance sheet funding expenses such  
as interest payable. 
Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) A PPP is a government service  
or private business venture which is funded and operated through a 
partnership of government and one or more private sector companies.
Realised profits or losses over value on the disposal of investments 
The difference between the fair value of the consideration received 
less any directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity and the 
repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start 
of the accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange 
rates at the date of disposal.
Revenue reserve recognises all profits that are revenue in nature or 
have been allocated to revenue.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Executive 
who is considered to be the Group’s chief operating decision maker. All 
transactions between business segments are conducted on an arm’s 
length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated 
on consolidation. Income and expenses directly associated with each 
segment are included in determining business segment performance. 
Share-based payment reserve is a reserve to recognise those 
amounts in retained earnings in respect of share-based payments.
Synthetic fee Internal fee payable to the Fund Management business 
for managing our proprietary capital. 
Total return Comprises operating profit less tax charge less movement 
in actuarial valuation of the historic defined benefit pension scheme. 
Total shareholder return (“TSR”) This is the measure of the overall 
return to shareholders and includes the movement in the share price 
and any dividends paid, assuming that all dividends are reinvested on 
their ex-dividend date. 
Translation reserve comprises all exchange differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of international operations.
Underlying fund management profit Calculated as fee income minus 
operating expenses related to Fund Management activities, excluding 
restructuring and amortisation costs. 
Unrealised profits or losses on the revaluation of investments The 
movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and 
end of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange 
rates at the date of the movement.
Value weighted earnings growth The growth in last 12 month 
earnings, when comparing to the preceding 12 months. This measure 
is the key driver of our private equity portfolio performance.

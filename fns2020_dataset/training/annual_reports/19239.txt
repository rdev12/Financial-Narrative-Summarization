The Company has consistently 
delivered strong operating and 
financial performance. The robustness 
of our business model has been 
proved with its ability to weather 
difficult trading conditions faced by 
the Indian power sector.
 
Our plants have been performing at 
over 90% PLFs, significantly above 
industry average. Our ability to achieve 
such high PLFs can be attributed not 
only to our equipment but also our 
ability to procure a constant supply of 
coal. We also continue to realise above

in our year on year growth in profits

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
This is the average price realised per unit of power 
sold. The average tariff achieved for FY15 was  
Rs 5.71/kWh, an increase of 3% from FY14 due  
to higher realisation from Group captive customers 
and the LTVT contract.
Gearing is a measure of net debt to shareholders’ 
equity plus net debt. As at 31 March 2015 the  
Group has net debt of £250.6m and gearing of 59%. 
The Company is near peak debt with all projects 
under construction complete.
The cost of fuel is the primary cost input in power 
plants. Cost of generation per kWh increased to 
Rs 3.27 FY15 from Rs 3.17 in FY14 due to increase  
in local duties and transportation costs.
Plant load factor measures the output of a power 
plant compared to the maximum output it could 
produce. Our Chennai plant (units I, II and III) 
achieved an average PLF of 91%, significantly  
ahead of industry average.
This represents net profit after tax attributable to 
equity shareholders. In FY15, earnings per share 
were 4.9 pence, an increase of 18.6%.
Earnings Before Interest, T axes, Depreciation and 
Amortisation is a factor of volumes, prices and cost 
of production. This EBITDA measure is calculated 
by adjusting non-operational and exceptional items, 
depreciation and net finance cost. It is a measure 
of the Company’ s operating cash flows. EBITDA for 
FY15 was higher by 8% at £33.39m.
(FY14: £30.97m). OPG Power Ventures Plc

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I’m delighted to be addressing 
shareholders following another 
very successful year.
For the fifth year in succession, 
management demonstrated the 
effectiveness and sustainability of their 
adopted group captive business model 
as a result of which your Company 
recorded consistently healthy margins. 
Maintaining our record for achieving 
unbroken fuel supplies and strong tariffs, 
we also benefited from reduced exchange 
rate volatility.
As well as delivering industry leading 
operational performance, management 
have built the Group from 20 MW to a fully 
developed 750 MW generator. Securing 
a reputation for building all of their 
controllables to time and within budget, 
the Group has delivered on its IPO 
commitments.
We are now a fast growth power generator 
with an attractive multi-locational asset 
base. And we still have important work to 
do to continue to satisfy the expectations 
of our customers. To this end management 
are looking ahead and wanting to provide 
customers with a one stop shop for  
all energy needs, both from thermal or 
renewable sources. The Company thus 
has the opportunity to closely replicate the 
diversity of the nation’s energy generation.
I expect the generation of cash from its  
full portfolio of assets to put the Company 
on the path to dividends. In addition 
through management’s pursuit of a  
growth strategy the Company is targeting 
enhanced returns at a time when India’s 
economic revival appears to be gathering 
momentum, and industry becomes a more 
thirsty consumer group. I’m therefore truly 
excited by the Company’s prospects as it 
now represents scale, robustness 
and growth.
Upon the completion of construction of 
our 750 MW portfolio I would like to take 
the opportunity to thank the management 
team and our employees and contractors 
for all their efforts in building this Company 
from the ground up and my sincere thanks 
to my Board colleagues.
In addition, on this special occasion 
of having delivered on all its promises, 
on behalf of the Company, I want to 
extend a very special thanks to all of 
our shareholders and lenders who have 
supported us over the last seven years 
since our admission to AIM.

Coal overview
Domestic coal in short supply 
production expected to be ramped 
up to 1 billion tonnes by 2020
India has over 300 billion tonnes of coal 
reserves and therefore coal remains India’s 
predominant primary energy source, 
accounting for approximately two-thirds of 
total power generation capacity and 
expected to remain the major contributor 
for the foreseeable future. However:
• Domestic coal supply has been lower 
than the demand 
• Inadequate rail capacity hampers timely 
availability of coal 
• Low generation due to non-availability 
of coal
Measures introduced to improve  
coal supply: 
• Coal India Limited India plans to 
increase annual coal production to 
1 billion tonnes by 2020 from c. 500Mt
• Increased allocation to power sector 
• Improvement in mining processes to 
increase production 
• Increase efficiency by building plants 
with improved technologies 
• Mining Bill Amendment – allowing 
private sector companies to mine coal 
for merchant use
• Expand railway lines at coal sites and 
add 250 additional rakes to evacuate 
higher coal quantities
International coal markets – coal 
production unaffected due to lower 
local production costs 
• International coal producers’ shielded 
as costs have come down due to lower 
oil and a strong US Dollar
• Consequently, no major change in 
international coal supply 
• India imported c.215Mt coal in FY15 
and is expected to reach 260Mt in FY16 
• International coal prices have declined 
over the last two years 
• Price of Indonesian HBA coal (4,200 
GAR) has declined by 12% in FY15
• India expected to become the biggest 
importer of coal.
‘ Our goal is to secure 
availability of coal to meet 
the demand of various 
sectors of the economy in 
an eco-friendly, sustainable 
and cost effective manner.’’

This has been a period 
of tremendous progress 
for the Company. 
We have run our operations at over 90% 
load factor and nearly trebled our available 
capacity from 270 MW to 750 MW. In so 
doing, we have also established a 
multi-location business, widened our core 
skills in areas such as transmission line 
construction, delivered an increase of over 
20% in profitability and continued to 
actively manage our gearing and 
operational risk profile. Over the last three 
years, as we increased from 110 MW to 
270 MW operating capacity, our local 
currency earnings have grown by over 
350%. With a full 750 MW constructed and 
further low risk projects being evaluated, 
we intend to create further value for 
shareholders. 
A quantum leap forward to 750 MW 
constructed assets 
In the last few weeks, the Group has 
completed the construction of its biggest 
projects – the 180 MW Chennai IV and 
the 2x150 MW Gujarat, bringing our total 
constructed assets to 750 MW. With one 
of the 150 MW units in Gujarat awaiting 
transmission lines from the state, we 
currently have 600 MW of operational 
assets across two states. 
The 180 MW Chennai unit, constructed 
on time and within budget, was built using 
key equipment from Europe, a first for the 
Group, and increases the Chennai plant’s 
capacity to 414 MW. 
The new units at Chennai and Gujarat 
boast the same flexible fuel design features 
as our existing Chennai plant.
At the 300 MW Gujarat site, our 
development work has been completed. 
We continue to work with the state 
transmission company on constructing the 
multi-circuit evacuation line which is now 
approximately two-thirds complete. In the 
meantime, one 150 MW unit has already 
been operating at an average load factor of 
approximately 47% since commissioning 
in April, ahead of our expectations. This 
unit uses the newly constructed interim 
transmission line and we continue to 
expect both units of the plant to achieve 
normal commercial operations in around 
September 2015. 
I am extremely proud of the team’s 
achievement in building two sizeable 
projects concurrently in different locations 
to such a high standard. 
Operations continue to endorse our 
business model 
In addition to the substantial growth in 
capacity, we achieved continued strong 
operational performance that saw load 
factors averaging 91% across our portfolio 
of three units that were commercially active 
for the full financial year at Chennai. This 
is well ahead of the national average and 
is reflective of our flexible procurement 
policy that once again helped to ensure 
we experienced no lack of fuel (coal). 
We continued to perform consistently well 
against regulated tariff levels for industrial 
users – our average tariff for the year rising 
slightly to Rs 5.71 per kWh. These factors 
combined to deliver Rupee revenues that 
were higher than last year in spite of a 
major planned maintenance shutdown 
of our flagship unit, Chennai I. Our robust 
top line thus continued to benefit from 
the successful implementation of our 
business model.

‘ With a full 750 MW

we intend to create further

Rupee costs have held steady
As much of our coal purchases are 
imported, unit costs of generation are 
affected by currency fluctuation between 
the US Dollar and the Indian Rupee. 
Whilst we have continued to enter into 
a mix of fixed and variable price coal 
contracts of varying durations, the Rupee 
has been far less volatile against the US 
Dollar than in previous years. Any savings 
generated as a result of coal prices were 
largely offset by a rise in logistics costs 
and coal cess. Around 68% of our coal 
purchases were imported. 
Opportunities taken to manage risk 
One of the advantages of our model is that 
we retain the flexibility to take opportunities 
that benefit our risk-reward profile. For 
instance, in October 2014 the Group 
secured power sales contracts until 
September 2015 with TANGEDCO for 
around two-thirds of the output from the 
Chennai plant at attractive fixed rates. 
Similarly, the Long Term Variable Tariff 
arrangement entered into in January 2014 
for 74 MW continues until 2029 and 
delivered an average tariff this year of  
Rs 5.79 per kWh. This is in addition to the 
55 MW reserved by us at Chennai for sales 
direct to Group captive customers at an 
average tariff of over Rs 6 per kWh since 
December 2014.
Our joint venture with Noble, entered into 
in August 2014 for a Long Term Freight 
Arrangement, is expected to provide 
security over our cost and availability of 
international freight for around half of our 
existing operations from 2017, deploying 
the right management skills to deliver 
those savings. Under the arrangement,  
the Company has joint ownership of two 
new 64,000 tonnes cargo vessels and 
gives OPG the ability to use 1.5 Mt of 
freight capacity per annum.
I believe our being able to take such 
opportunities as they arise helps us 
to establish a continually more 
robust business. 
Maintaining our focus on balance 
sheet management 
During the year we invested £102m 
on completing our capital projects and 
our borrowings were £261m at 31 March 
2015. This represents gearing of 59% 
which remains in line with expectations. 
Our repayments remain on schedule and 
our borrowing facilities have an average 
outstanding duration of approximately nine 
years versus our enlarged asset portfolio 
that is being depreciated over 35–40 
years. During the year, our domestic credit 
rating was raised to ‘A-’ and in the last  
few weeks it has been raised again to  
‘A’. In addition, as a result of base rate 
reductions, we have already seen 0.5%  
cut from our local borrowing cost which 
equate to annualised pre-tax savings of 
over £1m.  OPG Power Ventures Plc

India’s economic revival continues 
and we will continue to build a robust 
business for the long term
Some developments are being prioritised 
by the new Government in pushing 
ahead with business-focused legislation, 
such as that relating to land acquisition for 
infrastructure projects, mining and minerals, 
and to the transparency of administrative 
processes. The Government is starting 
to lead the way on investment in certain 
crucial sectors including the power sector. 
Delivering ‘Power for All by 2020’ and 
anticipated amendments to the Electricity 
Act 2003 should assist in making 
investment more attractive but I believe 
that the sheer enormity of the task to 
balance electricity supply and demand 
makes it one of the country’s greatest 
challenges. We expect to play our part by 
continuing to build and grow a profitable 
and robust business that meets the 
demands of our customers. 
Meeting demand, maintaining 
momentum
With customers seeking to source their 
energy needs through a mixture of thermal 
and renewable power, the Board will 
endeavour to ensure that OPG’s growth in 
the future reflects that dynamic. We have 
kept an active watch on the renewable 
power space and are being measured 
about the timing of our entry into 
renewables as the aforementioned 
demand trend in India coupled with 
improving wind and solar technologies 
and falling equipment prices make it 
increasingly attractive to us. 
We are evaluating in detail new projects, 
including modular wind and solar projects 
across four states in India. I believe that the 
development of renewables capacity will 
make our business even more robust with 
a yet wider combination of technologies, 
locations and potential customers. The 
evaluation of these future projects will 
include analysis of the optimum funding 
structure, given the forecast internal cash 
generation of the Company alongside 
the Board’s intention to initiate a dividend 
which remains unchanged and is to be 
embedded within our proposed long-
term management incentive scheme. 
Our current view is that projects to be 
pursued are those that can be funded 
from internally generated capital and debt. 
At this time of positioning the Company 
for the next stage of its development, the 
Board recognises that the Group currently 
has no long-term incentive plan in place. 
As such, the Group’s Remuneration 
Committee believes that the introduction of 
an incentive scheme is appropriate as the 
Board targets future growth. The scheme’s 
currently proposed metrics, described in 
more detail after the financial review, are 
to be designed to sit alongside the Group’s 
strategy with vesting occurring upon value 
creation for shareholders.

/kWh
Chennai performed ahead of 
expectations at an average 
of 91% Plant Load Factor 
(‘PLF’) for the year.
Consistent and strong  
operational performance 
Chennai plants performed ahead of 
expectations at an average of 91% Plant 
Load Factor (‘PLF’) for the year. At 77 MW 
Chennai I, a planned shutdown was 
taken for three weeks, for the first time 
since commissioning and the plant 
operated at 90% for the remainder of  
the year. Power generation from the 
Chennai plant (Chennai I, II, III) for the 
year was 1,861 million kWh, slightly 
ahead of last year (FY14: 1,840 million 
kWh) as the full year generation from 
Chennai III (FY14: 10 months) offset the 
Chennai I shutdown. Other performance 
parameters such as auxiliary power 
consumption and heat rate efficiency 
remained in line with management 
expectations. 
Flexible and diversified sales mix 
We continued to sell our output under our 
flexible sales model adopting a diversified 
sales mix of both customers and tenure. 
In October 2014, the Company entered 
into its sales arrangement with Tamil Nadu 
Generation and Distribution Company 
(‘TANGEDCO’) to supply 255 MW of output 
until September 2015 at Rs 5.50/kWh 
(including output from Chennai IV on 
commercial commissioning). This was in 
addition to our existing 15 year Power 
Purchase Agreement (‘PPA’) for 74 MW 
under the Long Term Variable Tariff 
Agreement (‘LTVT’) entered into in January 
2014 which provides foreign exchange 
protection for imported coal. Approximately 
55 MW output was sold directly to industrial 
customers. Our average tariff realised 
across all our sales in Chennai for FY15 was 
Rs 5.71/kWh representing a 3% increase 
from FY14. This increase was on account of 
higher realisation on our LTVT and a 10% 
increase in tariffs from December for 55 
MW sales to industrial customers. 
Coal supplies 
The Company received its anticipated coal 
supplies from Coal India Limited (‘CIL ’) 
during the year and remained unaffected 
by the deallocation of coal blocks by the 
Supreme Court and the subsequent 
auctioning of these blocks. The Company 
also had contracts in place in FY15 to 
procure imported coal from its established 
suppliers and received its agreed 
quantities of coal allowing for planned 
running of operations. 
All India average PLFs were 66% during  
the year primarily due to non-availability of 
coal, as compared to 91% achieved by our 
plants. Our flexible boilers, coastal location 
and covered coal sheds supplemented by 
our established procurement policy ensured 
we continued to receive our coal regularly. 
The Company’s joint venture with Noble 
Shipping to secure freight for part of our 
operations is expected to further 
strengthen our procurement operations. 
Indonesian and Indian coal costs went up 
during the year due to higher logistics 
costs and coal cess. Average cost of 
generation per unit was Rs 3.27, 3.2% 
higher from FY14.
Achieving new scale with addition 
of 480 MW
180 MW Chennai IV
180 MW Chennai IV plant was originally 
planned as a 160 MW comprising  
2x80 MW. The unit was upgraded to one 
unit of 160 MW and again in May 2014 to 
180 MW. The move provided the Company 
with additional space to construct its 80 
MW Chennai III, the equity for this funded by 
internal cash flows.
Key highlights of the plant:
• Expanded from 160 MW to 180 MW 
in May 2014
• European equipment supplier 
• Shared facilities
• Sales agreed at Rs 5.50 until 
September 2015 
to TANGEDCO (state utility)
300 MW Gujarat
Construction at Gujarat plant, 
comprising two units of 150 MW, was 
completed in February 2015. It has been 
the Group’s largest greenfield project to 
date and in a second location.
Key highlights of the plant:
• Adapted from water cooled to air cooled 
• Second greenfield site developed at the 
same time as Chennai IV
• New skills developed e.g. 
transmission lines
• Similar flexible boiler design as 
in Chennai
• Commenced commercial sales in 
mid April 2015 
• Interim transmission line in use  OPG Power Ventures Plc

The Group faces a number of risks to its business and 
strategy. Management of these risks is an integral part  
of the management of the Group. The Group has in place  
a process for identifying and managing risks.
The list of principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group’s business set out below 
cannot be exhaustive because of the  
very nature of risk. New risks emerge and 
the severity and probability associated with 
these will change over time.
Sector-related risks
POWER SALE 
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The Company’s power plants derive their revenue from the Group captive model selling 
power Company’s on short-term, medium-term, or long-term sale basis and would, for 
this purpose, enter into Power Purchase Agreements with counterparties such as industrial 
captive consumers, power trading companies and state utilities. Contracts with customers 
may impose restrictions on the Company’s ability to, amongst other things, increase prices at 
short notice and undertake expansion initiatives with other customers. This could affect the 
revenue in the short- to medium-term. In addition, recovery of revenues could be effected by 
credit risk of a customer or their ability to draw power at any given time.
• Review contracts periodically to 
obtain best possible tariffs
• Flexibility to sell to captive consumers 
or in the open market
• Benchmarking captive consumer 
prices to state utility prices to benefit 
from any price increases
• Monitor ongoing customer performance, 
maintaining a group of counterparties
AVAILABILITY OF FUEL SUPPLY AND COSTS 
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The Group has coal linkages with domestic companies and agreements for imported coal. 
The dependence on third parties for coal exposes the Group’s power plants to vulnerabilities 
such as non-supply, price increases in the international market, foreign exchange fluctuations 
and increases in shipping costs and any changes in applicable taxes and duties. This could 
impact the operations and profitability of the Group.
• Seeking long-term supplies
• Maintaining adequate storage facility to 
keep appropriate levels of surplus stocks
• Maintaining relationship with suppliers 
and mitigating any potential disruption
• Developing different sources for fuel 
supply especially in the imports market
TIMELY EXECUTION OF PROJECTS 
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The length of the construction period and the cost to complete any given project 
is dependent on third-party suppliers and EPC contractors. Factors such as disputes with 
contractors, price increases, shortages of construction materials, delays in supply from  
various contractors, accidents, unforeseen difficulties, changes in Government policies,  
delays in receipt of necessary approvals and non-availability of external infrastructure such  
as transmission lines, can lead to cost overruns and delays impacting the timely completion 
and ultimately the profitability of projects. 
• Close monitoring of projects by the 
project team and addressing issues 
causing delays
• Ordering key equipment and long 
lead items ahead of schedule
• Including liquidated damages clauses in 
its contracts in relation to such matters  
as delays and inferior workmanship
• Developed strong and well experienced 
in-house EPC team to deliver the projects 
on time
PROJECT FINANCE 
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The development of power plants is a capital intensive business and the Group’s  
projects require access to both equity and debt markets. The availability of capital as well as 
terms of debt funding/interest rates may change including the need for personal guarantees.
• Assessing financial viability of projects
•  Financing projects with an optimum 
mix of debt and equity including 
internal accruals
•  Obtaining in-principle project finance from 
banks before commencement of projects
• Monitoring cash flows to ensure repayment 
of debt and interest in line with schedule
•  Exploring new relationships in debt 
markets to ensure optimum debt 
funding terms
PRINCIPAL RISKS OPG Power Ventures Plc

India-specific risks
GOVERNMENT POLICY AND REGULATIONS 
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The power industry is heavily regulated with permits and licences issued by the Indian  
Government and other regulators. Further, the regulatory environment is continuously 
changing. Obtaining these licences is critical to the Group’s development plans.
Failure or delays in receiving permits or approvals could have an adverse impact on projects 
and affect the profitability of the Group.
• The Group monitors and reviews 
changes in the regulatory environment 
and its commitments under licences 
previously granted
• It continually ensures compliance with 
the conditions contained within individual 
licences and is mindful of the importance 
of complying with national and local 
legislation and standards
• The Group maintains an open and 
proactive relationship with the Indian 
Government and its various agencies
ABILITY TO RETAIN FISCAL AND TAX INCENTIVES
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The Group’s existing and planned power plants are based on the various fiscal and tax 
benefits that will be available to the Company by the federal and state Government. 
A change in policy or the adoption of tax policies and incentives can have an adverse impact 
on the profitability of the Group.
• The Group continues to monitor 
changes and developments in respect 
of incentives provided by the Indian 
federal and state authorities
• Project investment returns are evaluated 
based on the expected incentives 
available to the Company and are 
revised based on the most up-to-date 
guidance available
EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS
Description Monitoring and mitigation
As a consequence of the international nature of its business, the Company is exposed to 
risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group’s operations 
are based in India and its functional currency is the Indian Rupee although the presentational 
currency is Great Britain Pound Sterling. The raw material is purchased in US Dollars.
The Group’s financial results may be affected by appreciation or depreciation of the value of 
the foreign exchange rates relative to the Indian Rupee. 
• Putting in place, where appropriate, 
forward contracts or hedging 
mechanisms
• Monitoring our risk on a regular basis 
where no hedging mechanism is in 
place and taking steps to minimise 
potential losses
GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTABILITY
Description Monitoring and mitigation
The Indian market and Indian economy are influenced by global economic and market 
conditions, particularly emerging market countries in Asia. Financial instability in recent years 
has inevitably affected the Indian economy. 
Continuing uncertainty and concerns about contagion in the wake of the financial crises could 
have a negative impact on the availability of funding.
• The Group continues to monitor 
changes and developments in the 
global markets to assess the impact 
on its financing plans OPG Power Ventures Plc

revenues increased by 3.8%. This was due to a 1% increase in output as a net result of a 
full year of operation at the 80 MW Chennai III which was brought into commercial service 
in June 2013 and offset by a planned long maintenance shutdown taken at 77 MW 
Chennai I. The Group’s average tariff was up by 2.9% following a 10% increase in 
December 2014 in the tariff charged to industrial customers served directly (currently 
around 55 MW) plus an average realisation of Rs 5.79 on the Long Term Variable Tariff 
(‘LTVT’) arrangement that relates to 74 MW of the output of the Chennai plant.
There were no revenues from the new 180 MW Chennai IV or 300 MW Gujarat plants 
during the period under review. 
Production and output levels from the Group’s three operating power units in Chennai 
compared to the prior year were as follows:

Cost of revenue
About 90% of cost of revenue is represented by fuel costs. The average factory gate costs 
for Indian coal increased by 4.5% and for Indonesian coal by 3.2% due to increase in 
inland transportation and duties. Cost of generation per unit increased by 3.2% to Rs 3.27 
from Rs 3.17. Cost of revenue in Pound Sterling terms was 58.5% of revenue in FY15, 
lower than the 60.2% recorded in FY14 due to the effect of foreign currency translation.

Gross profit
Gross profit (‘GP’), excluding depreciation in 2015 was £41.51m (FY14: £39.29m),  
an increase of 5.6% principally as a result of the increase in average tariffs described 
above and lower costs of revenue on translation. Underlying gross profit margins  
remained steady at 38%. 
EBITDA
EBITDA is a measure of a business’s cash generation from operations before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and exceptional and non-standard or non-operational changes 
which are non-cash item or expenses relating to projects under construction. 
EBITDA was £33.39m in FY15 up from £30.97m in FY14 and the EBITDA margins were

Distribution, general and administrative 
Distribution costs include transmission costs to Group captive customers and discount for 
early payment by customers. Distribution costs were higher by £0.6m due to increased 
sales to Group captive customers. 
General and administrative costs (excluding charge on deconsolidated investments) were 
lower by £0.99m principally due to lower foreign exchange losses during the year as the 
Rupee and US Dollar exchange rates were relatively steady. Management remuneration 
costs increased during the year which included provisions of £0.5m for bonuses. 
Finance costs 
Net finance costs were lower by £0.56m due to decrease in finance costs relating to 
operations by £0.7m and higher finance income of £0.45m which was generated by profit 
on sale of short-term financial investments. Finance costs on borrowings increased £0.6m 
due to increase in borrowings.
Expenditure on projects
This relates to expenses incidental to projects under construction charged to period 
expense not being of a capital nature and therefore not capitalised to project costs. 
These expenses in FY15 were £0.38m in FY15 as compared to £0.34m in FY14.
Employee Stock Option (‘ESOP’) charge 
This relates to the amortisation of the value of stock options granted to certain Directors 
and is non-cash in nature. £0.23m reflected the balance ESOP costs relating to 22 million 
options which were amortised during the year. 
Taxation 
The Company’s operating subsidiaries are under a tax holiday period but are subject to 
Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) on its accounting profits. Any tax paid under MAT can be 
offset against future taxable profits once the tax holiday period is over. The tax charged 
during the year was £4.36m (FY14: £3.39m) which includes current tax of £2.85m 
(FY14: £2.68m) and deferred tax of £1.51m (FY14: £0.71m). As a result effective tax rate 
for the year was 20.14% up from 18.86% in FY14.

Property, plant and equipment
The net book value of our property, plant and equipment has increased by £135m, almost 
all of which relates to investments made during the year in the construction of our new 
plants at Chennai and Gujarat.
Other non-current assets
Other non-current assets increased by £4.61m year on year primarily as a result of 
investments made in a shipping joint venture with Noble Chartering Limited and increase 
in the restricted cash (deposits) holding for more than 12 months.

Subsequent to the reporting date, the Company has received £9.4m from Tamil Nadu 
Generation and Distribution Corporation (‘TANGEDCO’) towards the sale made during 
the period October 2014 and November 2014 under short-term sale agreement and for 
February 2015 and March 2015 under 15 year variable tariff LTBT contract. Net amounts 
written off trade receivables during the year total £Nil (FY14: £0.5m).
Current assets
Current assets decreased by £39.18m to £73.11m year on year primarily as a result of the 
following movements: 
• An increase in trade receivables of £7.63m 
• A reduction in investment and other assets of £40.2m of which £27.0m was on account 
of capital advances to suppliers on new projects being capitalised to assets under 
construction in property, plant and equipment. A further £14.9m represented sales 
of holding in financial assets for deployment in projects as scheduled
• A reduction in inventory holding of £5.01m as shipments were received just after year 
end for existing operations and coal for newly commissioned projects is accounted 
under project costs until commissioning
Gearing
Net borrowings (borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale 
investments) were £250.66m as at 31 March 2015. The gearing ratio was 59%. 
Restricted cash balances totalling £8.1m (FY14: £7.6m) comprise deposits that have 
been pledged as security against the Company’s borrowings. 
Other non-current liabilities
The reduction in other non-current liabilities of £6.5m is on account of £15.0m reduction 
in other payables comprising capital goods payables relating to Chennai IV and Gujarat 
plant offset by increases of £1.6m in deferred tax provisions and £7.2m increase in 
project retention monies as projects approach their completion.

Proposed Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
The Group’s Remuneration Committee are seeking to introduce a new incentive scheme 
for senior management to run from FY15–16 to FY17–18 with the following shareholder 
value based performance targets: 
a). the achievement of a share price of 130 pence;
b). the achievement of a further 250 MW growth in installed capacity from a base of 
750 MW; and
c). a cumulative total of 3 pence in ordinary dividends made, paid or declared between 
now and the end of/publication of the Report and Accounts in respect of FY18. 
Under the proposed 2015 LTIP, up to 16 million new Ordinary Shares in the Company are 
expected to be awarded at their nominal value of 0.0147 pence to certain members of the 
senior management team, the majority of which would be to Gita Investments Limited, 
a company linked to the CEO. The awards, which would be made in due course, would 
vest over a three-year period equally upon achieving the three targets. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to declare vesting of awards on a linear scale of performance 
but cannot raise maximum award levels. Vested shares cannot be sold for a period of one 
year following the end of the performance period, the exception to this rule being sales to 
meet tax liabilities, if any. All vested shares will be entitled to accrued dividends paid over 
the three-year performance period, such that the interests of the management are aligned 
with those of the shareholders. Further announcements will be made upon any awards of 
shares to Directors of the Company.  OPG Power Ventures Plc

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Corporate Social Responsibility 
(‘CSR’) is at the core of our 
operations. Maintaining 
our social responsibility to 
operate is vital to successfully 
delivering on our growth plans 
and creating value. We aim 
to achieve international best 
practices with our CSR efforts 
and continually evaluate our 
health, safety, environment, 
and community practices 
to ensure we are delivering to 
all our stakeholders. We are 
committed to improving 
the lives of the societies in 
which we operate through 
the integration of economic 
prosperity, social development 
and environmental protection.
Health and safety
Health and safety is the matter of 
greatest importance at OPG
The Board had formally established a 
Health, Safety and Environment Committee 
(‘HSE Committee’) in FY13 to develop, 
implement and oversee a health and safety 
culture in the Company and to assist 
the management in its drive towards 
achieving and maintaining industry-leading 
performance in these areas. This is crucial 
to ensure, through management, that the 
Company’s employees, its customers, 
suppliers and its contractors enjoy a safe 
and healthy workplace.
Across the Company, we continually monitor 
and review health and safety procedures, 
acting promptly if any improvements are 
required. Our motto of SAFETY FIRST 
is inculcated in all our personnel and in all our 
operations and projects under development. 
And of course we ensure that our plant 
locations are compliant with all national 
health and safety regulations.
The OPG Chennai site is OHSAS 
18001:2007 certified. OHSAS 18001 is a 
standard used for an occupational health 
and safety management system, which 
enables an organisation to control its risks 
and improve its performance in this area. 
The standard provides a systematic 
approach to identifying hazards, and then 
either eliminates or reduces the risks of 
the hazards.
At both Chennai and Gujarat sites, 
continuous training programmes in safety 
management are established for both 
OPG and contractor staff. Targets have 
been introduced to enable year on year 
improvements and these are monitored 
by the Company’s HSE Committee. 
To drive the improvement programmes the 
Company has adopted the Policy of Zero 
Harm at both sites.
Following were key initiatives/improvements 
that we have introduced at our power plants:
Safety initiatives
• Safety induction for all new employees 
and contract workmen as per 
standard programme
• Manual call point checking (monthly)
• Monthly EHS training programme for 
contract employees
• Weekly EHS training programme for 
OPG employees (every Friday)
• Extinguisher and fire hydrant training 
for new contract workmen and 
employees (monthly)
• Carrying out the IMS (Integrated 
Management Systems) internal audit.
• Fire hydrants and extinguishers 
healthiness and availability 
inspections (monthly)
• Safety Committee meetings (monthly)
• Training of 15 employees in first aid  
by a certified body
• Eight employees attended five days’ 
training on occupational health safety, 
conducted by RLI (Regional Labour 
Institute, Government of India)
• Two emergency preparedness and 
response mock drills conducted 
(internal and external)
• Increased number of safety signage 
boards placed inside the plant
• Increased number of fire hydrants 
and monitors included in 
revamping activities
• Visitor’s safety guidelines introduced
• Safety Committee agenda modified 
as per Factories Rules 1950
• EHS external audit was carried out 
by a third-party safety consultant
• EMS 14001 and OHSAS 18001 second 
surveillance audit carried out
• Alcohol detector procured to monitor 
coal truck drivers
As part of their monthly and yearly 
reporting, plant managers are
required to submit details of training 
activities and other initiatives. Most often 
these activities tend to focus on:
• Fire handling
• Mock emergency drills
• Occupational ill health awareness
The above activities typically take place 
at monthly intervals with a compulsory 
annual safety awareness day being held 
at both plants.
In addition to processes for reporting 
specific incidents, plant management are 
required to submit a monthly safety report 
setting out:
• Injuries by number, nature, seriousness 
and cause
• Information on near miss incidents
• Safety concerns arising and 
improvement actions to be taken
• Safety promotion activities along with 
details of attendees
This information, which covers around 
300 employees and 350 contractors at 
Chennai, revealed six lost time injuries at 
the plant and a total reportable incident 
rate of 0.40, down from 0.49 in the 
previous year. Our target for FY16 is 0.35.
For the Gujarat plant, FY16 being the first 
year of operations, data will be reported in 
the next report 
There were no fatalities at the Company’s 
operations during the year. OPG Power Ventures Plc

OPG believes that safety is everyone’s 
responsibility. The main objective is to 
motivate the employees and associates 
to put safety first in the workplace and 
contribute towards making OPG a healthier 
and safer place to work.
Environment
OPG is committed to achieve continuous 
improvements in environmental performance 
and seek to prevent, mitigate, reduce 
or offset the environmental impact 
of our operations.
In May 2013, the OPG Chennai site 
successfully obtained the ISO 14001:2004 
certification. This specifies requirements 
for an environmental management system 
to enable an organisation to develop and 
implement policies and objectives with 
respect to the environment.
Environmental and green initiatives
Our dedication to environmentally 
sustainable operations goes beyond our 
plants and offices. Following are a few 
initiatives of the Company:
• 2,000 saplings planted throughout 
the site
• E-Waste collection and disposal 
agreement signed with TNWMS
• Colour coded waste segregation bins 
were introduced
• Rain water collection pond volume 
increased by 10,000 m

• Monthly water sprinkling programmes 
surrounding the Chennai plant and 
in other areas e.g. roads and yards 
through water tankers to arrest any 
possible dust pollution
• Sweeping tractor usage for floor 
cleaning all over the plant
At our Gujarat site we did mangrove 
plantation with the assistance and 
knowledge of the Government authorities.
Our people
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on 
keeping employees informed on matters 
affecting them and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. 
This is achieved through informal meetings 
and presentations on new developments 
both within the Company and the wider 
industry. The Group is committed to 
providing equal opportunities and opposes 
all forms of unfair or unlawful discrimination. 
Employees will not be discriminated against 
because of race, colour, nationality, ethnic 
origin, disability, sex or sexual orientation, 
marital status or age.
All employees are encouraged to raise 
genuine concerns about possible 
improprieties in the conduct of our 
business, whether in matters of financial 
reporting or other malpractices, at the 
earliest opportunity and in an 
appropriate way.
Disabled persons
Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of 
members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort is made to ensure that their 
employment with the Group continues 
and that appropriate training is arranged.
Training and development
Employing the right people and 
encouraging the continuous development 
of the skills of our employees is critical to 
developing a successful business. The 
Company recruits graduate engineering 
trainees and provides them with a 
comprehensive six-month on-site training 
programme. This will ensure that, in keeping 
with the growth of the Company’s assets, 
adequate well trained and competent 
personnel are available for in-house 
operations and project development.
Supply chain
The Group works with a team of industry-
leading suppliers and contractors in order 
to mitigate the risk in the event of there 
being a product delay or a supplier failing. 
The Board recognises the particular risks 
posed to its supply chain by the prevailing 
global economic conditions and the 
potential impact should key suppliers fail. 
To mitigate these impacts, the Group 
monitors suppliers’ business continuity 
issues, providing such practical support 
and advice as may be appropriate.
The Company’s power generation plants 
are fuelled by coal sourced from India but 
also from imported coal from Indonesia. 
Availability of supplies is therefore less of 
an issue than prices, which can fluctuate

in line with world market forces of supply 
and demand.
Community
OPG respects the rights and acknowledge 
the aspirations and concerns of the 
communities in which it works. We 
recognise the importance of engaging with 
the local communities in which we operate. 
Promoting and respecting fundamental 
needs is at the heart of our values and 
business principles, and crucial to 
maintaining positive relations with local 
communities where we operate
OPG Outreach
OPG Outreach, launched in July 2011 near 
our Kutch site, has now completed four 
successful years and has been expanded 
to the Chennai site as well during 2013.
The first free primary healthcare centre 
that we built in 2013 at Sitha Raja Kandigai 
(the nearest village to our Chennai site), is 
running successfully, handling 40 patients 
on an average per day. The centre is 
serving the medical requirements of the 
residents of five nearby villages.
The second healthcare centre is under 
development at the Periya Obulapuram 
village, also near the Chennai site. OPG is 
confident that both these centres and their 
associated facilities will provide much 
needed basic care and medical aid to the 
communities around the OPG power plant.
In collaboration with Rotary Club of 
Chennai (an NGO), we have organised 
distribution of tricycles and hearing aids.
Rural infrastructure development
In continuation to our community 
development efforts, our Gujarat team 
has distributed cattle feed and provided 
assistance in building Gowshalas (cow 
shelters), water storage tanks in nearby 
villages of Kutch district, Gujarat.
On request of the people of Kayalar Medu 
village, Gummidipoondi, we have assisted 
in patchwork repair of the pothole-ridden 
roads in the village. The construction of 
a prayer hall/church, which we started last 
year is steel roofed and is expected to be 
completed shortly.
Educational aid
OPG believes that education and 
employment will provide opportunities for 
people and communities to develop and 
prosper, thus increasing their standard 
of living.
We continue to sponsor education of 
children from local communities studying in 
various Government schools. As a yearly 
concern, 850 school children belonging to 
the villages Periya Obulapuram, Chinna 
Obulapuram, Kayalarmedu, SR Kandigai 
received full school supplies (uniforms, 
shoes, books, bags, etc.) for the entire year 
before the commencement of the school 
year. About 56 students from below 
poverty line families are also granted 
annual school/college fees to ensure 
that lack of funds does not preclude 
their advancement.
As part of OPG Outreach, a strong 
awareness programme has been 
developed to promote girl child education. 
To support this, the Company started a 
sponsorship programme last year in higher 
secondary education at a reputed private 
school. Under this scheme, three girls will 
be selected every year based on academic 
background and economic needs, and 
their entire education will be funded by 
OPG Outreach.
OPG has also sponsored monthly salaries 
to PTA teachers in four Government 
schools situated in the vicinity of the plant. 
This programme is intended to provide 
support to Government owned schools in

this committee will be considered further. 
 
5. Evaluation (B.6) 
The Board will continue to evaluate 
informally the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge required to 
ensure that its composition is appropriate 
to the Group’s size and complexity. At 
the appropriate time, the Board will give 
further consideration to the issue of 
formally evaluating its performance and 
that of its principal committees and the 
individual Directors. 
Operation of the Board
Board of Directors
The Board comprises the following 
individuals:
Executive
1. Arvind Gupta (Managing Director and 
Chief Executive Officer); and
2. V Narayan Swami (Finance Director).
Non-executive
1. M C Gupta (Non-executive Chairman);
2. Martin Gatto (Senior Independent

The Board considers that, as at the date 
of this report, it complies with Code 
provision B.1.2, which requires that, in 
the case of smaller companies, there 
should be a minimum of two independent 
Non-executive Directors. In addition to the 
Chairman, Mike Grasby and Martin Gatto 
are considered to be independent under 
the Code.
Biographical details of all the Directors 
at the date of this report are set out on 
page 35 together with details of their 
membership, as appropriate, of the Board 
Committees. The Board is responsible 
for setting the Company’s objectives and 
policies, and providing effective leadership 
and the controls required for a publicly 
listed company. Directors receive papers 
for their consideration in advance of each 
Board meeting, including reports on the 
Group’s operations to ensure that they 
remain briefed on the latest developments 
and are able to make fully informed 
decisions. The Board met four times during 
the year under review. 
The Executive Committee supports 
the Board in implementing strategy and 
reports relevant matters to the Board for its 
consideration and approval. The Executive 
Committee (‘ExCo’) is composed of the 
two Executive Directors and four members 
of senior management. It met eight times 
during the year.
Directors have the right to request that any 
concerns they have are recorded in the 
appropriate committee or Board minutes. 
Informal procedures are in place for 
Directors to take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense.
The Company maintains Directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance and 
indemnity cover, the level of which 
is reviewed annually.
Introduction
The Board is committed to good corporate 
governance practices. The Company 
was admitted to trading on AIM in May 
2008. Accordingly, compliance with the 
governance framework contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code published 
by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the 
Code’) is not mandatory. Nevertheless, 
the Company remains committed to high 
standards of corporate governance and 
endeavours to comply with the Code to the 
extent practicable for a public company of 
its size.
This report describes how the Company 
has applied, or how it intends to apply, 
the principles set out in the Code. 
Compliance with the Code
Since admission to AIM, the Group has 
grown substantially against a background 
of difficult trading conditions within the 
electricity generation sector. As reported 
in the Strategic Report, the year has seen 
the Group complete its two major projects 
of 480 MW and a total of 750 MW now 
fully constructed, trebling the scale and 
achieving diversification and with the 
270 MW operations delivering a robust 
performance. The primary focus of the 
Board is to ensure sustainability of existing 
operations and to pursue its profitability 
focused growth strategy and the Board 
has therefore adopted an approach to 
governance that is proportionate and 
commensurate with the current size and 
complexity of the Group. The Board notes 
the following areas of non-compliance 
with the Code with comments on each 
as appropriate:
1. Schedule of matters reserved (A.1.1)
 At present, the Board reviews and adopts 
the Group’s strategy, plan and key risks, 
policies and procedures. The Board will 
at the appropriate time adopt a schedule 
of matters specifically reserved to it 
for decision. 
2. Division of responsibilities (A.2.1)
As explained in greater detail on page 37, 
there is a clear separation between the 
roles and responsibilities of the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer. The Code 
further requires that this be set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board and this is 
to be done in due course.

Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Senior Independent Director
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by different individuals and there is a clear separation of roles. 
The Chairman’s key responsibilities are the effective running of the Board, ensuring that the Board plays a full and constructive 
part in the development and determination of the Group’s strategy and overseeing the Board’s decision-making process. The key 
responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer are managing the Group’s business, proposing and developing the Group’s strategy and 
overall commercial objectives in consultation with the Board and, as leader of the executive team, implementing the decisions of the 
Board and its Committees. 
Martin Gatto, the Senior Independent Director, is available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be resolved through 
discussion with the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman.
Re-election of Directors
At every AGM, one-third of the Directors for the time being (excluding any Director appointed since the previous AGM) or, if their number 
is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third, shall retire from office by rotation. On this basis, Martin Gatto and  
Mike Grasby will offer themselves for re-election at the AGM.
Information and professional development
Prior to the Company’s admission to AIM in May 2008, all Directors received a briefing from the Company’s nominated adviser of their 
duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of an AIM company. Directors are encouraged to keep abreast of developments to 
assist them with their duties. 
In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the Chairman is available to the other Non-executive Directors to discuss any issues of 
concern they may have relating to the Group or as regards their area of responsibility and to keep them fully briefed on ongoing matters 
relating to the Group’s operations.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that new Directors each receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board as 
required by provision B.4.1 of the Code.
Board performance 
As noted above, the Board will in due course consider the most appropriate methodology for evaluating its performance and that of its 
principal Committees and the individual Directors.
Meetings of the Board and its Committees

Board Committees
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are 
M C Gupta, Martin Gatto, Mike Grasby and 
Ravi Gupta. Martin Gatto is considered to 
have recent, relevant financial experience. 
The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
and a representative of the auditor are 
normally invited to attend meetings of 
the Committee.
The primary duty of the Audit Committee 
is to oversee the accounting and financial 
reporting process of the Group, the 
external audit arrangements, the internal 
accounting standards and practice, the 
independence of the external auditor, the 
integrity of the Group’s external financial 
reports and the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control system. 
The Audit Committee considered 
the following matters during the year 
under review:
• The Annual Report and Accounts for 
the year ended 31 March 2014; and
• The unaudited results for the half-year 
FY15 to 30 September 2014.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee currently 
consists of M C Gupta, Martin Gatto, Mike 
Grasby and Ravi Gupta. Ravi Gupta is not 
present when any remuneration matter 
relating to the Chief Executive, Arvind 
Gupta (his brother) is discussed. 
The primary duty of the Remuneration 
Committee is to determine and agree with 
the Board the framework or broad policy 
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and such other members of 
the executive management team of 
the Group as is deemed appropriate. 
The remuneration of the Non-executive 
Directors is a matter for the executive 
members of the Board. No Director may 
be involved in any decisions as to his 
own remuneration.
Full details of the role and composition 
of the Remuneration Committee, the 
remuneration policy of the Company and 
its compliance with the Code provisions 
relating to remuneration are set out in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 39 to 41.
Accountability and audit
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s system of internal control, which 
includes risk management. The Board has 
delegated the responsibility for reviewing 
the effectiveness of its internal control 
systems to the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee reviews these systems, policies 
and processes for tendering, authorisation 
of expenditure, fraud and the internal 
audit plan.
The system of internal control is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board has instructed ExCo to be 
a leading part of its process to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant 
risks the Group faces and which is in 
accordance with the current guidance on 
internal control. The Audit Committee will 
assist the Board in discharging its review 
responsibilities. A summary of the key risks 
facing the Group and mitigating actions is 
described on pages 22 and 23.
Assurance
Grant Thornton has been auditor for 
the Group for the last five years. The 
Committee considers that, at this early 
stage in the Group’s development, it is 
more efficient to use a single audit firm 
to provide certain non-audit services for 
transactions and tax matters. However, to 
regulate the position, the Committee will at 
the appropriate time establish a policy on 
the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor. That policy will set out the 
external auditor’s permitted and prohibited 
non-audit services and a fee threshold 
requiring prior approval by the Audit 
Committee for any new engagement.
Going concern 
A statement on the Directors’ position 
regarding the Company as going concern 
is contained in the Directors’ Report on 
page 42.
Shareholder relations and the Annual 
General Meeting
The Board is committed to maintaining an 
ongoing dialogue with its shareholders. 
The Directors are keen to build a mutual 
understanding of objectives with its principal 
shareholders. To this end, the Chief 
Executive, Senior Independent Director 
and Finance Director together met with a 
number of institutional shareholders during 
the year. The Directors also encourage 
communications with private shareholders 
and encourages their participation in the 
Annual General Meeting.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for 
ensuring the effective communication of 
shareholders’ views to the Board as a 
whole and updates the Board accordingly. 
Board members keep abreast of 
shareholder opinion. 
Notice of the Annual General Meeting will 
be sent to shareholders at least 21 clear 
days before the meeting. The voting results 
will be made available on the Company’s 
website following the meeting.
The Company uses its corporate website 
(www.opgpower.com) to communicate 
with its institutional shareholders and 
private investors, and posts the latest 
announcements, press releases and 
published financial information together 
with updates on current projects and 
other information about the Group.

Introduction
This report sets out information about 
the remuneration of the Directors of the 
Company for the year ended 31 March 
2015. As a Company admitted to AIM, 
OPG is not required to prepare a Directors’ 
remuneration report. However, the Board 
supports the principles of transparency 
and has prepared this report in order to 
provide information to shareholders on 
executive remuneration arrangements. 
The report has been substantially prepared 
in accordance with Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Group Accounts and Reports 2008 
(‘the Regulations’).
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration 
Committee are M C Gupta (Chairman), 
Martin Gatto, Ravi Gupta and Mike Grasby 
who, with the exception of Ravi Gupta, are 
all independent Non-executive Directors. 
Terms of Reference have been approved 
for the Remuneration Committee and its 
primary duty is to determine and agree 
with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, senior managers and such other 
members of the executive management 
team of the Group as is deemed 
appropriate. The remuneration of the 
Non-executive Directors is a matter for 
the Chairman and the Committee to 
be considered on the basis of the 
recommendations of the executive 
members of the Board. 
The principal responsibilities of the 
Committee include:
• Assessing and setting compensation 
levels for Directors and senior managers;
• Reviewing the ongoing appropriateness 
and relevance of the remuneration policy 
to ensure that members of the executive 
team are provided with incentives that 
encourage enhanced performance;
• Reviewing the design of share incentive 
plans for the approval of the Board; and
• Ensuring that contractual terms on 
termination are such that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate 
losses is fully recognised in the drafting 
of Directors’ service agreements and 
letters of appointment. 
In fulfilling these duties, the Committee 
shall be cognisant of remuneration trends 
across the Group and within the sector in 
which the Group operates.
The Executive Directors and external 
advisers may be invited to attend meetings 
of the Remuneration Committee but do 
not take part in the decision making. 
Attendance at meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee by individual 
members is detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 37.
Advisers
During the year, the Board received 
externally commissioned advice in 
connection with implementing a long term 
incentive plan for executives to meet the 
Group’s objective of providing an incentive 
plan in the context of the Group’s overall 
approach to rewards and incentives. 
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee seeks to 
maintain a remuneration policy to ensure 
that the Company is able to attract, retain 
and motivate its Executive Directors and 
senior management. 
The retention of key management and the 
alignment of management incentives with 
the creation of shareholder value are key 
objectives of this policy. 
The Group therefore sets out to provide 
competitive remuneration for all its 
management and employees appropriate 
to the business environment in the market 
in which it operates and in recognition of 
their contribution to Group performance. 
To achieve this, the remuneration package 
is based upon the following principles:
• Total rewards should be set to provide a 
fair and attractive remuneration package;
• Appropriate elements of the 
remuneration package should be 
designed to reinforce the link between 
performance and contribution to the 
Group’s success and reward; and
• Executive Directors’ incentives 
should be aligned with the interests 
of shareholders. 
The remuneration strategy is designed to 
be in line with the Group’s fundamental 
values of fairness, competitiveness and 
equity and also to support the Group’s 
corporate strategy. The Group seeks 
to increasingly align the interests of 
shareholders with those of Directors 
and senior employees by giving the latter 
opportunities and encouragement to build 
up a shareholding interest in the Company. 
Stock Option Plan – 2009
During the year, under the Stock Option 
Plan approved by the Board on 16 July 
2009. Awards of 250,000 options 
were approved for each of M C Gupta, 
Mike Grasby, Ravi Gupta and V Narayan 
Swami in addition to the awards granted 
previously to the remaining two Directors. 
These awards are in terms of the 
commitments made in the IPO Admission 
Document. The Option contracts approved 
during the year for the four Directors 
named above will be executed in the 
current (2015–16) financial year. Options 
granted must be exercised within 10 years 
of the date of grant and vesting depends 
on achievement of the following 
performance conditions:
1. The power plant at Kutch in the state of 
Gujarat must have been in commercial 
operation for three months; and
2. The closing share price must be at least 
£1 for three consecutive business days.
Long Term Incentive Plan – 2015
In June 2015, the Company announced 
its plan to introduce its first Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’). Vesting of awards 
under the LTIP will be subject to the 
following shareholder value based 
performance targets:
1. Achievement of a share price of 
130 pence;
2. Achievement of a further 250 MW 
growth in installed capacity from a 
base of 750 MW; and
3. A cumulative total of 3 pence in ordinary 
dividends paid or declared between 
now and publication of the FY18  
Annual Report.
Up to 16 million shares in the Company  
will be awarded at their nominal value 
to certain members of the senior 
management team, including about 
14 million shares to Gita Investments 
Limited, a company linked to the CEO. 
Subject to certain covenants, the awards, 
once made, will vest over the period to 
FY18 with a third of the maximum award 
vesting upon achievement of a share price 
of 130 pence and then equally on achieving 
each of the other targets. With certain 
exceptions, vested shares will not be 
allowed to be sold for one year. All vested 
shares are to be entitled to dividends. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to declare vesting of awards on a linear 
scale of performance but cannot raise 
maximum award levels. The metrics of the 
scheme have been established to support 
the Group’s strategy to deliver responsible 
and sustainable returns over the long term.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 
Service agreements, notice periods and termination payments
The service agreements for the Executive Directors are for no fixed term and may in normal circumstances be terminated on the notice 
periods set out in the table below. The Company reserves the right and discretion to pay the Executive Directors in lieu of notice. If the 
Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, the Company is required 
to make a payment equal to the aggregate of basic salary and the cost to the Company of providing other contractual benefits for the 
unexpired portion of the duration of any entitlement to notice.
The key terms of the Executive Directors’ service agreements are as follows:
Name Position Date of contract Notice period
Current
salary (p.a.)  
£
Arvind Gupta Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer 23 May 2008 Twelve months’ prior written notice  
on either side
406,463
V Narayan Swami Finance Director and Chief Financial Officer 23 May 2008 Three months’ prior written notice  
on either side
 73,163
Salaries
Mr Arvind Gupta’s salary was increased from approximately £250,000 to approximately £400,000 with effect from 1 April 2014. From the 
same effective date, Mr V Narayan Swami’s salary was increased from £52,143 to £73,163. These increases, which were the first since 
2012 and the second since admission to AIM in 2008, take into account median levels of salary in comparable UK listed companies 
based on external advice commissioned by the Company in the context of the scaling up of its activities.
Bonus
No bonuses have previously been paid to the Executive Directors in connection with the period between AIM admission in May 2008 
and March 2013. Since this, as an interim measure pending the adoption and full implementation of an annual bonus plan during the 
current year with detailed performance metrics, the Remuneration Committee has decided that Mr Arvind Gupta should be entitled to 
a maximum annual bonus of twice annual salary, based on the performance and the growth of the Company from 20 MW to 270 MW by 
31 March 2014 and a further scale up to 600 MW by 31 March 2015. Accordingly, on account of the consistently profitable performance 
and transformational growth, outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 33, of the Company, the Remuneration Committee approved 
and paid a bonus of £500,000 to Mr Arvind Gupta in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014 and a bonus of £793,537 has been 
awarded in respect of the year ended 31 March 2015. 
In the case of Mr V Narayan Swami, the Remuneration Committee has approved an annual bonus of 33.33% of annual salary for the year 
ended 31 March 2015.
Benefits-in-kind
Under their service agreements, Mr Arvind Gupta and Mr V Narayan Swami are entitled to applicable medical, travel, insurance, 
accommodation and other allowances. 
Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. 
The Chairman does not currently participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor does any pension entitlement 
accrue. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a contract of employment with the Company. Each has instead 
entered into a contract for services with the Company.
Non-executive Directors’ contracts for services 
Non-executive Directors were appointed for an initial term of 12 months. M C Gupta, Martin Gatto, Mike Grasby and Ravi Gupta have 
each signed a contract for services with the Company. They were each appointed for an initial period of twelve months and, under the 
terms of their contracts for services, their appointments were renewable for a further period by mutual agreement, subject to re-election, 
when appropriate, by the Company in general meeting. A formal process for evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees 
and the individual Directors will be introduced in due course.
The key terms of the Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are as follows:

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Group 
and the Parent Company financial 
statements. The Directors are required 
to prepare financial statements for the 
Group in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
as adopted for use in the European 
Union and have also elected to prepare 
financial statements for the Company in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted for 
use in the European Union. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare such 
financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS and the Companies Act 2006.
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements present 
fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
and Company’s financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the fair presentation of 
the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the 
definitions and recognition criteria for 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses 
set out in the International Accounting 
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, 
a fair presentation will be achieved by 
compliance with all applicable International 
Financial Reporting Standards. Directors 
are also required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and 
apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements;
• Present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; and
• Provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with specific requirements 
in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the Group 
and of the Company, for safeguarding the 
assets, for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of the financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. OPG Power Ventures Plc

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF OPG POWER VENTURES PLC
We have audited the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements of 
OPG Power Ventures Plc for the year 
ended 31 March 2015 which comprise 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit or 
Loss and Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flow and the related notes. 
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ 
responsibilities statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements which give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 
and of its profit for the year then ended in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2015
(ALL AMOUNTS IN £, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)
1. Corporate information
1.1. Nature of operations
OPG Power Ventures Plc (‘the Company’ or ‘OPGPV’), and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ‘the Group’) are primarily engaged in 
the development, owning, operation and maintenance of private sector power projects in India. The electricity generated from the Group’s 
plants is sold principally to public sector undertakings and heavy industrial companies in India or in the short-term market. The business 
objective of the Group is to focus on the power generation business within India and thereby provide reliable, cost effective power to the 
industrial consumers and other users under the ‘open access’ provisions mandated by the Government of India.
1.2. Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) and their interpretations as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and the provisions of the Isle of Man, Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
1.3. General information
OPG Power Ventures Plc, a limited liability corporation, is the Group’s ultimate parent Company and is incorporated and domiciled in the 
Isle of Man. The address of the Company’s registered office, which is also the principal place of business, is IOMA House, Hope Street, 
Douglas, Isle of Man IM1 1AP. The Company’s equity shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) of the London 
Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015 were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 1 June 2015.
2. New and revised standards that are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (‘IFRS 10’)
IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and SIC 12 ‘Consolidation-Special Purpose 
Entities’. IFRS 10 revises the definition of control and provide extensive new guidance on its application. These new requirements have the 
potential to affect which of the Group’s investees are considered to be subsidiaries and therefore to change the scope of consolidation. 
The requirements on consolidation procedures, accounting for changes in non-controlling interests and accounting for loss of control of 
a subsidiary are unchanged.
Management has reviewed its control assessments in accordance with IFRS 10 and has concluded that there is no effect on the 
classification (as subsidiaries or otherwise) of any of the Group’s investees held during the period or comparative periods covered by 
these financial statements.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ (‘IFRS 11’)
IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ (IAS 31) and SIC 13 ‘Jointly Controlled Entities – Non-Monetary-Contributions by 
Venturers’. IFRS 11 revises the categories of joint arrangement, and the criteria for classification into the categories, with the objective of 
more closely aligning the accounting with the investor’s rights and obligations relating to the arrangement. In addition, IAS 31’s option of 
using proportionate consolidation for arrangements classified as jointly controlled entities under that Standard has been eliminated. 
IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity method for arrangements classified as joint ventures. 
Management has reviewed its control assessments in accordance with IFRS 11 and has concluded that there is no effect on the 
classification of any of the Group’s investees held during the period or comparative periods covered by these financial statements. 
The new joint venture arrangement entered into in the year has been classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11 and accounted 
for accordingly. 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ (‘IFRS 12’)
IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements for various types of investments, including unconsolidated 
structured entities. It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity is exposed from its involvement with 
structured entities.
Management has reviewed the impact of IFRS 12 and has concluded that there is no effect on any of the Group’s investees held during 
the period or comparative periods covered by these financial statements.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (‘IFRS 13’)
IFRS 13 clarifies the definition of fair value and provides related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. It 
does not affect which items are required to be fair-valued. The scope of IFRS 13 is broad and it applies for both financial and non-financial 
items for which other IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements except in certain 
circumstances. IFRS 13 applies prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. Its disclosure requirements need 
not be applied to comparative information in the first year of application. The Group has however included as comparative information the 
IFRS 13 disclosures that were required previously by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The Group has applied IFRS 13 for the 
first time in the current year, see note 27. OPG Power Ventures Plc

2. New and revised standards that are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 continued
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ 
The Group has applied IFRIC 21 Levies for the first time in the current period. IFRIC 21 addresses the issue as to when to recognise a 
liability to pay a levy imposed by a government. The interpretation defines a levy, and specifies that the obligating event that gives rise to 
the liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by legislation. The interpretation provides guidance on how 
different levy arrangements should be accounted for in particular, it clarifies that neither economic compulsion nor the going concern 
basis of financial statements preparations implies that an entity has present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in 
a future period.
IFRIC 21 has been applied retrospectively. The application of this interpretation has had no material impact on disclosures or on the 
amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
2.1. Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not effective and have not been early 
adopted by the Group
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group. 
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. Certain other new standards and interpretations have been 
issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
Standard or interpretation Effective for in reporting periods starting on or after
Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
The management does not expect to implement IFRS 9 until all of its chapters have been published and it can comprehensively assess 
the impact of all changes.
The management does not expect the application of the other standards to have any material impact on its financial statements when 
those Standards become effective. The Group does not intend to apply any of these pronouncements early.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
3.1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for financial assets and liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value.
The financial statements have been prepared on going concern basis which assumes the Group will have sufficient funds to continue its 
operational existence for the foreseeable future covering at least 12 months. As the Group has forecast it will be able to meet its debt 
facility interest and repayment obligations, and that sufficient funds will be available to continue with the projects development, the 
assumption that these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis is appropriate.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and have been 
presented in Pound Sterling (‘£’), the functional and presentation currency of the Company.
3.2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the assets liabilities and results of the operation of the Company, subsidiaries and joint 
venture for the year ended 31 March 2015.
A subsidiary is defined as an entity controlled by the Company. The parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which effective control is acquired by the Group, 
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 March and use 
consistent accounting policies adopted by the Group.
All intra-Group balances pertaining to subsidiaries, income and expenses and any resulting unrealised gains arising from intra-Group 
transactions are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group and is presented separately in 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately 
from parent shareholders’ equity. Acquisitions of additional stake or dilution of stake from/to non-controlling interests/other venturer in the 
Group where there is no loss of control are accounted for as an equity transaction, whereby, the difference between the consideration 
paid or received and the book value of the share of the net assets is recognised in ‘other reserve’ within statement of changes in equity.  OPG Power Ventures Plc

Padma Shipping Ltd (‘PSL ’) OPGPV Hong Kong 50 – 50 –
1 The Company has entered into a joint venture agreement with Noble Chartering Ltd (‘Noble’), to secure competitive long-term rates for international freight for its imported 
coal requirements. Under the Long Term Freight Arrangement (‘LTFA’), the Company and Noble are to purchase and own, jointly and equally, two 64,000 Mt cargo vessels 
through a joint venture company Padma Shipping Ltd, Hong Kong (‘Padma’). The Company will commit to provide 1.5 Mt of coal per annum for carriage by the two vessels 
for a minimum period of 10 years at competitive long-term rates. Pursuant to this agreement, Padma Shipping Ltd has been incorporated in order to execute the joint 
arrangement for procuring two cargo ships of 64,000 Mt capacity from Cosco Shipyard, Hong Kong which are expected to be delivered by 2017. The Company and Noble 
are to invest approximately US$9m over the period of delivery of the vessels as their equity contribution thereby and during the current period, the Company has paid an 
advance of US$2,801,700. Accordingly the joint venture has been reported using equity method as per the requirements of IFRS 11. 
3.4. Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of the Company is the Pound Sterling (‘£’). The Cyprus entity is an extension of the parent and pass through 
investment entity. Accordingly the functional currency of the subsidiary in Cyprus is the Pound Sterling. The functional currency of the 
Company’s subsidiaries operating in India, determined based on evaluation of the individual and collective economic factors is Indian 
Rupees (‘INR’). The presentation currency of the Group is the Pound Sterling (‘£’) as submitted to the AIM counter of the London Stock 
Exchange where the shares of the Company are listed.
At the reporting date the assets and liabilities of the Group are translated into the presentation currency at the rate of exchange prevailing 
at the reporting date, and the income and expense for each statement of profit or loss are translated at the average exchange rate (unless 
this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expense are translated at the rate on the date of the transactions). Exchange differences are charged/credited to other 
comprehensive income and recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Statement of financial position date are translated into functional currency at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Aggregate gains and losses resulting from foreign currencies are included in finance income or 
costs within the profit or loss. 
Indian Rupee (‘INR’) exchange rates used to translate the INR financial information into the presentation currency of Pound Sterling (‘£’) 
are the closing rate as at 31 March 2015: 92.76 (2014: 99.42) and the average rate for the year ended 31 March 2015: 98.41 (2014: 95.89).
3.5. Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, 
and revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in accordance 
with the relevant agreements, net of discounts, rebates and other applicable taxes and duties.
Sale of electricity
Revenue from the sale of electricity is recognised when earned on the basis of contractual arrangement with the customers and reflects 
the value of units supplied including an estimated value of units supplied to the customers between the date of their last meter reading 
and the reporting date. OPG Power Ventures Plc

Financial Statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Interest and dividend
Revenue from interest is recognised as interest accrued (using the effective interest rate method). Revenue from dividends is recognised 
when the right to receive the payment is established.
3.6. Operating expenses
Operating expenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss upon utilisation of the service or as incurred. Expenditure for 
warranties is recognised when the Group incurs an obligation in that regard.
3.7. Taxes
Tax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. 
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, taxation authorities relating to the current or 
prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on taxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in 
the financial statements. 
Calculation of current tax is based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the 
reporting period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting profit. Deferred tax on temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the 
Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of 
realisation, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are always 
provided for in full. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be utilised against future taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Group has a right and the intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities 
from the same taxation authority. Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax income or expense in 
profit or loss, except where they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the 
related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively. 
3.8. Financial assets
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of any financial 
instrument and are measured initially at fair value adjusted by transactions costs, except for those carried at fair value through profit or 
loss which are measured initially at fair value. 
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial 
asset and all substantial risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, 
cancelled or expires.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories upon initial recognition: 
• Loans and receivables
• Available-for-sale financial assets. 
The category determines subsequent measurement and whether any resulting income and expense is recognised in profit or loss or in 
other comprehensive income. 
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets except for assets having maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date. These are 
classified as non-current assets. After initial recognition these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less 
provision for impairment. Discounting is omitted where the effect of discounting is immaterial. The Group’s cash and cash equivalents, 
trade and most other receivables fall into this category of financial instruments. 
Individually significant receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received 
that a specific counterparty will default. Receivables that are not considered to be individually impaired are reviewed for impairment 
in groups, which are determined by reference to the industry and region of a counterparty and other shared credit risk characteristics. 
The impairment loss estimate is then based on recent historical counterparty default rates for each identified group.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for 
inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets include mutual funds and equity 
instruments. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the 
reporting date. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and reported within the available-for-sale reserve in equity, except for impairment losses and foreign exchange differences on 
monetary assets, which are recognised in profit or loss. When the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired the cumulative 
gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from the equity reserve to profit or loss and presented as a 
reclassification adjustment within other comprehensive income. The fair value of the mutual fund units is based on the net asset value 
publicly made available by the respective mutual fund manager.
Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for financial assets that are debt securities which 
are recognised in profit or loss only if the reversal can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
3.9. Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables. Financial liabilities are measured subsequently at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All interest-related charges and, if applicable, changes in an instrument’s fair value that are reported in profit or loss are included within 
‘finance costs’ or ‘finance income’.
3.10. Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market 
prices at the close of business on the Statement of Financial Position date. For financial instruments where there is no active market, fair 
value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference 
to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
3.11. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Historical cost 
includes expenditure that is directly attributable to property plant and equipment such as employee cost, borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects etc, if recognition criteria are met. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its costs are recognised in the 
carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance 
costs are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on all other assets is computed on straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset based on 
management’s estimate as follows:
Nature of asset Useful life (years)
Buildings 40
Power stations 40
Other plant and equipment 3–10
Vehicles 5–11
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until commissioned.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use 
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
The assets residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted 
prospectively if appropriate.
3.12. Intangible assets
Acquired software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and install the specific software.
Subsequent measurement
All intangible assets, including software are accounted for using the cost model whereby capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their estimated useful lives, as these assets are considered finite. Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each 
reporting date. The useful life of software is estimated as four years. OPG Power Ventures Plc

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
3.13. Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date and 
whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to use 
the asset.
Group as a lessee
Contracts to lease assets are classified as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset 
to the Group. Leases where the Group does not acquire substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. 
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease of land is 
classified separately and is amortised over the period of the lease.
3.14. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, that necessarily take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. Interest income earned on the temporary 
investment of specific borrowing pending its expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the costs of these assets. 
Gains and losses on extinguishment of liability, including those arising from substantial modification from terms of loans are not treated as 
borrowing costs and are charged to profit or loss. 
All other borrowing costs including transaction costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are 
incurred, the amount being determined using the effective interest rate method.
3.15. Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (‘CGU’) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for 
an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Groups 
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation 
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or 
CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying 
amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.
3.16. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the Statement of Financial Position includes cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits with original 
maturity period of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits. Restricted 
cash represents deposits which are subject to a fixed charge and held as security for specific borrowings and are not included in cash 
and cash equivalents. 
3.17. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
condition is accounted based on weighted average price. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less estimated selling expenses.
3.18. Earnings per share
The earnings considered in ascertaining the Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) comprise the net profit for the year attributable to 
ordinary equity holders of the parent. The number of shares used for computing the basic EPS is the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted EPS the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential 
equity share.

3.19. Other provisions and contingent liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when present obligations as a result of a past event will probably lead to an outflow of economic resources 
from the Group and amounts can be estimated reliably. Timing or amount of the outflow may still be uncertain. A present obligation arises 
from the presence of a legal or constructive obligation that has resulted from past events. Restructuring provisions are recognised only if 
a detailed formal plan for the restructuring has been developed and implemented, or management has at least announced the plan’s 
main features to those affected by it. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
Provisions are measured at the estimated expenditure required to settle the present obligation, based on the most reliable evidence 
available at the reporting date, including the risks and uncertainties associated with the present obligation. Where there are a number of 
similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a 
whole. Provisions are discounted to their present values, where the time value of money is material. 
Any reimbursement that the Group can be virtually certain to collect from a third party with respect to the obligation is recognised as a 
separate asset. However, this asset may not exceed the amount of the related provision. All provisions are reviewed at each reporting 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 
In those cases where the possible outflow of economic resources as a result of present obligations is considered improbable or remote, 
no liability is recognised, unless it was assumed in the course of a business combination. In a business combination, contingent liabilities 
are recognised on the acquisition date when there is a present obligation that arises from past events and the fair value can be measured 
reliably, even if the outflow of economic resources is not probable. They are subsequently measured at the higher amount of a 
comparable provision as described above and the amount recognised on the acquisition date, less any amortisation. 
3.20. Share-based payments
The Group operates equity-settled share-based remuneration plans for its employees. None of the Group’s plans feature any options for 
a cash settlement. 
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values. Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services is determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of 
the equity instruments granted. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions 
(for example profitability and sales growth targets and performance conditions). 
All share-based remuneration is ultimately recognised as an expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit to ‘other reserves’.
If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate 
of the number of share options expected to vest. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the number of share 
options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period. 
No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to that estimated 
on vesting. 
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs up to the nominal value of the 
shares issued are allocated to share capital with any excess being recorded as share premium. 
3.21. Employee benefits 
Gratuity 
In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (‘the Gratuity Plan’) covering 
eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination 
of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment.
Liabilities with regard to the gratuity plan are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an independent actuary, at each Statement 
of Financial Position date using the projected unit credit method.
The Group recognises the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Statement of Financial Position as an asset or liability, respectively 
in accordance with IAS 19, Employee benefits. The discount rate is based on the Government securities yield. Actuarial gains and losses 
arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to profit or loss in the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Employees Benefit Trust
Effective during the previous year, the Group has established an Employees Benefit Trust (hereinafter ‘the EBT’) for investments in the 
Company’s shares for employee benefit schemes. IOMA Fiduciary in the Isle of Man have been appointed as Trustees of the EBT with full 
discretion invested in the Trustee, independent of the Company, in the matter of share purchases. As at present, no investments have 
been made by the Trustee nor any funds advanced by the Company to the EBT. The Company is yet to formulate any employee benefit 
schemes or to make awards thereunder. OPG Power Ventures Plc

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
3.22. Business combinations
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder that controls the Group 
are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or, if later, at the date 
that common control was established using pooling of interest method. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying 
amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the 
acquired entities are added to the same components within Group equity. Any excess consideration paid is directly recognised in equity.
4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the consolidated financial statements are as set out above. The application of a 
number of these policies requires the Group to use a variety of estimation techniques and apply judgement to best reflect the substance 
of underlying transactions.
The Group has determined that a number of its accounting policies can be considered significant, in terms of the management 
judgement that has been required to determine the various assumptions underpinning their application in the consolidated financial 
statements presented which, under different conditions, could lead to material differences in these statements. The actual results may 
differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the management and will seldom equal the estimated results.
The following are significant management judgements in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most significant 
effect on the financial statements.
• Deferred tax assets
The assessment of the probability of future taxable income in which deferred tax assets can be utilised is based on the Group’s latest 
approved budget forecast, which is adjusted for significant non-taxable income and expenses and specific limits to the use of any unused 
tax loss or credit. The tax rules in India in which the Group operates are also carefully taken into consideration. If a positive forecast of 
taxable income indicates the probable use of a deferred tax asset, especially when it can be utilised without a time limit, that deferred tax 
asset is usually recognised in full. The recognition of deferred tax assets that are subject to certain legal or economic limits or 
uncertainties is assessed individually by management based on the specific facts and circumstances (refer note 10).
• Application of lease accounting 
Significant judgement is required to apply lease accounting rules under IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease 
and IAS 17 Leases. In assessing the applicability to arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised judgement to 
evaluate customer’s right to use the underlying assets, substance of the transaction including legally enforced arrangements and other 
significant terms and conditions of the arrangement to conclude whether the arrangements meet the criteria under IFRIC 4.
Estimates and uncertainties
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date, 
that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year 
are discussed below:
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets: The recognition of deferred tax assets requires assessment of future taxable profit (see note 3.7).
• Estimation of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities: While preparing the financial statements the Group makes estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
 − Available-for-sale financial assets: Management apply valuation techniques to determine the fair value of available-for-sale financial 
assets where active market quotes are not available. This requires management to develop estimates and assumptions based on 
market inputs, using observable data that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Where such data is not observable, 
management uses its best estimate. Estimated fair values of the asset may vary from the actual prices that would be achieved in an 
arm’s length transaction at the reporting date;
 − Other financial liabilities: Borrowings held by the Group are measured at amortised cost. Further, liabilities associated with financial 
guarantee contracts in the Company financial statements are initially measured at fair value and remeasured at each Statement of 
Financial Position date (see note 3.9 and note 26); and
 − Impairment tests: In assessing impairment, management estimates the recoverable amount of each asset or CGUs based on 
expected future cash flows and use an interest rate for discounting them. Estimation uncertainty relates to assumptions about 
future operating results and the determination of a suitable discount rate; and
• Useful life of depreciable assets: Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date, 
based on the expected utility of the assets.

5. Segment reporting
The Group has adopted the ‘management approach’ in identifying the operating segments as outlined in IFRS 8 – Operating segments. 
Segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating 
decision maker evaluates the Group’s performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators at 
operating segment level. Accordingly, there is only a single operating segment ‘generation and sale of electricity’. The accounting policies 
used by the Group for segment reporting are the same as those used for consolidated financial statements. There are no geographical 
segments as all revenues arise from India.
Revenue on account of sale of power to one party amounts to £82,182,445 (2014: £94,016,799).

Deferred tax 1,512,742 708,780
Tax expense reported in the statement of comprehensive income 4,360,769 3,385,087
The Company is subject to Isle of Man corporate tax at the standard rate of zero percent. As such, the Company’s tax liability is zero. 
Additionally, the Isle of Man does not levy tax on capital gains. However, considering that the Group’s operations are entirely based in 
India, the effective tax rate of the Group has been computed based on the current tax rates prevailing in India. Further, a substantial 
portion of the profits of the Group’s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits attributable to generation of 
power in India. Under the tax holiday the taxpayer can utilise an exemption from income taxes for a period of any 10 consecutive years 
out of a total of 15 consecutive years from the date of commencement of the operations.
The Group is subject to the provisions of Minimum Alternate Tax (‘MAT’) under the Indian Income taxes for the year ended 31 March 2015 
and 2014. Accordingly, the Group calculated the tax liability for current taxes in India after considering MAT.

(990,316) (708,780) – 189,243 (1,509,853)
In assessing the recoverability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion 
or all of the deferred income tax assets will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The amount of the 
deferred income tax assets considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income 
during the carry forward period are reduced.
Shareholders resident outside the Isle of Man will not suffer any income tax in the Isle of Man on any income distributions to them. 
Further, dividends are not taxable in India in the hands of the recipient. However, the Group will be subject to a ‘dividend distribution tax’ 
currently at the rate of 15% (plus applicable surcharge and education cess) on the total amount distributed as dividend.
As at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, there was no recognised deferred tax liability for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted 
earnings of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries, as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be 
distributed in the foreseeable future. OPG Power Ventures Plc

The Company has issued share capital at par value of £51,671 (£0.000147 per share).
Reserves
Share premium represents the amount received by the Group over and above the par value of shares issued and the excess of the fair 
value of share issued in business combination over the par value of such shares. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of 
shares are deducted from securities premium, net of any related income tax benefits. 
Foreign currency translation reserve is used to record the exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
the foreign subsidiaries.
Other reserve represents the difference between the consideration paid and the adjustment to net assets on change of controlling 
interest, without change in control, other reserves also includes any costs related with share options granted and gain/losses on  
remeasurement of available-for-sale financial assets.
Retained earnings include all current and prior period results as disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income less dividend distribution. 
18. Share-based payments
The Board has granted share options to Directors and nominees of Directors which are limited to 10% of the Group’s share capital. 
Once granted, the share must be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant otherwise the options would lapse.
The vesting conditions are as follows:
• The 300 MW power plant of Kutch in the state of Gujarat must have been in commercial operation for three months.
• The closing share price being at least £1.00 for consecutive three business days.
The related expense has been amortised over the estimated vesting period of 4.96 years (expected completion of the Kutch plant) and 
an expense amounting to £242,888 (2014: £974,222) was recognised in the profit or loss with a corresponding credit to other reserves.

The weighted average price fair value of options granted in 2010–11 was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model was 
£0.28 per option. The significant inputs into the model were weighted average share price of £0.66 (2011) at the grant date, exercise 
price of £0.60, volatility of 31.34% dividend yield of nil, an expected option life of 4.96 years and annual risk free rate of 3%. The volatility 
measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on daily share prices of the last three years.

Term loans contain certain covenants stipulated by the facility providers and primarily require the Group to maintain specified levels of 
certain financial metrics and operating results. The terms of the other borrowings arrangements also contain certain covenants primarily 
requiring the Group to maintain certain financial metrics. As of 31 March 2015, the Group has met all the relevant covenants.

The fair value of borrowings at 31 March 2015 was £260,788,187 (2014: £194,769,946). The fair values have been calculated by 
discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.

provided on actuarial basis for the companies in the Group, the amount pertaining to the Directors is not individually ascertainable and 
therefore not included above.
24. Business combination within the Group without loss of control
As per the original structure of the Group, two Cypriot subsidiaries of OPGPV, namely GEPL and GHPL, held the investments in the 
equity of the Group’s Special Purpose Vehicles (‘SPV’) in India. During the year ended 31 March 2013, the management decided to 
interpose an Indian holding Company, GPIPL in the structure and warehouse the SPV investments in GPIPL. Accordingly, the 
shareholders of GEPL, GHPL and GPIPL had entered into a scheme of arrangement to effect the above restructuring of the Group. As 
part of the regulatory requirements in India, the Group had applied and obtained approval from the High Court of Madras on 28 October 
2011 subject to fulfilment of certain conditions including approval of relevant regulatory authorities, allotment of shares etc. The scheme 
had been consummated with effect from 25 January 2013 upon issue of shares to the shareholders of GEPL and GHPL, namely CHL and 
the assets and liabilities of GEPL and GHPL have been taken over by GPIPL. Consequent to the scheme of arrangement, the Group also 
has gained 100% economic interest over GPIPL by virtue of an agreement entered into with the minority shareholders of GPIPL dated 
1 April 2012. The liquidation process of GEPL and GHPL is in progress as at year end and the management expects the same to be 
complete by the end of 2015. 
The above arrangement has been considered as a business combination involving companies under the Group and has been accounted 
at the date that common control was established using pooling of interest method. The assets and liabilities transferred are recognised 
at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components 
of equity of the acquired entities are added to the same components within Group equity. There was no excess consideration paid in 
this transaction.

25. Commitments and contingencies
Operating lease commitments

Total 622,925 608,955
During the year ended 31 March 2015, £28,054 (2014: £28,791) was recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income 
in respect of operating leases.
Capital commitments
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group entered into a contract to purchase property, plant and equipment for £3,256,530 
(2014: £17,821,218) for its power generation projects under development. In respect of its interest in joint ventures the Group is committed 
to incur capital expenditure of £16,232,097 (March 14: nil) of their share of interest.
Guarantees and Letter of credit
The Group has provided bank guarantees and letter of credits (‘LC’) to customers and vendors in the normal course of business.  
The LC provided as at 31 March 2015: £40,347,660 (2014: £66,289,044) and Bank Guarantee as at 31 March 2015: £10,248,750 
(2014: £4,348,072) are treated as contingent liabilities until such time it becomes probable that the Company will be required to 
make a payment under the guarantee. 
26. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, comprises of loans and borrowings, trade and other payables, and other current liabilities. The 
main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has loans and receivables, trade and 
other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. The Group also hold investments designated 
at available-for-sale categories. 
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Group’s senior management advises on financial risks 
and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below: 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair values of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. 
Market prices comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity risk. Financial instruments 
affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, available-for-sale investments.
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
i) The sensitivity of the statement of comprehensive income is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest 
income for one year, based on the average rate of borrowings held during the year ended 31 March 2014, all other variables being 
held constant. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt 
obligations with average interest rates. 
At 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, the Group had no interest rate derivatives.
The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each 
reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All other variables are held constant. If interest rates increase or decrease by 
100 basis points with all other variables being constant, the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2015 would increase or 
decrease by £2,047,577 (2014: £627,770). OPG Power Ventures Plc

26. Financial risk management objectives and policies continued
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rate. The Group’s presentation currency is the Pound Sterling £. A majority of our assets are located in India where the Indian 
Rupee is the functional currency for our subsidiaries. Currency exposures also exist in the nature of capital expenditure and services 
denominated in currencies other than the Indian Rupee.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises where a Group company holds monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency 
different to the functional currency of that entity:

The impact on total equity is the same as the impact on net earnings as disclosed above.
Credit risk analysis
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial 
loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade and other receivables) and from its financing 
activities, including short-term deposits with banks and financial institutions, and other financial assets.
The maximum exposure for credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets amounting to 
£37,889,350 (2014: £44,805,445). 
The Group has exposure to credit risk from accounts receivable balances on sale of electricity. The operating entities of the Group has 
entered into short-term agreements with transmission companies incorporated by the Indian state Government (TANGEDCO) to sell the 
electricity generated. Therefore the Group is committed, in the short term, to sell power to these customers and the potential risk of 
default is considered low. For other customers, the Group ensures concentration of credit does not significantly impair the financial assets 
since the customers to whom the exposure of credit is taken are well established and reputed industries engaged in their respective field 
of business. The credit worthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit in the normal course of the business is monitored 
regularly. The credit risk for liquid funds is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external 
credit ratings. 
The Group’s management believes that all the above financial assets, except as mentioned in note 13 and 14, are not impaired for each of 
the reporting dates under review and are of good credit quality. 
Liquidity risk analysis
The Group’s main source of liquidity is its operating businesses. The treasury department uses regular forecasts of operational cash flow, 
investment and trading collateral requirements to ensure that sufficient liquid cash balances are available to service ongoing business 
requirements. The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial 
liabilities as well as cash outflows due in day-to-day business. Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and 
week-to-week basis, as well as on the basis of a rolling 90 day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 90 day and a 30 day lookout 
period are identified monthly. 
The Group maintains cash and marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements for up to 60 day periods. Funding for long-term 
liquidity needs is additionally secured by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to sell long-term financial assets.

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability (i.e. a exit price) in an ordinary transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values. 
1 Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other borrowings like short-term loans, current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due 
to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
2 The fair value of loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as well as other 
non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities.
3 Fair value of available-for-sale instruments held for trading purposes are derived from quoted market prices in active markets. Fair value of available-for-sale unquoted equity 
instruments are derived from valuation performed at the year end. 
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position 
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 in the period.
The Group’s finance team performs valuations of financial items for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. Valuation 
techniques are selected based on the characteristics of each instrument, with the overall objective of maximising the use of market-based 
information. The finance team reports directly to the chief financial officer (‘CFO’).
Valuation processes and fair value changes are discussed by the Board of Directors at least every year, in line with the Group’s 
reporting dates.
The fair value of contingent consideration related to the Level 3 investments is estimated using a present value technique. The £nil 
(2014: £274,181) fair value is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, adjusting for risk at 17%.

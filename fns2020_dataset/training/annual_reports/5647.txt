We have secured leading international  
positions in many of our served markets  
in each of our four principal operating divisions.

us to deliver balanced, proﬁtable growth. 


We develop and maintain a close relationship 
with a wide portfolio of blue-chip customers, 
who are successful leaders in their respective 
markets. The high standards of service and 
supply demanded by such customers help

Porous Technologies
Protection & Finishing Products Vision 2015
Delivering  
balanced, proﬁtable 
growth from the 
manufacture of 
millions of plastic, 
ﬁbre and foam 
components

Filtrona’s key strategic objectives can be summarised as the “3Ps”: Place; 
Products & Markets; and People. These apply equally to how we seek to 
deliver balanced, proﬁtable organic growth and the way in which we 
identify value-creating, complementary acquisition opportunities.

In order to take advantage of new revenue growth opportunities, we  
look to expand our geographic footprint through increasing both our 
penetration in existing markets and our presence in new or faster growing 
economies. And we made considerable progress in 2012 in this respect.
Continuing our successful roll-out programme, the Protection & Finishing 
Products division further strengthened its position in the US, with new site 
openings in New Jersey, Houston and Jacksonville during the year, and in 
Memphis shortly after the year end. In addition, we established a Moss 
facility in Xiamen, China and also entered the Austrian, Swiss and Slovakian 
markets for the ﬁrst time; indeed the sales and warehousing capability 
which has been established in Slovakia will also act as a regional distribution 
hub for central and eastern Europe. In Porous Technologies, we opened  
a new corporate ofﬁce in Singapore. This regional headquarters – which 
includes sales, marketing, business development and customer service 
capabilities – will allow us to provide our customers in Asia Paciﬁc with  
an even better level of service and more co-ordinated support, reinforced  
by our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities around the world. 
Subsequent to the year end, we announced the strategic expansion of  
our presence in the key Indian market. To date, the Company’s footprint  
in India has been limited to our successful ﬁlters joint venture with ITC  
and a tear tape slitting facility for our Coated & Security Products division. 
However, this new investment will see us move to a purpose-built facility in 
Bangalore, with the capacity to accommodate manufacturing, warehousing 
and the appropriate commercial infrastructure for three of our divisions. 
Last year, Filtrona unveiled a new, more ambitious strategy known as Vision 
2015, building on the Company’s positive features and attributes, but with 
a rekindled appetite for growth behind key objectives and targets and with 
a more uniﬁed culture across the organisation. I am very pleased that we 
have continued to make excellent progress towards our objectives in 2012.

In FY 2012, revenue increased 11% on a like-for-like basis, signiﬁcantly 
ahead of our Vision 2015 objective of at least mid single-digit growth. As 
expected at the beginning of the year, each of our four principal operating 
divisions contributed to this result through a combination of geographic 
expansion, successful new product launches and range expansion, with  
a particularly noteworthy 17% like-for-like growth rate in Filter Products.
With adjusted operating proﬁt growth of 28% (at constant exchange)  
– for a margin improvement of 30bps – rigorous control of our ﬁnancing 
costs and a further 100bps improvement in our tax rate, adjusted earnings 
per share growth was 30% (at constant exchange) – again, well in excess 
of our Vision 2015 objective of at least double-digit. 
Consistent with our business model, we re-invested in the Company  
to support future revenue growth opportunities. Yet, notwithstanding 
£43m capital expenditure across the divisions, our cash ﬂow conversion 
was strong, at over 75% (87% on an underlying basis), and was supported 
by additional progress on our net working capital ratio. We also maintained 
our commitment to paying a progressive dividend to our shareholders, with 
an increase of 19% in FY 2012.

Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 13 Business Review | Chief Executive’s Review
 Signiﬁcantly, it will result in our Component Distribution, Speciality Tapes 
and Porous Technologies businesses establishing a presence in India for the 
ﬁrst time. This more co-ordinated modus operandi across our operating 
divisions represents a step-change from the more ad hoc approach which 
was adopted prior to the introduction of our Vision 2015 strategy – 
particularly in terms of new market entry. Indeed, the more horizontal 
approach which we are now taking – particularly with regard to our 
expansion in the important Brazil / Russia / India / China (“BRIC”) and other 
faster-growing opportunity markets – will allow us better to leverage the 
scale and capabilities of the overall Filtrona Group, and thereby facilitate  
the delivery of our strategic objectives. 
Recent transactions have also supported the organic expansion of our 
footprint, from the acquisitions of Richco, Inc. (“Richco”) at the end of 2011 
and Jae Yong Co. Ltd (“Jae Yong”) in April 2012, to the acquisition of Ulinco 
Components AB (“Ulinco Components”) in Component Distribution and 
the formation of a joint venture in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) for our 
Filter Products division both announced subsequent to the year end. With 
over 70% of revenue generated outside the US, Richco has added a 
number of new geographies to our Protection & Finishing Products division, 
including Malaysia and Japan – as well as signiﬁcantly enhanced our 
manufacturing capability in China – while South Korea-based Jae Yong has 
further expanded the presence of our Porous Technologies division in the 
Asia Paciﬁc region. The acquisition of Ulinco extends our Component 
Distribution capabilities in the Nordic region, and our joint venture in the 
UAE with BBM Bommidala Group – one of India’s leading producers of 
tobacco products and by-products – both strengthens our presence in the 
growing Middle Eastern market and underscores our commitment to being 
a trusted partner to our tobacco customers on a global basis. 
In some cases, these are not only new markets for our respective operating 
divisions, but also for the overall Company, thereby providing a potential 
bridgehead for further co-ordinated expansion in the future. 

2012 saw a number of initiatives, successfully delivering against our 
objective of identifying key new product opportunities to help drive  
our revenue growth, and being supported by the capital investment  
we continue to make in the business. 
In Protection & Finishing Products, the Component Distribution businesses 
further expanded their ranges, with the introduction of some 2,500 new 
products. We also made good progress in terms of leveraging cross-selling 
opportunities – with new Richco catalogues in Asia and Europe now 
featuring Moss products as well. And, beneﬁting from a new facility, large 
tonnage presses and newly developed multi-cavity mould bases, MSI 
introduced its MaxX range of thread protectors – an innovative product line 
which is compliant with recently implemented standards in the oil and gas 
industry in the US.
Our Coated & Security Products division developed a number of new 
packaging, identity and authentication solutions, beneﬁting from the 
previous investment in state-of-the-art equipment and technologies  
which we have made. Indeed, one of the highlights of the year was 
supplying accreditation solutions to the London 2012 Games in the UK. 
Accordingly, we were very pleased that our innovation continued to gain 
recognition in 2012, with the division winning an Asian Manufacturing 
Award 2012 in the Innovation Packaging Solution category for our 
Supastrip Variable Data Print tape and, together with Northgate Public 
Services and the Department of Transport, a UK IT Industry Award for the 
Blue Badge Improvement Service. We also added to our existing capabilities 
in personal identiﬁcation products business with the acquisition of Securit 
World Ltd (“Securit”), which provides us with new opportunities in 
attractive growth segments, such as access control and membership. 
In Filter Products, our three innovation centres in Jarrow, UK, Greensboro, 
US and Surabaya, Indonesia actively supported key customers in their 
respective launches, with a 20% increase in our level of joint customer 
development activity as well as the introduction of six new proprietary 
products during the year. In addition, our investment of over £1m in our 
Scientiﬁc Services laboratory in Jarrow not only allows us to provide 
customers with a complete service of analytical and commercial testing, 
expert guidance and innovative product solutions, but also to make new 
testing methods available in order to meet evolving regulatory requirements.
Over and above its continued successful commercialisation of innovative 
new products – including negative pressure advanced wound care and 
further products using porous plastics – our Porous Technologies division 
added two exciting new capabilities through acquisition during the year. 
The Jae Yong transaction has introduced nibs and other critical components 
to the division’s existing portfolio of ink-management reservoirs for the 
writing instruments industry, so that we can now offer the broadest range 
of solutions to our customers. And the acquisition of Lymtech Scientiﬁc,  
a manufacturer and distributor of porous wiping materials, has extended 
our manufacturing technology into the complementary area of non-
woven ﬁbre. As a result, we now have access to the attractive growth  
and higher value market for clean room wipes, which are used in the 
controlled environments increasingly required in industries such as life 
sciences and electronics.

Filtrona’s Vision 2015 strategy is not just about ﬁnancial performance  
– it is also about people. Indeed, at all levels, our employees are a vital 
resource in the Company’s pursuit of operational excellence and the 
provision of quality products and service to our customers. Indeed, as  
an international organisation, it is important that we attract an appropriate 
level of local talent and enhance mobility through increasing cross-divisional 
moves. In this respect, we made good progress during the year, not only in 
terms of developing our existing employees but also in adding to our talent 
base through our recent acquisitions.
During the year, we undertook the ﬁrst Group-wide employee engagement 
survey in Filtrona’s history, which was extremely important in terms of 
gaining the views of all our people so we can ensure that the Company  
A co-ordinated approach 
to the Indian market will 
allow us better to 
leverage our Group-wide 
skills and scale

 is a great place to work. It is also key to developing a more uniﬁed culture 
across the organisation. Translated into 19 languages and distributed to 
more than 4,000 employees worldwide, the survey saw an excellent 75% 
response rate with a strong turnout in each of our operating divisions and 
at head ofﬁce. While there are naturally areas for improvement, where 
action plans have been agreed and are being implemented, the Board and 
the Group Management Committee (“GMC”) were very pleased with the 
overall positive ﬁndings – not least that 82% of respondents are proud to 
be part of the Filtrona Group.
In 2012, we ﬁlled a number of key Group and divisional roles. At Board 
level, Matthew Gregory was appointed Filtrona’s new Group Finance 
Director from his previous role as Corporate Development Director,  
after Steve Crummett stepped down following six successful years at  
the Company.
We also created a new role of Group Operations Director, and have 
welcomed Alan Richards to the position. Alan brings extensive operations 
experience and will have oversight of our global manufacturing and 
distribution footprint, to ensure effective use of resources and the 
achievements of the beneﬁts of scale. And before the year end, we 
announced the appointment of Matt Taylor, Managing Director – 
Component Distribution to the GMC. Matt joined Filtrona in 1987,  
and in his 25 year career has held a variety of increasingly senior roles in 
those businesses. Leaving Filtrona were Robert Purcell, Managing Director 
– Protection & Finishing Products division and, shortly after the year end, 
Tony Edwards, Managing Director – Coated & Security Products division: 
both of them tendered their resignations to pursue other opportunities 
outside the Company.
2012 was also another successful year for both the Filtrona Management 
Development and Graduate Development Programmes. The two-year 
graduate programme has provided a talent pipeline for a number of years, 
and in October a record 21 people joined from across the Company. The 
programme has recently expanded into new geographies including Asia, 
and graduates from Brazil, India and Reinbek, Germany were recruited for 
the ﬁrst time this year, expanding the international scope. The 2012 intake 
will join the nine graduates recruited in 2011, and will have the opportunity 
to develop their management skills through bespoke training which takes 
place around Filtrona’s sites, giving graduates exposure to the Company.
Supporting our recruitment and talent development initiatives has been  
the roll-out of a more rigorous appraisal and succession planning process 
and the establishment of a divisional HR structure, with the appointment  
of dedicated Human Resources directors in each of Protection & Finishing 
Products and Filter Products adding to the existing divisional resources in 
Porous Technologies and Coated & Security Products. 
Our overriding commitment remains the health, safety and welfare of our 
employees and all those who visit our operations. And notwithstanding the 
very good standards we have already reached, and a signiﬁcant increase  
in our headcount, we made further progress in our health and safety 
performance in 2012. Indeed, ten of our sites received a Gold ranking in 
the Filtrona Health & Safety Awards, up from seven in 2011, with a further 
ﬁve achieving Silver status.


During the year, we made a number of organisational changes so as  
to strengthen the Group structure and to enhance our operational 
excellence further. 
At the time of our Half Year 2012 results, we announced that Enitor  
– our Netherlands-based plastic extrusions business – would be reported 
separately for external purposes as “Other” , as opposed to being reported 
under the Coated & Security Products division. Indeed, given the different 
nature and drivers of Enitor’s business, it had already been operationally 
managed separately at Group level since the beginning of the year, so  
as to allow a greater degree of focus on growth opportunities. And while 
Enitor’s end-markets proved challenging in 2012, nonetheless its standing as 
a recognised leader in the design, manufacture and supply of technical and 
innovative custom extrusions – supported by reliability and service – has 
resulted in a number of exciting new contracts, in particular a ﬁrst-time win 
with the international home products retailer, IKEA. Heading into 2013, 
Enitor aims to extend its sales into previously untapped end-markets such  
as water treatment, as well as new geographies such as North America. It is 
also focused on continuing to push the boundaries of extrusion techniques 
to stay at the forefront of technology, including exploring newer materials 
which enhance the environmental credentials of customers’ products.
In December, we announced a change to the organisational structure of 
our Protection & Finishing Products businesses. Effective from 1 January 
2013, the Component Distribution businesses are now managed under  
a common structure within three geographic regions, while MSI Pipe 
Protection Technologies will seek to leverage its more than 30 years’ 
experience and leading position in the Oil Country Tubular Goods market 
into new end-markets. These two business areas will be reported together 
as the renamed “Component & Protection Solutions division”. At the same 
time, the Speciality Tapes business of Duraco will now form part of the 
Coated & Security Products division. As identifying key new product and 
end-market opportunities is a core objective of Filtrona’s Vision 2015 
strategy to deliver balanced, proﬁtable growth, we are conﬁdent that this 
new structure will allow the Company better to exploit previously untapped 
cross-selling and end-market potential.

and Richco extend our

16 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012

 Having re-aligned each of our principal operating divisions to more focused 
business units in 2011, we made further improvements to our commercial 
structure in 2012, facilitated by the appointment of our Group Commercial 
Director in January. Indeed, as with the expansion of our geographic 
footprint, there is similarly signiﬁcant scope for the Company to go to 
market in a more uniﬁed and co-ordinated way, so as to leverage better 
Filtrona’s overall capabilities, skills and customer relationships. As a result, 
we introduced regional commercial structures during the year with teams 
clustered by geography, which will allow us to provide our customers with 
an even better level of service and more co-ordinated support on a regional 
basis. We also made progress with regard to developing commercial processes 
for increased efﬁciency and effectiveness, including the development  
of common Customer Relationship Management and market-leading 
e-commerce platforms, both of which will be rolled out in 2013. 
While each of our divisions ostensibly produces very different products,  
we serve a number of common industries and customers: for example, our 
Filter Products and Coated & Security Products divisions are both trusted 
partners to the tobacco industry, while the pharmaceuticals sector is served 
by Porous Technologies for essential components and, increasingly, our 
Coated & Security Products division for labels. These are only a couple of 
examples from across the Company where, by adopting a more category-
based, horizontal approach to our product portfolio as opposed to 
operating as individual divisions, we can better exploit existing – and 
importantly, new and innovative – product and cross-selling opportunities, 
so as to become an even more important and relevant partner to our 
customers. Accordingly, we have established nine principal product 
categories – from industrial to point of purchase – from which we are 
seeking to deliver the next stage of our revenue expansion, and around 
which we will be better able to manage our key customer accounts. 

Filtrona is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance  
and responsibility, to ensure that the way in which we manage our activities 
reﬂects the expectations of all the Company’s stakeholders. As a member 
of both the FTSE4Good Index and the Carbon Trust, we recognise that  
our interaction with the environment and local communities is a critical 
component of the international reputation and quality, of Filtrona’s 
businesses as well as a cornerstone of developing a responsible, progressive 
and winning culture.
All our principal manufacturing facilities hold the ISO 14001 environmental 
accreditation and, with the exception of recently-acquired sites (which, per 
Filtrona policy, have a period of 24 months to reach the required standard), 
they have also achieved the Occupational Health & Safety Management 
Systems OHSAS 18001; in respect of the latter, the Payne Cardiff site 
acquired in 2010 attained the standard in 2012 as anticipated. In addition, 
we were very pleased to gain additional accreditation in two of our 
divisions: Payne Security was awarded the coveted Intergraf CWA 
15374:2005 certiﬁcation as an accredited supplier to the secure printing 
industry for both private and government customers, while our Component 
Distribution facility at Kidlington, UK attained the recently introduced and 
internationally recognised ISO 50001 standard on energy management. 
Attaining the ISO 50001 standard at all our manufacturing facilities by  
the end of 2014 is a Company-wide objective, and in recognition of the 
excellent work that our Kidlington site has done in being the ﬁrst to do so,  
I was very pleased to award it the 2012 Chief Executive’s Special Award.
During the year, Filtrona was placed in the top 10% of companies by  
the UK’s Environment Agency in the Carbon Reduction Commitment 
Performance League Table. This league table is based on early actions that 
participating companies have taken to demonstrate their commitment to 
energy efﬁciency within their organisations, and is a direct result of the 
action which we initiated back in 2010 under the auspices of our Health, 
Safety & Environment Council.
We have also made further progress on reducing the environmental impact 
of our business in other aspects, with our water use and the amount of 
waste sent to landﬁll showing reductions versus 2011 levels. This year,  
I was very pleased to give the Group Environmental Award to the Porous 
Technologies’ Reinbek, Germany facility, for an innovative energy 
management system that has reduced and controlled energy consumption 
by 30kW per annum.

In 2012 – the ﬁrst full year of Filtrona’s Vision 2015 strategy – we continued 
to build on the promising start we made in 2011 and to make further 
progress towards our objectives. In delivering these 2012 results, I would  
like to acknowledge the efforts of all our employees and to thank them for 
their dedication and commitment as we continue to shape the Company  
– in particular, as we look to leverage our collective capabilities more 
effectively and to work together on a more horizontal, cross-divisional basis.

In what remains an uncertain economic environment, Filtrona’s 
international footprint, together with the diversity of its products and 
end-markets, provide the Company with a degree of defensiveness. 
Accordingly, we are well-positioned to deliver further balanced, proﬁtable 
growth in 2013, and anticipate that each of our principal operating 
divisions will contribute to the overall Group result. As such, we are aiming 
to continue to make progress towards our Vision 2015 objectives of at least 
mid single-digit like-for-like revenue growth and double-digit adjusted 
earnings per share growth, at constant exchange.

Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 17 Business Review | Chief Executive’s Review
 The ﬁnancial information is prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, and with the accounting policies set out on page 85.
Foreign exchange rates
Movements in exchange rates relative to sterling affect actual results  
as reported. The constant exchange rate basis adjusts the comparative  
to exclude such movements, to show the underlying growth of the 
Company. For the principal exchange rates for Filtrona for the year ended 
31 December 2012 (“FY 2012”), see the table opposite. Re-translating  
at FY 2012 average exchange rates reduces the prior year revenue and 
adjusted operating proﬁt by £14.1m and £2.1m respectively.
Like-for-like basis
The term “like-for-like” describes the performance of the business on a 
comparable basis, adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and 
foreign exchange. The FY 2012 results and the FY 2011 comparatives reﬂect 
the results of Reid Supply Company (acquired on 6 September 2011), Richco, 
Inc. (acquired on 21 December 2011), Securit World Ltd (acquired on  
17 February 2012), Jae Yong Co. Ltd (acquired on 23 April 2012), John R.  
Lyman Company and Big Blue Properties LLC (together “Lymtech Scientiﬁc” , 
acquired on 13 June 2012) and FractureCode (divested on 28 July 2011).
Adjusted basis
The term “adjusted” excludes the impact of intangible amortisation  
and exceptional operating items, less any associated tax relief. In FY 2012, 
intangible amortisation was £8.3m (2011: £3.7m), and there was an 
exceptional pre-tax charge of £10.6m (2011: £8.2m) mainly relating to 
integration costs and fees arising from the afore mentioned acquisitions.
Trading performance
Full year revenue was 22.7% ahead of the prior year (+26.0% at constant 
exchange rates) at £663.4m, with like-for-like growth of 11.1%. The gross 
margin rose 20bps (+10bps at constant exchange rates) to 35.9%. Ongoing 
volume leverage operational initiatives and successful pricing programmes 
to mitigate input cost increases were largely offset by the dilutive mix 
impact of the very strong revenue growth in the lower margin Filter 
Products division.
On an adjusted basis, operating proﬁt was ahead 24.6% (+27.8% at 
constant exchange rates) at £105.3m, equating to a 30bps uplift in the 
margin to 15.9% (at both actual and constant exchange rates). Operating 
proﬁt as reported was £86.4m, 19.0% higher than last year (+22.9%  
at constant exchange rates).
Net ﬁnance expense
Net ﬁnance expense was £9.5m, a £1.2m increase versus FY 2011.  
The net interest charge on net debt increased to £8.9m (2011: £8.6m), 
primarily as a result of additional debt taken on to ﬁnance acquisitions.  
The amortisation of bank facility fees increased to £1.3m (2011: £0.8m),  
the IAS 19 pension ﬁnance credit of £0.3m was lower (2011: £1.2m), while 
other interest income was £0.4m (2011: expense of £0.1m).
Tax
The effective tax rate on proﬁt before exceptional items and tax was  
29.4% (2011: 30.4%).
Net income
Adjusted net income was up 27.5% (+31.0% at constant exchange rates)  
to £67.6m. On a reported basis, net income of £53.5m increased 26.2% 
(31.1% at constant exchange rates). Fully diluted adjusted earnings per 
share of 30.7p was up 26.3% (30.1% ahead at constant exchange rates).

Dividends
The Board of Directors recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 8.6p per share 
(2011: 7.2p), an increase of 19.4%. This takes the FY 2012 dividend to 
12.5p per share (+19.0% versus FY 2011).
Net working capital
Net working capital is deﬁned as “inventories plus trade & other  
receivables less trade & other payables, adjusted to exclude deferred 
consideration receivable / payable, interest accruals / capital payables  
and other normalising items.”
Net working capital of £78.0m was higher than the 31 December  
2011 level of £71.1m. The net working capital / revenue ratio was 11.8% 
(2011: 12.9% at constant exchange rates).
Cash ﬂow
Operating cash ﬂow decreased 14.5% to £79.3m (2011: £92.7m).  
This included an outﬂow of net working capital for the year of £7.8m  
(2011: inﬂow of £7.9m) and gross capital expenditure of £43.8m  
(2011: £27.0m), with net capital expenditure at £43.2m (2011: £26.8m).  
Net capital expenditure equated to 191% (2011: 129%) of the  
depreciation charge for the year of £22.6m (2011: £20.7m).
Net interest paid was £8.9m (2011: £9.1m) and tax payments decreased  
by £4.0m to £17.6m (2011: £21.6m). The outﬂow in respect of pension 
obligations was broadly unchanged at £8.4m (2011: £8.3m). Free cash  
ﬂow of £44.4m (2011: £53.7m) declined by 17.3%.
Net debt
Net debt at the end of the period was £163.5m, an increase of £18.6m  
from 1 January 2012. This reﬂected free cash ﬂow of £44.4m, offset by 
dividends totalling £23.2m, net acquisitions of £35.0m and foreign 
exchange and other items.
The Company’s ﬁnancial ratios remain strong. The ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA as at 31 December 2012 was 1.3x (31 December 2011: 1.4x)  
and interest cover was 11.1x (31 December 2011: 9.3x).
Balance sheet
At the end of 2012, the Company had shareholders’ funds of £235.0m  
(2011: £207.0m), an increase of 13.5%. Net debt was £163.5m (2011: 
£144.9m) and total capital employed in the business was £403.8m 
(2011: £358.3m).
This ﬁnances non-current assets of £407.8m (2011: £362.5m), of which  
£180.3m (2011: £168.1m) is tangible ﬁxed assets, the remainder being 
intangible assets, deferred tax assets and retirement beneﬁt assets. The 
Company has net working capital of £78.0m (2011: £71.1m), current 
provisions of £17.5m (2011: £12.8m) and long-term liabilities other than 
borrowings of £46.5m (2011: £41.3m). The return on average invested 
capital (including intangibles) was 21.2% (2011: 23.6%), owing to 
acquisitions during the year.
Pensions
As at 31 December 2012, the Company’s IAS 19 pension liability was 
£8.3m (2011: £24.0m) with a net liability of £4.5m (2011: £16.6m) after 
accounting for a deferred tax asset of £3.8m (2011: £7.4m). The deﬁcit  
has been calculated after updating the asset values and certain 
assumptions as at 31 December 2012.
Treasury policy and controls
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to control external  
borrowing and manage exchange risk. Treasury policies are approved by 
the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types  
of ﬁnancial investments that may be employed and the criteria for investing 
and borrowing cash. The Company uses derivatives only to manage foreign 
currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business activities.  
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The department  
is subject to independent reviews by the Group Assurance department. 
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the  
Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place, 
and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination  
of geographical presence and suitable credit rating. Filtrona monitors the 
credit ratings of its counterparties and credit exposure to each counterparty.
Foreign exchange risk
The majority of Filtrona’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling.  
The Company’s normal policy is to limit the transaction exposure and the 
resulting impact on shareholders’ funds by borrowing in those currencies  
in which the Company has signiﬁcant net assets. As at 31 December 2012, 
Filtrona’s US dollar-denominated assets were approximately 47% hedged by 
its US dollar-denominated borrowings, while its euro-denominated assets 
were approximately 90% hedged by its euro-denominated borrowings.
The Company does not hedge the translation effect of exchange  
rate movements on the income statement. The majority of Filtrona’s 
transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations, 
and so transaction exposure is limited. However, where they do occur,  
the Company’s policy is to hedge the exposures as soon as they are 
committed using forward foreign exchange contracts.

The division is a global market leader in the 
provision of a rapid supply of primarily plastic 
products for protection and ﬁnishing applications, 
and includes the following activities.
Component Distribution – comprising the Moss, 
Skiffy, Alliance, Reid and Richco operations –  
is a global market leading manufacturer and 
distributor of plastic injection moulded,  
vinyl dip moulded and metal items. 
MSI Pipe Protection Technologies specialises in 
the manufacture of high performance, innovative 
products from commodity resins to engineering-
grade thermoplastics and polymer alloys for use 
in a range of end-markets. 
The Speciality Tapes business of Duraco is a 
leading manufacturer and distributor of adhesive 
coated products, including foam, magnetic, 
ﬁnger lift and acrylic high bond tapes, hook  
and loop and non-skid foam.
Collectively, these three business areas serve  
a very broad base of over 150,000 customers  
in industries such as hydraulics, pneumatics,  
oil and gas, electrical controls, construction, 
point of purchase and tubular metal products. 
We serve these customers from nine principal 
manufacturing facilities and 53 sales and 
distribution operations in a total of 23 countries.

Our objective is to leverage our extensive 
product range and geographic distribution 
capability, using our efﬁcient sourcing and 
manufacturing operations and sophisticated  
IT platform, to respond to the demands of our 
diverse international customer base. Our tool 
library and production experience, along with 
our inventory logistics structure, are unique 
assets. We have strong business to business 
marketing expertise – electronic, web-based  
and physical – and support this with a number  
of comprehensive product catalogues available 
in many languages and online.
We target organic growth opportunities  
through increasing the range and availability of 
our products, and by network expansion into 
new international territories and growing density 
within existing territories. Driving an increased 
number of transactions from a growing 
customer and product base, while focusing on 
further reduction of transaction costs, is a key 
objective for our continued success. The division 
continues to seek acquisition opportunities, 
which can move us into complementary product 
categories or further our distribution capability.

 Range expansion and new site roll-outs 
support balanced, proﬁtable growth
Revenue increased 48.6% (at constant exchange) 
to £237.7m, with like-for-like growth of 9.6% 
driven by continued range expansion, new site 
roll-outs and improved marketing effectiveness. 
The results were boosted by the inclusion of a 
full year contribution from Richco, as well as an 
incremental eight months from Reid Supply.
Underlying growth in the Component 
Distribution businesses of Moss, Skiffy and 
Alliance was broad-based across geographies 
and key end-market sectors. During the year,  
we further expanded our range, with the 
addition of some 2,500 new products, mainly 
centred around hardware and fasteners. In 
addition, our successful roll-out programme 
continued, with the establishment of new sites 
for Moss in Xiamen, China and Alliance Express 
in Jacksonville, US, and we entered the Austrian, 
Swiss and Slovakian markets for the ﬁrst time; in 
the case of the latter, the sales and warehousing 
capability which has been set up will also act  
as a regional distribution hub for Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
The integration of Richco and Reid continued  
in line with expectations. Richco’s US operations 
were successfully transferred to our main Alliance 
facility in Erie, with progress also being made on 
integrating sites in Continental Europe. In the 
UK, we consolidated Richco’s manufacturing 
with our Moss site at Kidlington, and our 
additional investment will allow the further 
integration of Richco’s warehousing during  
2013 as well as supporting new range expansion 
in the future. We also leveraged cross-selling 
opportunities, with new Richco catalogues in 
Asia and Europe now featuring Moss products, 
as well as greater integration of Richco and  
Moss ﬁeld sales teams. 
The Speciality Tapes business of Duraco 
performed well, particularly supported by growth 
in the ﬁnger lift tape and hook and loop ranges. 
The Express sites in New Jersey and Houston,  
US opened during the year have made a very 
encouraging start, while the Stera Tape business 
was renamed as Duraco Europe, with cross-
selling opportunities beneﬁting from the launch 
of the ﬁrst catalogue in the region.
Notwithstanding a record year in 201 1, MSI 
delivered further growth across all sites in 2012.  
To underpin the future growth potential of this 
business, a new ofﬁce, manufacturing plant and 
warehouse were opened in Houston, in May. The 
136,000 square-foot facility is double the size of 
the previous location and, along with investment 
in larger injection moulding machines and mould 
bases, has increased production rates. The 
additions support a new “best in market” product 
line, the MaxX range, which is compliant with the 
thread protector standard recently implemented 
by the American Petroleum Institute.
Boosted by the increasing use of electronic 
marketing media, our continued focus on 
efﬁcient marketing investment and activity 
delivered strong lead indicators versus 2011: 
marketing responses were 25% ahead, and  
the number of live accounts at the end of 
December increased to a record level of 156,000, 
up 17% versus 2011. Revenue from higher 
margin proprietary products, as opposed to 
custom parts, increased to 72% from 70%  
in FY 2011, on a comparable basis (excluding 
recent acquisitions).
Adjusted operating proﬁt grew 44.1% (at 
constant exchange) to £53.1m, equating to a 
70bps reduction in the margin. Operating and 
process efﬁciencies, together with leverage from 
the strong revenue growth and a continued 
positive mix effect from moving the business 
further into higher margin standard parts were 
more than offset by the dilutive impact of Reid 
and Richco. However, as anticipated, our 
successful integration and delivery of synergy 
savings is progressively closing the margin 
differential between the acquired and the 
underlying businesses.
Complemented by value-adding M&A
Following the year end, we announced the 
acquisition of 100% of the share capital of  
Ulinco Components AB (”Ulinco Components”) 
for an undisclosed cash consideration. Based in 
Sweden, Ulinco Components is a leading 
distributor of plastic protection and ﬁnishing 
products, hardware and specialist masking 
solutions in the Nordic region. The acquisition of 
Ulinco Components not only expands the product 
range and customer base of our Component 
Distribution businesses, but also reinforces and 
extends their geographic presence in Scandinavia. 
Continued new site 
roll-out allows us to 
increase our penetration 
in existing markets as 
well as expand our 
geographic footprint 
into new territories
24 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012


 Over and above compliance with environmental 
standards and a commitment to reducing our 
impact on the environment, all our divisional 
businesses are increasingly focused on the extent 
to which new environmentally-friendly products 
and processes present new opportunities to add 
value in response to customer demands, as well 
as potentially reducing costs. Notwithstanding 
our very good revenue growth in 2012 and the 
integration of Reid and Richco, we continued  
to make further environmental improvements 
during the year, with a very pleasing reduction  
in CO
2
 emissions, energy use, general waste  
and water consumption.
Our focus is on the fundamental objective  
of securing the health and safety of all our 
employees. During the year, our MSI site in 
Veracruz, Mexico achieved Gold status in the 
Company’s Health & Safety Awards with a 
further three sites receiving other accreditation, 
showing successful achievement in providing  




Given their very wide application, the global 
market for protection and ﬁnishing products  
is large, fragmented and ill-deﬁned for  
both suppliers and customers; however, 
management estimates the value at in  
excess of £2bn pa.
Manufacturing GDP growth rate
With protection and ﬁnishing products being 
used in a very broad spectrum of industrial 
end-markets, those countries with a higher 
manufacturing GDP growth rate are 
particularly attractive.
Increased use of standard components
There is an increasing move to small, 
specialised ﬂexible manufacturing businesses, 
which assemble their specialised parts and 
equipment from a range of standard 
components. This approach provides them 
with ﬂexibility, the ability to move quickly and 
provide their own customers with the service 
they require.
Just-in-time delivery
As customers are required to deliver their own 
products “just-in-time”, so their demand for 
critical components from their suppliers is 
increasingly on the same basis.
Increasing labour costs
Standardised manufacturing processes  
and components typically require less 
labour, thereby helping customers reduce 
their cost base.
Industry speciﬁcation
As end-markets become more sophisticated 
and demanding, so the requirement for higher 
quality components increases. Over and above 
this more general trend, certain customers – 
notably those in the oil and gas industry – are 
increasingly facing regulatory guidelines in 
terms of the speciﬁcation of the components 
they use. 
Key new product opportunities
 Continued range expansion, to provide 
customers with the broadest selection  
of standard components
 Develop new sectors for existing customer 
base, such as hardware
 Globalise successful local products 
through established supply chain
 Enter new and adjacent product markets, 
such as point of purchase
 Launch products which are compliant  
with new industry speciﬁcations, such as 
the MaxX range of thread protectors
Improving operational excellence  
and execution
Towards the end of the year, we announced a 
new organisational structure for our Protection  
& Finishing Products businesses aimed at better 
exploiting previously untapped cross-selling and 
end-market potential. This structure took effect 
from 1 January 2013. 
Going forward, Component Distribution will be 
managed under a common structure within three 
geographical regions; Europe, Middle East & 
Africa, Americas and Asia. The implementation  
of these regional structures is designed to 
facilitate further integration of the current 
operations and to drive a number of commercial 
and operational beneﬁts, with the objective of 
promoting our full range of products as broadly 
as possible across our various channels to market. 
Separately, with over 30 years’ experience  
and its new state-of-the-art facility, there  
are opportunities for MSI Pipe Protection 
Technologies to leverage its expertise in 
developing and manufacturing innovative 
products into industries beyond oil and gas, 
where it is already the leader in the Oil Country 
Tubular Goods market.
For the full year 2013, Component Distribution 
and Pipe Protection Technologies will be 
reported together as the renamed “Component 
& Protection Solutions division”, while the 
Speciality Tapes activities of Duraco will form 
part of the Coated & Security Products division. 
FY 2012 comparatives for this new organisational 
structure are provided in note 30. 
a safer and healthier workplace. In addition,  
the Duraco Europe business delivered further 
improvement in its health and safety metrics 
towards our divisional standards. In conjunction 
with our comprehensive policies in this area,  
the division has achieved key international 
accreditations across its facilities which are 
detailed on page 47.
We were very proud to receive the Chief 
Executive’s Special Award in recognition  
of our Kidlington, UK facility attaining the 
recently-introduced ISO 50001 standard. 
Further information on this achievement  
can be found on page 46. 
We were also pleased by the level of 
participation of employees across our sites in  
the Filtrona Engagement Survey, in particular 
that 86% consider their part of the division to be 
good to work for and 91% enjoy the work they 
do, both of which results are above the average 
for the total universe of companies which 
undertake such surveys.

The Porous Technologies division is a world 
leader in the development and manufacture  
of customised liquid and vapour handling 
products engineered from three material 
technologies: bonded and non-woven ﬁbre, 
polyurethane foam and porous plastic.
Our range consists of components which  
serve as a critical part of a variety of end-
products, including medical diagnostic devices, 
wound care products, writing instruments, 
printer cartridges, air fresheners, cosmetic 
applicators and speciality wiping products  
used for critical environments such as clean 
rooms and laboratories.
We serve customers in over 56 countries from  
six manufacturing facilities in four countries,  
with a regional commercial and new business 
development structure. Supporting the  
division globally are R&D facilities in the US,  
with regional teams facilitating product 
development in other geographies.

 Quality is at the forefront of the division’s efforts, 
given the critical role many of our components 
play in our customers’ end-products. Our 
production sites are ISO 9001:2008 compliant, 
and our facility in St. Charles, US is also ISO 
13485:2003 certiﬁed. Quality laboratories at 
each of our facilities provide consistency checks 
throughout the production process, to assure 
reliability and satisfaction to our customers.

Successful innovation supports balanced, 
proﬁtable growth
Revenue increased 11.8% (at constant exchange) 
to £85.8m. Adjusting for the acquisition of Jae 
Yong in April and Lymtech Scientiﬁc in June, as 
well as the transfer of a portion of intercompany 
revenue to the Filter Products division, like-for-
like growth was 5.6%.
Revenue growth of 9% in healthcare (c. 20%  
of divisional revenue) was boosted by further 
success in point of care diagnostics and 
infectious ﬂuid collection and disposal systems 
using porous plastics. Printer systems (c. 30%  
of divisional revenue) was up 3%, supported  
by new product development and geographic 
expansion but partially impacted by the 
bankruptcy ﬁling by a global OEM account  
early in the year.
Household products & personal care (together  
c. 10% of divisional revenue) increased 2%, 
supported by the expansion of sales to an 
existing customer in an additional geographic 
region. Writing instruments (c. 30% of divisional 
revenue) was ahead 2% on an underlying basis 
(ie, excluding the acquisition of Jae Yong), with 
continued success in capturing new business in 
developing markets partially offset by lower 
volumes in more established markets.
In 2012, the division continued its successful 
track record of converting its intellectual 
property and manufacturing know-how into 
commercial success. Similar in nature to our 
other technologies, porous plastic components 
are engineered from a variety of raw materials, 
each with differing properties (such as pore size, 
density, chemical resistance, rigidity and 
hydrophobicity). This technology allows us to 
increase our reach in the ﬂuid-handling space 
and to expand further in existing markets. 
During the year, in healthcare we developed a 
cannula ﬁlter designed to protect the user from 
contaminated ﬂuids by preventing leakage, while 
our new negative pressure wound care therapy 
also incorporates porous plastic to prevent ﬂuid 
waste from contaminating the pump systems, 
with our foam being used at the wound site  
to provide comfort and absorb exudate. 
Additionally, we launched writing instrument 
nibs in both porous plastic and polyester ﬁbre,  
and we developed a new ﬁbre wick technology 
for use in road-side breathalyser test kits.
Adjusted operating proﬁt rose 12.9% (at 
constant exchange) to £20.7m, for a 20bps uplift 
in the operating margin. Continued initiatives to 
improve efﬁciency were partially offset by the 
cost of establishing a new corporate ofﬁce in 
Singapore, further investment in porous plastics 
technology resources and the short-term dilutive 
impact of acquisitions.
Complemented by value-adding M&A
In 2012, we made two exciting strategic 
acquisitions: Jae Yong for an undisclosed sum, 
and Lymtech Scientiﬁc for a cash consideration 
of US$45.3m. Based in South Korea, Jae Yong  
is a globally recognised manufacturer of 
reservoirs, nibs and tubes for the writing 
instrument industry, and expands our offering  
in this segment from ink-management reservoirs 
to include other critical components. It also 
enhances our divisional presence in the growing 
Asia Paciﬁc region. As such, we will be able to 
deliver an expanded portfolio of high-quality, 
innovative components and excellent service  
for writing instruments to customers around  
the world.
US-based Lymtech Scientiﬁc is a manufacturer 
and distributor of porous wiping materials used 
within the clean environments increasingly 
required by the medical, life science, electronic 
and industrial markets. This transaction not  
only extends our manufacturing technology into 
the complementary area of non-woven ﬁbre,  
but also gives us access to the attractive growth 
and higher value clean room and controlled 
environment wipes market as well as adding a 
distribution selling channel. Additionally, through 
leveraging the global commercial and 
operational resources of the division, there is a 
South Korean-based 
Jae Yong has 
further expanded 
our presence in the 
Asia Paciﬁc region
28 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012


 real opportunity for us to expand the Lymtech 
Scientiﬁc business geographically into the 
sizeable Asian and European clean room  
wipes markets.
Improving operational excellence  
and execution
In March, we opened a new corporate ofﬁce in 
Singapore, which will act as a commercial centre 
of excellence and regional headquarters for the 
growth businesses in Asia. This new location 
– which includes sales, marketing, business 
development and customer service capabilities 
– will allow us to provide our customers with  
an even better level of service and more 
co-ordinated on a regional basis, supported  
by our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities 
around the world. 
During the year, we also re-focused our 
commercial efforts on speciality foam, bonded 
ﬁbre and porous plastics and non-woven 
products, so as to leverage our capabilities more 
effectively and provide our customers with even 
greater value-added propositions. To help drive 
our global footprint and expansion goals, we 
also undertook a thorough restructuring of  
our commercial team to create a single sales 
organisation grouped by region: Americas; 
Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia. 
These three regional teams, each headed by  
a Sales Director, successfully draw together the 
necessary skills and international experience 
which will allow us to support our collective 
technology platform more efﬁciently.
We also invested further in our porous plastics 
capabilities at our facilities in St. Charles and 
Richmond, US.




Management estimates the global addressable 
market for our porous technologies products  
at around £1.2bn. The underlying growth  
rates and key trends facing the division vary 
depending on the end-market served and  
the respective ﬂuid handling challenge  
being addressed.
Printing systems:  
performance improvements
Estimated market growth of 3% pa, with 
customers looking to enhance the performance 
of their products, such as through the use of 
increasingly complex inks. 
Healthcare: enhanced ﬂuid  
handling capabilities 
Estimated market growth of 8-10% pa,  
driven by the migration from slower and more 
expensive laboratory-based testing to results 
being provided at the point-of-care. 
Advanced wound care: changing 
customer / patient needs
Estimated market growth of 6% pa.  
A globally aging population is resulting  
in a change in the incidence of medical 
conditions requiring advanced wound  
care products, such as diabetes.
Household & personal care:  
emerging market growth
Estimated market growth of 3-4% pa,  
with consumers increasingly transitioning  
to more sophisticated household and  
personal care products.
Non-woven products: growing 
requirement for sensitive environments
Estimated market growth of 6-7% pa. 
Industries such as electronics increasingly 
operate in controlled environments, while 
others (eg hospitals) have a requirement  
for clean room conditions to combat infection 
and / or contamination risk.
Writing instruments: range expansion
Estimated market growth of 2% pa, with 
customers increasingly looking for a total 
solutions provider – from ink reservoirs to nibs.
 
Key new product opportunities
 Improved technologies to further enhance 
ﬂuid handling capability
 Additional technology platforms, to  
take advantage of new end-market

 Continued focus on customer partnerships

We are focused on the delivery of the highest 
standards of safety, quality and performance 
across all our international operations. Our global 
initiatives continue to keep our employees 
focused on driving to zero both lost time 
accidents and environmental accidents. 
As a result, we were very pleased that our St. 
Charles, US site received Gold status for the 
third year running in the Filtrona Health & Safety 
Awards, with accreditation also going to our 
Ningbo, China, Richmond, US and Reinbek 
Germany facilities. We took steps to further 
reduce our environmental impact: our energy 
and water consumption both improved, and we 
made particularly strong progress in lowering 
our CO
2 
emissions and general waste. 
Accordingly, we were very proud to receive the 
Group Environmental Award at our Reinbek 
facility for an energy management system that 
has reduced and controlled energy consumption 
by 30kW per annum.
We were similarly pleased with the response of 
our sites to the Group employee engagement 
survey, notably that 86% consider their part of 
the business is good to work for and 88% feel 
a strong sense of commitment – both well 
above average scores, when compared to  
the total universe of companies which 
undertake such surveys.

communication and product protection through 
integrated creative design.
Payne Security is a leading supplier to the identity 
and valuable document and the consumer 
packaging markets, providing a range of 
authentication technologies, printed ﬁlm and 
card-based solutions.
Payne and Payne Security together serve 
customers in over 100 markets from seven 
manufacturing facilities in ﬁve countries.  
They are supported by an in-house design  
studio, an R&D facility and multi-million  
pound print capabilities.

Our objective is to use our business  
development philosophy and resource to  
identify innovation opportunities and translate 
these into novel, workable solutions for new  
and existing customers. We seek to leverage  
our well-invested, developing international 
footprint to provide market-leading quality  
and service on a global basis, underpinned by 
our motivated and well-trained employees.
Payne manufactures a range of tapes, labels, 
closures and seals which offer functional  
beneﬁts to packaged goods through providing 
easy opening and resealability. Our products are 
also the ideal medium to carry sophisticated 
branding and communication messages, in the 
form of printed images, text or data. Additionally, 
we look to add value to our customers’ 
packaging through providing brand protection 
solutions, such as tamper evidence or 
authentication technologies, from Payne Security.
Payne Security provides security technologies 
and innovations to governments and brand 
owners worldwide, to enable them to identify 
and secure valuable documents and products  
in the ﬁght against counterfeiting. Our offering 
comprises overt, covert and forensic 
technologies, including inks, lacquers,  
laminates, labels, tear tapes and threads.

Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 31 Business Review | Review of Operations


 These technologies and products have a wide 
application including branded goods and 
national identity documents (such as passports, 
identity cards and visas). Payne Security also 
offers a range of secure card solutions for 
national schemes (such as entitlement to free 
transport and parking) and for the provision of 
identity and entitlement within government 
agencies, such as universities and hospitals.

Continued innovation and investment 
support balanced, proﬁtable growth
Revenue increased 18.6% (at constant exchange) 
to £85.3m. Adjusting for the acquisition of 
Securit in February 2012 and the divestment of 
FractureCode in July 2011, like-for-like growth 
was 10.0%. 
Revenue in tear tape was ahead 9%, and was 
boosted by winning further business in Asia with 
a major multinational tobacco customer, as well 
as successful new packaging and promotional 
innovations in the wrapped food sector. Growth 
in labels (of 14%) was driven by a strong result  
in the tobacco segment.
In authentication and identity solutions, 
underlying revenue growth (ie, excluding Securit 
and FractureCode) was 15%. During the year, 
we fulﬁlled more than one million packs for  
the roll-out of the next generation Blue Badge 
contract in the UK, which we were awarded  
at the end of 2011. In addition, we were very 
proud to supply accreditation solutions to the 
London 2012 Games.
Following on from the Queen’s Award for 
Enterprise which we received in 2011, we were 
honoured with further recognition for our 
innovation in 2012. In particular, we were 
pleased to win an Asian Manufacturing Award 
2012 in the Innovation Packaging Solution 
category for our Supastrip Variable Data Print 
(“VDP”) tape. This tape combines the latest in 
digital print technology with gravure printing, to 
deliver over 500 million unique digitally printed 
codes together with a promotional message at 
the consumer’s ﬁngertips. It is suitable for use on 
many different ﬂexible pack styles, and has been 
successfully used by a number of leading 
multinational consumer goods companies. 
We were also proud to be part of the team – 
together with Northgate Public Services and  
the Department for Transport – which was given 
the accolade of IT Project Team of the Year in the 
Organisational Excellence category at the 2012 
UK IT Industry Awards. The award was presented 
for successfully implementing the new national IT 
system for the Blue Badge Improvement Service, 
which is now deployed by all 206 local authorities 
throughout England, Scotland and Wales. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt increased 9.3% (at 
constant exchange) to £14.9m, equating to a 
150bps decline in the margin: on a like-for-like 
basis the margin was unchanged. Our continued 
focus on efﬁciency improvements such as 
waste reduction, combined with other cost 
reduction initiatives, was more than offset  
by further investment in authentication 
technologies and the initial dilutive impact 
from the acquisition of Securit.
Undertaking value-creating M&A
During the year, we added to the existing 
capabilities of our Payne Security personal 
identiﬁcation products business with the 
acquisition of Securit for a cash consideration  
of £6m. UK-based Securit distributes desktop 
personal identiﬁcation card systems, providing 
printers, software and associated accessories, 
and provides us with new opportunities in 
attractive growth segments, such as access 
control and membership. The integration of 
Securit to date is in line with expectations,  
with further consolidation expected in 2013.

 Management estimates the value of the global 
market for pressure sensitive tear tapes, labels 
and security technologies at c. £3bn, with 
annual growth ranging from 0-9% depending 
on the end-markets served.
Increasing consumer communication
Packaging is increasingly used to communicate 
brand messages, and to engage with 
consumers via promotions or competitions.
Functionality and convenience  
of packaging
There is a growing demand for packaging 
which not only offers optimum product 
protection, but is also easy for consumers  
to access.
Brand and identity protection  
and veriﬁcation
Brand owners and governmental bodies need 
to protect their brand assets and provide 
secure identiﬁcation of goods and individuals.
Sustainability and waste reduction
There is a growing need for resealable 
packaging to reduce waste, as consumers 
purchase larger pack sizes to increase value  
for money.
Provision of total solutions
Customers are increasingly seeking a partner 
which can deliver a complete offering – from 
design to delivery of the product.
Key new product opportunities
 Investment in technology, to develop  
novel, value-added packaging and 
authentication solutions
 Functional packaging beneﬁts, such as 
opening, closing and tamper evidence
 Eco-friendly packaging solutions, such  
as closing and resealing
 Creative and secure design solutions,  
to provide enhanced communication  
and authentication opportunities
 Complete card production and  
fulﬁlment offering, to provide an 
“end-to-end” solution 
Improving operational excellence  
and execution
To support future growth opportunities for the 
division, we completed a number of successful 
operational initiatives during the year. At Payne 
Cardiff, we installed a state-of-the-art labels 
printing press which will allow us to deliver an 
even wider portfolio of high impact packaging 
solutions to our customers. And we made 
further investment in authentication technologies 
and manufacturing capability of our Banbury,  
UK site.
Going forward, we are pleased that the Speciality 
Tapes activities of Duraco will also form part of 
the Coated & Security Products division. Bringing 
these two businesses together will allow for 
synergies in development, manufacturing and 
distribution, as well as a stronger go to market 
proposition from a wider portfolio. FY 2012 
comparatives for this new organisational 
structure are provided in note 30. 

As a business we believe in careful stewardship 
of the environment in which we operate and 
embody this philosophy in our business strategy. 
During the year, we continued to develop 
sustained, long-term environmental  
programmes affecting CO
2
 emission reduction, 
water consumption reduction, waste recycling, 
ecological impact and ongoing energy efﬁciency 
improvements. And we continued to make 
further progress towards these objectives,  
in particular delivering a further mid-teens 
reduction on our water consumption. 
In 2012, the Payne Cardiff facility secured OHSAS 
18001 accreditation, as scheduled. In addition,  
we were very pleased that Payne Security was 
awarded the coveted Intergraf CWA 15374:2005 
certiﬁcation as an accredited supplier to the secure 
printing industry for both private and government 
customers, measured against a stringent set of 
criteria. Details of the international accreditations 
held across the division are shown on page 47 .  
We were similarly pleased that four of our seven 
facilities achieved Gold status in the Filtrona Health 
& Safety awards, up from two in 201 1.
We continuously seek to monitor employee 
satisfaction by ensuring a high degree of 
management engagement with employees  
at all our locations. We were, therefore, very 
encouraged by the high response rate from across 
the division to the Group employee engagement 
survey, in particular that 92% of employees 
consider the division as good to work for and that 
91% have a strong sense of commitment to the 
business – both of which results are considerably 
above the average of the total universe of 
companies which undertake such surveys.

The Filter Products division is the world-leading 
independent provider of ﬁlter solutions to the 
tobacco industry, and comprises the following 
business activities. 
Our Filters business is the only global independent 
supplier of ﬁlters. Not only do we offer standard 
ﬁlters, but as the leading supplier of special ﬁlters 
we offer innovative solutions that meet the 
consumer-driven demands of the tobacco industry 
against a backdrop of ongoing legislative changes.
We also increasingly provide adjacent services  
to the tobacco industry. Our Scientiﬁc Services 
facility located in the UK was one of the ﬁrst 
independent externally accredited laboratories 
for the testing of cigarettes and ﬁlters, and has 
over 20 years’ experience of providing analytical 
services to both independent and multinational 
customers. Additionally, we offer a full bespoke 
range for the design, packing and packaging of 
ﬁlters for roll your own (“RYO”) brands, 
providing an efﬁcient and cost-effective solution 
to delivering retail-ready product to the market.
The Filter Products division supplies over 700 
product speciﬁcations to over 300 customers, 
including all the multinational tobacco companies. 
We have nine manufacturing facilities in nine 
countries, supported by a UK-based research 
facility and three regional development centres. 
 Increase innovation in special ﬁlters and  
grow the pipeline of proprietary projects,  
to meet customer needs for products with 
greater marketing appeal
 Expand capacity to satisfy growing  
demand for innovative ﬁlters in  
Eastern Europe and Asia
 Establish Scientiﬁc Services as a full  
solution provider to the tobacco industry
 Continue to beneﬁt from ongoing trend  
to more specialised ﬁlters, while still  
offering attractive low cost propositions

Our objective is to develop value-creating 
partnerships with our customers. We seek to 
leverage our long-standing experience, expertise 
and insight to provide innovative solutions to 
brand differentiation and identity, as well as 
excellence in both manufacturing and service. 
Our recognised ability to provide new value-
added products and services is key to the 
division’s future growth, as market dynamics  
in the tobacco industry continue to evolve.
Research in ﬁlters is carried out at the Filters 
Technology Centre in the UK, supported by three 
regional development centres. Together, they 
work closely with customers, to understand their 
speciﬁc needs and to deliver solutions at a pace 
appropriate to local market conditions and 
legislative requirements. Our offering is further 
enhanced by our ability to complement our 
customers’ own strengths and assets in a  
variety of tolling, or outsourced management, 
relationship arrangements, as well as our 
growing adjacent services activities.
We continuously upgrade our technology and 
footprint, to ensure we exceed our customers’ 
expectations and remain at the forefront of 
market trends. Our ﬂexible global manufacturing 
capability allows us to respond rapidly to  
market changes and customer demand for

 high standards of quality, cost control and 
production efﬁciency act as further sources  
of competitive advantage.

Innovation and joint development activity 
support balanced, proﬁtable growth
Revenue increased 16.9% (at constant exchange) 
to £233.6m. Underlying volumes were ahead  
of the prior year, with signiﬁcant value growth 
driven by the increase in special ﬁlters in all 
geographic regions. In FY 2012, Asia accounted 
for 56% of volumes (FY 2011: 54%).
Over and above continued success for our 
previous innovations such as ﬂavoured capsules, 
2012 also saw the successful launch of six 
proprietary new products into the market.  
These included the Autograph ﬁlter – the  
latest addition to our Icon range, and offering 
customers high impact visual differentiation 
possibilities for their brands – as well as a  
Super Slim version of our clove-ﬂavoured Kretek 
Aroma ﬁlter to meet the growing demand from 
the Indonesian market. We also built on  
our offering to the RYO segment, with the 
introduction of a Micro Slim ﬁlter in a Pop-a-
Tip™ format and a new packaging concept in 
the Push-and-Slide box, to allow consumers easy 
Our internationally 
accredited 
Scientiﬁc Services 
laboratory offers

access to their RYO ﬁlter tips. At the same time, 
we continued to work closely with our customers 
to develop bespoke solutions tailored to their 
speciﬁc needs, with such joint activity up over 
20% during the year. We support our future 
innovation capabilities through ongoing 
intellectual property development, and eleven 
patent and trademark applications were  
ﬁled in 2012. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt rose 23.3% (at constant 
exchange) to £28.9m, with the margin up 70bps. 
Higher raw material and other input costs were 
successfully mitigated by continued cost control, 
as well as quality enhancement initiatives and 
productivity improvements.
Undertaking value-adding M&A
Subsequent to the year end, we announced  
the formation of a joint venture in the UAE  
with BBM – one of India’s leading producers  
of tobacco products and by-products, as well  
as a leading cigarette exporter from India – to 
manufacture ﬁlter products. The joint venture in 
which Filtrona will be a majority shareholder will 
entail the construction of a new 29,000 sq. ft. 
facility, and is expected to be fully operational 
during Q3 2013. The formation of this joint 
venture agreement with BBM strengthens our 
presence in the growing Middle Eastern market 
– which is witnessing a growing trend in the 
more specialised Super Slim, charcoal and 
ﬂavoured ﬁlters – and underscores our 
commitment to being a trusted partner to  
our tobacco customers on a global basis. 
Improving operational excellence  
and execution
During the year, we signiﬁcantly expanded our 
Scientiﬁc Services (“FSS”) laboratory in Jarrow, 
UK, with investment in new state-of-the-art 
machinery and equipment, and a doubling in  
the number of technical staff. As a result, FSS 
has increased its capabilities and can now 
provide customers with a complete service  
of analytical and commercial testing, expert 
guidance and innovative product solutions.  
The laboratory is also in the process of making  
a number of new testing methods available in 
order to meet the updated US Food and Drug 
Administration requirements.
In addition, we continued with our investment  
in equipment across our key operational sites, 
including taking delivery of new ﬂexible, high 
speed combiners. This investment will contribute 
to continued improvements in quality, efﬁciency 
and responsiveness to our customers. At the 
same time we have successfully increased the 
utilisation of existing production assets, thanks 
to a number of internal initiatives aimed at 
improved ﬂexibility. Taken together, these 
operational improvements have resulted in a  
ﬁve billion rod increase in the available annual 
capacity of the division. 
In response to the need to meet increased 
demand from new business opportunities, 
investment in capacity at a number of sites is 
required. The additional demand will result in 
future incremental revenue, although it is not 
expected to have a material impact on the FY 
2013 results. 
36 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
 We are committed to the environment and  
its sustainability and, in seeking to secure 
operational efﬁciencies and cost reductions,  
the division focuses on the optimisation of 
energy usage and the development of new 
sustainable solutions.
Having introduced a division-wide system and 
been able to demonstrate improvement and 
accreditation in energy, in 2012 we again 
delivered a very strong reduction in both waste 
and CO
2
 emissions, while our energy use rose  
by less than our revenue growth.
We were proud to receive Gold status in the 
Filtrona Health & Safety Awards for the ﬁfth 
consecutive year at our ITC Filtrona India facility 
and for the third year running in Jordan, with  
a further two sites also gaining this accolade. 
Combined with our comprehensive programmes 
in this area, the division has achieved key 
international accreditations across its facilities, 
which are detailed on page 47. Four of our  
sites hold Level 7 accreditation by IQRS,  
an internationally recognised standard for 
business excellence.
Employee development is a key commitment  
of the division, and a new talent management 
framework was introduced during the year.  
Over and above our well established 
management development and graduate 
recruitment programmes, the framework is 
aimed at enhancing training, driving career 
progression and ensuring robust succession 
planning. As a result, we were pleased with  
the very high response rate of our employees  
to the Group engagement survey, with 91% 
considering their part of the business is good  
to work for and 90% having a strong sense of 
commitment – both results signiﬁcantly higher 
than the norm for the total universe of 
companies which undertake such surveys.



The global tobacco market is valued at c.
US$700bn, with broadly ﬂat cigarette retail 
volume growth.
Regulation
The tobacco industry is heavily regulated 
around the world on health grounds, with 
signiﬁcant restrictions on the way in which 
products can be marketed to consumers. 
Legislation continues to evolve, such as the 
current debate on “plain packaging”.
Illicit trade
Counterfeiting of tobacco products is a 
signiﬁcant and increasing challenge for  
the industry, undermining brand value, 
presenting a risk to consumers from low quality 
goods and reducing tax revenues. The illicit 
trade accounts for approximately 10% of 
duty-paid cigarette volumes and is estimated  
to be growing at c. 4% pa – well ahead  
of the overall industry.
Consumer engagement
As per capita income rises – particularly in 
eastern markets – so lifestyles change and new 
segments are created, with different consumer 
expectations and aspirations from the products 
which they purchase. As such, there is an 
increasing demand for new products to reﬂect 
these changes.
Consumer need
Consumers are increasingly concerned  
with environmental matters, such as 
sustainability and pollution, and the impact 
of products which they purchase. Such 
needs are often unspoken but create 
challenges for the industry to supply 
products which address such considerations.
 
Cost and price
As the price of cigarettes has continued to 
increase, growth opportunities have been 
created for other industry segments including 
RYO and Other Tobacco Products, such as, 
chewing tobacco.
Key new product opportunities
 Lifestyle solutions (eg, Slims / Super Slims, 
low / ultra low tar, “eco” ranges)

Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 37 Business Review | Review of Operations
 Vision 2015
The management of risk underpins the 
Company’s Vision 2015 strategy, focusing on  
the challenges which arise in the international 
environment in which Filtrona conducts business 
and reﬂecting the Company’s appetite for risk in 
the delivery of its business objectives. As such, 
risks are continuously monitored, associated 
action plans are reviewed, appropriate 
contingencies are provisioned and information  
is reported through established management 
control procedures.
The Company seeks to continuously improve its 
risk management processes and developed new 
systems during 2012 which serve to enhance the 
Company’s response to the risks inherent in its 
international business activities. 
Filtrona recognises that the ability to monitor, 
assess and respond to business risks may provide 
a competitive advantage. Reporting within the 
Group is structured so that key issues are 
escalated through the management team and 
ultimately to the Board if appropriate. Each area 
of the business is required to review its principal 
areas of risk and uncertainty formally and 
regularly. This is an ongoing process to ensure 
that there are clear and consistent procedures  
for monitoring, updating and implementing 
appropriate controls to manage identiﬁed risks. 
Filtrona’s short- and long-term performance can 
be impacted by many risks and uncertainties, not 
all of which are within the Company’s control. 
The Company is subject to the general risks and 
uncertainties which impact other international 
organisations, including political instability in the 
countries in which the Company operates and 
sources raw materials, the impact of natural 
disasters and changes in general economic 
conditions, including currency and interest rate 
ﬂuctuations, tax regimes and raw material costs.
Detailed below are the principal risks and 
uncertainties which the Board believes are 
speciﬁc to Filtrona having regard to its strategic 
objectives, together with the Company risk 
management response thereto. The details 
provided are not exhaustive and do not purport 
to be a complete explanation of all potentially 
relevant issues. There may be other risks and 
uncertainties which are unknown to the Board 
or which may not be deemed by the Board to 
be material at present but which could prove  
to be so. 
Effective management of risk and opportunity is 
essential to the protection of Filtrona’s reputation and 
the achievement of sustainable shareholder value

A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion 
of any of Filtrona’s manufacturing or distribution 
facilities, due to accident, labour issues, ﬁre, 
weather conditions, terrorist attack, natural 
disaster or otherwise which whether short- or 
long-term could adversely affect the Company’s 
ability to meet the demands of its customers. 
Some of the assets maintained by the Company, 
such as tooling and IT systems, are critical to the 
manufacture and delivery of particular products.
Filtrona seeks to manage the risk of potential 
disruption of the supply of its customers by:
 Operating within a ﬂexible global 
infrastructure 
 Installing ﬁre and other risk prevention 
systems 
 Implementing disaster recovery and business 
continuity plans
 Assessing operational risks
 Maintaining comprehensive insurance
A material disruption to operational facilities or 
the loss of critical assets may negatively affect 
the Company’s:
 Production capability and asset base
 Supply chain management
 Customer relationships
 Reputation
 Revenue
 Proﬁt
 Financial condition
Filtrona faces pressures from direct competitors 
as well as competition from alternative 
technologies. Some of the Company’s 
competitors may derive competitive advantage 
from greater ﬁnancial resources, economies of 
scale, additional purchasing power or a lower 
cost base, and Filtrona may face aggressive 
pricing practices.
Filtrona seeks to mitigate the risk of competitive 
pressure by:
 Sustained investment in research and 
development to develop the quality and 
breadth of its product and service offering
 Exploiting its innovative and manufacturing 
capabilities in new technologies, products 
and services
 Developing long-term relationships with 
customers at a senior level
 Protecting its intellectual property rights
 Expanding its international distribution,  
sales and marketing expertise
 Investing in both organic and acquisition 
growth opportunities
Demand for competitors’ products and the 
development of competing technologies  
may result in: 
 Loss of market positions 
 Erosion of margins 
 Intellectual property challenges
 Decline in revenue
 Decline in proﬁtability
 Deterioration in ﬁnancial condition
Filtrona’s development and growth has 
beneﬁted from acquisitions and the success  
of start-up operations. The rate of any future 
business development may in part be dependent 
on the success of additional acquisitions and 
new start-up operations. There can be no 
assurance that the Company will be successful  
in completing and integrating suitable 
acquisitions or developing and expanding 
further start-up operations. 
Filtrona addresses the challenges of 
international business development with:
 Experienced and skilled management 
 Detailed due diligence and planning
 Project risk reviews
 External expert advice 
If Filtrona fails to meet the challenges  
of business development arising from 
acquisitions and start-up operations,  
the Company may experience:
 Lower growth rates
 Delay in the achievement of strategic 
objectives
 Increased costs 
 Reduced proﬁtability

In some of Filtrona’s businesses, particularly ﬁlter 
products and packaging solutions, the customer 
base is relatively concentrated. In addition, trends 
in certain markets, particularly in the oil and gas 
industry, may reduce the demands for the 
Company’s products. Should Filtrona’s customers 
decide to satisfy their requirements internally or 
from other suppliers, and if Filtrona were unable 
to secure new business, this could result in  
a signiﬁcant loss of business. 
To counteract the Company’s exposure to  
a number of key customers, Filtrona:
 Invests in innovative, high quality,  
value-added products and services
 Develops long-term relationships and  
loyalty with customers at all levels through 
key account management techniques
 Seeks new markets and growth 
opportunities to expand the customer base
The loss of certain of Filtrona’s key customers 
exposes the Company to:
 Reduced revenue
 Restructuring costs
 Proﬁt decline
 Deterioration in ﬁnancial condition
 Reputational damage
Some of Filtrona’s businesses are dependent  
on the availability of specialist raw materials or 
components which are incorporated into the 
Company’s products. Key raw materials may  
be subject to price ﬂuctuations from supply 
shortage. If rapid increases occur in the price  
of such raw materials, including energy costs,  
the Company’s revenue and proﬁtability may  
be materially and adversely affected. 
To counteract the Company’s exposure  
to increases in raw material costs or supply 
shortages, Filtrona seeks to:
 Adopt appropriate procurement practices
 Secure longer-term supply agreements
 Implement cost recovery programmes
 Ensure the availability of alternative  
supply options
 Use consignment stock
If Filtrona is exposed to raw material price 
increases or supply shortages, the Company 
may suffer:
 Disruption to supply
 Increased costs
 Proﬁt decline
 Reduced revenue
A key component to Filtrona’s future success  
is the ability to develop new and innovative 
products and services. In addition to seeking 
internationally applied patent and trademark 
rights, the Company relies on unpatented 
proprietary know-how and trade secrets.  
In the event that Filtrona is unable to respond  
to competitive technological advances or to 
protect its intellectual property portfolio, the 
future performance of the Company may be 
adversely affected. 
To counteract the Company’s exposure  
to the erosion of its intellectual property  
portfolio, Filtrona:
 Invests in R&D
 Secures formal registrations of patent and 
trademark rights
 Adopts appropriate conﬁdentiality and 
licensing practices
 Monitors potential infringements and takes 
appropriate enforcement actions
Failure to develop and protect intellectual 
property rights exposes the Company to:
 Reduced revenue
 Proﬁt decline
 Litigation
 Reputational damage

Filtrona’s international operations are dependent 
on existing key executives and certain other 
employees in order to sustain, develop and grow 
its businesses, and there can be no assurances 
that these employees will remain with the 
Company. The success of the Company will 
reﬂect its ability to retain, attract and motivate 
highly qualiﬁed executives and other personnel 
equipped to deliver Filtrona’s strategic objectives.
In order to manage the risk of personnel 
change, Filtrona: 
 Reviews personal development and 
succession planning
 Sets appropriate key performance indicators
 Conducts management development 
schemes and other training programmes
 Sets effective remuneration programmes
 Provides long-term share-based  
incentive plans
 Uses a talent management system 
 Has increased the number of graduates  
on its development programme
If Filtrona fails to retain, attract or motivate the 
required calibre of employees, its operational 
performance and ﬁnancial condition may be 
materially impacted by a lack of:
 Experience
 Expertise 
 Commercial relationships
 Market insight
 Product innovation
Risk related to regulatory and legislative changes 
involves the possible inability of the Company  
to comply with current, changing or new 
requirements. Many of Filtrona’s current business 
activities are subject to increasing regulation and 
enforcement activity by relevant authorities.  
As the Company moves into new markets and 
territories in pursuit of its strategic priorities, 
Filtrona is exposed to new and additional 
compliance risk.
In order to manage compliance risk Filtrona:
 Establishes a clear compliance culture from 
the top down
 Conducts risk assessments and ongoing 
compliance reviews
 Implements policies and procedures
 Provides behavioural guidance and training 
to all employees
 Monitors compliance through veriﬁcation 
procedures 
Failure by the Company or its employees or 
others acting on its behalf to abide by the  
laws and regulations could result in:
 Administrative, civil or criminal liability
 Signiﬁcant ﬁnes and penalties
 Suspension or debarment of the Company  
from trading
 Reputational damage
 Loss of commercial relationships
A signiﬁcant part of Filtrona’s business relates  
to the supply of ﬁlter products and packaging 
solutions to manufacturers in the tobacco 
industry. Future performance may be affected  
by trends in the tobacco industry, such as 
changes in the consumption of ﬁlter products, 
self manufacture and increasingly restrictive 
regulations. Tobacco-related litigation could  
also adversely affect Filtrona, although there  
is no history of the Company being involved  
in such claims.
In seeking to minimise the potential impact of 
the exposure to the tobacco industry, Filtrona:
 Invests in the research and development of 
innovative value-added products and services
 Targets growth opportunities outside the 
manufacture of ﬁlter products
 Focuses on low cost ﬁlter production
 Takes internal and external legal advice  
to manage litigation risk
 Seeks to add value with a range of low  
cost and innovative packaging solutions
Filtrona’s relationship with the tobacco industry 
may lead to:
 Reduced revenue 
 Restructuring costs
 Proﬁt decline
 Reputational damage
 Deterioration in ﬁnancial condition

Filtrona recognises the signiﬁcance and importance of being a responsible 
corporate citizen in the workplace, marketplace, environment and community. 
The Company’s international operations fulﬁl their responsibility to record, 
monitor and make publicly available the potential impact of its activities.  
In pursuing its corporate strategy, Filtrona’s aim is to adopt business 
practices that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable, 
and to promote these to its stakeholders in order to strengthen relationships, 
share knowledge and encourage best practice. 
The Company’s risk management processes include consideration of the 
potential impact of corporate responsibility issues on Filtrona’s performance. 
The Company’s investment decisions take into account appropriate 
evaluations of the potential consequences for its employees, customers  
and suppliers and the environment. 
The Filtrona Values are fundamental to the Company’s adoption of  
the highest standards of business ethics and integrity that underpin its 
relationships with both internal and external stakeholders. Filtrona’s culture 
is one of openness, integrity and accountability. Employees are encouraged 
to act fairly in their dealings with fellow colleagues, customers, suppliers 
and business partners.
The Filtrona Values can be found on the Company’s website 
www.ﬁltrona.com.
Workplace
Health and safety
Filtrona’s overriding commitment in the workplace continues to be the 
health, safety and welfare of its employees and all those who visit the 
Company’s operations. Filtrona has an excellent health and safety record, 
and a culture of safety is deeply embedded within the Group. The Board 
provides health and safety leadership and the Chief Executive has primary 
responsibility for setting the principal health and safety objectives within 
which the detailed policies operate, and for reviewing progress against 
those objectives.
The Company has designed procedures and developed a culture which 
aims for continuous improvement with the sharing of best practice in all 
areas of health and safety, in addition to strict compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations. The degree of autonomy afforded to local management 
allows them to set the agenda best suited to the requirements of individual 
businesses, but subject always to the proper implementation of the core 
health and safety policies and principles which Filtrona has adopted. 
Ongoing initiatives are designed to monitor, assess and drive performance. 
Investigations are carried out into all circumstances that may have resulted  
in injury or near miss incidents. Continued reporting of near miss incidents 
and “non work” related injuries has enhanced the Company’s ability to 
learn from potentially hazardous conditions and prevent their reoccurrence 
or escalation into more serious incidents.
The Group-wide intranet-based management reporting system facilitates 
an extensive live programme of active monitoring, that measures in detail 
how successful the Company is in managing the safety of its workplaces  
at individual site level. 
Filtrona has an established Group Health, Safety & Environmental Council 
(“the FHSEC”) which is an international group and includes senior operating 
management from all divisions. The FHSEC’s primary task is to review 
progress with the implementation of Health, Safety & Environment 
(“HS&E”) policy and performance and set objectives and standards for the 
Group worldwide. The FHSEC meets bi-annually and discusses the physical, 
regulatory and ﬁnancial risks associated with all HS&E issues including 
climate change. There is a mechanism for identifying and allocating suitable 
resources to speciﬁcally identify risks and for reporting to the Board. With 
effect from 1 January 2013, the new Group Operations Director will work 
alongside the Chief Executive in being responsible for Group health and 
safety matters. The FHSEC will be amalgamated into the quarterly 
operations meetings which are planned for 2013.
The Company manages occupational health by identifying key risk activities, 
undertaking health assessments and, where appropriate, implementing 
health surveillance programmes. The Company has achieved the 
Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems OHSAS 18001 for all 
its principal manufacturing sites except Bridlington, UK, which is currently 
being progressed and expected to reach the standard during the year.  
The recently acquired sites are given a period of two years to reach the 
required standard, in accordance with Filtrona policy. 
As part of their integration, all businesses which join the Filtrona Group 
have to ensure that they achieve the Company’s health and safety reporting 
requirements within a suitable timescale. 
Businesses undertake extensive training programmes which are particularly 
focused on the key, or most frequent, risks in their operations. Training in 
risk assessment and root-cause analysis features strongly in the Company’s 
health and safety management. 
Details of the Company’s health and safety performance for 2012 and 
subsequent progress throughout 2013 can be viewed on the Company’s 
website www.ﬁltrona.com.
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 43 Business Review | Corporate Responsibility The Company has implemented Filtrona Group Safety Awards which 
reward manufacturing sites with Gold, Silver or Bronze status on the basis 
of their annual performance assessed against increasingly stringent criteria 
set by the FHSEC. The criteria governing these awards is based upon: 
achieving a high Filtrona audit score; OHSAS standard accreditation; regular 
health and safety meetings; availability of suitably trained employees on 
site; completion of all critical risk assessments; and achieving accident 
reduction targets. 
2012 2011 2010
Gold awards 10 715
Silver awards 5 95
Bronze awards 7 52
The Filtrona Chief Executive’s Special Award for health, safety and 
environment recognises the achievements of the division or site that  
best meets the following criteria: 
 Demonstrates a signiﬁcant impact on work methods or behaviours, 
resulting in improvements to employee perception of health, safety  
and environment standards
 Involves the majority of employees 
 Utilises novel or interactive media or methods 
In 2012, the award was won by the Moss Plastic Parts (“Moss”) business 
based at Kidlington, for being the ﬁrst facility in the Group to be accredited  
to the ISO 50001 standard. This important standard will establish a more 
systematic and sustainable approach to managing energy. Conformance to 
the standard provides evidence that the facility has implemented sustainable 
energy management systems, completed a baseline assessment of its energy 
use, and is committed to continual improvement in energy performance. 
ISO 50001 is designed for widespread use by all types of organisations.  
If widely adopted, it is anticipated that it could inﬂuence up to 60% of the 
world’s energy use across many economic sectors, and that it will become 
increasingly prevalent globally. The value of certiﬁcation may be driven by 
potential utility incentive programmes requiring ISO 50001 certiﬁcation and 
market forces within supply chains.
The standard entails a series of processes that enable the business to develop 
an energy management plan, and within this to identify areas at greatest 
risk, gain understanding of energy risk exposure and address signiﬁcant 
aspects of energy performance. 
With ever increasing energy costs and environmental legislation, it is prudent 
to invest in an effective energy management system for today. ISO 50001 
does not include prescriptive energy performance targets, rather it provides 
a framework through which Moss can set and pursue its own goals for 
improving energy performance without compromising the competitiveness 
of the business.
Employees
Filtrona’s employees are a vital resource in the pursuit of operational excellence 
and the provision of quality products and service to its customers. The skills 
and expertise of Filtrona’s employees drive the innovation which enables 
the Company to provide added value to its customers, enhance supply 
chain logistics with its suppliers and reduce the environmental impact  
of its operations. 
The Company regularly reviews its organisational structure to ensure that 
the business has the necessary personnel to deliver its strategic priorities. 
Filtrona understands the importance of having the right people with the 
right skills now and in the future to deliver the exceptional service and 
expertise which is the bedrock of our long-term relationships with our 
customers. To deliver that service and expertise, Filtrona is continually 
improving its comprehensive talent pool, from graduates to senior 
management. Filtrona runs a very successful graduate training programme 
which, historically, recruited from Europe and North Americas. 2011 saw 
the introduction of graduates from Asia, and during 2012 this was further 
expanded to include candidates from South America.
Key strategic aspects of recruitment, training and development are overseen 
or co-ordinated at a Group level to ensure consistency of approach, to 
identify strategic threats and opportunities and to open up a wider range 
of opportunities for our employees.
Filtrona encourages its employees to develop and manage their own 
careers. It facilitates this by providing relevant job training and, where 
appropriate, aims to ﬁll vacancies with existing staff where employees  
are suitably qualiﬁed and experienced.
Filtrona is committed to improving employee engagement and learning 
more about the needs of its workforce. In addition to the impact of the 
training and development programmes, employee engagement is enhanced 
by the communication practices which have been adopted across the 
businesses. During the year Filtrona undertook its ﬁrst Group-wide 
employee engagement survey, with 75% of the employees responding.
Filtrona values highly the commitment of its employees and recognises the 
importance of communication to good working relationships and practices. 
The Company seeks to ensure that employees are informed on matters 
relating to their employment and on ﬁnancial and economic factors 
affecting the businesses. The Company actively seeks feedback and ideas 
from employees to improve its operations, and forums appropriate  
to Filtrona’s local businesses have been established to allow employees  
to voice their views as to how the Company should fulﬁl the demands  
of all its local and international stakeholders. The Company’s European 
Information and Consultation Forum facilitates the discussion of issues 
across all of its operations in the European Union.
The Company recognises the importance of, and the beneﬁts to be derived 
from, diversity across its international operations and is committed to 
offering equal opportunities to all people without discrimination of any 
form. Filtrona remunerates fairly with respect to skills, performance and 
local market conditions. 
The Company gives full and fair consideration to employment applications 
by disabled people. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every 
effort is made to ensure that the training, career development and 
promotion opportunities available to disabled persons are as far as possible 
identical to those of other non-disabled employees.
Throughout its global activities Filtrona supports human rights as set down 
by the United Nations Declaration and its applicable International Labour 
Organisation conventions. Operations based in India, Indonesia, Jordan  
and Thailand are also accredited to SA 8000 which details fundamental 
principles of human rights. 
44 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Corporate Responsibility continued Marketplace
Filtrona’s reputation with its customers and suppliers and in the 
communities where it operates, is based not only on the quality of  
its performance, but also on the integrity of its management of the 
workplace and the environment, and its ethical and responsible conduct 
in the marketplace. The development and continuation of long-term 
business relationships reﬂects the trust placed in the Company, and such 
commitments are an important component in the ongoing success of 
the Company.
Filtrona’s Code of Business Ethics is applicable to all its businesses around 
the world. The policy details the standards expected by Filtrona in the 
conduct of its business and its relationships with third parties, including  
free and fair competition, the prohibition of bribery and political donations, 
and provides general guidance on honest and fair dealings with suppliers, 
customers and local and national authorities. 
Filtrona is committed to working with its suppliers to ensure the welfare of 
workers and employment conditions within its supply chain meet or exceed 
internationally recognised standards. 
Environment
Filtrona applies a structured approach to minimising its environmental 
impact by:
 Implementing and maintaining formal environmental systems 
accredited to ISO 14001 on a global basis
 Measuring consumption and emissions, and setting targets  
to improve performance
 Carrying out environmental impact assessments and developing  
site management plans
 Providing training to employees and engaging with customers  
and suppliers to raise environmental awareness
 Providing facilities to segregate and reuse or recycle waste
Filtrona is listed in the FTSE4Good Index which is designed to measure the 
performance of companies striving to meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards, and to facilitate investment in those companies 
where corporate responsibility issues are an inﬂuencing factor in an 
investor’s decision-making process. 
Filtrona supports the activities of the Carbon Trust and participated in the  
10th annual Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP“) environmental impact survey.  
It is the Company’s intention to participate in the CDP survey during 2013.
The UK Carbon Reduction Commitment (“CRC”) legislation became 
effective during 2010. This standard ensures commitment to an improved 
carbon footprint and enhanced reputation. The CRC is designed to drive 
energy efﬁciency and carbon reduction by giving organisations a ﬁnancial 
incentive through emissions trading. Filtrona continues to apply the 
principles of the CRC to its global operations and will be well placed to 
address future anticipated legislative changes in its operating regions.
The recently published CRC Performance League Table (“PLT”) ranked 
Filtrona in the top 10% of companies. The 2012-13 PLT is based on actions  
that participants have taken to show that they are committed to energy 
efﬁciency within their organisations. Participants get credit where they:
 Have a proportion of their CRC emissions certiﬁed under one of the 
seven carbon management schemes which the Environment Agency 
has accredited
 Have a proportion of their CRC electricity and gas supplies measured 
through voluntarily installed automatic meter reading devices, dynamic 
un-metered supply and daily read gas meters in year one
Given the diversity of Filtrona’s international operations, local management 
drives environmental performance based on divisional objectives set in 
accordance with Filtrona’s environmental policy. Copies of the policy  
can be found on the Company’s website www.ﬁltrona.com.
Filtrona uses a variety of indicators relevant to each of the operating 
divisions to monitor environmental performance, but the following  
core impacts are identiﬁed for the Group as a whole:
 Greenhouse gas emission from energy use, including electricity,  
natural gas, heating fuel, transport and travel
 Use of resources, including water
 Generation and disposal of waste
Filtrona is continually seeking to ensure reduction in its use of natural 
resources, and has established research and development facilities in the 
UK, Asia and the US to investigate the use of renewable resources and 
recyclable / biodegradable versions of products.

Filtrona is committed to ensuring good environmental practice at all  
its locations, and in its operational processes and investment decisions. 
Filtrona’s principal manufacturing sites are ISO 14001 accredited, and all  
of the Company’s European businesses comply with EU and domestic 
waste management regulations. 
Due to the scale of Filtrona’s international operations, the use of energy  
has both environmental and commercial importance. Where possible,  
and ﬁnancially viable, energy from renewable resources is utilised to  
limit environmental impact, commercial risk and costs.
Filtrona actively engages with its employees, customers and suppliers  
to exploit opportunities offered by new technologies, improved process 
operations and novel materials, to reduce its environmental impact and 
improve proﬁtability further.
Supplier standards are subject to review by the Company’s employees  
who audit their environmental credentials.
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 45 Business Review | Corporate Responsibility The FHSEC provides an opportunity to share best environmental practices 
and waste minimisation initiatives across all the Company’s sites. Filtrona  
is committed to respecting the environment and seeking practical ways  
to lessen the impact of its business activities. The Group Environmental 
Award has been designed to give additional recognition to those sites with 
projects or campaigns that further that objective, and is presented to the 
most successful and innovative environmental improvement or initiative  
on a site or division which meets one or more of the following criteria:
 Reduction in emissions
 Re-cycling of waste product
 Waste reduction
 Energy efﬁciency
 Efﬁcient use of raw material
 Use of bio-degradable materials
And which impacts one or all of:
 Local community
 Local ecology
 Public perception of the business
 Proﬁtability of the Company
In 2012 the Group Environmental Award was awarded to Porous 
Technologies, Reinbek, Germany for an Energy Management System that 
has reduced and controlled energy consumption by 30kW per annum. 
Community
Filtrona’s commitment to being a responsible corporate citizen extends  
to support for appropriate non-political and non-sectarian projects across  
a range of organisations and charities. Regardless of regional or national 
boundaries, the Company aims to support the creation of prosperous, 
educated, sustainable and healthy communities in the countries and 
cultures in which it operates. In its attempts to bring beneﬁts back to 
those communities whose support provides a basis for Filtrona’s success, 
the Company has focused on education and enterprise, health and welfare 
and the environment, with support driven at a local, rather than a 
corporate level. The approach is to support and enhance employee efforts 
in their communities through the application of the Company’s resources. 
In pursuit of its aims within the community, Filtrona has developed 
targeted programmes for local communities, often involving commercial 
sponsorship and signiﬁcant employee engagement through direct 
involvement or secondment.
Ethics
Filtrona’s culture is one of openness, integrity and accountability. Employees 
are required to act fairly in their dealings with fellow colleagues, suppliers, 
customers and business partners. All employees undertake training on the 
Company’s Code of Business Ethics which is updated annually. In addition 
all employees are required to review and conﬁrm their acceptance of critical 
Group policies, with the majority of employees being required to review 
and accept all of the Group policies. Filtrona operates a conﬁdential 
whistleblowing policy called “Right to Speak”, with an external call centre 
which enables all Group employees to raise any concerns.
Filtrona adopts a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption which 
extends to all business dealings and transactions in which the Company is 
involved. This includes prohibiting political donations, offering or receiving 
inappropriate gifts and making facilitation payments.

Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 51 Corporate Governance | Board of Directors Dear Shareholder
2012 saw Filtrona continue to make very good progress in the delivery  
of Vision 2015 and its strategic objectives. Organic growth and acquisition 
activity have together established a strong base for the Group to further 
develop its operations on a global basis with entry into both new end- 
markets and geographies. 
Risk appetite
The Board continues to focus on strategy and, with the executive 
management team, sets the targets for the Group. The executive 
management team is empowered to deliver against those targets, 
through appropriate levels of delegated authority and support. Much  
of the Board’s time has been spent on setting the risk appetite for the 
Group, and monitoring the risks within our businesses, while giving the 
executive management team freedom to deliver long-term growth in 
shareholder value.
Board responsibilities
The rigorous monitoring of ﬁnancial and operational performance has 
remained fundamental to the fulﬁlment of the Board’s responsibilities 
during the year. The pace of successful change within the Group remains 
founded on strong governance based on transparency and integrity driven 
by an effective Board, with appropriate internal controls and a comprehensive 
understanding of risk. 
Code compliance
I am pleased to conﬁrm that the Group complied throughout the year with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010. The required regulatory and 
governance assurances are provided throughout this report. The Board  
has received regular updates on the variety of legislative and governance 
related developments which occurred during the year and which are yet  
to be ﬁnalised, and I am committed to ensuring that the highest standards 
of governance and compliance are maintained across the Group.
 
Audit Committee
The work of the Audit Committee has continued to focus on the integrity 
of ﬁnancial reporting and the oversight of the risk management process 
and internal controls across the Group. The beneﬁts of the good progress 
made by the Group Assurance function during its ﬁrst full year of operation 
are being seen, and the continued development of its work will be 
important to ensure the Company’s expansion does not prejudice the 
strength of its controls and processes.
Remuneration Committee
The task of the Remuneration Committee was particularly challenging  
in 2012 in seeking to fairly reward executives for some very strong results, 
and setting remuneration at levels which will attract new key executives to 
the Group, while being sensitive to the restraint expected in the current 
economic environment. The importance of the drive to retain, attract and 
motivate the team required to deliver the strategic objectives of Vision 2015 
and beyond, necessitates the Remuneration Committee to ensure that the 
Company’s remuneration practices and incentives are appropriate while 
maintaining a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders. Indeed, 
the increased levels of share ownership required of the Group Leadership 
Team illustrates the commitment to ensuring that alignment. 
 
As the Company has continued 
its strong growth and its 
expansion into new end-markets 
and geographies, so your Board 
has successfully responded to 
the increasing demands of the 
governance agenda.

52 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Chairman’s Letter
JEFF HARRIS 
Chairman Core values and behaviours
I strongly believe that good governance is founded on the core values and 
behaviours established by the Board and communicated down through  
the Group. The Group has a strong culture of high standards of business 
ethics based on clear principles. The Board’s participation in the Company’s 
compliance training programmes, and its commitment to the development 
of new policies and practices in response to the increasing level of regulation 
impacting on its global operations, serves to ensure that the “tone from 
the top” is clearly understood and reinforced.
 
As the Company continues to grow in size and complexity, one of the 
greatest challenges facing the Board is to ensure that we have in place  
the right people, culture and processes to exploit fully the opportunities  
for further balanced growth and to effectively manage the risks to which 
the Company is exposed. 
Board evaluation
It is essential that the Company has a fully engaged and committed Board 
with an appropriate mix of skills, experience and knowledge, which is 
capable of engaging in positive and constructive debate to meet such 
challenges. In order to assess how the Board is performing, during the year 
an external facilitator, Lintstock, was engaged to carry out a full evaluation 
of the Board and its Committees. The process consisted of a questionnaire, 
and with one-to-one structured interviews with each Director and 
members of the GMC. The Board discussed the conclusions and 
recommendations of the report.
 
The Lintstock report concluded that the Board continued to fulﬁl its 
responsibilities effectively, although there are certain areas where  
further improvements in Board processes could be made.
In particular, there was an evaluation of Board meeting timing and agendas 
to focus sufﬁcient time on the critical issues, and greater and better 
interaction between the Board and management teams so that all 
understood their respective responsibilities and roles. 
I will be working with my Board colleagues to address these issues over  
the forthcoming months, and the intention is to continue the work with 
Lintstock so that we can track the progress being made by the Board in 
responding to these initiatives. 
Employee engagement
Independent of the Lintstock review, a Group-wide employee engagement 
survey was undertaken by Employee Feedback. A very high response rate 
from three quarters of our worldwide colleagues indicated strong levels of 
satisfaction with Filtrona as an employer and real support for Vision 2015, 
with 85% of respondents optimistic about the future of Filtrona. Detailed 
follow up of comments and recommendations on a site-by-site basis is 
being undertaken, and I am very grateful to all of my colleagues who 
participated in the survey.
I visited a number of Filtrona facilities during the year and intend continuing 
to tour a number of other sites during 2013. I am always impressed by the 
commitment and enthusiasm of my colleagues wherever I travel in the 
world. In particular, visits to Malaysia and Indonesia reminded me of the 
importance of Asia to the Group’s future. The Board visited the Company’s 
facility at Kidlington, UK in October following its approval of a substantial 
investment at the site, and it is anticipated that Board meetings will be held 
at least at two operational sites during 2013 to further enhance the Board’s 
visibility and provide the opportunity for better communication with the 
local teams.

Succession and diversity
The Nomination Committee will continue its work, having proper regard  
to the beneﬁts of diversity, to ensure that the Board composition continues 
to be appropriate for the Company as it makes further progress towards  
its strategic objectives. The Board’s commitment remains to ensure that  
it employs the best people to do the best job for the beneﬁt of the Group 
and its shareholders, in line with its diversity policy.
During the year there were a number of senior management changes as 
the Group seeks to secure a talent base capable of delivering its strategic 
objectives. Matthew Gregory’s promotion to Group Finance Director  
in September 2012 reﬂects the quality available within the experienced 
management team and the beneﬁts of continuity at a time of substantial 
change in our business. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Steve 
Crummett for his support and contribution in driving forward Filtrona at the 
inception of Vision 2015 as Group Finance Director, and to wish him well  
in his future career. 
As previously announced, Lars Emilson tendered his resignation as  
a Non-Executive Director for reasons of ill-health on 5 February 2013.  
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Lars for his wise counsel  
and valued contribution to the development and success of the Company 
during the past six years and wish him a rapid return to full health.
While the Nomination Committee primarily devotes its attention to Board 
succession, the Board has increased its focus on reviewing the quality of 
executive management and the processes for ﬁnding and developing a 
diverse, mobile and international capability. Additional resources have been 
made available to pursue this objective, with the implementation of an 
improved global talent management system to identify and manage the 
talent pipeline. In 2012, I was encouraged by the record intake for the 
Filtrona Graduate Development Programme, which included participants  
from countries such as Indonesia for the ﬁrst time.
Governance agenda
In summary, as the Company continues its strong growth, I think we have 
made excellent progress during the year in response to the increasing 
demands of the governance agenda, both internally and externally. 
However, just as the Group continually looks to new ways to improve its 
ﬁnancial and operational performance, I and the rest of the Board will 
continue to be receptive to ways in which we can continue to develop our 
practices, to ensure our governance performance delivers additional value 
for the beneﬁt of shareholders and reﬂects the highest standards.

Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 55 Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Framework
Corporate Governance Framework The Filtrona Board is accountable to all the 
Company’s stakeholders for the standards  
of governance which are maintained across 
Filtrona’s diverse range of global businesses 
Filtrona conﬁrms that throughout the year ended 31 December 2012  
the Company has complied with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010 (the “Code”).
For the 2013 Annual Report, the Company will be applying the Code which 
was published in September 2012 and effective for accounting periods 
commencing thereafter.
A copy of the Code can be viewed on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website www.frc.org.uk.
For the 2012 Annual Report, the Company applies the Code’s principles of 
openness, integrity and accountability through its own behaviour, corporate 
governance best practice and by adopting, as appropriate and proportionate 
for a company of the size and nature of Filtrona, recommendations of 
relevant professional bodies.
The Company’s governance structure, based on the leadership principles  
of the Code, was reviewed during the year and the Board continues to 
believe that the structure remains appropriate. The Board is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the Company, and its role is to 
provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Company within a framework  
of prudent and effective controls which enables risk to be assessed and 
managed in the pursuit of the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Board composition and independence
During 2012, the Filtrona Board continued to comprise a Non-Executive 
Chairman, two Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors.  
The Board is of the view that it has a highly competent Chairman and that 
the members of the Board in conjunction with the senior executive teams 
are well equipped to drive, and are capable of delivering, the Company’s 
Vision 2015 strategy. The Chairman and each of the other Non-Executive 
Directors have considerable international experience at a senior level in the 
management of activities broadly similar to those carried out by Filtrona 
and the material issues likely to arise for the Company.
Following Steve Crummett’s resignation from the Board in September 
2012, Matthew Gregory was appointed an Executive Director and  
assumed responsibility as Group Finance Director. 
Biographical details of all the current Directors are set out on pages 50 to 51.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separately held and 
are so deﬁned as to ensure a clear separation of responsibilities. Details are 
available on the Company website www.ﬁltrona.com. The Chairman leads 
the Board and ensures its effectiveness. The Chief Executive is responsible 
for the executive management and performance of Filtrona’s operations.
Roles
The Senior Independent (“SI”) Non-Executive Director, Paul Drechsler,  
can be contacted via the Company’s registered ofﬁce. In that role he is 
available to shareholders to discuss and develop an understanding of their 
issues and any concerns which cannot be resolved by discussions with the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive or Group Finance Director or where such 
contact is inappropriate. 
56 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance Report For the year ended 31 December 2012 it was the opinion of the Board 
that Paul Drechsler, Lars Emilson and Terry Twigger were each considered 
to be independent of management. In assessing independence, the 
Board considers that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are 
independent of management and free from business and other relationships 
which could interfere with the exercise of independent judgement now 
and in the future. The Board believes that any shareholdings of the 
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors serve to align their interests with 
those of the shareholders. 
The Board considers that the Non-Executive Directors provide an 
independent view in Board discussions and in the development of the 
Company’s strategy. Non-Executive Directors also ensure a sound basis for 
good corporate governance of the Company, challenging management’s 
performance and, in conjunction with the Executive Directors, ensuring 
that rigorous ﬁnancial controls and systems of risk management are 
maintained as appropriate to the needs of the businesses within Filtrona. 
The Board is content that the Non-Executive Directors devote sufﬁcient 
time to the business of Filtrona. 
The letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors are available for 
review at the Company’s registered ofﬁce and prior to the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”).
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all new Directors seek 
election to the Board at the AGM following their appointment. In addition, 
the Board has agreed that, in compliance with the Code, all current Directors 
will put themselves forward for re-election on an annual basis. Following 
the Board performance evaluation undertaken during the ﬁnancial year,  
the Board is satisﬁed that each of the Directors being put forward for 
re-election continues to be effective and that their ongoing commitment  
to the role is undiminished.
The responsibilities of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are deﬁned within the Committees’ Terms of Reference,  
copies of which are available at www.ﬁltrona.com. 
The conduct of Board matters
In managing the affairs of the Company, the Board has adopted a schedule 
of reserved matters which are reviewed annual, including:











The detailed implementation of all these and general operational matters 
are the responsibility of executive senior management and regular formal 
management reports are provided to the Board. 
During 2012, the Board was closely engaged in the detailed monitoring  
of performance and the actions necessary to maintain the balanced, 
proﬁtable growth of the Company in accordance with its Vision 2015 
objectives. It also remained focused on the longer-term strategic objectives 
which it has deﬁned, and the appropriate management of particular risks 
impacting the Group within the risk appetite parameters which were 
deﬁned by the Board during the year.
Boards and Committees
During the year there were six scheduled Board meetings, one of which 
was held at the Protection & Finishing Products’ Kidlington, UK facility. In 
addition to the scheduled formal meetings, the Board met on a number of 
other occasions as required and, in particular, reviewed in detail the further 
development and delivery of the Group strategy. The Chairman and Chief 
Executive maintain regular contact with the Directors, and the Chairman 
also holds periodic informal discussions with the Non-Executive Directors, 
without any of the Executive Directors being present, to review performance, 
discuss succession issues and to monitor corporate control mechanisms. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary & General 
Counsel, sets the programme for the Board during the year. The Board 
considers reports from the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
covering operational, ﬁnancial performance and other signiﬁcant business 
issues. Board meetings are structured to allow open discussion, and all 
Directors participate in determining the Group’s strategy and regularly 
reviewing the trading and ﬁnancial performance of the Company.
Committees are a valuable part of the Company’s corporate governance 
structure, and the Board looks to the Audit Committee in particular to 
undertake the majority of the work involved in monitoring and seeking 
assurance as to compliance with the controls within this framework. 
However, the Board as a whole maintains oversight of such important 
matters and after each Audit Committee meeting the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee reports on the matters which have been reviewed.

Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 57 Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report Other speciﬁc responsibilities are delegated to the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. These Committees report as appropriate  
to the Board.
Each of the Committees has terms of reference approved by the Board, 
copies of which are available on the Company’s website or on request  
from the Company Secretary & General Counsel.
Operational matters and the responsibility for the day-to-day management 
of the businesses are delegated to the Chief Executive, supported by 
members of senior executive management and the respective Divisional 
Managing Directors or Presidents as appropriate, within delegated authority 
limits and in accordance with clearly deﬁned systems of internal control.
The Board was supported during the year by the Group Management 
Committee (the “GMC”), which ensures a strong link between Filtrona’s 
overall corporate strategy and its implementation within an effective 
internal control environment.
Engagement with management
The Board receives detailed reports at each scheduled Board meeting on 
the operational and ﬁnancial performance of the businesses from the Chief 
Executive and the Group Finance Director, together with regular updates 
on any material issues which may impact the Group.
The Board receives detailed presentations from each of the Managing 
Directors or Presidents of the divisions during the course of the year,  
in addition to reviewing their respective strategic plans and budgets.  
The Board also considers reports from senior management about matters 
of material importance to the Company which arise from time to time. 
There is a programme of meetings, both formal and informal, with members 
of the senior executive management and the Board has the opportunity  
to engage with local management during site visits. The Board derives  
a better understanding of the Company’s operations and business model 
as a result of such contact.
Applying Filtrona’s Corporate Responsibility principles
The Chief Executive is the Director with primary responsibility for the 
implementation and integration of Filtrona’s Corporate Responsibility 
principles across the Company. During 2012 the Group Human Resources 
Director, supported by the Company Secretary & General Counsel, was 
responsible for co-ordinating the operation of the detailed policies on 
human resources, health and safety, ethics and the environment which 
support Filtrona’s commitment to its Corporate Responsibility principles. 
Further details of those policies can be viewed via the Corporate Responsibility 
page on the Company’s website at www.ﬁltrona.com. Following the 
appointment of the Group Operations Director during the year, the Group 
Human Resources Director handed over responsibility for all HS&E matters 
with effect from 1 January 2013. 
Conﬂict of interests
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to consider and,  
if it sees ﬁt, to authorise situations where a Director has an interest that 
conﬂicts, or may possibly conﬂict, with the interests of the Company. In 
addition, the Company has a conﬂict of interests’ policy governing the 
responsibilities of Directors in such situations. The decision to authorise a 
conﬂict of interest can only be made by non-conﬂicted directors (those 
who have no interest in the matter being considered), and in making such  
a decision the Directors must act honestly and in good faith when giving 
authorisation where they think this is appropriate, and will be most likely  
to promote the Company’s success. The Company Secretary & General 
Counsel maintains a register of Director’s interests, so that any potential 
concerns are addressed before any material concerns may arise. During  
the course of the year, there were no material conﬂicts of interest 
impacting on the conduct of the Board’s activities.
Information and professional development
The Chairman, supported by the Company Secretary & General Counsel, 
takes responsibility for ensuring that the Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information.
On appointment an induction programme tailored to their individual  
needs is available to Directors, and is designed to assist them in their 
understanding of Filtrona and its operations. Throughout a Director’s 
tenure they are encouraged to develop their knowledge of the Group 
through meetings with senior management and site visits. Directors are 
also provided with updates, as appropriate, on matters such as ﬁduciary 
duties, Companies Act requirements, share dealing restrictions and 
corporate governance matters. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary & General Counsel, who is responsible to the Chairman for 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and that applicable rules 
and regulations are followed. During the year under review, the Company 
Secretary & General Counsel’s advice was sought in relation to share 
dealings. In the furtherance of their duties, there are agreed procedures  
for the Directors to take independent professional advice, if necessary,  
at the Company’s expense. No Director took independent professional 
advice during the year.
58 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance Report continued Performance evaluation 
The Board considers the evaluation of its performance and that of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees annually, with each Committee 
also evaluating its own performance. This year the Board engaged an 
external facilitator, Lintstock, for full Board and Committee evaluations.
The ﬁrst stage of the review involved Lintstock engaging with the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary & General Counsel, to set the context for the 
evaluation and to tailor the heads of enquiry to the speciﬁc circumstances 
of the Filtrona Board. All Directors completed an online questionnaire 
addressing the performance of the Board, Committees and the Chairman, 
with an upward review of the Board by the Divisional Heads and the Group 
Human Resources Director also being conducted.
Interviews were conducted in two phases: ﬁrst with management and  
the Executive Directors and second with the Non-Executive Directors and 
the Chairman. Two partners from Lintstock attended each interview, with 
the anonymity of all respondents being ensured throughout the process  
in order to promote the open and frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which addressed the  
following areas:
 The current composition of the Board and the necessity for changes  
to the proﬁle of the Board to facilitate the delivery of the Company’s 
strategic objectives in Vision 2015 and beyond
 The Board’s knowledge and understanding of the opportunities,  
risks and challenges associated with Vision 2015, and the Board’s 
understanding of the views of major investors and stakeholders
 The structure of Board meetings, and the quality of materials presented 
to the Board
 The balance between the operational and strategic oversight role of  
the Board and its views as to the strategic priorities of the Company
 The Board’s risk appetite and views as to the key risks facing the Company
 Succession planning and the role of the Board in ensuring that there  
are appropriate human resources in place for the Company to meet  
its objectives
 The composition and performance of the Committees of the Board,  
and the performance of the Chairman
 The perception of the Board and the Company’s strategy by the 
Divisional Heads and the Group Human Resources Director, as well  
as areas of focus required in order for the Board to add maximum value  
to the business
Lintstock is engaged to deliver a three-year Board development programme, 
with the review content for each subsequent evaluation being designed  
to build upon learning gained in the previous year to ensure that the 
recommendations agreed in the review are implemented and that 
year-on-year progress is measured.
Shareholder communications
The Board recognises the importance of effective communication and 
seeks to maintain open and transparent relationships with its shareholders 
and other stakeholders, including providers of ﬁnance, customers and 
suppliers. This is achieved by regular updates through press announcements, 
the corporate website and other published material.
The Company also communicates regularly with its major institutional 
shareholders and ensures that all the Directors, including the Non-
Executive Directors, have an understanding of the views and concerns  
of major shareholders and are able to explain business developments 
and ﬁnancial results as appropriate. The Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and the Corporate Affairs Director have primary responsibility 
for investor relations. Presentations for analysts and institutional 
shareholders were held during the year and meetings were also held 
with key institutional investors to discuss strategy, ﬁnancial performance 
and investment activities. Slide presentations are made immediately 
available after the full year and half year results, and are also available  
on the Company’s website to view and download.
All shareholders have the opportunity to meet any of the Directors of  
the Company should they so wish. Feedback from meetings with shareholders 
is provided to the Board so they are aware of any issues or concerns. 
Additionally, the Board uses the AGM as an occasion to communicate  
with all shareholders, including private investors, who are provided with  
the opportunity to question the Directors. 
At the AGM the level of proxy votes lodged on each resolution will be 
made available, both at the meeting and subsequently on the Company’s 
website. Each substantially separate issue is presented as a separate 
resolution, and the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available to answer questions from shareholders.
The Notice of the AGM and related papers will be posted to shareholders 
more than 20 working days before the AGM.
Financial reporting
The Directors have acknowledged, in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 79, their responsibility for preparing  
the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and the Group. The external 
auditor has included, in the Independent Auditor’s Report set out on 
page 126, a statement about their reporting responsibilities.
The Directors are also responsible for the publication of unaudited quarterly 
Interim Management Statements and Half Year Results as required by the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority, 
providing an explanation of material events and transactions that have 
taken place during the relevant period and their impact on the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company and the Group and a general description of the 
ﬁnancial position and performance as well as the Company and the Group 
during the relevant period.
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 59 Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ insurance
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, and to the 
extent permitted by the laws of England and Wales, the Directors are 
granted an indemnity from the Company in respect of those liabilities 
incurred as a result of their ofﬁce. In respect of those matters for which the 
Directors may not be indemniﬁed, the Company maintained a directors’ 
and ofﬁcers’ liability insurance policy throughout the year. It is anticipated 
this policy will be renewed. Neither the Company’s indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover to the extent that the Director is proven to have 
acted dishonestly or fraudulently.
Internal controls
In accordance with the Code, the Board acknowledges its overall 
responsibility to shareholders to ensure that an adequate system of risk 
management and internal control is in place. This is essential for reliable 
ﬁnancial reporting and also for the effective management of the Group.
The effectiveness of the system has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee which assesses the quality of the control environment when 
monitoring and reviewing the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements 
and any signiﬁcant judgements that were made in their preparation.
Filtrona’s internal controls are designed to safeguard the Company’s 
assets, and to ensure the integrity and reliability of information used 
both within the businesses and for public announcements. The Board 
has overall responsibility in the Company’s system of internal control  
and risk management, and for reviewing the effectiveness of this  
system. Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
therefore only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance  
against material misstatement or loss.
The following procedures are in place, which enable the Board to review 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control:
 The Audit Committee meets regularly and reviews the effectiveness  
of the internal control environment of the Group
 The Audit Committee is supported by the Group Assurance function 
which undertakes extensive internal audit responsibilities across the Group
 Risk management reports are presented which detail an analysis of the 
key risks at a Group level, summarise developments potentially impacting 
the Group from a risk, governance or compliance perspective and 
propose actions for the Company in response to such developments
 The Board has the opportunity to review the internal control environment 
at local sites when Board meetings are held away from the Company’s 
head ofﬁce
 Every month each division submits detailed operating and ﬁnancial 
reports covering all aspects of performance. These are reviewed 
within the Group’s central ﬁnance function and summary reports 
 are communicated to the GMC and the Board
 Certiﬁcates are required from the businesses to conﬁrm compliance  
with the Group’s policies and procedures
 Self-certiﬁcation is required from all businesses and divisions at both  
the half year and year end to conﬁrm compliance with Group ﬁnancial 
policies and procedures
Policies and procedures, which are subject to ongoing review and 
updated as required in response to strategic, operational, business,  
legal or regulatory developments, with the approval of the Board or its 
respective Committees as appropriate, are communicated across the 
Group. Filtrona’s internal controls are designed to ensure signiﬁcant risks, 
investment decisions and management issues are identiﬁed, considered 
and escalated as necessary at the earliest opportunity. Divisional 
Managing Directors and Presidents are responsible for ensuring the 
communication of and compliance with Filtrona’s internal controls  
across their respective divisions. 
Control of signiﬁcant risks
The Board has two main responsibilities in relation to risk. One is to 
determine the risk appetite and communicate to the organisation what 
constitutes acceptable risk-taking. The second responsibility, which is 
delegated to the Audit Committee, is to oversee the management process 
for the identiﬁcation, assessment and mitigation of risk across the Group.
A Group Risk policy is in place which supports the Board in fulﬁlling these 
responsibilities and serves to reinforce the risk review processes embedded 
within the businesses. 
The Board is of the view that a rigorous ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the Company was in 
place throughout 2012, and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report for 2012. This process has been reviewed by the Audit Committee 
and will be reviewed routinely to ensure that the system of internal control 
and risk management remains ﬁt for purpose.
During the year the Board undertook a detailed exercise to consider  
the Group’s risk appetite in a number of key areas. This exercise was 
undertaken in addition to the evaluation, monitoring and mitigation of  
the key risks facing the Company, which is undertaken as part of the risk 
management processes and the disclosure of Principal Risks on pages 38  
to 41 of this Report.
The Board exercise was conducted over several meetings during the year 
and was facilitated by the Group Head of Assurance and the Company 
Secretary & General Counsel, with support from an external adviser. The 
discussions centred on the risk requirements of the Company, strategic, 
ﬁnancial, operational, talent and compliance objectives and took into 
account the views of the GMC who had separately assessed the relative 
risk appetite across the relevant factors. 
The risk appetite established by the Board provides clarity on those areas 
where the Board wishes to take little or no risk, and those where the Board 
would be comfortable adopting a greater level of risk taking. It is intended 
that this assessment will be used to support the Board’s ongoing decision 
making and underpin the risk management processes across the Company.

for non-audit services 
The Audit Committee supports the Board in establishing formal and 
transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply the required 
ﬁnancial reporting, internal control principles and risk management 
processes and the audit of the ﬁnancial statements of the Company. 
The Audit Committee reports to the full Board on a regular basis, but  
no less frequently than at every board meeting following a Committee 
meeting. There is an annual cycle of items that are to be considered by the 
Audit Committee. The timetable of these items is scheduled in accordance 
with the requirements of the annual audit cycle. The responsibilities of the 
Audit Committee are deﬁned in its terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually, copies of which are available at www.ﬁltrona.com.
The Audit Committee takes responsibility for reviewing the Group’s 
internal controls through its engagement with the new Group Assurance 
function. The Group Head of Assurance is responsible for providing 
assurances as to the adequacy of internal controls function throughout 
the Group and attends each Committee meeting. At the start of the year 
the Committee agrees the annual internal audit plan, which is drawn  
up on a risk-based approach across a broad section of the Company’s 
Risk appetite will change over time to reﬂect changes in the economic 
environment, strategy and the performance of the Company and it is  
the intention of the Board to review this at least on an annual basis in 
conjunction with its strategic and ﬁnancial planning processes. 
The Company has an established process for the development of risk 
practices. Further to the setting of the risk appetite by the Board there  
is a more formal method of deﬁning acceptable levels of risk within the 
organisation. The risk process has evolved and is validated through the 
preparation of risk registers which are used to assess risk tolerances and  
the registers are reviewed and discussed at the GMC prior to being put 
forward to the Audit Committee on a semi-annual basis.
With the development of the Group Assurance function during 2012, 
further controls have been introduced to improve effectiveness, reduce 
costs and support business performance. 
During 2013 a risk management technology platform is being introduced 
which will enhance the reporting tools currently being used and will enable 
the Company to improve risk management, develop risk strategies into risk 
mitigation, and eliminate any lack of coverage.

and have ﬁnancial and / or related business experience gained in senior 
positions in other large diverse organisations.
Terry Twigger has been the Chairman of the Audit Committee since 2009

experience, further details of which can be found on page 51.
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 61 Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report activities. Any signiﬁcant ﬁndings from internal control audits undertaken 
during the year have been appropriately investigated and necessary 
action taken to address and rectify any weaknesses that have been 
identiﬁed. As a result of the processes and reporting in place the Audit 
Committee is satisﬁed that management is giving its full attention to  
any outstanding issues. A summary progress report is presented at each 
Audit Committee and a semi-annual risk report is submitted to correspond 
with the reporting of half and full year results.
The internal procedures implemented by the Company to ensure the Board 
maintains overall control for all material strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and 
compliance matters affecting the Company are included within the internal 
control section of this Report. The Board establishes the standards and 
values that govern the Group and agrees the structure of the Group’s 
internal controls.
Engagement of the external auditor
KPMG has been the Company’s auditor since the Company’s public listing 
in 2005. KPMG provide the Committee with relevant reports, reviews, 
information and advice throughout the year as set out in the terms of their 
engagement. Their performance was formally assessed by the Committee 
in conjunction with the executive management team and the Committee  
is satisﬁed that they continue to be effective and provide an appropriate 
independent challenge of the Company’s management. In making its 
assessment of the external auditor, the Committee had due regard to  
their expertise, resourcing and independence. 
In accordance with UK regulations, the Company’s auditor adheres to a 
rotation policy based on best practice and accounting standards, and the 
current lead audit partner has been in place for two years. There are no 
contractual obligations restricting the Company’s choice of external auditor 
and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into by the Company.
In addition to the annual review of the service provided by the external 
auditors, the Audit Committee gives consideration from time to time to 
whether the audit might be provided more efﬁciently or effectively by an 
alternative audit ﬁrm, and the Company may put the audit out to tender  
at any time if the Committee deemed it appropriate.
The Audit Committee remains satisﬁed with the effectiveness of the 
external auditor and it does not consider it necessary to conduct a tender 
process this year. However, having regard to the new requirements of  
the Code on tendering the audit, the Audit Committee intends to give 
consideration during the year to any future process to ensure compliance 
with the Code and the appointment of the best service provider, to ensure 
that the Company continues to receive a high quality and effective audit.
The external auditor is engaged to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial 
statements. The audit includes the review and test of the system of internal 
ﬁnancial control and the data contained in the ﬁnancial statements to the 
extent necessary for expressing an audit opinion on the truth and fairness 
of the ﬁnancial statements.
Non-audit services policy
The importance of maintaining the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditor, by minimising its involvement in projects of a non-audit 
nature, is of concern to the Committee. It is, however, also acknowledged 
that, due to its detailed understanding of the Company’s business, it  
may sometimes be necessary to involve the external auditor in non-audit 
related work, principally comprising further assurance services relating  
to due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of acquisitions, 
disposals and tax services. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy in 
relation to the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit 
services, with deﬁned parameters and approval requirements in relation  
to any such appointments.
The majority of the non-audit work carried out by the external auditor  
during the year related to tax compliance services and acquisition activity  
in overseas jurisdictions, and the Committee believes that given their 
experience KPMG were the most appropriate suppliers of this work.

During the year the Nomination Committee considered Matthew Gregory 
for appointment as the Group Finance Director, taking into consideration 
the requirements of the role, the skills and experience required and the 
beneﬁts of Board diversity. Matthew’s capabilities and suitability were 
independently assessed by an external resource, The Zygos Partnership,  
and benchmarked against potential external recruits. Having considered  
the independent assessment of Matthew, and having regard to his ﬁnancial 
and senior management capabilities, experience of Filtrona, the beneﬁts  
of continuity at a time of considerable change within the Company and 
potential to further enhance the performance of the Board and the Company, 
his appointment was recommended to the Board.
The Nomination Committee and the Board as a whole supports the spirit  
of the recommendations set out in the Lord Davies Report “Women on 
Boards” in securing the right combination of skills, experience and expertise 
on the Board to effectively lead the sustainable growth and success of the 
Company for the beneﬁt of all stakeholders. The fundamental objective 
must be to ensure that the best people are appointed to do the best  
job for Filtrona taking into consideration other factors such as market  
and international experience and diversity of thought and background. 
Appointing people on merit without any form of discrimination is a  
key component of Filtrona policies across all its international operations  
at all levels. 
In recognising the beneﬁts of gender diversity, in conjunction with the 
development of any robust succession planning, the Nomination 
Committee has concluded that any future engagement of executive search 
agents in relation to potential appointments to the Board should include  
a speciﬁc instruction to ensure that the widest possible ﬁeld of female 
candidates be identiﬁed for consideration. A search for a replacement for 
Lars Emilson has been initiated on these terms. A copy of the Company’s 
statement on diversity is available on the website www.ﬁltrona.com. 
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 63 Corporate Governance | Corporate Governance Report Dear Shareholder
As Chairman of the Filtrona Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present 
the 2012 Remuneration Report for which we will seeking approval from the 
shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
The current remuneration policy is focused on aligning the interests of 
executives with shareholders and is structured to enable the Group to 
attract, motivate and retain the talent required to deliver Vision 2015. 
When considering the senior executive remuneration structure the 
Committee also takes into account the pay and conditions of all employees. 
As detailed in the 2011 Annual Report and following approval at the 2012 
AGM there were a number of changes implemented during the year to the 
remuneration structure of senior management. It is believed that these 
changes will create increased share ownership with more stretching targets 
linked with higher potential incentive reward, and secure greater alignment 
with shareholder interests. It is believed that these changes strengthen the 
remuneration policy.
The Committee believes there should continue to be a strong emphasis 
on long-term performance related pay and that it helps to discourage 
inappropriate risk taking which may be detrimental to the Company’s 
shareholders.
The Committee is satisﬁed that this risk level is managed through (i) annual 
bonus plan (ii) signiﬁcant compulsory share deferral in the annual bonus 
plan (iii) regular annual performance share awards (iv) application of share 
ownership guidelines; and (v) use of Total Shareholder Return as part of the 
performance conditions.
Filtrona has delivered another year of strong performance and growth 
against the majority of its KPIs. Given this progress towards the Vision  
2015 strategy and objectives, coupled with strong individual performances, 
the Committee has determined the 2012 Executive bonuses should be 
100% of the maximum.
The three year TSR and EPS performance conditions for the LTIP A and LTIP 
B awards made in September 2009 were achieved and so these awards 
vested in full.
The Committee’s review of the salary of the Chief Executive determined 
that an increase of 6.4% should be applied from 1 January 2013. Colin Day 
has inspired a new growth agenda at Filtrona and as the Company develops 
and further expands its global reach, scale and complexity, the beneﬁts  
of the changes he has driven are being seen by all stakeholders. 
As a matter of course the Committee considers executive remuneration 
matters alongside risk management. We believe that the remuneration 
arrangements in place do not raise health and safety, environmental,  
social or ethical issues, nor do they inadvertently motivate irresponsible 
behaviours.
The Committee values feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive 
your support at the AGM.

The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board on remuneration policy as applied to Filtrona’s senior executives, 
including Executive Directors. Membership of the Remuneration Committee 
during the year consisted wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Company Secretary & General Counsel acts as Secretary to the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Human Resources 
Director attended the Remuneration Committee meetings, except when 
their own remuneration was discussed.
The terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee, which are reviewed 
annually, can be found on the Company’s website www.ﬁltrona.com.
Policy Report
The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board 
the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Chief 
Executive’s remuneration proposals for the members of the Group 
Management Committee are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee 
and recommendations are made to the Board. 
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy 
as detailed by the Chief Executive in respect of other levels of management 
in the Company, and makes such recommendations to the Chief Executive 
as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate. The Remuneration 
Committee has regard to the proposed remuneration policy for other 
management and employees across the Group, when determining 
recommendations on remuneration for the Executive Directors and  
other senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the risks surrounding the Company’s 
existing remuneration policies in seeking to ensure that an appropriate 
balance was maintained in aligning the interests of the Company’s senior 
executives and shareholders. 
The remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board 
is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration 
of the Non-Executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. 
No Director is involved in determining or voting on his own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors the Remuneration 
Committee’s objective is to ensure that those individuals are provided with 
appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a 
fair and responsible manner having regard to the long-term performance  
of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success 
of the Company.
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 65 Corporate Governance | Report of the Remuneration Committee
Report of the Remuneration Committee Alignment with Group strategy
The Board as a whole establishes the remuneration policy and it considers 
the alignment of Group performance and the remuneration of its senior 
executives, including the Executive Directors, to be of the utmost 
importance. It believes that senior management should be highly rewarded 
(on a market competitive basis) for the delivery of stretching goals but 
should receive reduced rewards when the business does not perform to 
expectations. To achieve this alignment, Filtrona’s remuneration package is 
leveraged with a high percentage of pay “at risk” against the achievement 
of stretching goals. Furthermore, one half of any bonus for Executive 
Directors is delivered in the form of Filtrona shares which will vest after  
a three year period. These requirements closely tie the long-term value  
of executive remuneration to the long-term interests of shareholders.
As set out on page 13 Filtrona’s Vision 2015 strategy seeks to create 
sustainable shareholder value through the delivery of balanced, proﬁtable 
growth in its existing and future opportunity markets and technologies. 
The strategy also calls for strong conversion of proﬁt into cash. These 
priorities are reﬂected closely in the design of the remuneration packages 
which seek to drive their delivery through a combination of ﬁnancially 
driven targets, key personal objectives based around operational issues  
and relative shareholder return.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration packages  
for senior executives including the Executive Directors should consist of:
 Basic salary – Internal and external parity in basic salary positioning  
is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration package. 
The Remuneration Committee takes into account a range of factors, 
including individual and corporate performance, as well as pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere across the Group when undertaking 
base salary reviews 
 Annual bonus plan (delivered through a mixture of cash and shares) – 
Bonus structures are effective if they help drive the achievement of 
targets, while respecting the Company’s appetite for risk and allowing 
for sustained proﬁtable growth. The targets set should not provide an 
incentive to promote behaviours which would be detrimental to the 
Company’s long-term interests. As such, management must provide 
robust justiﬁcation for the targets it recommends. The Remuneration 
Committee assures itself that the targets provide appropriate incentives 
and are sufﬁciently challenging, but remain achievable
 Long-term incentive plan – Performance Shares granted under the LTIP 
encourage a longer-term focus on both Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and 
relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). These metrics measure how 
the Company is performing for shareholders  
The Remuneration Committee considers all these elements, plus pension 
and other beneﬁts, as a whole. It looks to ensure that an appropriate 
balance is maintained between them so that the need for both short-term 
success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised. The Remuneration 
Committee also ensures that the non-ﬁnancial business measures and 
individual objectives reﬂect adequately the Company’s environmental,  
social and governance responsibilities.
The remuneration structure which was implemented during 2012, and 
continues to apply to 2013 onwards, retains and increases the principles of 
increased share ownership and more stretching targets to link with higher 
potential incentive reward and TSR, in order to secure alignment with 
shareholder interests:
 Reﬂects the Company’s Vision 2015 strategic objectives
 Ensures that annual bonus metrics and targets provide executive  
reward for delivering the business objectives of:
 – Above industry average revenue growth
 – Continued margin improvement
 – Strong cash ﬂow generation and disciplined use of capital
 Rewards the delivery of performance annually, across a broad 
foundation of business fundamentals which should lead to growth  
in EPS, a key metric for shareholders
 Focuses rewards so they deliver if the Company delivers EPS growth  
in line with stretching targets
 Creates a more stretching ﬁnancial target for incentives that reﬂect  
a step change in business performance
 Rewards executives well if they deliver outstanding performance  
and create signiﬁcant sustainable shareholder value
 Provides no additional reward for the same ﬁnancial performance
 Changes the culture of Filtrona by requiring executives to hold 
signiﬁcant shareholdings in the Company
 Rewards executives for organic growth, and adjusts targets for  
M&A activity
 Maintains clawback provisions to safeguard shareholders’ interests
Summary of components of Executive Directors’ 
remuneration for 2013
The Remuneration Committee structures senior executive remuneration in 
two distinct parts: (i) ﬁxed remuneration of basic salary, pension and beneﬁts; 
and (ii) variable performance-related remuneration in the form of cash 
bonuses, deferred share bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable 
performance-related pay element forms a signiﬁcant portion of each 
package. The majority of total remuneration at the maximum performance 
level will derive from the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements, 
which are strongly aligned to Filtrona’s strategic objective to secure 
long-term shareholder value.

into account pay and 
employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company 
when considering increases 
to basic salary levels.
Salary increases for 
Executive Directors will  
not normally exceed those 
awarded to other group 
employees.
If there is a signiﬁcant 
increase in responsibility, 
change in scope of a role,  
or size of the business then 
basic salary may increase by 
more than this level. This is 
particularly relevant for new 
appointments, where they 
are moved towards the 
market median as their 
experience and performance 
in role develops.
None. Salaries for Executive 
Directors have been 
increased by 6.4%  
and 7.7% for Colin Day 
and Matthew Gregory

performance and risk 
management.
For Executive Directors  
the guideline minimum 
requirement is 300% of 
salary for Colin Day and 
200% of salary for Matthew 
Gregory. These shareholding 
requirements to be built up 
over ﬁve years from date of 
appointment.
Only shares beneﬁcially 
owned are taken into 
account in assessing 
compliance with  
this guideline.
Details of the Directors’ 
shareholdings can be  
found on page 75.
None. As described.
New appointments
 Basic Salary – to be set based on relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal relativities and their current basic salary. Where 
new appointees have initial basic salaries set below market, any shortfall will be managed with phased increases over a period of two to three years 
subject to their development in the role.
 Bonus – the annual bonus described above will apply to a new appointee with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reﬂect the proportion  
of employment over the year. 
 Share incentives – in usual circumstances new appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP on the same terms as other Executive Directors. 
However, to potentially facilitate the recruitment through the buy-out of existing awards from their current employer, the Remuneration Committee  
will retain the discretion to use other incentive arrangement which, where possible, will be consistent with respect of the structure, vesting period, 
expected value and use of performance measures.
Service contracts and exit payments
 The policy for executive service contracts is that notice periods will normally not exceed 12 months. Colin Day has a service contract dated 1 April 2011 and 
Matthew Gregory has a service contract dated 7 September 2012, both with a notice period of 12 months from either party. The service contracts for the 
Executive Directors are available for inspection by shareholders at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.
 The Remuneration Committee’s policy in relation to termination of service contracts is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation, having regard to all of 
the circumstances of the individual, the termination of employment, and to any legal advice received. The Company has the right to make a payment in 
lieu of notice (such payment being made based on salary and at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion the value of beneﬁts), and any such payment 
may be made in monthly instalments at the Company’s discretion and may be reduced to take into account any sums earned during the payment period 
by way of employment elsewhere.
Salary
Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration 
Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and 
experience of the individual. While the Company does not have a ﬁxed 
policy on annual pay awards it aims to pay fairly across all employees  
taking into account local and national economic environments.
Salaries are reviewed annually with any increase being effective from  
1 January (unless responsibilities change). Salary levels are determined 
taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at 
comparable companies. The Company aims to position basic salary  
around the mid-market level of the relevant comparator companies  
to remain competitive. 
A review of salary levels was undertaken in December 2012, and the 
Remuneration Committee awarded Colin Day an increase of 6.4%.  
While the Remuneration Committee is aware of and supports restraint  
in Executive Director remuneration increases, it is felt that the Company’s 
growth and organisational development requires a revision to salary to 
reﬂect its current size and complexity of operations which have increased 
signiﬁcantly during Colin Day’s tenure. Since his arrival in April 2011,  
Colin has overseen:
 A signiﬁcant increase in revenue, operating proﬁt and net income
 The addition of over 1,000 new employees 
 An increase in both the number and geographical spread of 
manufacturing and distribution locations
 Growth in market capitalisation of the Company in excess of 125% 
since his appointment in 2011 and around 50% since the start of  
2012, with the Company now established in the top 200 listed 
companies in the UK 
This substantial growth has been achieved through self-funded acquisitions 
and organic growth. Additionally, Colin has led a number of key initiatives 
which have strengthened the Group through the reorganisation of 
operations, and combined with a revised reporting and management 
structure this has increased the responsibilities of the Chief Executive.  
Other key initiatives driven by Colin include revised go-to-market strategies 
and increased interaction with the investor community.
68 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued For the reasons outlined above, the Remuneration Committee believes  
that the level of salary increase is warranted as it recognises the strong 
continued personal contribution made by Colin Day in the Company’s 
excellent progress towards fulﬁlling the Vision 2015 strategy. 
An increase of 7.7% was awarded to Matthew Gregory with effect  
from 1 January 2013 to reﬂect his strong performance as Group Finance 
Director since his appointment in September 2012. The Remuneration 
Committee’s intention is to offer phased salary increases to a mid-market 
position as Matthew’s experience in the role develops, subject to his 
continued strong performance. Even with this increase, Matthew Gregory’s 
salary still remains below that of his predecessor.

Annual bonuses
Each year, the Remuneration Committee reviews the annual bonus to 
ensure the performance measures and targets remain appropriate and 
aligned to the Company’s short-term strategy, whilst remaining within  
the appropriate risk proﬁle.
Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2013, Colin Day  
is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 150% of basic salary. 
Matthew Gregory is potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 
125% of basic salary. Bonus payments are normally made one half in cash 
and one half in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares 
being deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB. 
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the ﬁnancial performance targets, 
accounting for 80% of the bonus opportunity will be based upon a matrix 
of revenue and proﬁt targets (such that strong performance on both 
measures will be needed). 
The remaining 20% of the annual bonus will be based equally on the 
achievement of cash targets for working capital management and  
personal objectives which are set by the Board and endorsed by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the personal objectives established 
for Colin Day and Matthew Gregory are designed to deliver further 
progress by the Company towards the strategic objectives associated with 
its Vision 2015 strategy together with the further development on a global 
basis of the organisational structure and internal controls of the Company.
Deferred Annual Share Bonus plan 
The DASB provides for Executive Directors and other senior executives to 
receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company for nil payment. The 
number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award 
is granted, based upon the performance in Filtrona’s preceding ﬁnancial 
year of the participant and / or the Company and / or the division in which  
the participant worked.
Under the rules of the DASB the aggregate value of shares made subject  
to awards granted to a participant in any one ﬁnancial year may not exceed 
100% of their basic salary as at the award date. The Remuneration 
Committee has determined that, in accordance with the Company’s bonus 
arrangements, awards under the DASB will not normally exceed one half  
of the total annual bonus.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until at least 1 March in 
the third calendar year after the year in which the award was made. Subject 
to conﬁrmation from the Company, and continued employment within the 
Group, the shares are transferred to the participant at their request.
For 2010 awards onwards, the Remuneration Committee has retained the 
discretion to reduce the size of unvested DASB awards if it is found that the 
performance on which the original award was determined was materially 
misstated. If an award vests to a greater extent than it should have done 
due to a material misstatement in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements or 
due to an error in assessing the applicable performance conditions then the 
Remuneration Committee can seek to recover the extra value received as  
a result of the error. The Remuneration Committee can also seek to recover 
such amount as it considers appropriate as a result of gross misconduct. 
The Remuneration Committee has three years from the date on which  
the Award becomes exercisable to determine whether or not to apply 
clawback provisions. 
Executive share-based incentive plans
The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that offering Executive 
Directors and nominated senior executives the opportunity to be awarded 
shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and 
retaining key employees so that they may drive and participate in the future 
growth of the Company. It is also of the view that the Executive Directors 
and nominated senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly  
in the Company through the purchase of shares. The Company’s DASB is 
intended to support these objectives.
The award of shares or options under the executive share-based incentive 
plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account 
the role of the individual and other such criteria as they may determine 
from time to time. 
Awards under the Company’s share-based incentive plans will be satisﬁed 
using market purchases, new issue shares and / or shares held in treasury.
Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part A – Share Options
The LTIP Part A provides for participants to receive share option awards 
over shares worth up to two times basic salary or £250,000 (whichever  
is the greatest) in any ﬁnancial year, subject to performance conditions. 
Since 2008, Executive Directors and other nominated senior executives 
have not been eligible to receive awards under LTIP Part A. Since 2012 
members of the Group Leadership Team are no longer eligible to receive 
awards under LTIP Part A. Participation in LTIP Part A is limited to other 
designated employees. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan – Part B – Performance Shares
A performance share award under LTIP Part B consists of a conditional right 
to receive shares in the Company, subject to performance conditions, on 
the basis described below. Participants make no payment for the grant and 
exercise of performance share awards. Since 2012 members of the Group 
Leadership Team are eligible to receive awards under LTIP Part B. Previously 
awards were made only to Executive Directors and members of the Group 
Management Committee.
Participants may receive performance share awards over shares worth up  
to two times their basic salary (three times for the Chief Executive) in any 
ﬁnancial year. A performance share award will not normally be exercisable 
before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the 
extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisﬁed. The 
awards are structured as nil cost options. For employees based outside  
the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth 
anniversary of grant. For employees based in the US, once the performance 
conditions have been satisﬁed the options must be exercised within  
30 days of vesting.

Total remuneration (%)
One half of the awards are subject to a TSR performance condition and one 
half of the awards will subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition. 
The Remuneration Committee reviews performance measures and targets 
on an annual basis and believes that both these conditions remain 
appropriate, offering a balance of internal ﬁnancial metrics and external 
shareholder aligned measures. 
The TSR performance condition assesses Filtrona’s TSR performance relative 
to the constituents of the FSTE 250 index (excluding investment trusts). 
Performance is measured over three years from the date of grant. 12.5%  
of the award vests for median performance, increasing on a straight line 
basis to 50% vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards requires the 
Company’s earnings per share growth (adjusted to exclude items which  
did not reﬂect the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial performance and 
intangible amortisation) over three ﬁnancial years to be in excess of 8%  
per annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest. The proportion of the awards 
vesting will increase on a straight line basis, and for 50% of the awards to 
vest the adjusted EPS growth must be in excess of 15% per annum . The 
performance condition will be tested after three ﬁnancial years and there 
will be no provision for retesting. To the extent the performance condition 
has not been met after three ﬁnancial years, the relevant awards will lapse. 
Targets will be adjusted to take account of acquisitions or share buy-backs 
the Company makes. 
Remuneration mix
The graph below demonstrates the potential remuneration mix at 
below threshold, threshold, target and maximum for each of the 
Executive Directors. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts and do  
not participate in any Company pension, share or incentive schemes.  
In accordance with best practice, letters of appointment have been 
issued for all Non-Executive Directors for an initial period of three years. 
These letters are available for inspection by members at each AGM and 
during normal business hours at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, are 
approved by the Board in accordance with the policy adopted by  
the Remuneration Committee, and are based on a standard fee, with 
additional fees payable for the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and for the chairing of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The fees are set taking into account current market 
practice and the responsibilities and time commitment involved in the 
role. Following a benchmark review during 2012, and the need to be 
competitive, the annual review in December 2012 approved an increase 
of 6% payable to the Non-Executive Directors and 3% to the Chairman 
to reﬂect the increased size and scale of the Company’s operations. 
The fees will be subject to a further annual review in December 2013  
in accordance with the policy for the remuneration of Non-Executive 
Directors adopted by the Board. 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged, under their letters of appointment, 
to own a minimum of 7,500 shares.

Annual Bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2012 the company had the following 
performance measures and targets. 
The annual bonus was based upon a matrix of revenue growth and 
adjusted operating proﬁt. 
The minimum growth for base level entry for revenue is 16.0% and the 
stretch target is 23.0%. The minimum growth for base level entry for 
operating proﬁt is 15.0% and the stretch target is 26.0%. 
In addition 10% of the total bonus was subject to personal objectives and 
10% of the total bonus was subject to working capital. The working capital 
element is based upon the working capital management as calculated at the 
year end, based upon the previous 12 months’ revenue. The award will be 
calculated on a straight-line basis between an entry ratio and a target ratio.
Personal objectives were focused on the delivery of key milestones 
associated with the successful achievement of Vision 2015.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed performance against these 
objectives and determined that 100% of the possible maximum total bonus 
should be awarded to Colin Day, Matthew Gregory and Steve Crummett.

Group plc and received fees of £177,468 for the year ended 31 December 
2012. Steve Crummett was appointed a non-executive director of Consort

to secure pension beneﬁts. Matthew is a member of the Filtrona Pension Plan

to any potential bidder for the Company or Group.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at the Holiday Inn Hotel,  
500 Saxon Gate West, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire MK9 2HQ  
on Thursday 25 April 2013 at 12 noon.
In addition to the ordinary business of the AGM, resolutions in respect  
of the following matters of special business are included in the Notice  
of Annual General Meeting:
Authority to allot unissued shares
At the last AGM held in 2012, the Directors were granted authority to 
allot relevant securities up to a nominal amount of £17,453,532, which 
expires at the end of the forthcoming AGM. 
At this year’s AGM, shareholders will be asked to grant the Directors 
authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
security into shares: (i) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £17,616,915 
representing approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share 
capital, excluding treasury shares, at 20 February 2013 (such an amount to 
be reduced by the nominal amount allotted or granted under section (ii) 
below in excess of such sum); and (ii) comprising equity securities up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £35,233,830 representing approximately 
two-thirds of the issued share capital, excluding treasury shares, at 20 
February 2013 (such an amount to be reduced by any allotments or grants 
made under section (i) above) in connection with an offer by way of  
a rights issue. 
The proposal conforms to the guidelines issued by the institutional 
investment protection bodies to ensure that existing shareholders’ 
interests are safeguarded. The Directors have no present intention  
of exercising either of these authorities, which will expire at the end 
of next year’s AGM (or, if earlier, the close of business on 24 July 2014) 
except in relation to share options.
 
Allotment of shares for cash
At the last AGM held in 2012, the shareholders approved a special 
resolution to enable the Directors to allot shares for cash without ﬁrst 
offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing 
shareholdings. That approval expires at the end of the forthcoming  
AGM and Resolution 12 in the Notice of AGM seeks to renew it.
The resolution authorises the Directors to allot or sell shares for cash 
without ﬁrst offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to  
their existing shareholdings up to an aggregate nominal amount of 5%  
of the issued share capital of the Company, including treasury shares,  
at 31 December 2012 (equivalent to 10,966,340 ordinary shares).
Directors’ Report
Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 77 In respect of this aggregate nominal amount, the Directors conﬁrm their 
intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement  
of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 
three-year period where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% 
should not take place without prior consultation with shareholders. This 
authority will expire at the conclusion of the following AGM or, if earlier,  
on 24 July 2014. The proposal conforms to the guidelines issued by the 
institutional investment protection bodies to ensure that existing shareholders’ 
interests are safeguarded. 
Purchase of own shares
At the last AGM held in 2012, the shareholders approved a special 
resolution to enable the Company to purchase its own shares.  
That approval expires at the end of the forthcoming AGM. 
At this year’s AGM, the Directors consider it expedient to seek 
shareholders’ approval to enable the Company to purchase, in the market, 
up to 10% of its issued share capital (excluding any treasury shares) for 
cancellation, or to be held in Treasury, such power to apply until the end  
of next year’s AGM (or if earlier, 24 July 2014). In accordance with the 
requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the 
minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for a share is its 
nominal value and the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) for shares 
which may be paid is the highest of: (i) an amount equal to 105% of the 
average market value for a share for the ﬁve business days immediately 
preceding the date of the purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of the 
last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the 
trading venues where the purchase is carried out. 
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to 
make market purchases, however the authority provides the ﬂexibility  
to allow them to do so in the future. The Directors will only utilise this 
authority if satisﬁed that to do so would be in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders generally, and could be expected to  
result in an increase in earnings per share of the Company. 
During the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2012 2,489,635 ordinary 
shares were transferred out of Treasury by the Company to satisfy share 
options under the Company’s SAYE / Sharesave and executive share 
incentive plans.
No dividends have been paid on shares whilst held in Treasury and  
no voting rights attach to the treasury shares.
Auditor
KPMG Audit Plc has indicated that it is willing to continue in ofﬁce. 
Resolutions to re-appoint them and to authorise the Board to set their 
remuneration will be proposed at the AGM (Resolution 9 and 10 
respectively in the Notice of AGM).
Recommendation
The Directors believe that the resolutions in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders  
as a whole, and unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour 
of each resolution.
Derivatives
Information related to derivatives is included in the Accounting Policies  
on page 87, and in note 15.
Post balance sheet events
On 31 January 2013, Filtrona entered into an agreement to form a joint 
venture, in which Filtrona will be the majority shareholder, with BBM 
Bommidala (“BBM”) in the United Arab Emirates to manufacture ﬁlters. 
BBM is an Indian-based producer of tobacco products and by-products  
and a leading cigarette exporter from India.
 
On 20 February 2013, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Ulinco 
Components AB (“Ulinco Components”) from Ulinco Invest Aktiebolag. 
Ulinco Components is a distributor of plastic protection and ﬁnishing 
products, hardware and specialist masking solutions in the Nordic region of 
Europe, and will be reported under the Component & Protection Solutions 
division. The acquisition of Ulinco Components will expand the product 
range and customer base of the Component Distribution businesses and 
extend the division’s geographic presence in Scandinavia.
Going concern statement
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and accordingly have adopted the going concern basis in preparing 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Further information regarding the 
ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position, and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 18 to  
19. In addition, note 1 to the Financial Statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, its ﬁnancial risk 
management objectives,and details of its ﬁnancial instruments, hedging 
activities and exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Cash balances 
and borrowings are included in note 21. This disclosure has been prepared 
in accordance the with Financial Reporting Council’s Going Concern and 
Liquidity Risk: “Guide for Directors of UK Companies 2009”.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure  
of information to the auditor
As required by section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
who were members of the Board at the time of approving this Report, 
having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the auditor, conﬁrm that:
 As far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 Each Director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director to ascertain any relevant audit information and to ensure  
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information

78 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 In respect of the Annual Report  
and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company 
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union (“EU”) and applicable law and have elected to prepare its 
parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements 
unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and parent company and of their proﬁt or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 For the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
 For the parent company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements; and
 Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
parent company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 The ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set 
of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities 
and ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

84 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
for the year ended 31 December 2012 a. Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) in accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606 / 2002) (“adopted IFRS”) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its individual company ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”); these are presented on pages 121 to 125.
The ﬁnancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for derivatives which are stated at fair value and retirement 
beneﬁt obligations which are valued in accordance with IAS 19: Employee beneﬁts. 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements that conform with adopted IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may ultimately 
differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period  
in which the estimate is revised and future periods if relevant.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements are detailed below. These policies have been consistently applied  
to all periods presented. 
The following standards were adopted by the Group during the year with no signiﬁcant impact on its consolidated results, ﬁnancial position  
or disclosures: 
IAS 12 (Amendment): Income taxes introduced a presumption, for deferred tax purposes, that recovery of the carrying amount of an investment 
property will normally be through sale.
The following standards or interpretations have not yet been adopted by the Group. The Group does not currently believe the adoptions of these 
standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or ﬁnancial position of the Group:
IAS 1 (Amendment): Presentation of ﬁnancial statements amends how components of other comprehensive income are presented. The amendments 
require the grouping of items of other comprehensive income into items that might be reclassiﬁed to the income statement in subsequent periods 
and items that will not be reclassiﬁed to the income statement in subsequent periods.
IFRS 7 (Amendment): Financial instruments: Disclosures amends disclosure requirements to require information about all recognised ﬁnancial 
instruments that are set off in accordance with paragraph 42 of IAS 32.
IAS 32 (Amendment): Financial instruments: Presentation provides clariﬁcation on the application of offsetting rules.
IFRS 9: Financial instruments (not yet endorsed by the EU) the primary impact of which is to remove the multiple classiﬁcation and measurement 
models for ﬁnancial assets required by IAS 39 and introduce a model that has only two classiﬁcation categories: amortised cost and fair value. 
IFRS 10: Consolidated ﬁnancial statements replaces the guidance of control and consolidation in IAS 27 and SIC 12: Consolidation – special purpose 
entities. The core principle that a consolidated entity presents a parent and its subsidiaries as if they were a single entity remains unchanged,  
as do the mechanics of consolidation.
IFRS 11: Joint arrangements requires joint arrangements to be accounted for as a joint operation or as a joint venture depending on the rights  
and obligations of each party to the arrangement. Proportionate consolidation for joint ventures will be eliminated and equity accounting will  
be mandatory. It is anticipated that the application of the standard will result in an immaterial decrease in net sales, total assets and total liabilities 
of the Group but have no impact on the Group’s net proﬁt or net assets.
IAS 28 (Revised): Associates and joint ventures which is to include consequential amendments resulting from the introduction of IFRS 11.
IFRS 12: Disclosure of interests in other entities requires enhanced disclosures of the nature, risks and ﬁnancial effects associated with the  
Group’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structured entities.
IAS 27 (Revised): Separate ﬁnancial statements (not yet endorsed by the EU) makes revisions to the requirements for separate ﬁnancial statements 
prepared by a parent or an investor in a joint venture or associate.
IFRS 13: Fair value measurement explains how to measure fair value and aims to enhance fair value disclosures. The standard does not change  
the measurement of fair value but codiﬁes it in one place.
Financial Statements 85 Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Accounting Policies a. Basis of preparation continued
IAS 1 (Amendment), IFRS 13 and IFRS 7 (Amendment) are all effective 1 January 2013 and will be adopted by the Group in the accounting year 
beginning 1 January 2013.
IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12, IAS 27 (Revised), IAS 28 (Revised) and IAS 32 (Amendment) are all effective 1 January 2014, subject to EU endorsement in the 
case of IAS 27 (Revised). The Group intends to adopt these standards in the accounting year beginning 1 January 2014, subject to EU endorsement.
IAS 19 (Amendment): Employee beneﬁts changes a number of disclosure requirements for post employment arrangements and restricts the 
options currently available on how to account for deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans. The amendment requires the expected returns on pension plan 
assets, currently calculated based on management’s estimate of expected returns, to be replaced by a credit on the pension plan assets calculated 
at the liability discount rate. In future years, this change is expected to result in a decrease in ﬁnance income on pension scheme assets, recognised 
in the income statement, and an equal and opposite increase in the actual returns less expected returns on pension scheme assets credited to 
other comprehensive income. The Group does not expect this change to impact the Group’s net assets. The amendment also removes the option 
to include an expense reserve in pension scheme liabilities. This change is expected to result in a one-off credit to other comprehensive income 
and a corresponding increase in net assets in 2013, to release the expense reserves previously recognised within pension scheme liabilities.
The amendment to IAS 19 is effective 1 January 2013 and will be adopted by the Group in the accounting year beginning 1 January 2013.
All other standards and interpretations recently adopted by the EU not discussed above did not have or are not expected to have a signiﬁcant 
impact on the Group.
For the purposes of these ﬁnancial statements “Filtrona” or ”the Group” means Filtrona plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries.
Information regarding the ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 18 to 19. In addition, note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing  
its capital, its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of its ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities and exposures to credit, market  
and liquidity risk. Cash balances and borrowings are detailed in note 21. The Directors have prepared plans and forecasts for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of signing these ﬁnancial statements. Based on these, and taking into consideration the risks detailed in note 1, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
and accordingly have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. This disclosure has been prepared in 
accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: “Guide for Directors of UK Companies 2009”.
b. Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Filtrona. Control exists when Filtrona has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the ﬁnancial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic beneﬁt from its activities. The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
ﬁnancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expense arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
c. Foreign currency
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of the Group’s subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the subsidiary operates (“functional currency”). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in sterling (functional currency of the 
parent company). 
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and recognised in the income 
statement unless hedge accounting criteria apply (see policy for derivatives).
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling 
at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average 
exchange rates. 
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences on retranslation at the closing rate of the opening balances of overseas entities are taken to other comprehensive income, as are 
exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings and derivatives designated as net investment hedges, to the extent that they are 
effective. Other exchange differences are taken to the income statement. Differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 are included in retained earnings.
86 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Accounting Policies continued d. Financial instruments
In accordance with IAS 39: Financial instruments: recognition and measurement (“IAS 39”), interest bearing loans and borrowings and other 
ﬁnancial liabilities (excluding derivatives) are held at amortised cost, unless they are included in a hedge accounting relationship. See note 15  
for separate disclosure of hedge types. 
Derivatives are measured initially at fair value. Subsequent recognition in the ﬁnancial statements depends on the classiﬁcation of the derivative  
as follows: 
(i) Fair value hedges
Where a derivative is used to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a monetary asset or liability, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognised 
in the income statement. 
(ii) Cash ﬂow hedges
Where a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in a cash ﬂow hedge the change in fair value is recognised in other comprehensive 
income to the extent that it is effective and any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Where the underlying transaction 
results in a ﬁnancial asset, accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item affects 
proﬁt or loss. Where the hedged item results in a non-ﬁnancial asset the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the asset. 
(iii) Hedges of net investment in foreign operations
The gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is deemed effective is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. Any ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
e. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Previously revalued properties were 
treated as being held at deemed cost upon transition to adopted IFRS.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment or other assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and other assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
f. Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives on a straight line basis at the following annual rates: 
Freehold land   Not depreciated
Buildings    2% or life of lease if shorter
Plant and machinery   7-20%
Fixtures, ﬁttings and equipment 10-33%
The assets’ useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
g. Leases
Rentals associated with operating leases are expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis. Lease incentives are amortised in the 
income statement over the life of the lease.
h. Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses. 
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. For acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004 goodwill represents the 
difference between the fair value of the assets given in consideration and the fair value of identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities  
of the acquiree. For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount 
previously recorded under UK GAAP. 
Since 1 January 2010 the Group has expensed costs attributable to acquisitions in the income statement.
Financial Statements 87 Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 h. Intangible assets continued
(ii) Research and development
Research costs are expensed to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. 
Development costs relating to new products are capitalised if the new product is technically and commercially feasible and a reliable estimate  
of the development costs can be made. All other development costs are recognised in the income statement and expensed as incurred.
(iii) Other intangible assets
An intangible asset acquired in a business combination is recognised at fair value to the extent it is probable that the expected future economic 
beneﬁts attributable to the asset will ﬂow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. Intangible assets principally relate to customer 
relationships, which are valued using discounted cash ﬂows based on historical customer attrition rates, and developed technology, which is 
valued using an income approach. The cost of intangible assets is amortised through the income statement on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful economic life. 
i. Impairment
All assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite lives 
are tested annually. Other intangible assets are tested if there is an indication of impairment.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of a non-ﬁnancial asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount, being the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, and is recognised in the income statement. Value in use is estimated 
based on future cash ﬂows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital.
j. Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (on a ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out basis) and net realisable value. For work-in-progress and ﬁnished goods, cost 
includes an appropriate proportion of labour cost and overheads.
k. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and ﬁxed term investments whose maturities are three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Bank overdrafts repayable on demand form an integral part of Filtrona’s cash management and are included as part of cash and cash equivalents 
in the statement of cash ﬂows.
l. Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal to fair value at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised in the income statement over the term of the borrowings.
m. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables carrying value is estimated as the present value of future cash ﬂows less impairment losses.
n. Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
o. Catalogue costs
The costs associated with the production and printing of catalogues are expensed to the income statement when access is received to those goods.
88 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Accounting Policies continued p. Income tax
Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and any adjustment to tax payable in prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases and the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible  
for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss, and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset or liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
q. Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement net of expected warranty claims when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards  
of ownership have been transferred to the customer.
The majority of the Group’s businesses sell goods on an ex-works basis, where the Group as seller makes its goods ready for collection at its 
premises on an agreed upon sales date and the buyer incurs all transportation and handling costs and bears the risks for bringing the goods to 
their chosen destination. The Group operates non ex-works terms with customers in some of its businesses, and in these businesses, revenue is 
recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. These terms include some consignment 
stock agreements, where revenue is recognised when the customer removes the goods from consignment stock.
r. Finance income and expense
Finance income and expense is recognised in the income statement as it accrues.
s. Segment reporting
A segment is identiﬁed on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Group Management Committee (refer to Corporate 
Governance Report) in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. 
t. Pensions
(i) Deﬁned contribution schemes
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension schemes are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The signiﬁcant pension schemes in Europe and the US have been accounted for on a deﬁned beneﬁt basis.
The net obligations in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes are calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of future 
beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that beneﬁt is discounted to determine its present 
value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated bonds that 
have maturity dates approximating to the terms of Filtrona’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed independent actuary using 
the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses that have arisen are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The amounts charged to operating proﬁt are the current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on settlement and curtailments.  
The expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities is included within ﬁnance expense and the expected return on scheme assets  
is included within ﬁnance income.
Financial Statements 89 Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 u. Share-based payments continued
Filtrona operates equity-settled, share-based incentive plans. A charge is made in the income statement based on the fair value of option awards 
using the Monte Carlo or binomial valuation models and relevant quoted share price information with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and vesting date of the options. The amount recognised as an expense 
will be adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of share options that vest with the exception of options that fail to vest because market-based 
conditions are not met.
v.  One-off items in the consolidated income statement
The exceptional operating items below are separated from other items by virtue of their size and incidence. They are shown as a separate line item 
within operating proﬁt on the face of the income statement in order for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the ﬁnancial information 
and performance. These items exclude amortisation of acquired intangible assets which are also presented separately in the income statement.
(i) Acquisition fees
In 2012, Filtrona incurred signiﬁcant one-off costs in professional fees as a result of the acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of Securit World 
Ltd, Jae Yong Co. Ltd, John R. Lyman Company and Big Blue Properties LLC. In 2011, Filtrona likewise incurred signiﬁcant one-off costs in professional 
fees as a result of the acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of Richco, Inc. and the assets and business of Reid Supply Company.
(ii) Acquisition integration and restructuring costs
Costs relating to the integration and restructuring of acquired businesses into the Group.
(iii) Other exceptional items
In 2012, this represents a release of pension obligations in the Enitor business and costs arising from further reconﬁguration of the Group.  
In 2011, other exceptional costs represented insurance proceeds received net of associated costs, the loss on disposal of the Group’s shares  
in FractureCode Corporation ApS and reorganisation costs within certain of the Group’s divisions.
w. Investment in own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Beneﬁt Trust for the purpose of fulﬁlling obligations in respect of share option plans are treated as 
belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury shares) are also deducted  
from retained earnings. 
x. Provisions
A provision is recognised when there is a probable legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the outﬂow of resources that will be required to settle the obligation. The outﬂow is the present value of management’s best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
y. Net debt
Net debt is deﬁned as interest bearing loans and borrowings, net of cash and cash equivalents.
z. Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company (ﬁnal dividend) or paid 
(interim dividend).
90 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Accounting Policies continued The following provides information on those policies that management considers critical because of the level of judgement and estimation required 
which often involves assumptions regarding future events which can vary from what is anticipated. The Directors believe that the ﬁnancial statements 
reﬂect appropriate judgements and estimates and provide a true and fair view of Filtrona’s performance and ﬁnancial position. 
(i) Pensions
Filtrona accounts for its deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes in accordance with IAS 19. The application of IAS 19 requires the exercise of judgement 
in relation to the assumptions used and for each assumption there is a range of possible outcomes (see note 18). In consultation with Filtrona’s 
actuaries, management decides the point within those ranges that most appropriately reﬂects Filtrona’s circumstances. Small changes to these 
assumptions can have a signiﬁcant impact on valuations. The Group performs a sensitivity analysis for the signiﬁcant assumptions used in determining 
post-employment costs and liabilities, as detailed in note 18.
(ii) Intangible assets
IFRS 3 requires the identiﬁcation of acquired intangible assets as part of a business combination. The methods used to value such intangible assets 
require the use of estimates. Future results are impacted by the amortisation periods adopted and changes to the estimated useful lives would 
result in different effects on the income statement and balance sheet. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment, along with the ﬁnite lived intangible assets and other assets of the Group’s cash 
generating units. Tests for impairment are based on discounted cash ﬂows and assumptions (including discount rates, timing and growth prospects) 
which are inherently subjective. The Group performs various sensitivity analyses in respect of the tests for impairment, as detailed in note 9.
The useful lives of the Group’s ﬁnite lived intangible assets are reviewed following the tests for impairment annually.
(iii) Taxation
Accruals for tax contingencies require management judgements and estimates in respect of tax audit issues and exposures in each of the 
jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Management is also required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an 
assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments. The Group performs 
appropriate sensitivity analysis in respect of taxation judgements that are materially sensitive as they arise.
(iv) Provisions 
Filtrona’s provisions are management’s best estimate of exposure, in cases where there is a probable legal or constructive obligation as a result  
of a past event, based on currently available information. By their nature these provisions are judgemental. The Group performs appropriate 
sensitivity analysis in respect of provision judgements that are materially sensitive as they arise.
(v) Depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment represents a signiﬁcant proportion of the asset base of the Group. Therefore, the estimates and assumptions  
made to determine their carrying value and related depreciation are critical to the Group’s ﬁnancial position and performance.
The charge in respect of depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value  
at the end of its life. Decreasing an asset’s expected life or its residual value would result in a higher depreciation charge in the income statement.
The useful lives of the Group’s assets are determined by management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed at least annually for 
appropriateness. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact  
their life, such as changes in technology. Historically, changes in useful lives and residual values have not resulted in material changes to the 
Group’s depreciation charge.

Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates 1. Risk management
Filtrona’s activities expose the business to a number of key risks which have the potential to affect its ability to achieve its business objectives.
The Board has overall responsibility for Filtrona’s system of internal control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this system. 
Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Filtrona has a centralised treasury department to manage funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Treasury 
policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of derivatives that may be employed and the 
criteria for investing and borrowing cash. Filtrona uses derivatives only to manage currency and interest rate risk arising from underlying business 
activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The treasury department is subject to periodic independent reviews by the 
Group Assurance department. Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination 
of geographic presence, expertise and suitable credit rating. 
The following describes Filtrona’s ﬁnancial risk exposure and management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
(i) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial asset fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises 
principally from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Filtrona has no signiﬁcant individual concentrations of credit risk. The following  
is an overview of how Filtrona manages its credit risk exposures.
Trade and other receivables
Filtrona’s exposure to credit risk is driven by the proﬁle of its customers. This is inﬂuenced by the demographics of the customer base, including 
the industry and country in which customers operate. Trade and other receivables are generally due from customers who are unlikely to seek 
credit ratings as part of their normal course of business. 
Filtrona monitors signiﬁcant customers’ credit limits and there is an allowance for impairment that represents the estimate of potential losses in respect 
of trade and other receivables. The components of this allowance are a speciﬁc allowance for individual losses and a collective allowance for losses 
that have been incurred but not yet identiﬁed. The collective allowance takes account of historical experience and the proﬁle of customers.
As at 31 December 2012, gross trade receivables were £85.4m (2011: £77.8m) of which £13.2m (2011: £13.3m) were past due but not impaired. 
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows:

Up to 3 months 13.2 13.3
As at 31 December 2012, trade receivables of £4.9m (2011: £6.7m) were provided for as they were considered to be impaired. The ageing of the 
impaired receivables provided for is as follows:

92 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Notes Derivative assets
Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard 
form documentation exists. The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis. The credit limits imposed specify  
the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty. These limits are determined by geographic presence, 
expertise and credit rating. Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative 
assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties. AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are 
neither impaired nor past due.

Filtrona’s maximum credit risk exposure is £131.9m (2011: £116.3m) and no collateral is held against this amount (2011: £nil).
(ii) Market price risk
Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of ﬁnancial assets and 
liabilities. Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% 
weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points (“bps”), 100bps and 200bps in 
market interest rates. The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ. 
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a) Currency risk
Filtrona publishes its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies. Therefore it is subject  
to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their 
transaction costs. 
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The majority of Filtrona’s net assets are in currencies other than sterling. The Company’s normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the 
resulting impact on shareholders’ funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has signiﬁcant net assets. At 31 December 2012, 
Filtrona’s euro denominated assets were 90% hedged by its euro denominated borrowings (2011: 92%), whilst its US dollar denominated assets 
were approximately 47% (2011: 59%) hedged by the US dollar denominated borrowings.
Transaction exposure hedging
The majority of Filtrona’s transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited. However, 
where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable 
forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 12 months. 
Filtrona does not formally deﬁne the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage 
on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Group’s risk management policies and prevailing market conditions. The Group 
documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash ﬂow hedges. To the extent that cash ﬂow hedges are effective, 
gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income 
statement or to the non-ﬁnancial asset acquired.
Financial Statements 93 Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 1. Risk management continued
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies. To calculate 
the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies’ average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%. The 
translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged. Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by 
increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges. It is assumed that all net 
investment and cash ﬂow hedges will be 100% effective.

b) Interest rate risk
Filtrona’s strategy is to ensure with a reasonable degree of certainty that at least 50% of the overall net ﬁnance expense is protected against 
material adverse movements in interest rates using ﬁxed interest rate debt, interest rate swaps and caps. 
The following table shows Filtrona’s sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates. 
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external ﬂoating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings 
have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted 
for the effect of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives. The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of  
a 50bps, 100bps or 200bps decrease or increase in interest rates on the fair values of Filtrona’s interest rate derivatives.

Notes (iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, will encounter difﬁculties in meeting obligations associated with ﬁnancial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or another ﬁnancial asset.
In 2011 Filtrona signed an agreement with a syndicate of relationship banks to provide new banking facilities until August 2016. This facility replaced 
its existing facilities which expired in April 2012. Fees of £3.1m paid in respect of these facilities have been capitalised and are being expensed  
in the income statement over the expected life of the facilities in accordance with the effective interest method. 
Filtrona’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility. Filtrona is mostly funded by two series of US$80m US 
Private Placement Loan Notes from various ﬁnancial institutions and syndicated ﬁve-year revolving credit facilities of £165.6m and €187.7m from 
its bankers. The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have maturities of seven and ten years and the revolving credit facilities mature in August 
2016. At 31 December 2012 the available bank and non-bank facilities totalled £416.4m (2011: £425.2m) of which £207.4m (2011: £181.1m) was 
drawn down. In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term ﬂexibility. 
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtrona’s available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were:

Expiring after two years 209.0 244.1
Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at ﬂoating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.

Total trade and other receivables carried at £94.5m (2011: £85.4m) include prepayments and accrued income of £4.3m (2011: £6.1m) which are 
not ﬁnancial assets and are therefore excluded from the above analysis. 
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared 
to contracted rates. 
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes. The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost 
with a carrying value of £97.1m (2011: £102.1m). The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes is £111.7m (2011: £117.6m).
All other ﬁnancial assets, classiﬁed as ‘loans and receivables’, and trade and other payables, classiﬁed as ‘amortised cost’, are held at amortised cost 
and have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values. Unsecured bank loans, 
included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at ﬂoating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate fair 
values at the reporting date. The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities fall within level two in the fair value hierarchy.
(iv) Capital structure
Filtrona deﬁnes its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this to safeguard  
its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes 
in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Filtrona may return 
capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. EBITDA is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before 
depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating 
items. Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees. During 2012, Filtrona’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2011, was to maintain the 
medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios at 31 December were:

Financial Statements 97 Enabling Everywhere  |  Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 2. Segment analysis continued
Continuing operations’ net ﬁnance expense of £9.5m (2011: £8.3m) and income tax expense of £23.4m (2011: £21.9m) cannot be meaningfully 
allocated by segment. The majority of unallocated assets relate to deferred tax assets, retirement beneﬁt assets and cash and cash equivalents. 
The majority of unallocated liabilities relate to interest bearing loans and borrowings, retirement beneﬁt obligations, deferred tax liabilities and 
income tax payable. 
No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in either 2012 or 2011. Analysed by destination, revenue to Europe is £273.7m, revenue  
to North America is £203.8m and revenue to Asia is £140.8m (2011: revenue in the UK was £48.6m, with revenue in the US of £137.2m). 
Non-current assets in the UK total £76.7m (2011: £56.0m) with other signiﬁcant locations being the US and The Netherlands with non-current 
assets of £203.1m and £32.2m (2011: £186.7m and £34.7m) respectively.
Included within revenue is the net gain arising from the change in the fair value of forward exchange cash ﬂow hedges transferred to the income 
statement of £1.1m (2011: net loss of £0.4m).

The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of Filtrona’s operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed 
due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for certain audit-related work to be carried out by the Company’s auditor rather than another ﬁrm of 
accountants. The Audit Committee, which consists of independent Non-Executive Directors, reviews and approves the level and nature of non-audit work which the 
auditor performs, including the fees paid for such work, thus ensuring that the auditor’s objectivity and independence is not compromised

Factors affecting income tax expense for the year
Filtrona operates in many countries and is subject to income tax in many different jurisdictions. Filtrona calculates its average expected tax rate  
as a weighted average of the national corporate income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates.

Other items 1.4 0.8
Income tax expense 23.4 21.9
The decrease in the weighted average applicable tax rate is caused by a change in the geographical balance of the Group’s proﬁts and by changes 
in corporate tax rates in these geographies.
Income tax expense in the UK is £3.1m (2011: £2.7m). The UK corporate tax rate reduced from 26% to 24% on 1 April 2012 and a further reduction 
in the rate to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 has been enacted. The impact of these enacted changes on deferred tax is immaterial. The UK 
Government has announced its intention to further reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014.

The impairment during 2011 related to plant and machinery and land and buildings that have been assessed as non-recoverable through  
ongoing use in the Group and are expected to have no value on disposal. The impairment charge of £5.8m made in 2011 was recognised  
within exceptional operating items and related to the integration of acquisitions and reorganisation within certain of the Group’s segments.
Included within land and buildings and plant and machinery are assets in the course of construction of £5.1m (2011: £11.2m) which were not 
depreciated during the year.

The weighted average useful economic life of customer relationships and other intangible assets at the end of the year was 17.2 years and 14.6 years 
(2011: 17.9 years and 15.2 years) respectively.
Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. A discounted cash ﬂow analysis 
is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash ﬂows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible

The tests are based on the following assumptions:
 Cash ﬂows for the next two years are based upon the Group’s annual Plan.
 Cash ﬂows beyond the Plan period are based on year two’s Plan cash ﬂows with growth rates speciﬁc to each business which range from nil to 3%.
 The estimated cash ﬂows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon Filtrona’s estimated post-tax weighted average cost of 
capital of 8.5% (2011: 8.5%) adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment. The pre-tax discount rates used ranged from 11.3%  
to 16.2% (2011: 11.6% to 13.8%).
Any impairment identiﬁed as a result of the analysis is expensed to the income statement. The test is dependent on management estimates and 
judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash ﬂows, and the discount rate applied to these cash ﬂows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash ﬂows by up to 25%, reducing terminal growth rates by up 
to eight percentage points or increasing pre-tax discount rates by up to 100 bps. The results of these analyses showed that, despite signiﬁcantly 
lower post-tax operating cash ﬂows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the value in use of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to 
exceed their carrying value.

Fair value derivatives protect the Group from currency risk exposure from changes in the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a previously 
unrecognised ﬁrm commitment to buy or sell assets at a ﬁxed price. 
Cash ﬂow hedges are hedges of the currency and interest rate risk exposure to variability in cash ﬂows. 
Hedges of net investments are hedges of the currency risk exposure to changes in the carrying value of recognised investments in foreign operations. 
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchases 
will be transferred to the income statement when the forecast sales and purchases occur. All of the hedged transactions are expected to occur 
over the next 15 months and all derivative instruments mature within the next 15 months.
106 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012
Notes During 2012, Filtrona had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary 
undertakings. The exchange gains of £5.0m on the US dollar borrowings and the gains of £1.4m on the euro borrowings were recognised  
in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2012.
During 2011, Filtrona had US dollar and euro denominated borrowings which it designated as hedges of its net investments in subsidiary 
undertakings. The exchange losses of £1.4m on the US dollar borrowings and the gains of £1.7m on the euro borrowings were recognised  
in other comprehensive income at 31 December 2011.
Finance income and expense arising on ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities held at amortised cost are those amounts, excluding the expected 
return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension scheme liabilities, detailed in note 4. The only losses recognised on ﬁnancial assets held

redundancy costs (2011: redundancy costs). Other provisions relate primarily to vacant properties, employees’ compensation claims and product 
warranties. Non-current provisions are generally long-term in nature with the timing of utilisation uncertain.
18. Employee beneﬁts 
Post-employment beneﬁts
Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualiﬁed actuaries. Full triennial 
actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European deﬁned beneﬁt schemes as at 5 April 2009 and annual actuarial valuations are performed 
on the principal US deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. The assets and liabilities of the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date 
from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions. A new 
actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2012 has been prepared and is currently under review by the Company and the Trustees.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices. Deﬁned beneﬁt contributions in 2013  
are currently under consideration by the Company and the trustees and therefore cannot be reasonably determined at the date of this report.

The Group will be adopting IAS 19 (Amended) on 1 January 2013. As a comparator, the income statement charge for 2012 under IAS 19 
(Amended) would be £1.9m higher. Under IAS 19 (Amended), there would be a net ﬁnance expense in 2012 of £0.9m rather than a net ﬁnance 
income of £0.3m and the deﬁned beneﬁt charge to operating expense would be £2.2m rather than £1.5m. Under IAS 19 (Amended) the actuarial 
gain, recognised in other comprehensive income, would equally be £1.9m higher in 2012. In addition, removing the expense reserves included in 
pension scheme liabilities, as required under IAS 19 (Amended), would result in a one-off credit to other comprehensive income and a 
corresponding increase in net retirement beneﬁt assets of £4.4m in 2012.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualiﬁed actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were:
2012 2011 
Europe US Europe US

Expected return on scheme assets 4.80% 7.10% 5.00% 7.10%

For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement. For service after April 2010, pension is linked to salary at April 2010 with 
annual increases capped at 3%
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale 
covered, may not be borne out in practice. 
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate deﬁned beneﬁt obligations at the year end are:
2012 2011 
Europe US Europe US
Male retiring today at age 65 21.3 19.2 20.8 19.1

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free 
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is 
invested and the expectations for the future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the 
actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Notes 23. Acquisitions
2012 acquisitions: Securit and Jae Yong
On 17 February 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Securit World Ltd (“Securit”) from the Heyden family. Securit distributes 
desktop personal identiﬁcation (“ID”) card systems, providing printers, software and associated accessories across a wide range of growing 
end-markets, including Trade Distribution, Education, Government, Health and General Industry. The acquisition of UK-based Securit adds to  
the existing capabilities of Filtrona’s Payne Security personal ID products business and provides new opportunities in adjacent attractive growth 
sectors, such as Access Control and Membership.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reﬂect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments  
are provisional and subject to ﬁnalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Securit had been completed on 1 January 2012 the contribution to 2012 Group revenue would have been 
£10.2m and to Group operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation would have been £1.3m.
Securit contributed £8.7m to revenue and £1.1m to operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 
2012. Related acquisition expenses of £0.2m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items. 
On 23 April 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Jae Yong Co. Ltd (“Jae Yong”) from the Lee family. Based in South Korea,  
Jae Yong is a globally recognised manufacturer of reservoirs, nibs and tubes for the writing instruments industry, and will be reported under  
the Porous Technologies division.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reﬂect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments  
are provisional and subject to ﬁnalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Jae Yong had been completed on 1 January 2012 the contribution to 2012 Group revenue would have 
been £2.5m and to Group operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation would have been £nil.
Jae Yong contributed £1.6m to revenue and made a £0.2m loss before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 
2012. Related acquisition expenses of £0.4m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.

The deferred contingent consideration of £0.4m in respect of Jae Yong becomes payable between one and three years after completion subject 
to the achievement of certain performance conditions.
Property, plant and equipment, inventories, and payables were all reassessed to their fair value. 
The adjustment to deferred tax is the tax effect of recognising customer relationships and other intangibles and the tax effect of the fair value 
adjustments above.
Included in the £4.9m of goodwill recognised above is the value of revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce. Due to their nature 
these assets cannot be individually identiﬁed or measured. It is expected that none of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets will be 
allowable for tax deduction in future years.
2012 acquisitions: Lymtech
On 13 June 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of John R. Lyman Company and Big Blue Properties LLC (together “Lymtech 
Scientiﬁc”) from William Wright and an associated family trust. Based in the US, Lymtech Scientiﬁc is a manufacturer and distributor of porous 
speciality wiping materials used within the clean environments increasingly required by the medical, life science, electronic and industrial markets. 
The acquisition of Lymtech Scientiﬁc adds complementary technology to Porous Technologies and also enhances the commercial capability of the 
division through the addition of a distribution selling channel.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reﬂect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments  
are provisional and subject to ﬁnalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Lymtech had been completed on 1 January 2012 the contribution to 2012 Group revenue would have  
been £17.8m and to Group operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation would have been £2.8m.
Lymtech Scientiﬁc contributed £8.2m to revenue and £1.9m to operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition  
to 31 December 2012. Related acquisition expenses of £0.6m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.

2011 acquisitions: Reid Supply
In 2011, Filtrona acquired the assets and business of Reid Supply Company (“Reid Supply”). Net cash outﬂow in respect of this acquisition was 
£18.3m in 2011.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of Reid Supply were adjusted to reﬂect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments were 
ﬁnalised in 2012 with an increase in accruals of £0.2m. Goodwill was increased accordingly in 2012.
As detailed in the summary below, deferred contingent consideration of £1.2m is payable by the Group if Reid Supply exceeds a target revenue 
during the 12 months to 31 December 2012. Achievement of this target is currently being considered.

2011 acquisitions: Richco
In 2011, Filtrona acquired the entire issued share capital of Richco, Inc. (“Richco”) from family and employee shareholders of the acquired company. 
Net cash outﬂow in respect of this acquisition was £70.7m in 2011.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of Richco were adjusted to reﬂect their fair values to Filtrona. The fair value adjustments were ﬁnalised  
in 2012 with an increase in accruals of £0.2m. Goodwill was increased accordingly in 2012.
In May 2012, the Group received a £2.5m working capital adjustment in respect of Richco. This was recorded as a reduction in the value of goodwill 
acquired and as a cash inﬂow from the acquisition of businesses, within investing activities, during the year.

adjustments below. 
Property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, provisions and payables were all reassessed to their fair value. 
The book value of trade receivables acquired is stated net of impairment losses of £0.3m.
Included in the £24.2m of goodwill recognised above is the value of revenue and cost synergies, including entry into new geographic and 
end-markets where previously Protection & Finishing Products was not present, and an assembled workforce. Due to their nature these assets 
cannot be individually identiﬁed or measured. It is expected that approximately 35% of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets will be 
allowable for tax deduction in future years.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Richco had been completed on 1 January 2011 the contribution to 2011 Group revenue would have been 
£47.2m and to Group operating proﬁt before intangible amortisation would have been £6.3m.
Relevant previous acquisitions
During 2011, Filtrona reassessed the fair value adjustments made in respect of Stera Tape, which was acquired in 2010, and increased certain 
accruals by £0.5m. Goodwill was increased accordingly in 2011. 
The revenue and gross proﬁt margin targets set in 2010 in respect of the acquisition of BP Labels were not met and as a result £0.3m was credited 
to the income statement during 2011.

disposal expenses were in total £0.1m in 2011. In 2012, Filtrona received £0.2m from ITO Technologies ApS, which represented the ﬁnal instalment 
of the consideration.

Filtrona plc Company Balance Sheet
at 31 December 2012 a. Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable 
UK accounting standards. 
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Filtrona plc is exempt from the requirements to present its own proﬁt and loss account and 
cash ﬂow statement. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, because the published consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements of the Group include disclosures which comply with the Standard. 
The following principal accounting policies have been consistently applied.
b. Investment in subsidiary undertaking
Investment in subsidiary undertaking is held at cost less any provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether 
the investment in its subsidiary has been impaired.
c. Share-based payments
The fair value of share options is measured at grant date. It is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the 
relevant employees work over the expected period between grant and vesting date of the options, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves. 
d. Own shares
The shares held in the Filtrona Employee Beneﬁt Trust for the purpose of fulﬁlling obligations in respect of share incentive plans are treated as 
belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings. The cost of shares held directly (treasury shares) is also deducted from 
retained earnings.
e. Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company (ﬁnal dividend) or paid 
(interim dividend).
f. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains 
or losses on translation are included in the proﬁt and loss account. Exchange differences arising from movements in spot rates are included in the 
proﬁt and loss account as exchange gains or losses, while those arising from the interest differential elements of forward currency contracts are 
included in external interest income or expense.
g. Financial instruments
Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value. The subsequent measurement depends on the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnancial instrument. 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings and other ﬁnancial liabilities (excluding derivatives) are held at amortised cost. 
The Company holds ﬁnancial instruments which hedge the net investments in the foreign operations of its subsidiary undertakings. Since the 
Company does not hold the underlying investments, gains and losses on these instruments are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.

On 26 June 2007, EAG Limited (“EAG”) completed its initial public 
offering (“IPO”) on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange 
(“AIM”), raising gross proceeds of £125 million. Subsequently, EAG 
arranged $140 million of new financing facilities, which have been 
renegotiated to a revised level of $75 million following termination 
of the acquisition strategy. These proceeds and financing facilities 
provided EAG with the resources to continue its expansion by 
acquisition into microelectronic failure analysis services, thereby 
broadening the range of testing services on offer to customers.
The businesses in microanalytical surface analysis and materials 
characterisation services, which constitute 63% of EAG’s revenues, 
continued to build on their market leading positions. This was 
driven by continued investment in instruments and skilled scientists 
to further broaden and expand the testing services.
Shortly before the IPO, EAG acquired the business of Accurel 
Systems International, which has now been combined with that 
of AMER Inc, which was acquired in late 2006. Since flotation, EAG 
continued its expansion strategy with the acquisitions of Micro 
Electronic Failure Analysis Services Inc, DSL Labs Inc and White 
Mountain Labs LLC. Together, these acquisitions position EAG 
as a leading supplier of microelectronic failure analysis services. 
This reflects the strategy of building leading positions in both 
microanalytical surface analysis and microelectronic failure analysis.
On 19 December 2007 , EAG announced an increase in overall 
expenses since the IPO, together with a realignment of management 
responsibilities and the initiation of a full strategic review to consider 
all options, including the possibility of an outright sale. I was 
appointed Non Executive Chairman; David Lahar, previously Executive 
Chairman, became Chief Executive; Jim Cowart relinquished his 
position as Vice Chairman but remained a Non-Executive Director 
and Thomas Pfeil resigned as Chief Executive. Furthermore, an 
independent committee of the Board was formed of non-executive 
directors to consider the strategic options, including the possibility of 
an outright sale, which is ongoing.
On 13 February 2008, EAG announced that it had received 
notification of the formation of a concert party by a group of EAG 
shareholders comprising David Lahar, Jim Cowart, Thomas Pfeil and 
American Capital Strategies Limited. Subsequently, on 26 March 2008, 
EAG announced that it had received notification that the concert 
party had been disbanded, and that David Lahar and Jim Cowart 
were no longer considering a possible offer for the company.
The strategic review is ongoing, and a number of expressions 
of interest have been received that are being pursued through an 
orderly process to explore the possibility of a sale. These results and 
the management budgeting process are important tools which the 
board will use to appraise any offers or proposed offers that might be 
made. The board will keep shareholders informed of developments.
The company would like to remind shareholders that EAG is 
not subject to the City Code on Takeovers & Mergers. However, 
the articles of association contain certain provisions relating to 
takeovers, copies of which are available on the company’s  
website at www.eaglabs.com.
A maiden interim dividend of 3 cents per share was paid in 
October 2007. At the time of the IPO, it was stated that the intention 
was to pay a dividend of 8 cents per share in the first 12 months as a 
public company. However, the board has decided to postpone any 
decision on future dividends, pending clarity of the future strategy.
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and 
senior management for their continued efforts and loyalty 
throughout a challenging period.
Outlook
Trading in the new year has been broadly in line with market 
expectations, notwithstanding the challenging conditions 
experienced in EAG’s main markets. Looking ahead, there are a 
number of new areas of optimism, including Asia and photovoltaic 
technologies. Nevertheless, the outlook is necessarily cautious in 
light of uncertainties in the general economic environment, and 
particularly in the semiconductor equipment and manufacturing 
areas, as well as the ongoing strategic review. The company 
remains confident in the attractiveness of the markets and their 
growth prospects over the longer term.
Ian Johnson 
Non-Executive Chairman 
30 March 2008
“2007 was certainly an eventful year. The IPO and new financing facilities laid the foundation for a period of 
rapid growth by acquisition to expand into the complementary market of failure analysis while continuing 
to build EAG’s leading position in surface analysis. The consequences of the rapid enlargement and multiple 
integration issues required changes to be made to the board and senior management at the end of the year 
together with strengthening of the finance function. A full strategic review of the business was initiated, 
including the possibility of an outright sale. This review is well underway and expressions of interest have 
been received from a number of parties to acquire the company. With publication of these results, the board 
is able to pursue a fuller dialogue and accelerate the process.”
CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        3
Four acquisitions were completed in the year which, together 
with earlier acquisitions, has positioned the group as a leading 
supplier of microelectronic failure analysis and “release to 
production” services. This opens an exciting new market that 
is complementary to the microanalytical surface analysis and 
materials characterisation services. 
In 2007, EAG’s clear market leadership in Secondary Ion Mass 
Spectrometry (“SIMS”) and Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry 
(“GDMS”) techniques, coupled with a strong presence in Asia, 
resulted in solid growth in a number of segments – electronic 
specialty metals and alloys, integrated circuit foundries, aerospace/
defence, lasers/optics and solar/energy.
EAG’s semiconductor capital equipment and integrated device 
manufacturing segments proved more challenging, as growth 
in the first half was followed by contraction in the second half. 
In the late summer, major foundries and large semiconductor 
manufacturers began to indicate that capital expenditure budgets 
could be reduced. Among integrated device manufacturers, 
general economic uncertainty, particularly with respect to 
EAG’s European clients in this segment, resulted in a reduction 
in demand for testing in second half. However, EAG’s revenue 
from the integrated circuit foundries and fabless semiconductor 
companies has grown.
Geographically, 74% of total sales were derived in the United 
States, 17% in Asia and 9% in Europe. Revenues from EAG’s 
operations in Asia increased significantly in 2007, particularly due 
to growth in demand from integrated circuit foundries in Taiwan, 
China and Singapore, emerging demand for purity testing of 
photovoltaic grade silicon feedstock in China, and the rapidly 
expanding fabless semiconductor segment in China.
The surface analysis testing business operates primarily from US 
laboratories in California, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Texas, New 
Jersey, North Carolina, and Arizona, the international laboratories 
in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Shanghai and Taiwan, as well 
as the sales office in Tokyo. The microelectronic failure analysis and 
“release to production” services business operates primarily from 
laboratories in northern and southern California and Arizona.
Microelectronic failure analysis and “release to production” 
testing services are provided primarily to fabless semiconductor 
companies and small to medium-sized integrated device 
manufacturers, and include automated test, failure analysis,  
circuit debug and edit, reliability and qualification testing (burn-in, 
stress, electro-static discharge and latch-up testing). These testing 
services are critical in bringing an integrated circuit design from 
conceptualisation to volume production.
In the year ahead, the plan is to integrate the acquisitions made 
during 2007. As a consequence, four facilities are expected to 
be consolidated by combining Accurel Systems International, 
AMER and DSL Labs into a single facility that is designed to 
accommodate all aspects of the microanalytical failure analysis 
services. This consolidation is expected to require one-time 
charges and capital expenditure of approximately $2m.
Fabless semiconductor companies typically focus on two 
areas – circuit conceptualisation and design, and application-
specific sales and marketing. The majority of the other operational 
areas – including prototype production, failure analysis, reliability 
and qualification testing, and volume production – are often 
outsourced. While the largest integrated device manufacturers 
(so called Tier-1 IDMs) introduce a sufficient number of new 
products and have sufficient volumes to justify maintaining 
their own in-house failure analysis and “release to production” 
testing capabilities, most smaller IDMs (Tier-2 and Tier-3) and the 
majority of fabless semiconductor companies find it difficult to 
justify maintaining in-house capabilities and look to independent 
companies, such as EAG, to provide these services on an 
outsourced basis.
EAG has incurred significantly higher corporate costs than 
planned in a number of areas, including additional personnel 
and system costs to upgrade the finance, human resource and 
information technology departments, professional services fees 
related to being a public company, share-based compensation 
expense, as well as one-off costs relating to the decision to realign 
management responsibilities and terminate acquisition activity, 
pending the outcome of the strategic review.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S REVIEW 4        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Trading
For the full year, revenues increased by 145% to $69.2 million  
(2006: $28.3 million) reflecting the full year impact of acquisitions as 
well as moderate growth in underlying revenues. Geographically, 
revenues outside the US now account for 29% (2006: 4%) of total 
revenues, with significant growth in Asia.
Operating profit before special items increased by 170% to $16.1 
million (2006: $6.0 million), reflecting the full year impact  
of acquisitions, as offset by a number of one-time charges 
including $0.9 million in severance payments.
In the second half, revenues were 7% ahead of the first half, 
which primarily reflects the full year impact of acquisitions, offset 
by a moderate decline in underlying revenues. Nevertheless, 
gross margins were maintained in the second half as direct costs 
flexed with the change in revenues. However, there was a stepped 
increase in indirect costs and corporate overheads to support the 
future growth ambitions and to transition the business to a public 
company, so that operating profit before special items in the 
second half declined to $5.2 million (2007 H1: $10.9 million).
Net finance charges before special items increased to $8.1 
million (2006: $4.0 million), of which $1.2 million was incurred 
in the second half (2007 H1: $6.9 million) reflecting the geared 
financing structure  
before the IPO and the financing of the acquisition programme.
Consequently, profit before tax and special items increased to 
$8.0 million (2006: $1.9 million) reflecting revenue growth and the 
new financing structure at the IPO.
Certain special items amounting to a loss for the period of $107.5 
million (2006: $37.3 million loss) have been separately disclosed in 
order to present what the board considers to be a more balanced 
perspective of the underlying trading performance. These include 
management fees to related parties prior to the IPO, aborted 
acquisition expenses and legal costs, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, finance costs associated with the reorganisation 
and restructuring prior to the IPO, tax impact of special items and 
deferred taxation on restructuring at the IPO.
After special items, operating profit increased to $10.2 million  
(2006: $4.7 million) while the loss before tax was $100.8 million  
(2006: $35.4 million loss) reflecting the non-cash charges of debt 
instruments prior to the IPO.
Tax
Before the IPO, there was a minimal charge for taxation as the 
business was treated as a partnership for US tax purposes whose 
profits were distributed to its partners, who were responsible for 
income taxes on those profits.
EAG Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, EAG Finance 
(Ireland) Limited, are resident and taxable in Ireland. However,  
the charge for taxation reflects the risk that the Internal Revenue 
Code could require EAG Limited to be treated as if it is also a US 
resident corporation following the reorganisation at the time of 
the IPO, as the tax status has not yet been resolved.
The tax rate on profit before tax and special items was 61% in  
2007 (2006: 1%), reflecting this new corporate structure. Taxation  
within special items is represented by the tax effect of special items  
and deferred taxation resulting from the restructuring at the IPO.  
After special items, the total tax charge for the year was $3.5 million 
(2006: $0.0 million).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share before special items decreased by 15% to  
6.7 cents (2006: 7.9 cents). After special items and consequent on 
restructuring prior to the IPO, the loss per share was 222.1 cents 
(2006: 147.2 cents loss) principally reflecting non-cash charges  
of debt instruments.
The average number of shares in issue was 47.0 million in  
2007 (2006: 24.1 million) and 66.7 million shares were in issue at  
31 December 2007.
Dividends
A maiden interim dividend of 3 cents per share was paid, while 
dividends in kind of $0.2 million (2006: $0.4 million) were made 
prior to the IPO. No final dividend is proposed.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Intangible assets are required to be capitalised and amortised  
over their useful lives. Goodwill, being the difference between the 
fair value of purchase consideration and the fair value of net assets 
(including intangible assets), is required to be capitalised and not 
amortised. At the year end, the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets has been reviewed and their value was upheld.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations increased by 144% to $16.7 million 
(2006: $6.8 million), reflecting the strong cash generative nature of the 
underlying businesses. During the year there was capital expenditure 
of $5.4 million mainly for instruments and expenditure of $61.7 million 
on four acquisitions, which were financed by new loans and existing 
cash resources. There are further payments of $8.9 million payable to 
the vendors of acquired companies and businesses and other related 
payables, of which $7 .8 million is payable in 2008.
Expenditure of $6.1 million for a new building, which was under 
construction at the time of the acquisition of Micro Electronic Failure 
Analysis Services Inc, is included within expenditure on acquisitions. 
The original intention had been to lease the building but, since it was 
not ready at the date of acquisition, it was purchased outright with 
the intention of an eventual sale and leaseback. Any refinancing has 
been postponed, pending progress on the strategic review.
Treasury
EAG raised £125 million at the IPO. Since then, EAG obtained a  
$140 million multi-currency secured credit facility, comprising a  
$1 25 million term loan facility for acquisition purposes and a $1 5 million 
revolving credit facility for working capital and general corporate 
purposes. At the year end, the Group had net debt of $47 .1 million 
including $15.1 million of cash balances, together with $75.5 million of 
undrawn facilities. Subsequent to the year end, the facilities have been 
renegotiated, with the term loan facility reduced from $1 25 million to 
$60 million and the revolving credit facility unchanged at $15 million, 
which reflects termination of the acquisition strategy.
The rate of exchange between the US dollar and sterling averaged 
2.01 (2006: 1.84) during the year, while the rate of exchange was  
1.98 (2006: 1.96) at the year end.

EAG Limited (“EAG”) is a leading materials science testing services 
company incorporated in Jersey under the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991 and headquartered in Ireland. EAG acquired its business 
and operating subsidiaries from EAG Holdings LLC in June 2007 at 
the time that EAG became listed on the AIM market of the London 
Stock Exchange.  
EAG is a leading global provider of microanalytical surface 
analysis, microelectronic failure analysis and “release to production” 
testing services for integrated circuit (IC) development, EAG offers 
its customers highly sophisticated testing services broadly used in 
developing new processes or materials, transferring those processes 
to production, developing and qualifying new production 
tools, performing failure analysis, solving process problems in 
manufacturing, and providing third-party product validation. EAG’s 
surface analysis and materials characterization testing customers are 
primarily the research and development departments of companies 
developing products where properties of surfaces or thin layers 
are critical to product performance. The Group provides its testing 
services to a broad range of end-user market segments, including 
semiconductor capital equipment, electronic materials, specialty 
metals and alloys, semiconductor fabrication, photovoltaics, 
biomedical, pharmaceutical, and aerospace and defence.
EAG is also a leading global provider of microelectronic “release 
to production” and failure analysis (“RTP/FA”) testing services. 
EAG’s microelectronic failure analysis and “release to production” 
testing services are provided primarily to fabless semiconductor 
companies and small to medium-sized IC manufacturers. Services 
include automated test (ATE), failure analysis, circuit debug 
and edit, reliability and qualification testing (burn-in, stress, 
electro-static discharge and latch-up testing). These testing 
services are critical in bringing an integrated circuit design from 
conceptualisation to volume production..
b. Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The management of the business and the execution of the 
Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, 
which could have a material impact on the Company, as follows:
Dependence on senior management and highly trained 
scientists – The Group’s performance is dependent on the 
continued retention and performance of its senior management 
and its ability to attract and retain highly-trained scientists.
Cyclicality in certain customer market segments – Certain 
of the Group’s customer market segments have historically 
experienced cyclicality in revenue streams, particularly the 
semiconductor, semiconductor capital equipment and electronic 
materials segments. The Group typically provides its services to 
the research and development departments of its customers 
and downturns in the customers’ revenue streams may affect the 
expenditure of those departments.
Failure of information systems – The Group’s ability to maintain 
financial controls and provide a high-quality service to clients 
depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its 
management information systems, including its computer systems.
Equipment reliability – The Group’s revenues depend on the 
availability of its instrumentation to perform relevant tests.
Limited visibility of order flow – The Group does not have long 
term contracts with its customers, so there can be no certainty of 
future business at the same levels as they have been historically.
Taxation – The Internal Revenue Service may seek to apply the 
US inversion rules (at IRC s7874) to make EAG Limited subject to 
US taxation, which could result in additional tax in the US as well 
as existing tax in Ireland, in addition to increased compliance or 
defence costs. The charge for taxation reflects this risk.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 10        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are set and 
approved by the Board. It is the policy of the Committee to 
ensure that fees and remuneration packages offered respectively 
to Non-Executive and Executive Directors are competitive 
and commensurate with individual performance, experience 
and market conditions and appropriate for the responsibilities 
involved. No Director plays a part in the decision of his own fees  
or remuneration.
a. Directors’ Contracts and Letters 
of Appointment
Mr. David Lahar, the sole Executive Director, has a service contract 
with the Company which is terminable by either party upon 
service of not less than twelve months’ notice. Each Non-Executive 
Director has a letter of appointment as well as a services contract 
each of which is terminable by either party upon service of not 
less than one month’s notice.
On 3rd June 2007, each of the Non-Executive directors entered 
into a three year service contract with the Company. Their 
appointments were made subject to re-election at the 2008 
annual general meeting of the Company and thereafter subject 
to the retirement on rotation provisions set out in the articles of 
association of the Company. In the event that the Non Executive 
Director is removed from office at the request of the Company, the 
Non-Executive’s compensation will continue for 1 year or until the 
end of the appointment, whichever is less.
b. Executive Directors’  
Remuneration
The main elements of Mr. David Lahar’s remuneration package  
are as follows:
a basic salary of $275,000, which is reviewed annually; •	
options over 300,000 ordinary shares at an exercise price of  •	
265 pence per share;

Mr. Lahar is not entitled to a pension contribution but is entitled 
to payments by the Company of up to $1,800 per annum into a 
contributory retirement plan. Mr. Lahar is entitled to repayment of 
all reasonable travel and other expenses properly incurred in the

c. Share Scheme
The Company operates a discretionary Share Option and Enterprise 
Management Incentive Plan for all Directors and employees of the 
Group. The number of ordinary shares issued under the plan or 
subject to unexpired options granted under the plan cannot exceed 
10 percent of the Company’s issued share capital. 
The exercise of an option can be made conditional upon targets 
imposed by the Company, and if those targets are not satisfied 
or are not capable of being satisfied, the option automatically 
and immediately lapses. In addition, the Company can include 
a condition as to when an option will become exercisable. If the 
Option is granted free from any such targets or conditions then 25 
percent of the option is exercisable per year for the first four years. 
An option holder may exercise his option within six months of his 
employment ceasing with any member of the Company’s group 
due to death, ill health, injury or disability. Otherwise, an option 
holder has a period of 60 days after his employment ceases, unless 
the employee has been dismissed for cause in which case his 
option immediately lapses whether it is exercisable at that time or 
not. All Options become immediately exercisable in the event that 
there is a change of control of the Company.
On 26 June 2007 , the Company granted share options for a total 
of 2,567 ,000 shares to employees at an exercise price of 265 pence 
per share, of which 2,135,000 remain outstanding. All such options 
are exercisable over a four year period commencing twelve months 
from the date of grant, with 25 percent becoming exercisable on 
each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant.

REMUNERATION REPORT (continued) 12        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the group, for safeguarding the assets and for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the annual 
report and financial statements in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and have 
chosen to prepare the financial statements for the group and the 
company in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union. The group and 
parent company are required by law and IFRS as adopted by 
the EU to present fairly the financial position of the group and 
the parent company and the performance for that period; the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 provides in relation to such financial 
statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to 
financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them •	
consistently;
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and •	
prudent;
state whether they have been prepared in accordance with •	
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis •	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in Jersey governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        13
We have audited the group and parent company financial 
statements of EAG Limited (the “financial statements”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the consolidated income 
statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expenses, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash 
flow statement and the related notes 1 to 43, together with the 
parent company income statement, the parent company statement 
of recognised income and expenses, the parent company balance 
sheet, the parent company cash flow statement and the related 
notes 1 to 12. These financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
The group and parent company have not previously prepared 
statutory accounts. Accordingly, comparatives for the year ended 
31 December 2006 are unaudited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Article 110 of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board are set out in the Statement of 
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. We also report 
to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent 
with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper 
accounting records or if we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit.
We read the Directors’ Report for the above year and consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of 
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall 
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial 
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance •	
with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board, of the state of the group and parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2007 and of the group’s loss and parent 
company’s profit for the year then ended; and
the financial statements have been properly prepared in •	
accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
for the year ended 31 December 2007
1. General information
EAG Limited (“EAG”, “the Company”, or, together with its 
subsidiaries, “the Group”) is incorporated in Jersey and 
headquartered in Ireland. The address of the Company’s principal 
place of business is 26 Upper Pembroke Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.  
The address of the Company’s registered office is 47 Esplanade,  
St Helier, Jersey JE1 0BD.
The Group is a leading provider of micro analytical surface 
testing and materials characterisation services. The Group offers 
its customers highly sophisticated testing services broadly 
used in developing new processes or materials, transferring 
those processes to production, developing and qualifying new 
production tools, performing failure analysis, solving process 
problems in manufacturing, and providing third-party product 
validation. EAG’s customers are primarily the research and 
development departments of companies developing products 
where properties of surfaces or thin layers are critical to product 
performance. The Group provides its testing services to a broad 
range of end-user market segments, including the semiconductor 
capital equipment, specialty metals and materials, electronic 
materials, semiconductor fabrication, biomedical, pharmaceutical, 
aerospace, and defence.
On 26 June 2007, EAG completed its flotation on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange, in which it acquired all of 
the operating subsidiaries of EAG Holdings LLC (the “Predecessor 
Company”), a limited liability company, formed on 30 August 2005 
in the state of Delaware, United States of America, located at 810 
Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, California, United States, 94086.
On 26 June 2007, EAG (and its wholly-owned subsidiary EAG 
(Ireland) Finance Limited) acquired the operating subsidiaries of 
the Predecessor Company. As a result of this reverse acquisition, 
EAG became the legal parent of the Group, and the Predecessor 
Company became a legal subsidiary within the Group. See Note 7 
– Reorganisation for further information related to the basis for the 
financial information herein. 
These financial statements are presented in US Dollars because 
that is the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with policies in note 3.
2. Adoption of new and  
revised Standards
In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures which are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 , and the related 
amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. The 
impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been 
to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements 
regarding the Group’s financial instruments and management of 
capital (see note 25). Four Interpretations issued by the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for 
the current period. These are IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement 
Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies; IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2; IFRIC 9 Reassessment of 
Embedded Derivatives; and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and 
Impairment. The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to 
any changes in the Group’s accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
 IFRS 8 — Operating segments •	
 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 — Group and Treasury Share Transactions •	
 IFRIC 12 — Service Concession Arrangements •	
 IFRIC 13 — Customer Loyalty Programmes •	
 IFRIC 14 IAS 19 — the Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, •	
Minimum funding Requirements and their interactions
 IAS 23 (revised) — Borrowing Costs •	
 IFRS 3 (revised) — Business Combinations •	
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards 
and Interpretations in future periods will not have a material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The principal accounting policies adopted in both the current 
and prior period are set out below.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The financial 
statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis with 
acquisitions being accounted for at their fair value at the time 
of acquisition. Comparatives for the year ended 31 December 
2006 are neither audited nor reviewed, as EAG Limited has not 
previously prepared statutory accounts. The financial information 
for the year ended 31 December 2006 has been extracted from the 
supplementary admission document of EAG Limited dated  
25 June 2007. Statutory accounts for 2007 will be delivered to  
the Companies Registry in Jersey after the company’s Annual 
General Meeting. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired by the Predecessor 
Company during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of the acquisition or up to the effective date of  EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        19
disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
The Group owned 100% of the above subsidiaries at year-end.

Certain special items have been separately disclosed in order 
to present, in the board’s view, a more balanced perspective 
of the underlying trading performance. Management fees 
represent payments to related parties prior to the initial public 
offering. Aborted acquisition expenses and legal costs reflect the 
decision to terminate the acquisition programme pending a full 
strategic review of the business, as well as litigation expenses. 
Amortisation represents the non-cash charge for intangible assets 
of acquisitions. Finance expenses represent dividends in kind 
on redeemable preferred units and write-off of capitalised loan 
fees of EAG Holdings LLC, consequent on the refinancing prior 
to the initial public offering. Other finance costs represent the 
non-cash charge for the change in value of put options of EAG 
Holdings LLC, which were classified as liabilities and offset by a 
capital contribution to retained earnings in advance of the initial 
public offering. The tax credit represents the impact of taxation on 
special items and deferred taxation on restructuring at the initial 
public offering.
Aborted acquisition costs and  
other acquisition related expenses:
As of year end, the Group suspended further acquisitions and 
expensed the costs associated with acquisitions that were in 
process at that time. In addition, the Group has filed a claim with 
respect to funds held in escrow related to alleged breaches  
of representations and warranties in regard to the  
Accurel acquisition.  
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses is accounted 
for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of 
exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
Details of the Group’s principal subsidiaries at 31 December 2007 are as follows: 20        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, are recognised at their fair 
value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset 
and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest 
in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly 
controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially 
recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. The Group tests goodwill 
annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications 
that goodwill might be impaired. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash generating units 
(“CGUs”) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an  
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from analytical services is recognised at the time the 
service is completed and the final report is delivered to the 
customer. Revenue from product sales is recognised upon 
shipment. Revenue is reported net of discounts, any VAT and other 
sales related taxes and intra-group transactions. Finance income 
is recognised in the period in which it arises. Liabilities for future 
services acquired during business combinations are recognised 
at the estimated fair value of the services to be performed at the 
date of acquisition and recorded as a liability. 
Non-cash exchange of future services 
The Group will occasionally engage in non-cash exchanges of 
instruments for future services. The value of the instrument and 
future services are recorded at the estimated fair value at the date 
of the transaction. The instrument is included in property, plant 
and equipment, and depreciated over its estimated future life. 
Revenue associated with the liability for future services is released 
into revenue when the service has been completed.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the 
Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of 
the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in 
the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments 
are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on  
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged  
directly against income. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group company, where 
applicable, are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For 
the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results 
and financial position of each group company are expressed 
in United States dollars, which is the functional currency of the 
Predecessor Company, and the presentation currency of EAG for 
the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual 
companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are de-nominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items 
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value 
was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the 
period in which they arise except for:
 exchange differences which relate to assets under construction •	
for future productive use, which are included in the cost of 
those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to 
interest costs on foreign currency borrowings;
 exchange differences on transactions entered into  •	
to hedge certain foreign currency risks; and
 exchange differences on monetary items receivable from •	
or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is 
nether planned nor likely to occur, which form part of the net 
investment in a foreign operation, and which are recognised  
in the foreign currency translation reserve and recognised in 
profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary 
items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period 
except for differences arising on the translation of non-monetary 
items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in 
equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of 
that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on  
the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the 
average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the 
date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
classified as equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Taxation
Taxation comprises both current tax and deferred tax. Taxation is 
recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        21
Corporation tax
The corporation tax charge is based upon the profits for the year.
EAG Limited is tax resident in Ireland and is subject to Irish 
tax laws. The Group has operating subsidiaries in China, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United 
States. Each subsidiary is subject to the tax laws of the jurisdictions 
in which they operate. There is also an operating subsidiary 
in Taiwan, which is incorporated in the United States, which is 
subject to the tax laws of both the United States and Taiwan. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method on all 
temporary differences, except those arising on initial recognition 
of goodwill or where the temporary difference arose on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which was not a 
business combination and which at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting profit or taxable profit. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax 
rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected  
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be 
realised. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed annually.
Property, plant and equipment
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or 
administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised 
impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying 
assets, borrowing costs capitalized in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets on the same basis 
as other property assets commences when assets are ready for 
their intended use. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over 
their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the 
following bases:
Estimated Useful Life:
Buildings 50 years
Building and leasehold improvements 3 to 50 years
Instruments and laboratory equipment 5 to 25 years
Office furniture and equipment 5 to 7 years
Computers 5 years
Vehicles 5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets. Leasehold 
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated 
useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Gains and losses on disposals of tangible assets are determined 
as the difference between net proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset and are recognised in income in the period in which 
the asset is disposed.
Construction in process
Construction in process is a temporary account used to 
accumulate the costs of bringing an asset to the location and 
condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in its 
intended manner prior to placing it into service. These costs 
include the purchase price of the asset, moving costs, installation, 
assembly, testing and other direct costs required to ensure the 
asset is operating properly. Once the asset is operating according 
to its intended use, these costs are reclassified to an appropriate 
category within property, plant and equipment. The asset is then 
depreciated over its useful life.
During the current period construction in process includes a 
building and freehold land acquired with an acquisition (please 
see note 37). The building was completed in January 2008 and 
placed in service.
Intangible assets
Amortisation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation 
of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using the 
straight-line method, on the following bases:
Estimated Useful Life:
Technology 4 to 15 years
Customer base 10 years
Software 5 to 10 years
Non-compete agreements 5 years
Goodwill and trademarks have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortisation. 22        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating-
unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with 
an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to 
be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised 
as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories consist of physical inventories and services in process.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Costs comprise of direct materials, and where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Cost is calculated using the specific identification method. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated cost of completion and cost to be incurred in 
marketing, selling and distribution. 
Services in process consist of labour and other costs associated 
with unbilled services at the end of the reporting period. These 
costs are stated at direct cost, including an appropriate portion of 
fixed and variable overhead expenses.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there is an indication that the 
assets are not recoverable. The allowance recognised is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the 
effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand 
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according 
to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An 
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and notes are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit 
or loss using the effective interest rate method and are netted 
against the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that 
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective 
interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are 
measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Share-based compensation
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based 
Payment. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments 
to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the  
vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of shares  
that will eventually vest. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. 
The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.  EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        23
4. Critical accounting  
judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are 
described in note 3, management is required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty in applying the group’s 
accounting policies
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation at the balance sheet date that are expected to have 
the greatest risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are 
discussed below.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of  
property, plant and equipment at the end of each  
annual reporting period.
Intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, management reviews the 
business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible 
assets should be recognised separately from goodwill. If such an 
asset is identified, then its fair value is determined by discounting 
the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by 
the asset, over the estimated life of the asset. Where there is 
uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful 
life this is factored into the calculation.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a 
minimum on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the 
value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill 
is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to 
make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash 
generating unit that holds the goodwill at a determined discount 
rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
For the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is allocated 
to CGUs and tested by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU 
with the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
The value in use calculations utilises an estimate of the future cash 
flows expected to arise from the CGU and an appropriate discount 
rate in order to calculate present value.
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for 
doubtful accounts. This provision is based primarily on a review of 
all outstanding accounts and considers the past payment history 
and creditworthiness of each account and the length of time that 
the debt has remained unpaid (see note 20).

7 . Reorganisation
On 26 June 2007, a reverse acquisition took place by which the 
group headed by the Predecessor Company was transferred 
to EAG (and its wholly-owned subsidiary EAG Finance (Ireland) 
Limited). As a result of this reverse acquisition, EAG became the 
legal parent of the Group, and the Predecessor Company became 
a legal subsidiary. The financial statements of EAG represent 
a continuation of the financial statements of the Predecessor 
Company and its former subsidiaries. The assets and liabilities of 
the Predecessor Company and its former subsidiaries are 
recognised and measured in the consolidated financial statements 
at their pre-combination carrying amounts. 
The retained earnings and other equity balances recognised in 
the consolidated financial statements are the retained earnings 
and other equity balances of the Predecessor Company and its 
former subsidiaries immediately before the reverse acquisition.

1 1. Finance costs 
On 2 September 2005 the Predecessor Company issued Preferred 
Units which carried the right to payment-in-kind dividends and 
with warrants attached giving the holder the right to acquire 
Common Units of the Predecessor Company for $0.01 per 
Common Unit.
Certain of the Preferred Units also carried mandatory 
redemption rights that allowed the holder to require the 
Predecessor Company to purchase the Preferred Unit at $1.00 
per Preferred Unit (the “Redemption Units”). The warrants also all 
carried mandatory put options that allowed the warrant holders  
to require the Predecessor Company to purchase the Common 
Units acquired under the warrants at the fair market value of a 
Common Unit at the time of exercising the put (the “Warrants”). 
The Redemption Units and Warrants were exercisable by their 
holders at the earlier of September 2011 or on the sale of the 
Predecessor Company. 
The Redemption Units and their associated payment-in-kind 
dividends were classified as liabilities and the value of payment-
in-kind dividends distributed to holders of Redemption Units 
was charged to other finance costs at $1.00 per Redemption Unit. 
In the six months ended 30 June 2007, EAG recorded a finance 
charge in respect of the Redemption units of $2,706,000 (year 
ended 31 December 2006: $4,614,000; six months ended 30 June  
2006: $1,963,000).
The Warrants were classified as liabilities valued at the fair 
market value of a Common Units with the result that substantially 
all of the economic value of the Predecessor Company was shown 
as a liability to its equity holders in its balance sheet. Increases 
in the fair value of the liability in respect of the Warrants, which 
varied with the fair value of the Predecessor Company, were 
recorded as finance costs. In the six months ended 30 June 2007, 
EAG recorded a finance charge in respect of the Warrants of 
$100,246,000 (year ended 31 December 2006: $35,433,000; six 
months ended 30 June 2006: $nil).
On 25 June 2007, the Predecessor Company, holders of 
the Redemption Units and holders of the War-rants signed a 
Rescission Agreement in which the Limited Liability Company 
Agreement of the Predecessor Company and the terms of 
the warrants were amended to rescind the redemption rights 
attached to the Redemption Units and to rescind the put options 
associated with the Warrants with immediate effect.
As a result of this Rescission Agreement, the fair market values 
of the Redemption Units and Warrants as at 25 June 2007 were 
transferred from liabilities to retained earnings as a capital 
contribution, offsetting the losses previously recorded as a  
result of the finance charges incurred. As a result of the rescission, 
there will be no future finance charges relating to Redemption 
Units or Warrants.

12. Management fees
13. Tax 
Until 26 June 2007 , management fees were payable to related 
parties, specifically American Capital Strategies, Ltd. (“ACAS”) and 
Auriga Partners Inc. (“Auriga”), pursuant to agreements reached 
in connection with investments in the Predecessor Company by 
ACAS and Auriga. Until the reorganisation and IPO on 26 June 2007 , 
ACAS received an annual management fee of $300,000 payable 
in quarterly installments of $75,000. The ACAS management 
agreement was terminated effective 26 June 2007 following the 
IPO and reorganisation. Auriga, which is a California corporation 
jointly owned and operated by David Lahar (currently the Chief 
Executive Officer) and Jim Cowart (currently a board member) 
received an annual management fee in the amount of $154,000 
annually, payable in quarterly installments of $38,500 each 
calendar quarter. Following the IPO and reorganisation, the Auriga 
management agreement was terminated effective 26 June 2007. 
Total management fees paid in the six months ended 30 June 2007 
were $222,000 (2006: $227 ,000), and $455,000 in management fees 
were paid for the year ending 31 December 2006.
EAG Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, EAG Finance (Ireland) Limited, are resident and taxable in Ireland. However, the charge 
for taxation reflects the risk that the Internal Revenue Code could require EAG Limited to be treated as if it is a US resident corporation 
following the reorganisation at the time of the initial public offering, as the tax status has not yet been resolved.

The Group’s equity share capital comprises Ordinary Shares of  
EAG Limited. Prior to the AIM IPO on 26 June 2007, the Predecessor 
Company’s equity capital comprised both Common Units and 
Preferred Units with associated warrants convertible into Common 
Units that, for purposes of this presentation, are treated as 
common unit equivalents.
As a result of the reverse acquisition, the capital structure at 31 
December 2007 is that of EAG Limited whereas at 31 December 
2006, the balance sheet reflects the capital structure of EAG 
Holdings LLC. In accordance with IAS 33, loss per share has been 
presented on the basis of EAG Limited’s capital structure.
During the reverse acquisition, prior to the IPO the  
various equity instruments in EAG Holdings LLC were exchanged 
for ordinary shares in EAG Limited (see note 11).
As a result of the loss for the period ended 31 December 2007 
potentially dilutive instruments have been excluded from the 
calculation of diluted loss per unit as their effect would  
be antidilutive.  EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        31

As at 31 December 2007 76,049
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more 
frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Deferred tax adjustments consist of the deferred taxes 
recognised at the time of the IPO with respect to the 2006 
acquisitions. This arises from differences in book and tax basis for 
intangibles, fixed assets and certain accruals.
Other adjustments to opening balance sheets include: fair 
value adjustments to instruments arising from alterations to 
the provisional valuations made to certain assets acquired in 
2006, adjustments to consideration for working capital acquired 
reflecting additional consideration paid to former equity holders 
in relation to purchases made in 2006 and other miscellaneous 
adjustments.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) 
are determined from the discounted free cash flow forecast 
valuation and management’s review of the recoverable amount.  
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates 
cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from 
other assets or group of assets. The Group considers that it only  
has one CGU.        
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most 
recent budget and four year forecast and extrapolates future 
cash flows using a terminal growth rate of 2.85%. Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect 
management’s assessment of the risks of the CGU. The rate used 
to discount the forecast cash flows was 8.65%.
The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying value at year-end. 
Therefore, goodwill was not impaired at the balance sheet date. 32        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007

Trade receivables
Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 
31 December 2007 amount to $14.9 million (2006: $8.5 million), 
comprising the amount presented above.
The average credit period taken on sales of the Group’s  
services is 58 days (2006: 49 days). No interest is charged on  
trade receivables. 
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts from the sale of services of $998,000 (2006: $299,000). 
This allowance has been determined by reviewing the age and 
potential collectibility of certain receivables at the balance sheet 
date with reference to past default experience.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors 
with a carrying amount of $4.6 million (2006: $1.3 million) which 
are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not 
provided as there has not been a significant change in credit 
quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.  
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.  
The average age of these receivables is 82 days (2006: 62 days).
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and 
cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are 
net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for 
impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the 
recoverability of the cash flows.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for 
trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short 
term duration. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect 
to trade receivables as no single customer has greater than 5% of 
total accounts receivable at year end.
Aging of past due but not impaired receivables:
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group 
considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. 
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer 
base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, management 
believes that there is no further credit provision required in excess 
of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or 
less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
The loan guarantee was cash restricted for a loan from a former owner of a subsidiary acquired in 2006. The loan was repaid and on 24 
April 2007 the restrictions were lifted. The Group’s restricted cash also provides a rental guarantee for the lease costs of a subsidiary’s 
facility for an indefinite period.
Trade payables principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for 
trade purchases as at 31 December 2007 is 23 days (2006: 26 days). 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

Facilities “A” and “B” of $60,197,000 were arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group 
manages this exposure by monitoring interest rates to determine if changes in its capital structure are appropriate. 
The directors estimate the fair value of the Group’s borrowings as follows:
25. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising their 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 24, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 30 – 36.
Gearing ratio
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, financing arrangements and other equity related liabilities. Equity includes all capital 
and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and 
the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, final liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.

Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies which exposes the Group to exchange  
rate fluctuations. To mitigate this risk the Group maintains  
bank accounts denominated in the most common foreign 
currencies traded in to include Euro and Pound Sterling. The 
carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated 
monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date  
are of nominal amounts.
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group 
borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk 
is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix 
between fixed and floating rate borrowings. 
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and 
financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management 
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on 
the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at 
the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is 
prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance 
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 0.5% increase 
or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally 
to key management personnel and represents management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If the interest rates had been 0.5% higher/lower and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 
31 December 2007 would decrease/increase by $323,000 (2006: 
decrease/increase by $446,000). This is mainly attributable to the 
Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
Credit risk management
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread 
across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts 
receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure 
to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having 
similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having 
similar characteristics if they are connected entities. Concentration 
of credit did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time 
during the year. 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial 
statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account 
of the value of any collateral obtained.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by 
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and 
matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
Included in note 24 is a description of additional un-drawn 
facilities that the Group has its disposal to further reduce liquidity 
risk. Please also see note 44 for subsequent changes to the credit 
facilities agreement.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual 
maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been 
drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities 
based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. 
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

The Group has access to financing facilities, the total unused 
amount of which is $75.5 million at the balance sheet date. The 
Group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash 
flows and proceeds of maturing financial assets. 
The Group has financial covenants on these facilities for 
leverage, interest cover and cash cover (please see note 44).
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial 
liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements 
approximate their fair values.
26. Convertible loan notes
Two convertible loan notes were issued on 29 December 2006 
in conjunction with the acquisition of Shiva Technologies, Inc. 
The notes carried an interest rate of 6% per annum payable 
semi-annually and could be converted into Common Units of the 
Company at the option of the Holder at any time on or after the 
occurrence of a Liquidity Event which was defined as:
 a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company; •	
 the liquidation or dissolution of the Company; •	
 a sale of 50% or more of the equity interests in the Company; or •	
 an IPO of equity interests in the Company. •	
In accordance with the above terms, the notes were converted 
into an equity interest in the Company on 26 June 2007 as part of 
the IPO.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible 
loan notes were split between the liability element and an equity 
component, representing the fair value of the embedded option 
to convert the liability into equity of the Group, as follows:

The interest charged for the period is calculated by applying an 
interest rate of 6% to the nominal value of the convertible loan 
notes issued plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The directors estimated the fair value of the liability component 
of the convertible loan notes at 31 December 2006 to be 
approximately $3,534,000. This fair value was calculated by 
discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of  
$10 million available for offset against future profits. These relate to 
Group operations within the United States and a deferred tax asset 
has been recognised in respect of all of these losses.  
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary 
differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 
$7.98 million (2006: $nil). No liability has been recognised in 
respect of these differences because the Group is in a position 
to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences 
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset of $5.1 million in respect of  
future tax amortisation available over a 15 year period  
has not been recognised in the financial statements.

For the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group does not 
have any obligations under finance lease. For the year ended 31 
December 2006, the average lease term of all obligations under 
capital lease was 30 months and the average effective borrowing 
rate was 5.54%. Interest rates were fixed at the contract date. All 
leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have 
been entered into for contingent rental payments. All leases were 
acquired as parts of business combinations that were entered into 
during the year ended 31 December 2006. 
The lease obligations are denominated in sterling and euros.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates 
their carrying amount.
The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the 
lessors’ rights over the leased assets.
29. Other financial liabilities
The Group financed property and casualty insurance liabilities 
under a short-term financing agreement in 2006. The balance 
outstanding under this agreement was $nil as of 31 December 
2007 (2006: $215,000). The short-term agreement financed 
$352,000 and was repayable in eight equal monthly payments in 
the amount of $44,000 including scheduled principal payments 
and interest based on an effective interest rate of 6.25%. The 
insurance coverage is for the period of 2 September 2006 through 
2 September 2007. Payments began on 2 November 2006 and 
were completed on 2 June 2007.

32. Equity reserve – Predecessor Company
EAG was incorporated on 22 March 2007 and registered in Jersey 
(registered number 96298) as a private company limited by shares 
under the name EAG Limited. On 21 May 2007, EAG was re-
registered in Jersey as a public company. 
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no 
right to fixed income.
On 2 June 2007 EAG issued 419,287 Ordinary Shares to an 
individual investor for an aggregate subscription of £1,000,000. 
On 20 June 2007, an agreement was entered into between and 
among EAG Finance (Ireland) Limited, ACAS and Team EAG 
whereby EAG Finance (Ireland) Limited acquired from ACAS and 
Team EAG their respective existing equity and preferred interests 
in the Predecessor Company. The acquisition was conditional 
on EAG’s admission to AIM. The consideration payable by EAG 
Finance (Ireland) Limited in this transaction was £51.0 million.
On 20 June 2007, a distribution agreement and a contribution 
agreement were entered into whereby the entire issued share 
capitals of each of Cascade Scientific Limited, Cascade Scientific 
GmbH, Nano Science KK, Shiva Technologies Europe SAS, and 
Accessright Consultants Limited were acquired by EAG indirectly 
from the Predecessor Company. The acquisition was conditional 
on EAG’s Admission to AIM. The consideration payable by EAG 
was satisfied through the issuance of 19,189,557 Ordinary Shares, 
credited as fully paid.
On 26 June 2007 , EAG completed its flotation on the AIM market 
of the London Stock Exchange. Admission to AIM was a condition 
precedent to EAG (and its wholly-owned subsidiary EAG Finance 
(Ireland) Limited) acquiring all of the former operating entities of  
 the Predecessor Company, as described above. As a result, all  
of the Predecessor Company’s equity interests (consisting of 
Common Units, Preferred Units, warrants and the convertible note 
– equity portion) are no longer outstanding. As of 30 June 2007 , the 
outstanding equity instruments of EAG Limited are Ordinary Shares 
and options on Ordinary Shares.
In the AIM flotation, EAG issued 47 ,132,198 Ordinary Shares at an 
issuance price of 265 pence. Of the shares issued, 30,000,000 were 
issued to fund EAG and were used primarily to repay indebtedness. 
The remaining 17 ,132,198 Ordinary Shares issued were to fund the 
acquisition of the equity interests of certain existing shareholders of 
the Predecessor Company, including all of the interests of ACAS.

37 . Acquisition of subsidiaries
Acquisition of Accurel Systems  
International Corp. 
On 1 May 2007 the Group acquired the operations and assets 
of Accurel Systems International Corporation (Accurel) for 
consideration of $12,697,000 from Implant Sciences Corporation 
(IMX) of Wakefield, MA. The enterprise value of Accurel was 
$14,602,000. Accurel is a leading provider of advanced failure 
analysis, microscopy and focused ion beam circuit edit services. 
This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase 
method of accounting.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Accurel is attributable 
to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s 
products in the new markets and the anticipated future operating 
synergies from the combination. The intangible assets acquired 
include customer base, non-compete agreements and trade 
name. Customer base and non-compete agreements were valued 
by an independent third party based upon revenue models using 
discounted future cash flows. Trade-name was valued under a 
relief of royalty methodology.
The operations of Accurel were fully integrated into an existing 
EAG site and services were performed utilising both Accurel and 
existing EAG instruments and personnel. Therefore, the Group is 
unable to ascertain the revenue and gross profit before tax for  
the period between the date of acquisition and the balance  
sheet date.
If the acquisition of Accurel had been completed on the first day 
of the financial year, Accurel would have contributed approximately 
an additional $2,985,000 to the Group revenues and approximately 
$1,134,000 to the Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation. 
 The fair value of net assets acquired is provisional with respect 
to the value of the fixed assets acquired and directly attributable 
costs pending resolution of seller representations and warranties. 
Amendments may be made to these figures in the subsequent 
accounting period with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. 
The Group has a holdback claim against the previous owners in 
respect to representations and warranties. 
EAG filed a civil action in California state court against the 
former President of Accurel Systems International Corporation 
alleging, among other things, fraud, breach of contract, unfair 
competition, misappropriation of confidential information and 
interference with contractual relations. EAG filed a separate but 
related civil action in California state court against Accurel Systems 
International Corporation and its parent corporation, Implant 
Sciences Corporation relating to their sale of Accurel’s assets to  
the Group. Discovery is currently underway in both actions.
The Group continues to evaluate the revenue-generating 
capacity of specific test equipment acquired through use in 
the post-acquisition period, and expects to have finalised these 
evaluations no later than June 2008.

Acquisition of MEFAS
On 9 November 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the share 
capital of Micro Electronic Failure Analysis Services, Inc. (MEFAS) 
for consideration of $28,782,000. The enterprise value of MEFAS 
was $34,429,000. MEFAS is a leading provider of microelectronics 
testing, qualification, and characterisation, including reliability 
qualification testing, electrostatic discharge and latch-up testing, 
focused ion beam circuit edit capabilities, and device and system 
level failure analysis. This acquisition has been accounted for using 
the purchase method of accounting.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of MEFAS is attributable 
to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s 
products in the new markets and the anticipated future operating 
synergies from the combination. The intangible assets acquired 
include customer base, non-compete agreements and trade  
name. Customer base and non-compete agreements were valued 
by an independent third party based upon revenue models using 
discounted future cash flows. Trade-name was valued under a 
relief of royalty methodology.
The acquisition of MEFAS occurred on 9 November 2007. As 
a result of the acquisition, Group revenues in 2007 were higher 
by approximately $1.1 million and earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2007 were higher by 
approximately $0.5 million. If the acquisition of MEFAS had been 
completed on the first day of the financial year, MEFAS would have 
contributed approximately an additional $7,194,000 to the Group 
revenues and approximately $1,887,000 to the Group earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. 
The fair value of net assets acquired is provisional due to the 
timing of the acquisition. Amendments may be made to these 
figures in the subsequent accounting period with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill. The Group continues to evaluate the 
revenue-generating capacity of specific test equipment acquired 
through use in the post-acquisition period, and expects to have 
finalised these evaluations no later than December 2008.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of DSL is attributable to the 
anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s products 
in the new markets and the anticipated future operating synergies 
from the combination. The intangible assets acquired include 
technology, customer base, non-compete agreements and trade 
name. Technology, customer base and non-compete agreements 
were valued by an independent third party based upon revenue 
models using discounted future cash flows. Trade-name was 
valued under a relief of royalty methodology.
The acquisition of DSL occurred on 26 November 2007 . As a result of 
the acquisition, Group revenues in 2007 were higher by approximately 
$1.1 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation in 2007 were higher by approximately $0.1 million. If 
the acquisition of DSL had been completed on the first day of the 
financial year, DSL would have contributed approximately an additional 
$10,349,000 to the Group revenues and approximately $nil to the Group 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. 
The fair value of net assets acquired is provisional due  
to the timing of the acquisition. Amendments may be made 
to these figures in the subsequent accounting period with a 
corresponding adjustment to good-will. The Group continues 
to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity of specific test 
equipment and in-tangibles assets acquired through use in  
the post-acquisition period, and expects to have finalised  
these evaluations no later than December 2008. 
Acquisition of DSL Labs
On 26 November 2007 the Group acquired 100% of the share 
capital of DSL Labs Inc. (DSL) for consideration of $14,107,000. The 
enterprise value of DSL was $22,718,000. DSL is a leading provider 
of microelectronics FA/RTP services, including automated testing, 
reliability and qualification testing, failure analysis and probe 
card design. DSL also provides complementary test engineering 
services, such as test program development, program conversion 
and optimisation, wafer sort and final test production. In addition, 
DSL is a major provider of reliability and qualification testing 
services, helping fabless semiconductor companies ensure proper 
integrated circuit design, package assembly and device integrity 
by performing electrical stress, thermal stress and mechanical 
stress tests to identify the occurrence of failures and their severity. 
This acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase 
method of accounting.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of WML is attributable 
to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the Group’s 
products in the new markets and the anticipated future operating 
synergies from the combination. The intangible assets acquired 
include software, customer base, non-compete agreements 
and trade name. Software, customer base and non-compete 
agreements were valued by an independent third party based 
upon revenue models using discounted future cash flows.  
Trade-name was valued under a relief of royalty methodology.
The acquisition of WML occurred on 7 December 2007. As a 
result of the acquisition, Group revenues in 2007 were higher 
by approximately $0.2 million and earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation in 2007 were higher by 
approximately approximately $0.1 million. If the acquisition of WML 
had been completed on the first day of the financial year, WML 
would have contributed approximately an additional $2,373,000  
to the Group revenues and approximately $326,000 to the Group 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. 
The fair value of net assets acquired is provisional due to the 
timing of the acquisition. Amendments may be made to these 
figures in the subsequent accounting period with a corresponding 
adjustment to goodwill. The Group continues to evaluate the 
revenue-generating capacity of specific test equipment acquired 
through use in the post-acquisition period, and expects to have 
finalised these evaluations no later than December 2008. 52        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007

Supplemental non-cash disclosures
During 2006 a large customer of the Group decided to close the 
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (“XPS”) section of their internal 
lab and outsource their analysis work. The Group entered into 
a contract with this customer to perform a total of $551,000 of 
future services for this customer at our list price in exchange for 
ownership of the customer’s XPS instrument. The Group recorded 
this transaction as deferred revenue of $551,000 for future services 
and capitalised the instrument in the amount of $551,000. As the 
Group does not offer significant discounts, this approximates the 
fair value of the services to be provided.
39. Contingent liabilities
The Predecessor Company acquired the assets of Shiva 
Technologies, Inc., a Syracuse NY based lab, on 29 December 2006 
from Shiva Technologies, Inc. and Krishna Chivukula (‘‘Sellers’’). 
In the course of installing the Predecessor Company’s laboratory 
management and accounting software, it was discovered that 
during the period from November 2004 to February 2007, a 
number of jobs analysing copper had been performed for a 
mining company partially owned by the Government of Myanmar. 
Myanmar is subject to certain trade restrictions under various 
US laws, and it is possible that performing the jobs violated such 
restrictions. The substantial majority of this work was performed 
by Shiva prior to the Predecessor Company’s acquisition of its 
assets. Under the purchase agreement (a) the Predecessor  
Company did not assume liabilities relating to the period prior  
to the Predecessor Company’s acquisition of the assets and (b)  
the Sellers have subsequently indemnified the Predecessor 
Company against any losses it might incur for such unassumed 
liabilities. The Predecessor Company and the Sellers have signed 
a letter in which they agree, among other things, that the 
substantial majority of costs and liabilities associated with this 
matter are accordingly the responsibility of the Sellers. The Sellers 
and the Predecessor Company have jointly instructed counsel 
to advise on this matter and have made a joint disclosure of the 
facts to the relevant authorities. While the process may take many 
months to finally resolve with the relevant government agencies, 
the Directors are confident that the final outcome will not be 
material to the financial position of the Group. EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007        53
40. Commitments
a)  Operating lease commitments 
The Group as lessee
At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable 
operating leases, which fall due as follows:
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the 
Group for certain of its office properties and rentals related to 
office equipment. Lease terms for office properties range from 
three to ten years and average 59 months. Lease terms for office 
equipment rentals range from three to five years and average 49 
months. The Group provides for flexibility in negotiating lease 
terms to respond to local office rental market conditions.
b)  Capital commitments 
At year end the Company had capital commitments to complete 
the building acquired with MEFAS. Estimated completion costs 
were $297,000.
41. Share based payments
The Company has a share option scheme (the “Plan”) open to 
employees and third parties. Under the Plan, 2,567,500 share 
options were granted on 26 June 2007 at an option price of £2.65. 
No equity instruments other than these share options were issued 
in exchange for the fair value of goods or services received. There 
were no modifications to share-based payment arrangements 
during the periods presented.
In accordance with IFRS 2: Share based payments, the fair 
value of services received in return for share options granted to 
employees and a consultant performing services similar to those 
performed by employees, is measured based on the Black-Scholes 
formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of share-
based payments. 
During the twelve months ended 31 December 2007, the  
Group recognised an expense of $755,000 in respect of share 
options granted. As these were the first share options granted  
by EAG Limited, there was no charge for share-based payments  
in prior periods. 
The general terms and conditions of the share options granted are 
that they have a five year term from date of grant, vest rateably at a 
rate of 25% per year over four years, are not subject to performance 
conditions, and are to be settled in equity. One award, granted to 
one employee only, vested 50% upon grant with 25% vesting at the 
end of years three and four of the service period. Other terms and 
conditions of this grant are identical to all other grants. The share 
options were granted at an option price of £2.65, which was the fair 
value of EAG Ordinary Shares on the date of the grant.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are  
as follows.

2007 Number and weighted average exercise prices of share options 54        EAG Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The fair value of the share options granted was determined by 
reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted,  
using the following input assumptions in the Black Scholes  
option pricing model:
 All options outstanding have an exercise price of  •	
£2.65 per option
 Management expects Ordinary Share dividend yield of  •	
1.5% per year
 The employees and consultant who received the share  •	
options are relatively homogeneous for purposes of  
valuing their share options
 Cancellations due to termination of employment is  •	
estimated to be 5% per year
 The expected life of the shares vesting at each vesting  •	
date is as follows:
 Vested at grant – 2.5 year life
 Vesting at the end of the first year – 3 year life
 Vesting at the end of the second year – 3.5 year life
 Vesting at the end of the third year – 4 year life
 Vesting at the end of the fourth year – 4.5 year life
 Volatility is determined by averaging the historical annual  •	
share price volatility for four public companies considered 
 to be reasonable peers of the Group and for the FTSE AIM  
100 index of the top 100 companies traded on the AIM  
market of the London Stock Exchange, resulting in a  
volatility assumption of 26%
 The risk free interest rate is determined to be 5.8% based on •	
the yield on a UK government treasury bond with a maturity 
matching the expected life of the share options granted.
 The fair value calculations in pounds sterling were translated to •	
dollars based on the spot ex-change rate at the grant date of 
1.9997 US dollars to the pound sterling.
Based on these assumptions the fair value per share option is 
determined to be:
The fair value of the share options granted is being recognised 
over the vesting periods in which the option holders are 
performing services for the Group. Using the assumptions 
described above, the Group determined the fair value of the  
share options granted over the life of the options is $2,997,000.  
Of this amount, the total expense recognised for the year ended 
31 December 2007 arising from share-based payment transactions 
in which the goods or services received did not qualify for 
recognition as assets and hence were recognised immediately as 
an expense is $155,000. The fair value of the share options granted 
which has not yet been recognised as expense is $1,723,000 and 
will be recognised as services are rendered over the remaining 
vesting period, which expire on 25 June 2012.
42. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit 
plans for all qualifying employees in its subsidiaries in the US and 
worldwide. The assets of the plans, with the exception of Japan, 
are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the 
control of trustees. Where employees leave the plans prior to full 
vesting of the contributions, the contributions payable by the 
Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions. The 
pension plan adopted by a newly acquired subsidiary in Japan 
provides for payments to employees based upon their salary 
and length of service with the Company. A liability of $1,018,000 
was assumed at 29 December 2006 as part of the acquisition 
agreement, of which $818,000 was subsequently paid to  
two retiring former owners in January 2007.
The total expenses recognised in the income statement  
of $480,000 (2006: $185,000) represents contributions payable 
to these plans by the Group at rates specified by the rules of the 
plans. As of 31 December 2007, contributions of $19,000 and (2006: 
$3,000) had not been paid over to the plans. The amounts were 
paid subsequent to the balance sheet date.

Important Notes
The following notes explain your general rights as a shareholder and 
your right to attend and vote at this Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
(or to appoint someone else to vote on your behalf).
A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the EGM 1. 
is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on 
a poll, to vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a 
shareholder. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a shareholder 
from attending in person and voting at the EGM.
If you return more than one proxy appointment the 2. 
appointment which is received later by the Registrar (as long as 
it is received in any event before the latest time for the receipt of 
proxies) will take precedence.
The appointment of a proxy, and the original or duly certified 3. 
copy of the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under 
which it is signed or authenticated, should be deposited with 
the Company’s Registrar, at the address shown on the proxy 
form, not later than (a) 11.00 am on 22 May 2008, or 48 hours 
before the time for holding any adjourned Meeting or (in 
the case of a poll not taken on the same day as the EGM or 
adjourned Meeting) for the taking of the poll at which it is to be 
used, or (b) lodged using the CREST proxy voting service – see 
Note 7 below.
The following documents are available for inspection during 4. 
normal business hours at the registered office of the Company 
on any business day:
(a) copies of Directors’ service contracts with the Company;
(b)  copies of the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment;
(c)  the register of interests of the Directors in the share  
capital of the Company; and
(d)  a copy of the Company’s Memorandum and Articles  
of Association.
The Company, pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertified 5. 
Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those 
shareholders listed in the register of members of the Company 
as at 8.00 pm on 22 May 2008 (or, if the Meeting is adjourned, 
8.00 pm on the day two days prior to the day fixed for the 
adjourned Meeting) shall be entitled to attend or vote at the 
EGM in respect of the number of shares registered in their name 
at that time. In each case, changes to entries on the register of 
members after such time shall be disregarded in determining 
the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Meeting.
As soon as practicable following the EGM, a summary of the 6. 
business transacted will be available, on written request, from 
the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office and 
will be posted on the Company’s website.
Electronic proxy appointment 
through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 7. 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the AGM to be held on 27 May 2008 and any 
adjournment(s) thereof by following the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual.
All messages relating to the appointment of a proxy or an 
instruction to a previously appointed proxy, which are to be 
transmitted through CREST, must be received by Capita IRG 
Registrars (ID – RA10) no later than 8.00 pm on 24 May 2008, or, if 
the Meeting is adjourned, close of business on the day three days 
prior to the day fixed for the adjourned Meeting. Contents

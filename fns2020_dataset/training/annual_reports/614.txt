OUR  COMPANY
Chairman’s Letter
DEAR SHAREHOLDER
INTRODUCTION
I am privileged to introduce this ﬁrst Annual 
Report of Alent plc as an independent 
company, following the demerger of 
Cookson Group plc in December 2012. In 
May 2012, the Cookson Board undertook 
a strategic review which concluded that 
a demerger was the best option for 
maximising the value of the Cookson Group 
and creating value for its shareholders. The 
demerger was completed in December 2012 
and Alent is now listed on the London Stock 
Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 
250 in the Specialty Chemicals sector. 
As a stand-alone global specialty chemicals 
and materials Company , we now have the 
opportunity to demonstrate and to build on 
our position as the preferred supplier of high 
performance materials and chemistry across 
the electronics, industrial and automotive 
markets.
We set out in this report how we will execute 
and further develop our strategy. We focus 
on our existing specialist high growth 
end-markets while also developing new 
ones, bringing to market new high-margin 
products while continuing to enhance our 
operational efﬁciencies and expanding our 
OEM sales, while developing our technology 
and innovation leadership. We believe that 
this strategy will result in our continuing to 
deliver value for our shareholders.
RESULTS
Alent improved its business fundamentals 
and doubled its adjusted operating proﬁt 
from 2008 to 2011. Despite a difﬁcult macro-
economic environment in 2012, that growth 
continued during the year with adjusted 
operating proﬁt increasing 3% to £97.2m 
(2011: £94.4m) and adjusted Earnings Per 
Share (EPS) increasing 2.1% to 24.6p (2011: 
24.1p). Adjusted cash generated from 
operations was £86.0m (2011: £93.0m) and 
represented a cash conversion of 88% of 
adjusted operating proﬁt.
DIVIDEND
As stated in the Alent Prospectus, the Board 
is recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 5.5 
pence per share, subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM on 21 May 2013. 
Alent is a cash generative business 
with the opportunity for investments 
to enhance its growth prospects, both 
through organic investments including new 
product development, and through bolt-on 
acquisitions. The Board intends to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy that reﬂects this 
strategy, with dividend growth expected to 
be at least in line with underlying earnings 
growth, targeting a dividend cover in the 
near term within a range of 3.0 to 2.8 times.
HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT & 
SUSTAINABILITY (HSES)
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Alent’s HSES policy and for monitoring its 
implementation. While our activities in this 
important area continue to be of a high 
standard and there were no major incidents 
during the year, as a new Company I look 
forward to increased focus on this area. 
BOARD
Alent begins its new corporate life with 
what I believe to be a very strong and 
experienced Board, bringing together new 
appointees as well as Directors with historical 
knowledge of Alent and its industries. Our 
management team in particular has many 
years of experience in our business and in 
our markets. I believe the Board has the 
right depth and mix of skills, experience, 
knowledge and independence to maximise 
the opportunities for Alent and its 
shareholders. The biographies of our Board 
are set out on pages 44 to 45.
GOVERNANCE
The Board is committed to the principles of 
best practice in corporate governance. We 
act in accordance with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council, and 
the Companies Act. Ultimate responsibility 
for the management of the Company rests 
with the Board of Directors. The Board 
focuses primarily upon strategic, policy and 
governance issues, acting in accordance 
with the best interests of shareholders as a 
whole. It also approves the Group strategy, 
oversees the allocation of resources and 
monitors the Group’s performance. 
DIVERSITY
The Board recognises the beneﬁts to the 
Company of diversity, both within our 
operations and at Board level. We support 
the Davies Review ‘Women on Boards’ as 
well as the Financial Reporting Council’ s 
statement on proposed changes to the 
Code relating to gender diversity on Boards. 
OUR PEOPLE
Finally , on behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of our people for the invaluable 
contribution they make to our continuing 
success. Alent’ s growth and development 
over recent years is as a direct result of 
their persistent hard work, dedication and 
achievement of results, and I believe we all 
look forward with enthusiasm and conﬁdence.

What We Do continued
We add value to our customers’ businesses by 
providing products, processes and services which 
allow them to increase the efficiency and quality of 
their operations and products.
ASSEMBLY MATERIALS
Our Assembly Materials business is a global 
leader in the development, manufacturing 
and sales of innovative materials used in 
electronic assembly processes. With a 
unique worldwide presence in 50 locations 
throughout the Americas, Europe and the 
Asia/Paciﬁc region, Assembly Materials 
supplies a full line of solder paste, stencils, 
bar solder, wire solder, and wave soldering 
ﬂuxes. We also manufacture enabling 
technology products for the power 
electronics, LED/opto-electronics and 
photovoltaic industries.
Assembly Materials has been committed 
to developing and manufacturing the 
highest quality soldering materials. That 
tradition continues today through our 
innovative products, including our line 
of environmentally friendly, lead-free 
electronic assembly products. 
PRODUCTS
Assembly Materials is one of the 
leading global suppliers of materials to 
assemblers of printed circuit boards and 
the semiconductor packaging industry. 
These products (of which solder represents 
nearly 80% of revenue) are used primarily 
to attach electronic components, such 
as semiconductors and capacitors, onto 
printed circuit boards and to form the 
necessary electrical and physical connection 
between the board and its components.
Assembly Materials’ products enhance 
the connectivity and are essential to the 
longevity, reliability and functionality 
of the ultimate electronic device (i.e. a 
broken solder joint can stop the electronic 
device from functioning). As importantly, 
Assembly Materials’ products are also 
critical to the cost and efﬁciency of the 
process by which the electronic devices are 
manufactured. These are typically highly 
automated and use mass manufacturing 
techniques so productivity and reducing 
reject rates and wastage are very cost 
sensitive issues for customers. The 
technical speciﬁcation of the product 
combined with the consistency and 
reliability of supply are therefore vitally 
important to customers.
Printed circuit board assembly
In printed circuit board assembly, the 
principal product lines include solder, 
ﬂuxes, adhesives, cleaning chemistries 
and stencils. Solder can be supplied to 
customers in either bar form (i.e. solid, 
and sold as an ingot, which is used 
predominantly in the more mature wave 
soldering technology for assembling 
printed circuit boards); wire form (used 
for touch-up and repair work); paste 
form (used in the more modern and 
technologically advanced surface mount 
technology for assembling printed circuit 
boards); powder form; sphere form; or 
as preforms. Solder paste can also be 
supplied in leaded and lead-free options.
Semiconductor packaging
The Assembly Materials’ product line also 
supplies the semiconductor packaging 
industry with solder products, including 
solder spheres which are used to connect 
the package to the printed circuit board and 
to provide electrical and thermal insulation.
Non-electronics market
Assembly Materials also manufactures 
and markets a respected range of leading 
products and services globally to the 
plumbing, automotive and water treatment 
industries. Our current product portfolio 
covers traditional chemical water treatment 
and heat transfer ﬂuids for renewable 
technologies, solders and ﬂuxes, ﬁlters and 
equipment.

OUR  COMPANY OUR COMPANY www.alent.com

In order to better understand the products 
and services that Alent supplies to its 
customers, it is important to understand the 
nature of the company’s key end-markets.
ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY
The principal end-market for Alent is 
global electronics production, which 
accounts for approximately three-quarters 
of our revenue. We supply electronic 
component manufacturers and assemblers, 
who, in turn, supply the electronic 
equipment manufacturers and suppliers.
It is also important to understand where 
Alent sits within the broader electronics 
supply chain. Within the assembly service 
segment of the supply chain, there are 
broadly three groups of manufacturers of 
electronics equipment:
 Contract Equipment Manufacturers 
(“CEMs”) or Electronics 
Manufacturing Services (“EMSs”):
companies such as Jabil, Foxconn, 
Sanmina-SCI and Flextronics, who 
manufacture products for OEMs and for 
other companies which consider their 
core competence to be design, 
distribution and marketing of 
technology rather than manufacturing 
(such as HP , Dell and Cisco). Whilst the 
CEMs and EMSs can be the ultimate 
end-customers for our products, and 
the persons to whom the physical 
products are supplied, the relationship 
with the OEM is also typically very 
important, as the OEMs often instruct 
the CEM or EMS as to whose 
components and materials should be 
used in the manufacture of their 
electronic devices; 
 Original Design Manufacturers 
(“ODMs”): companies such as Compal 
Electronics who design, manufacture and 
service products for other organisations. 
Unlike EMSs, who usually manufacture 
from a near-ﬁnal design provided by their 
OEM customers, ODMs sell fully 
designed products for OEMs and then 
manufacture them. ODMs are a relative 
newcomer to the industry. They have their 
roots in designing and manufacturing 
low-end notebook PCs; and 
 Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(“OEMs”): companies such as IBM, 
Intel, Nokia and Samsung who design, 
manufacture and market their own 
products.
As shown in the diagram opposite, Alent 
operates within the electronics materials 
segment of the electronics value chain, 
where we provide highly engineered and 
intermediate materials to our customers. 
Engineered materials are formulated or 
processed materials which perform speciﬁc 
functions or have particular process 
characteristics, e.g. photo resist, die attach, 
conductive adhesive and thermal interface, 
while intermediate materials are reﬁned 
or processed raw materials which possess 
electronic grade purity or properties, e.g. 
metals, glass, ceramics and polymers.
According to Prismark Partners, the 
electronics materials segment was 
estimated to be a $146bn market in 2012 
and the overall market for electronic 
products was estimated at $1,650bn.
Our products broadly ﬁt within the 
fabrication materials, packaging materials, 
interconnect materials and assembly 
materials segments and Prismark estimates 
these sub-sectors to be worth $24bn, 
$13bn, $20bn and $6bn, respectively.
In the electronics market, there is a strong 
trend towards increased connectivity 
and portability in consumer electronics. 
Consumer demand is for faster, smaller 
and lighter products, which is leading to 
increasing miniaturisation and complexity 
and the use of multi-layer circuit boards. 
We are at the leading edge of this 
trend and are a leading player in the 
development and supply of specialty 
materials into these fast-growing niches.
According to Prismark forecasts in January 
2013, end-market sales of electronic goods 
is, on average, forecast to grow by 4.4% 
CAGR from 2011 to 2017 in value terms, 
along with signiﬁcant growth in the size 
of the key markets in which our products 
are used. However, it is the volume of 
electronic devices which is a key growth 
driver for Alent. The electronics industry 
has historically been a “price down” 
industry, with reduced prices for each 
generation of product, which means 
that forecasts of market growth by value 
tend to understate the market growth by 
volume, which is the key driver of demand 
for our products.
Where We Operate: 
Our Markets
Overall, Alent’s revenue by end-market is approximately 
three quarters electronics, with industrial and automotive 
making up the balance.  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
As in the electronics end-market, volume is 
a key driver of demand for Alent’s products 
in the industrial automotive segment. 
Automotive is a particularly OEM-driven 
segment where our OEM strategy 
positions us well. As shown in the chart 
above, vehicle volumes are expected to 
grow approximately 6% CAGR from 2012 
to 2015. In addition, there is a strong trend 
for increased electronic content in vehicles 
and increasing demand for functional and 
decorative coatings, which beneﬁts both 
of our divisions. This dynamic will enable 
Alent to beneﬁt from a twofold increase, 
both of a growing underlying market, as 
well as an increase in product penetration.
The need for improved corrosion-resistant 
and wear-resistant coatings, driven by 
the need to provide longer warranty 
protection to customers, increases 
demand for our products. The improved 
quality of automobiles and need to reduce 
their weight is also driving higher demand 
for increasingly sophisticated decorative 
ﬁnishes, which both enhance customer 
perception of the vehicle and enable lower 
weight materials (e.g. plastics) to be used 
in their production.
A premium class automobile typically 
now contains between 70 and 100 
microprocessor-based electronic control 
units (ECUs). According to Global Industry 
Analysts, in April 2012, electronics content 
as a percentage of the total vehicle cost 
is expected to rise signiﬁcantly as market 
penetration of hybrid and electric vehicles 
increases. We supply products used in the 
manufacturing and assembling of these 
electronic devices, which are increasingly 
being used to control a wide range of 
systems, including chassis and safety 
systems, lighting, powertrain, infotainment, 
interior electronics and electric vehicles.

CEO Statement
OVERVIEW 
I am very pleased to deliver my ﬁrst 
report as Chief Executive of Alent plc, 
newly created following the demerger of 
Cookson Group plc in December 2012. 
I believe strongly that the establishment 
of Alent as a stand-alone company will 
beneﬁt our shareholders, our customers 
and our people. The Alent Board and 
management are now singularly focused 
on the Alent business, and free to deploy 
its capital resources in the best interests 
of the newly formed Group. This is a cash 
generative business and we are now able, 
as a stand-alone Company, to deploy 
the cash generated to pay dividends, 
invest organically in capital development, 
complementary technologies and R&D, 
and to begin to consider value adding, 
bolt-on acquisitions. We look forward 
to demonstrating the strength of our 
business and the opportunities we have 
for proﬁtable growth. I’d like to take this 
opportunity to thank each and every one 
of Alent’s 2,600 people across the globe 
for a job well done in 2012 and for setting 
Alent on a strong foundation for further 
growth and proﬁtability improvement in 
2013 and beyond.
ALENT
Alent is a leading supplier of advanced, 
consumable specialty chemicals and 
engineered materials used primarily in 
the electronics, automotive and industrial 
end-market segments. We offer our 
customers customised products that in 
many cases are speciﬁcally designed to 
solve an individual customer’s production 
problem, or to enable a customer to build 
its next generation products at acceptable 
yields, throughput and reliability. Our 
ability to quickly develop solutions for our 
customer’s problem can often result in 
Alent being the customer’s preferred and 
trusted source of supply, differentiating 
us from our competitors. We deliver our 
products on a “just in time” basis from a 
global manufacturing base of 23 facilities 
located around the world. We have long-
standing relationships with our customers 
and we have a deep understanding of 
their manufacturing processes and future 
material needs.
KEY STRENGTHS AND CAPABILITIES
Alent is a market and technology leader 
across its targeted end-market segments. 
We are innovative with a clear focus on 
customer demands. Further sustainable 
revenue and margin growth will be driven 
by underlying industry megatrends in 
electronics, as well as in automotive, 
industrial and emerging applications such 
as LEDs and photovoltaics. We will also 
build on our already well-established 
footprint in key developing markets such as 
China, India and Brazil, together with our 
continued efforts to optimise our product 
mix toward higher margin products.
We differentiate ourselves from our 
competitors by our global “copy exact” 
manufacturing structure, our fast cycle 
R&D capabilities, and our OEM marketing 
and selling strategy. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
One of our strategic goals is to excel in 
our targeted markets and to continue to 
grow our innovative new product pipeline 
with high-value adding, new market 
creating technologies. R&D is therefore 
critical to the continued success of Alent 
and we have invested signiﬁcantly in 
our facilities around the world. We have 
substantial R&D sites in Bangalore, India, 
in the USA in New Jersey and Connecticut, 
in Langenfeld, Germany and also in 
Hiratsuka, Japan. We also have smaller 
R&D sites in the UK and the Netherlands. 
In total we have over 170 R&D scientists 
and engineers with more than one third 
of these located in Bangalore. Our R&D 
spend in 2012 was c4% of NSV. Our R&D 
focus is on the growth areas in which 
we are investing; we spend very little on 
mature, but cash generative products 
such as solder bar and wire. Excluding 
these, R&D spend is c5% of NSV. Instead, 
we divert signiﬁcantly more resources to 
the development of our higher margin 
products such as damascene copper, nano 
silver die attach materials, and our next 
generation solder pastes.
Global R&D resources are allocated into 
three key categories:
 approximately 70% is allocated to 
speciﬁc customer-driven, new product 
evolution and development activities.
The focus here is to ensure that we 
continue to gain share in our current 
markets by a continued stream of 
differentiated, innovative products and 
by working very closely with our 
customers;
 an additional 20% is allocated, through 
new business development, to 
expanding and extending our products 
and services into new but adjacent high 
growth or emerging markets; and
 the remaining 10% is allocated to 
exploring, selecting and nurturing 
emerging/breakthrough/disruptive 
technologies that will help to sustain our 
innovation pipeline for many years to come.
“I believe strongly that the establishment of 
Alent as a stand-alone Company will benefit 
our shareholders, our customers, and our 
people.”

OUR PERFORMANCE
NEW PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
Alent supplies a broad range of products 
across the electronics, automotive and 
industrial end-markets. A signiﬁcant 
portion of our R&D spend and deployment 
of resources is focused on incremental 
improvements to existing product 
platforms, which enable customers 
to improve their own manufacturing 
yields and productivity, and enhance 
both the performance and reliability of 
their products. It is these incremental 
improvements that enable our customers 
to deliver their next generation products, 
cementing our relationship with them. 
We also have an exciting pipeline of new 
products that we are launching. Some of 
these are into new markets such as LED 
lighting and solar/photovoltaics, and we 
continue to identify new or emerging 
markets into which our technologies and 
chemistries can be applied. Some are 
signiﬁcant enhancements, such as our 
ultra-high performance damascene copper 
for enabling next generation technology 
nodes, new moulded interconnect devices 
for smartphone antennae, as well as new 
3D packaging plating chemistries for 3D 
interconnects, and new semi-conductor die 
attach products for the power electronics 
end market. While these new products 
had a relatively small impact on our results 
in 2012, we expect these to develop 
into signiﬁcant revenue streams over the 
coming years.
OEM SALES STRATEGY
One key operational strategy is our value-
add OEM marketing and selling initiative. 
We show the OEMs the value our products 
can bring to them. We are able to quantify 
for them, in monetary terms, how much 
they will save if they specify the use of our 
products to their subcontractors, even 
though our products may cost more. We 
show customers the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of 
increased production yields, increased 
productivity and increased reliability, which 
we can actually demonstrate. In our R&D 
centres in Bangalore and the USA we have 
production scale surface mount assembly 
lines, which are the same scale assembly 
lines that our customers use. In a single 
day we can assemble more than 1,000 
circuit boards. We can place as many as 
500 components on each board. Each of 
these components has multiple solder 
joints, such that on a single day we can 
literally generate millions of individual 
interconnect data points. From these 
data points, we can generate accurate 
yield and productivity data which is made 
available to our customers. We then 
take these boards and mechanically and 
environmentally stress them in such a 
way as to be meaningful to the speciﬁc 
OEM’s end application. This reliability 
data, along with the assembly yield and 
productivity data, are the backbone of 
our value selling initiative. In summary, 
this is much more than a sales pitch, it is 
a compelling value proposition that we 
have seen deliver real tangible results for 
our customers. Alent backs all of this up 
with its global manufacturing footprint, 
experienced technical service engineers, 
and “copy exact” manufacturing protocols. 
Large multinational OEMs want assurance 
that their supply chain can deliver exactly 
the same materials wherever in the 
world they choose to have their products 
manufactured.
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT
The core Alent management team is a 
highly experienced group of executives, 
with whom I have worked for many years 
as we grew and developed the business 
to the point at which it could have its 
own listing. This group has extensive 
international experience across all of 
our operations, our markets, and the 
industries and customers whom we 
serve. I believe that the management 
team is well-positioned to lead Alent 
to a successful future as a stand-alone, 
high-growth company. In addition, I am 
pleased to welcome David Egan to the 
Alent management team as Finance 
Director. I know that David will bring a 
new perspective to Alent and that his 
contributions will have a positive impact 
on our future performance.
TRADING PERFORMANCE
Alent delivered a solid set of results for 
the year despite challenging economic 
conditions during 2012. Whilst NSV was 
broadly ﬂat, both as a result of mix effects 
and as a result of weaker electronics and 
European automotive and industrial end-
market demand, adjusted operating proﬁt at 
constant currency increased 3.4% to £97.2m 
and adjusted EPS increased 2.1% to 24.6 
pence per share. Adjusted cash generated 
from operations was £86.0m (2011: £93.0m) 
and represented a cash conversion of 88% of 
adjusted operating proﬁt.
OUTLOOK
Our major global electronics end-markets 
are expected to return to positive year 
on year growth, with more limited growth 
in global printed circuit board surface 
area production. This improving market 
development is likely to be tempered 
by the continuing macroeconomic 
headwinds across the Eurozone, especially 
in the automotive industry. Alent’s strong 
positions across its selected leading 
electronics applications and with its end-
customers place us in a good position to 
grow NSV and to further improve returns. 
We have begun the year on track and look 
forward to making further progress over 
the course of the year, with our normal 
seasonal improvement in the second half.

Business Unit Review
Electronics end-markets remained 
relatively weak in 2012. According to 
Henderson Ventures, a leading industry 
commentator, worldwide production of 
electronics equipment (on a revenue basis 
at constant 2011 exchange rates) declined 
by 1.2% versus 2011. The bright spots 
that drove Assembly Materials’ growth 
were smartphones and tablet computers.
Global smartphone year-on-year unit 
growth was 37% (Prismark) with global 
production of some 650 million units. 
Global 2012 tablet computer volumes 
were 125 million units, an increase of 95% 
compared with 2011. Assembly Materials’ 
NSV in the Surface mount assembly 
product line segment, which includes 
solder paste, increased 3.8% year on year 
(+8% at constant currency). Other high 
unit volume electronics system segments 
such as standard mobile phones, desk top 
and laptop PCs, LCD TVs, set top boxes 
and digital cameras all experienced no, 
or negative unit growth in 2012 versus 
2011. Automotive electronic systems 
grew globally by 3.7% on a revenue basis 
(Prismark) with increases in North America 
and Asia offsetting declines in Europe.
For Assembly Materials, we segment our 
solder product lines between bar solder — 
used in the more mature wave soldering 
technology for assembling printed circuit 
boards and which comprises “Wave solder 
assembly” in the table above; and products 
such as the high performance solder 
paste, wire and preforms that are used as 
the joining medium in the more modern 
surface mount technology for circuit board 
manufacture, shown as “Surface mount 
assembly” in the table. In wave solder 
assembly, NSV increased 2.7% at constant 
currency. We saw, as expected, a continuing 
shift away from the older printed circuit 
board assembly process to the newer 
Surface mount assembly process, and this 
is reﬂected in the table above. Although 
overall global bar solder volumes declined 
12% as compared to 2011, we were still 
able to achieve revenue growth, in constant 
currency, in this segment as a result of 
continued mix shift toward low silver 
content alloys and the on-going shift from 
lead-bearing solders to lead-free alloys.
Surface mount assembly products saw an 
increase in NSV of 8% at constant currency. 
We shipped a signiﬁcantly higher volume 
of lead-free solder paste, being driven by 
demand from the smartphone, tablet and 
laptop computer segments from OEMs, as 
a result of our ongoing OEM marketing and 
selling strategy. In 2012, c30% of our global 
solder paste volume was shipped into 
the supply chain of three market-leading 
OEMs in the smartphone, tablet and laptop 
computer market segments based on 
speciﬁc product speciﬁcation by the OEMs.
“Microelectronics” includes a range of 
non-solder products that are sold into the 
electronics, LED and photovoltaic markets, 
including electronic polymers, spheres, and 
die attach materials. NSV declined 5.6% 
at constant currency due to lower solder 
sphere volumes. 
The “Other” category includes our 
recycling and reclaim operations, our 
consumer products and water treatment 
chemicals businesses. NSV declined in 
these areas 6.6% at constant currency, 
primarily due to lower sales of commodity 
products in our Fernox water treatment 
chemicals business. The resulting mix shift 
away from commodities improved the 
quality of earnings in this product 
line segment. 
Assembly Materials’ adjusted operating 
proﬁt increased by £5.0m (9.3%) to £58.7m 
(2011: £53.7m). On a constant currency 
basis the increase was 9.9%. The NSV 
margin increased 3.1ppts to 28.2% (2011: 
25.1%). The increase in proﬁt and margin 
was driven by a number of factors. These 
included higher sales of our higher margin 
surface mount technology products, higher 
margin sales in Asia more than offsetting 
a small decline in Europe, operational 
gearing on the increased sales overall, and 
the effects of our continual operational and 
Six Sigma improvement programmes and 
the continued product mix shift away from 
low margin, more commoditised products 
to higher margin products.

“Performance coatings” are specialty 
electroplating chemicals sold into non-
electronics end-markets which are used 
to provide either corrosion protection, 
or wear protection, or to provide a high 
quality decorative ﬁnish to either metal 
or plastic substrates. In the automotive 
and industrial end-markets, the severe 
market headwinds in Europe resulted in 
signiﬁcantly reduced volume demand from 
customers in that region. Western Europe 
experienced a 10% unit volume decline 
(source: LMC Automotive) in light vehicle 
production in 2012 with manufacturers 
in Southern Europe hit particularly hard. 
However, stronger demand in the North 
American and Asian automotive markets 
more than compensated for the decline 
in Europe and, as a result, Surface 
Chemistries’ Performance coatings NSV 
was up 1.7% versus the prior year (on a 
constant currency basis). 
Products sold into “electronics” end-
markets include copper damascene, 
providing the copper “wiring” in the 
leading edge semiconductor applications 
such as microprocessors, logic and 
ASICs, wafer bumping chemistries 
for the semiconductor market, and 
printed circuit fabrication chemicals and 
interconnect materials serving a broad 
range of electronics applications. The 
overall worldwide circuit board market 
contracted by some 6% (Prismark) in 
2012 as measured in millions of square 
metres of circuit boards produced. As a 
result, our printed circuit board chemistry 
volumes sold into this market were down 
5.7%. The global semiconductor market, 
in terms of silicon area (excluding solar) 
saw a decline in 2012 of 1.1% (Henderson). 
Our damascene copper business was, in 
total, generally ﬂat in comparison to the 
prior year as some customers struggled 
to ramp the new, higher speciﬁcation 
28nm technology node and this delayed 
expected qualiﬁcations. However, even 
within our damascene copper product line, 
we experienced a mix shift in 2012 away 
from the more commoditised electrolyte 
business toward the higher margin 
additives. Damascene copper additives 
increased 9% year on year.
The smaller product group, “Other” 
includes equipment sales — where we sell 
electroplating equipment to our customers 
typically alongside a multi-year contract for 
us to provide the associated electroplating 
chemicals, and small amounts of non-
proprietary products sourced from third 
parties and resold to customers. NSV 
decreased £2.9m on a constant currency 
basis due to a reduction in equipment 
sales and sales of commodities.
Our new, world class manufacturing and 
technical centre under construction in 
Shanghai is progressing well with hand-
over expected at the end of the ﬁrst half 
of 2013.
Surface Chemistries’ adjusted operating 
proﬁt decreased by £2.2m (4.6%) to £46.0m 
(2011: £48.2m). On a constant currency 
basis the decrease was 4.4%, resulting in 
the NSV margin being ﬂat year on year, 
at 22.0%. The major factor in this decline 
was the weaker demand in Europe (which 
accounted for 41% of divisional sales) in 
both automotive and electronics, together 
with the global decline in printed circuit 
board production volumes.

Financial Review
“I am pleased to be reporting 
on a resilient set of results for 
2012.”
❯ David Egan, Group Finance Director
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to be reporting on a resilient 
set of results for 2012 despite challenging 
economic environments. Whilst Net Sales 
Value (NSV) on a constant currency basis 
was broadly ﬂat year on year at £416.7m, 
both as a result of mix effects and as a 
result of weaker electronics and European 
automotive and industrial end-market 
demand, adjusted operating proﬁt on a 
reported basis increased 3% to £97.2m 
(2011: £94.4m) and adjusted Earnings Per 
Share (EPS) increased 2.1% to 24.6p (2011: 
24.1p). Adjusted cash generated from 
operations was £86.0m (2011: £93.0m) and 
represented a cash conversion of 88% of 
adjusted operating proﬁt.
Adjusted ﬁnancial information for 2011 
and 2012
Prior to demerger, the Alent businesses 
formed the Performance Materials Division 
of Cookson Group plc. The fundamental 
structure of Alent’s businesses has not 
changed as a result of the demerger and 
consequently the demerger has had little 
impact on Alent’s operational activities 
and results. The principal impact of the 
demerger on Alent’s results has been from 
the overlay of a stand-alone corporate 
structure and the effect that this has had 
on the ﬁnancing and tax arrangements 
of Alent as well as all KPIs calculated by 
reference to these items.
Proforma adjustments: In order to 
provide clearer ﬁnancial information and 
performance metrics of Alent, we have made 
proforma ﬁnancial adjustments to show what 
the results of Alent for 2012 and 2011 would 
have looked like if Alent had been a stand-
alone Group for the whole of that period. 
These results will provide a benchmark 
against which future results can be most 
appropriately compared. In order to apply 
proforma adjustments, certain assumptions 
are required to be made and these are 
discussed in the balance of this report.
Other adjustments: In addition to the 
proforma adjustments, the Board believes 
that additional adjustments should be 
made in respect of exceptional items 
and demerger costs, to arrive at adjusted 
proﬁt before tax and adjusted EPS. 
We believe that this provides a better 
basis for understanding Alent’s ﬁnancial

Group NSV decreased by £16.6m (3.8%) 
to £416.7m (2011: £433.3m). On a constant 
currency basis the decline for the Group 
was 0.3%. 
Assembly Materials NSV decreased by 
£6.1m (2.8%) to £208.0m (2011: £214.1m), 
although on a constant currency basis it 
increased by 2.3%. Despite lower volumes, 
the mix shift toward low silver content alloys 
and the ongoing shift from lead bearing 
solders to lead-free alloys in the Wave 
solder assembly sub-segment improved 
NSV . Surface mount assembly products 
saw an increase in NSV of 8% at constant 
currency. We shipped a signiﬁcantly higher 
volume of lead-free solder paste, being 
driven by demand from the smartphones, 
tablets and laptop computer segments 
from OEMs. Additional details on the NSV 
sub segments can be found on pages 
16 to 17.
Surface Chemistries NSV decreased by 
£10.5m (4.8%) to £208.7m (2011: £219.2m). 
On a constant currency basis the decline 
was 2.7%. Stronger demand in the Americas 
and Asia automotive markets more than 
offset weaker demand in the automotive 
and industrial end-markets in Europe 
leading to a performance coatings sub 
segment NSV improvement of 1.7% versus 
the prior year, on a constant currency 
basis. NSV in the electronics chemistries 
sub segment declined 4.4% primarily due 
to lower global printed circuit board and 
semiconductor production. Additional 
details on the NSV sub segments can be 
found on pages 16 to 17.  OUR PERFORMANCE www.alent.com

Assembly Materials adjusted operating 
proﬁt increased by £5.0m (9.3%) to £58.7m 
(2011: £53.7m). On a constant currency basis 
the increase was 9.9%. The NSV margin 
increased 3.1ppts to 28.2% (2011: 25.1%), 
whilst on a constant currency basis the NSV 
margin increase was 2.0ppts. The increase 
in proﬁt and margin was driven by a number 
of factors. These included increased sales of 
our higher margin surface mount technology 
products, higher NSV in Asia more than 
offsetting a small decline in Europe, 
operational gearing on the increased sales 
overall, and the effects of our continual 
operational improvement programmes. 
Surface Chemistries adjusted operating 
proﬁt decreased by £2.2m (4.6%) to £46.0m 
(2011: £48.2m). On a constant currency basis 
the decrease was 4.4%. The NSV margin was 
ﬂat year on year at 22%. Weaker volumes, 
primarily in Europe automotive and industrial 
segments, offset gains in other geographic 
markets.
Central costs of £7.5m represent estimated 
annual costs associated with becoming a 
separate stand-alone Group. Accordingly 
these costs have been presented on a 
proforma basis in the segmental analysis and 
assumed to be the same amount in both 2012 
and 2011.
Group adjusted operating proﬁt increased 
by £2.8m (3%) to £97.2m (2011: £94.4m). On 
a constant currency basis the increase was 
3.4%. Group NSV margin increased 1.5ppts 
to 23.3% (2011: 21.8%) whilst on a constant 
currency basis, the increase was 0.8ppts.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Total exceptional costs for the Group 
were £15.8m (2011: £3.5m), made up 
of restructuring charges, disposal 
and closure costs, one-off loss on an 
equipment construction contract and, 
in 2011, £2.0m of gains relating to 
employee beneﬁt plans.
The restructuring charge for the year was 
£3.5m (2011: £1.9m), principally arising in 
connection with initiatives that included 
redundancy programmes, the downsizing 
or closure of facilities, the streamlining 
of manufacturing processes and the 
rationalisation of product lines.
The disposal and closure costs of £5.7m 
(2011: £3.6m) arose in relation to costs 
incurred in connection with the demolition 
and clean-up of sites of former Group 
businesses that have either been closed
 or disposed of. Cash costs of £1.9m 
(2011: £1.8m) were incurred, leaving 
provisions made but unspent of £15.4m.
The one-off loss on an equipment 
construction project of £6.6m (2011: £nil) 
relates to the additional costs incurred, or 
to be incurred by Alent, for the installation 
and ﬁnancing of a chemical treatment 
line following insolvency of the third party 
subcontractor.
DEMERGER COSTS
Costs of £10.7m, incurred as a result of the 
demerger of the Alent group of businesses 
from Cookson Group plc and principally 
relating to professional fees for audit, 
accounting, pensions, legal and regulatory 
compliance services.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Proforma adjustments have been made 
to reﬂect Alent’s post demerger banking 
arrangements and debt levels. Based upon 
the level of net debt at 31 December 2012 
and the interest payable on the gross 
borrowings drawn under the new bank 
facility, the Group’s net borrowing-related 
proforma ﬁnance costs are £7.6m per 
annum. After including pension-related 
interest and interest from the unwinding 
of discounted provisions, the Group’s total 
net adjusted ﬁnance costs in 2012 and 
2011 are £8.5m per annum.
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Adjusted proﬁt before tax increased 2.2% to 
£89.0m (2011: £87.1m) whilst on a constant 
currency basis, the increase was 2.5%.
TAX CHARGE
Proforma adjustments have been made to 
reﬂect Alent’s post-demerger structure and 
performance. As a result the proforma tax 
charge on ordinary activities was £20.8m 
(2011: £20.1m) on adjusted proﬁt before tax 
of £89.0m (2011: £87.1m), an effective tax 
rate (before share of post-tax proﬁt from 
joint ventures) of 23.4% (2011: 23.4%). As at 
31 December 2012, there are approximately 
US$248m of gross US tax losses available to 
Alent. The tax charge on exceptional items 
was £4.9m (2011: £3.2m). Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

STOCK CODE: ALNT
OUR PERFORMANCE
ADJUSTED PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Adjusted proﬁt for the year increased by 
1.8% to £68.2m (2011: £67.0m).
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 
2.1% to 24.6 pence per share (2011: 24.1 
pence per share). The weighted average 
number of shares was 277.5m (2011: 277.5m).
DIVIDENDS
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend for 
2012 of 5.5 pence per share. This is aligned 
to previous guidance. On a proforma basis, 
assuming the Cookson Group interim 
dividend was split in the same proportion 
as the ﬁnal dividend, this amounts to a full 
year dividend of 8.25 pence per share or 
equivalent to 3 times dividend cover from 
adjusted EPS for Alent.
The ﬁnal dividend, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting on 21 May 2013, is 
to be paid on 13 June 2013 to shareholders 
on the register on 10 May 2013. Any 
shareholder wishing to participate in the 
Alent Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) 
needs to have submitted their election to 
do so by 22 May 2013.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)
R&D is critical to the continued success 
of Alent to meet the demand for leading-
edge products for smaller , lighter and faster 
electronics and to take advantage of the 
opportunities presented by new and fast-
growing markets, such as LED, power semi-
conductor electronics and photovoltaics. 
In addition, tightening environmental 
regulations mean that improvements to 
existing products are required in order to 
ensure continued compliance.
Alent believes its facility in Bangalore enables 
it to maintain its leading position and run-rate 
of new products at an attractive cost.
Alent invests signiﬁcant amounts in R&D 
and endeavours to sustain its competitive 
advantage. In 2012, total R&D spend was 
£16.5m, (2011: £16.0m) equivalent to 4.0% 
(2011: 3.7%), of NSV . Of this expenditure, 
£8.1m (2011: £7.9m) or 3.9% (2011: 3.7%) of 
NSV was in the Assembly Materials business 
whilst £8.4m (2011: £8.1m) or 4.0% (2011: 
3.7%) of NSV was in the Surface Chemistries 
business. All R&D costs have been expensed 
through the Group income statement.

Outflow in relation to purchase of Woking site (restructuring £16.0m; capex £5.5m) (21.5) —
EBITDA for 2012 was £111.9m (2011: 
£108.1m). Working capital outﬂow in 2012 
of £20.0m (2011: £9.6m) was primarily due 
to a reduction in factoring and supplier 
ﬁnancing. Working capital as a percentage 
of sales was 17.7% (2011: 16.9%). 
Restructuring cash costs of £3.8m (2011: 
£3.8m) were incurred in the year in respect 
of restructuring initiatives leaving provisions 
made but unspent of £5.4m (2011: £3.2m). 
Adjusted cash generated from operations 
was £86.0m (2011: £93.0m) and represented 
a cash conversion of 88% of adjusted 
operating proﬁt.
Operational capital expenditure in 2012 
was £16.4m (2011: £16.1m). This represents 
184% (2011: 189%) of depreciation. 
Whilst the Group’s manufacturing 
operations are relatively capital light, more 
recently the building of a major facility in 
Shanghai, the upgrading of a number of 
manufacturing facilities, and the upgrading 
of our R&D sites with the latest equipment 
have combined to increase the level of 
capital expenditure in 2012. We expect 
completion of the Shanghai facility in mid-
2013, and completion of a new facility in 
Chennai, India by the end of 2013.
Adjusted cash ﬂow for the year was £49.1m 
(2011: £63.7m). 
Demerger cash costs of £5.7m (2011: £nil) 
were incurred in the year leaving provisions 
made but unspent of £5.0m (2011: £nil), at 
the end of the year.
Outﬂow in relation to the purchase of the 
Woking site of £21.5m (2011:£nil) relates 
to the purchase of a property in Woking, 
UK which was previously occupied on a 
leasehold basis and over which an onerous 
lease reserve had been established in 2009. 
The 2012 cash outﬂow includes £5.5m 
relating to the purchase of the land and 
buildings and £16.0m relating 
to restructuring.
DEBT FACILITY AGREEMENT
Alent signed a £300m, ﬁve year, 
multicurrency, revolving credit facility dated 
21 September 2012. Loans made under the 
facility will bear interest at a ﬂoating rate 
per annum based on the London interbank 
offer rate (LIBOR) as applicable plus a 
margin ranging from 1.25% per annum to 
2.25% per annum depending on the ratio of 
consolidated net borrowings to proforma 
EBITDA. £2.9m of fees associated with 
establishing the new facility have been 
capitalised against borrowings.
NET DEBT
Net debt at 31 December 2012 was 
£144.4m. Gross borrowings were £225.9m 
whilst cash on hand was £81.5m. The cash 
on hand balances were slightly higher than 
normal due primarily to the timing of the 
demerger. At 31 December 2012, 100% of 
the Group’s borrowings were denominated 
in pounds sterling. Post-balance sheet, 
the Group’s gross borrowings have been 
redenominated into US Dollars (38%), Euros 
(15%) and pounds sterling (47%).
Financial covenants applicable to the facility 
include adjusted EBITDA to net interest 
(minimum 4.0 times) and net debt to 
adjusted EBITDA (maximum 3.0 times). As 
at 31 December 2012, Alent was operating 
well within these covenants as the ratio of 
EBITDA to net interest cover was 15 times 
and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 
1.3 times.  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

The Group operates deﬁned contribution 
and deﬁned beneﬁts pension plans, 
principally in the US and Germany. The 
Group’s largest deﬁned beneﬁt plan in 
the US is closed to new members and to 
further accruals for existing members. As 
shown in the table above, as at 
31 December 2012, the net deﬁcit in 
Alent’s post-retirement deﬁned beneﬁt 
plans was £24.3m (2011: £26.4m) with 
assets of £41.1m (2011: £45.0m) and 
liabilities of £65.4m (2011: £71.4m).
With effect from 1 January 2013, Alent will 
adopt IAS 19, Employee Beneﬁts (revised 
2011). Adoption of this new standard is not 
expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s results or ﬁnancial position.
GOING CONCERN BASIS
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, 
accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial 
statements for the year ended 
31 December 2012.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Following the demerger, these are the 
ﬁrst ﬁnancial statements that have been 
prepared for Alent plc and IFRS1, First-
time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards, has been applied as 
detailed in note 2.4 to the Group ﬁnancial 
statements. The ﬁnancial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU and the 
accounting policies set out in the notes 
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Applying accounting policies requires the 
use of certain judgements, assumptions 
and estimates. The following accounting 
policies have been identiﬁed as being the 
most signiﬁcant and where there is most 
risk of material adjustment to the carrying 
value of Group’s assets and liabilities within 
the next ﬁnancial year:
 Goodwill
 Employee beneﬁts
 Liability reserves
 Taxation
See note 3 to the Group ﬁnancial 
statements for more detail.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions between Alent plc and 
Vesuvius plc have been treated as related 
party up until the date of the demerger, 
19 December 2012. The details of these 
transactions have been included in note 36 
on page 120. 
CURRENCY IMPACT ON TRADING
The Group reports its results in pounds sterling but conducts its business in multiple foreign currencies. The revenue mix in its major 
currencies in 2012 was as follows:
2012 2011
US Dollars 25% 26%
Chinese Renminbi 20% 21%
Euros 19% 19%
Taiwanese Dollars 10% 11%
Brazilian Reals 5% 5%
Based on the 2012 mix of non-pound 
sterling denominated revenue and 
adjusted operating proﬁt, a 1% movement 
in US Dollars (relative to pounds sterling) 
changes revenue by £1.7m and adjusted 
operating proﬁt by £0.3m, a 1% movement 
in Chinese Renminbi (relative to pounds 
sterling) changes revenue by £1.4m and 
adjusted operating proﬁt by £0.4m and a 
1% movement in Euros (relative to pounds 
sterling) changes revenue by £1.3m and 
adjusted operating proﬁt by £0.1m.
The Group has a policy of broadly matching 
the currency of borrowings to the currency 
of its operating activities for its major trading 
currencies. Immediately following demerger, 
100% of the Group’ s gross borrowings were 
denominated in pounds sterling. However, 
post the balance sheet date, just over 
50% of the Group’ s gross borrowings were 
redenominated into non-sterling currencies: 
principally US Dollars and Euros. OUR PERFORMANCE www.alent.com

Alent Group 713.9 814.4 (12.3%) (11.1%)
Group revenue decreased by £100.5m 
(12.3%) to £713.9m (2011: £814.4m). On a 
constant currency basis the decline was 
11.1%. The revenue decrease is impacted 
by the “pass through” to customers of 
lower tin and silver prices, both major 
raw materials for Assembly Materials, and 
lower gold consumption in the Surface 
Chemistries business. For the full year 
2012, the average prices of tin and silver 
were, respectively, 19% and 11% lower 
than the same period in the prior year, 
such that approximately £41m of the 
Group’s revenue decrease was as a result 
of these lower metal prices. The balance 
of the revenue reduction was due to 
declining global demand for lower margin, 
more commoditised products (particularly 
bar solder, non-proprietary chemicals) and 
lower gold consumption partially offset 
by the continued market penetration of 
innovative, higher margin, products such 
as advanced solder pastes, damascene 
copper, “tape and reel” packaged solder 
preforms and proprietary chemicals.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Assembly Materials operating proﬁt 
increased by £5.4m (10.4%) to £57.5m 
(2011: £52.1m). On a constant currency 
basis the increase was 7.7%. The NSV 
margin increased 3.3ppts to 27.6% 
(2011: 24.3%) primarily as a result of solid 
demand and margin for the surface mount 
solder paste. On a constant currency basis 
the NSV margin increase was 1.3ppts.
Surface Chemistries operating proﬁt 
decreased by £2.3m (4.8%) to £45.2m 
(2011: £47.5m). On a constant currency 
basis the decrease was 6.0%. The NSV 
margin was ﬂat year on year at 21.7%. 
Weaker volumes, primarily in Europe, 
offset gains in other markets.
NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs on a statutory basis 
amounted to £6.4m (2011: £6.3m), 
including £2.8m (2011: £3.6m) for the 
interest cost associated with the Group’s 
deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations. 
Finance income amounted to £2.8m 
(2011: £3.4m), including £2.3m (2011: 
£3.0m) for the expected return on the 
assets of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension plans.
PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Proﬁt before tax decreased by £21.2m to 
£73.2m (2011: £94.4m) primarily due to the

RISKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE GROUP MITIGATION
The ﬁnancial performance and ﬁnancial position of the Group 
may be adversely affected by a signiﬁcant weakening in demand 
in its core end-markets and general macro-economic conditions.
The Board will regularly review Group strategy, which will 
determine the markets in which the Group operates. The 
current spread of the Group’s business, both geographically 
and by end-market served, provides some protection to the 
Group should conditions in particular markets deteriorate. 
In late 2008 and the ﬁrst half of 2009, the Group experienced 
a signiﬁcant downturn in its key end-markets of electronics 
and automotive. However, the downturn in electronics 
end-markets was relatively short lived and the recovery has 
been strong. Demand in automotive markets has remained 
more difﬁcult. The Group responded with a number of 
cost-reduction initiatives and the cost base remains tightly 
controlled.
Following the tight control of the cost base in recent years 
and the level and tenor of the Group’s debt facilities, the 
Directors believe that the Group is well positioned ﬁnancially 
to sustain a further downturn in end-market activity should 
this occur.
The global macro-economic environment is uncertain. While 
demand in Alent’ s key electronics end-markets has been 
reasonably stable overall during 2012 with weaker demand 
in Europe offset by continued growth in the Americas and 
Asia-Paciﬁc, there has been general weakening in the global 
economy and slowing global industrial production, most notably 
in Europe. In addition to clear evidence of slowing worldwide 
economic growth, concerns about the stability of the Eurozone 
and the European ﬁnancial/banking system remain. It is, as 
yet, unclear to what extent the seeming insolvency of Greece 
and the ﬁscal weakness of other countries such as Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal and Spain will impact the euro currency and the 
banking system. There is therefore considerable uncertainty as 
to how the Eurozone crisis, the global ﬁnancial crisis and the 
wider economic situation will develop over time.
Alent supplies predominantly consumable products, on short 
lead times, mainly to the electronics, automotive and industrial 
end-markets. As such, the Group’ s expectations of future trading 
are based upon the Directors’ assessment of end-market 
conditions, which are subject to some uncertainty . In the event 
that end-market conditions suffer signiﬁcant deterioration, the 
Group may experience reductions in trading activity , a lower share 
price, ﬁnancial failure of one or more of its key customers and 
suppliers, asset impairments, lower proﬁtability and/or a material 
adverse impact on its ﬁnancial position.
The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract, develop 
or retain skilled or qualiﬁed employees could negatively 
impact Alent’s business.
Alent depends on the capabilities and performance of its 
executive ofﬁcers and employees. Loss of key personnel or 
failure to attract or retain qualiﬁed employees could impact 
Alent’s business and have a material adverse effect on its 
ﬁnancial condition and operating results.
Alent believes in the importance of investing in and 
developing its most important asset, its people. Alent 
believes its people are its competitive advantage and it 
has created comprehensive development opportunities to 
introduce, reinforce and further strengthen their talents. 
The Group utilises a variety of programmes tailored to help 
its employees enhance their performance, set and achieve 
objectives, develop their leadership skills and recognise and 
reward their achievements. The Group has implemented a 
long-standing and rigorous succession planning programme 
with an identiﬁed succession plan in place for all senior 
members of staff.
Our Approach to 
Risk Management
As described in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 46 to 55, there is a continuous process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the business. Group management 
operates a risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing the business and 
reports to the Audit Committee on the process of how those risks are being managed. 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management and also reviews the role of insurance and other measures used in managing 
risks across the Group. The Board receives regular reports on any major issues that arise and makes an assessment of how the risks have 
changed over the period under review. Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

RISKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE GROUP MITIGATION
The Group’s ﬁnancial position and trading results may 
be adversely affected by ﬂuctuations in exchange rates, 
interest rates or the rate of inﬂation.
The Group attempts to manage transactional and balance 
sheet translation risks associated with currency exchange rate 
ﬂuctuations through its hedging and funding policies and it is 
Group policy that foreign currency transaction exposures that 
are material at an individual operating unit level are hedged 
using appropriate instruments such as forward foreign 
exchange contracts. For its key operating currencies, it is 
the Group policy to broadly match the currency proﬁle of its 
borrowings with the currencies of its asset base, but it does 
not hedge translational impact on the income statements 
of overseas subsidiaries. Where appropriate, the Group 
manages its interest rate exposures using interest rate swaps 
or other instruments.
Alent has no control over changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates, or inﬂation and interest rates. In the normal course of 
business, many transactions are carried out by the Group’ s 
businesses in currencies other than their reporting currency, 
leading to transactional foreign exchange risk, although this is 
not material for the Group overall. The Group is exposed to the 
effect of translating the results and net assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries into sterling. Signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the value 
of currencies in which it operates, in interest rates or in rates of 
inﬂation may adversely impact the Group’ s ﬁnancial position and 
results of operations.  
The Group may lose customers to competitors with new or 
alternative technologies if its businesses do not adequately 
adapt to market developments. 
Alent has invested signiﬁcantly in research and development 
facilities and will continue to do so to ensure that the Group 
remains able to front-run emerging trends, and maintain 
its leadership position in terms of innovation and product 
development in its market niches. Indeed, research and 
development is critical to the continued success of the Group 
and signiﬁcant managerial and ﬁnancial resource is dedicated 
to this area. In 2012, total research and development spend 
was £16.5m, equivalent to 4% of NSV. The drive for smaller, 
smarter and faster electronics and the rapid pace of change, 
means that only those businesses with the required scale and 
technical expertise are able to successfully take advantage 
of these market opportunities. The Group has historically 
been at the forefront of market developments and remains 
conﬁdent that it will continue to be successful in leading the 
world in key new developments.
The markets in which many of Alent’s businesses operate 
can experience rapid changes due to the introduction of 
new technologies. The Group’s continued success depends 
upon its ability to continue to develop and produce new and 
enhanced products and services on a cost-effective and timely 
basis in accordance with customer demands. In addition, the 
markets for the Group’s products are competitive in terms of 
pricing, product and service quality, product development and 
introduction time, customer service, ﬁnancing terms and other 
similar factors. If the Group fails to adequately adapt to market 
developments related to new products and technology, it 
could lose customers to suppliers with better or less costly 
products. Alternatively or additionally, the Group could fail to 
achieve its anticipated returns on the amounts it has invested 
in research and development. These outcomes could have 
a material adverse effect on the Group’s future prospects, 
ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
Throughout its global operations, the Group faces various risks, both internal and external, which could have a material impact on the 
Group’s long-term performance. The Group manages the risks inherent in its operations in order to mitigate exposure to all forms of 
risk, where practical, and to transfer risk to insurers, where cost-effective. The risks below are not the only ones that the Group will face. 
Some risks are not yet known and some that are not currently deemed material could later become material. All of these risks could 
materially affect the Group, its businesses, and results of future operations or ﬁnancial condition.

RISKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE GROUP MITIGATION
If the Group fails or is unable to protect, maintain and 
enforce its intellectual property, it may lose its exclusive 
right to use its technologies and processes.
The Group applies for patents over its major products, 
technologies and processes in a number of jurisdictions, 
including in Europe and the USA. New product and service 
offerings by competitors are regularly monitored and any 
perceived breach of a Group patent is vigorously challenged. 
To the extent possible, the Group avoids holding key 
intellectual property in countries which do not afford an 
acceptable degree of legal protection to the Group.
Throughout its operations, Alent relies on a combination 
of trade marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and 
conﬁdentiality procedures and agreements to protect 
its proprietary rights. If the Group fails to, is unable to 
protect, maintain and enforce, or is the subject of theft 
or infringement of, its existing intellectual property, this 
may result in the loss of the Group’s exclusive right to use 
technologies and processes which are included or used in 
its businesses. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s 
procedures and contractual provisions will be adequate 
to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or other 
unauthorised use of the Group’s intellectual property by 
third parties. In addition, the protection provided by these 
intellectual property rights varies between the countries in 
which the Group operates and the laws of certain countries 
in which the Group operates may not protect proprietary 
rights to the same extent as those of, for example, the United 
Kingdom or the United States of America. 
The Group’s worldwide operations and businesses may be 
adversely affected by various political, legal, regulatory and 
other developments in countries in which it operates.
As part of its planning process before entering a new market 
or territory, or expanding in an existing market or territory, 
the Group undertakes a rigorous assessment of the risks 
involved. In addition, the spread of the Group’s major 
businesses, both geographically and by end-market served, 
provides some protection to the Group should any of its 
businesses be adversely impacted by legal, regulatory or 
other changes in an individual market or territory.
The Group has in place an insurance programme covering 
all of its businesses which provides an acceptable level of 
coverage for the operational risks which they face.
Alent is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, 
including those covering taxation and environmental matters, 
and political risks, including the imposition of trade barriers, 
changes of regulatory requirements, lack of protection 
for intellectual property rights and the volatility of input 
costs, selling prices, taxes and currencies. In particular, 
operating within the rapidly evolving developing nations 
can expose the Group’s businesses to signiﬁcant local risks 
and challenges. Future global political, legal or regulatory 
developments concerning the Group’s businesses may 
affect their ability to operate and to operate proﬁtably in the 
affected jurisdictions. Should the Group’s businesses fail to 
comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, 
this may result in a ﬁnancial loss or restriction on their ability 
to operate.
Alent’s businesses are subject to a variety of operational risks, 
including natural catastrophe, terrorist action, theft, fraud 
and, particularly in developing nations, insufﬁcient supply of 
high quality local management and technical personnel. If 
any of the operational risks materialise to a signiﬁcant extent, 
this could result in a substantial interruption to a facility, loss 
of future insurance cover, potential loss of customers and 
revenue and ﬁnancial loss.

OUR PERFORMANCE
RISKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE GROUP MITIGATION
Alent’s future prospects, ﬁnancial position and results of 
operations could be adversely affected if it is unable to 
pass on to its customers ﬂuctuations in the prices of the raw 
materials which it purchases. 
The Group has rigorous processes in place to ensure that any 
increases or decreases in the cost of commodity metal prices 
are passed on to its customers. Group systems are automatically 
uploaded with LME (London Metal Exchange) prices or 
equivalent on a daily basis. These prices are then agreed and 
passed on to the customer at the time of placing an order.
Tin, silver, gold, isopropyl alcohol, nickel sulphate and 
chromic acid are among the principal raw materials that Alent 
purchases. Alent’s business may be affected by ﬂuctuations 
in the price and supply of such raw materials. Alent’s ability 
to pass on increases or decreases in the cost of raw materials 
to its customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon market 
conditions, established market practice and terms of trade. If 
Alent’s ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials 
is limited, this could have a material adverse effect on Alent’s 
future prospects, ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
Future expenditure on compliance with environmental 
and health and safety laws and regulations may materially 
adversely affect Alent’s future prospects, ﬁnancial position 
and results of operations.
The Board has overall responsibility for Alent’s Health, 
Safety and Environment (HS&E) policy and for monitoring its 
implementation. Executives and line managers at all levels are 
directly responsible through the normal management structure 
for HS&E matters in the operations under their control.
Alent’ s facilities are ISO Compliant to Quality, Environmental 
and Health and Safety Standards by a third party registrar. The 
systems require auditing to the established standards in the 
system and include continuous improvement as part of its core. 
System reviews are summarised with well supported corrective 
action methodologies where recommendations are warranted.
The Group has in place an insurance programme covering 
all of its businesses which provides an acceptable level of 
coverage for the operational risks which they face.
Alent is subject to applicable laws and regulations in all 
of the jurisdictions in which it operates and in which it has 
property assets undergoing remediation activity, including 
those relating to pollution, the protection of the environment, 
human health and safety, the disposal of hazardous 
substances and waste materials and remediation of any 
land or water contaminated by such substances. Violations 
of legal or other regulatory requirements could result in 
restrictions on operations, the imposition of more stringent 
permitting conditions, damages, ﬁnes or other sanctions, all 
of which may have a material adverse effect on Alent’s future 
prospects, ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
The loss of key manufacturing assets as a result of a major 
catastrophe could cause signiﬁcant disruption and lead to 
temporary plant closures or a suspension of operations and 
production which could negatively impact Alent’s business 
and ﬁnancial position.
Alent delivers its products on a “just in time” basis from a 
manufacturing base of 23 facilities located around the world. 
Its “copy exact” manufacturing structure allows the Group 
to produce products to the same speciﬁcation across all 
of its global manufacturing sites. Alent can therefore ﬂex 
production between sites with minimum disruption to its 
customers.
Alent’s procurement strategy ensures that it has agreements 
in place with regional suppliers across the globe and 
can increase its supply of raw materials in each region as 
necessary.
The Group has in place an insurance programme covering 
all of its businesses which provides an acceptable level of 
coverage for the operational risks which they face.
Failure to manufacture products within customers’ speciﬁed 
schedules and timeframes could prevent Alent from fully 
performing its contractual obligations, which could severely 
impact sales and earnings and cause detrimental reputational 
damage to Alent. This could result in a loss of market share, 
weakened customer relationships and threaten Alent’s 
position as global supplier of choice. OUR PERFORMANCE www.alent.com

BACKGROUND
Alent employs some 2,600 people 
(2011: 2,600), has a global base of 23 
manufacturing facilities and is serving 
customers in more than 100 countries 
worldwide. We supply our customers 
with consumable products for use in their 
manufacturing processes, for example in 
the production of electronics, automotive, 
LED lighting and alternative energy 
products. We operate in “just in time” 
supply chains with short lead times from 
order to delivery. We therefore have 
a relatively large number of small and 
medium sized facilities located close to 
our customers throughout the world’s 
major economic regions, rather than large 
centralised factories supplying customers 
worldwide. Our manufacturing processes 
are not energy intensive (total energy costs 
are approximately 1% of revenue) and do 
not produce large quantities of hazardous 
or other wastes and emissions.
SUSTAINABILITY 
Alent is committed to a sustainable 
societal, commercial and environmental 
global eco-system. We are focused on 
promoting sustainability throughout our 
environmentally friendly product and 
technology development activities, our 
operations, and the development of our 
people. We believe these efforts will 
beneﬁt the environment, our business, 
customers, shareholders, our people and 
our worldwide value chain.
We recognise our operations impact a 
wide community of stakeholders, including 
investors, customers, business associates, 
our people and local communities. 
Therefore, the Company has a wide range 
of initiatives to support health, safety and 
environmental activities. Those activities 
include advanced manufacturing facilities, 
designed to international standards, a high 
level of training for chemical operators, 
and segregation of raw materials and 
ﬁnished goods. 
All of our operations are designed with 
waste water treatment and pollution 
abatement equipment which meets or 
exceeds local compliance requirements. 
Our Approach to 
Corporate Responsibility
The following are just a few examples of the initiatives we have 
undertaken to support health, safety and environmental activities:
Conﬂict Minerals
Alent has been very engaged with critical 
industry stakeholders in the Conﬂict Minerals 
issue and regulation over the last few years. 
In August 2012, the US Securities and 
Exchange Committee (“SEC”) published 
the ﬁnal rules of implementation of Section 
1502 of the Dodd Frank Act regarding 
Conﬂict Minerals. This Act was enacted by 
Congress in order to help eradicate the sales 
of “Conﬂict Minerals” from the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining 
countries (the “Conﬂict Countries”). 
The Act requires any USA publicly held 
company to annually disclose its use of 
conﬂict minerals that originated in Conﬂict 
Countries. As a UK listed company we are 
not required to comply but we choose to 
do so as we strongly believe in this initiative. 
Conﬂict minerals are those minerals whose 
derivatives are Tin, T antalum, Tungsten or 
Gold. We take very seriously our obligations 
in this process and have been very proactive 
in communicating our goals to our suppliers 
for transparency and have documented 
certiﬁcation of our source tin’ s status as 
“Conﬂict-Free”. 
Alent is actively participating in the Conﬂict-
Free Tin Initiative , launched in September 
2012 by the Dutch government. Its aim is 
to establish a pilot programme to create 
demand for conﬂict-free tin from a conﬂict 
region whose economy has collapsed due 
to a series of severe internal and cross-
border conﬂicts. This initiative is designed 
to prevent an unintended boycott of 
minerals from the area due to the increased 
due diligence required when supplying 
Conﬂict Minerals from Conﬂict Countries. 
Metals Recycling
Alent moves c5% of the world’s tin in any 
given year. We continue to invest and 
expand in our capabilities to take back 
metal waste streams and responsibly 
reclaim that waste into high purity raw 
materials for reuse. Our metals recycling 
services operate the largest metals 
recycling facility in North America with 
major operations in Europe, and signiﬁcant 
operations in the Asia-Paciﬁc and South 
American regions. As an example, in 2012 
our largest recycling operation processed 
over 3.2m kg of solder scrap metal 
producing clean feed material for reuse in 
our manufacturing operations.
Green Technologies
Alent’s commitment to being a leading and 
preferred supplier of high performance 
specialty chemicals includes developing 
technologies that are socially responsible 
and eco-friendly. Our product technologies 
focus is to develop environmentally-friendly 
products, many that are lead-free, halogen-
free and hexavalent-free. Many of our 
products and processes help support our 
customers’ sustainability strategies.  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

OUR PERFORMANCE
We collaborate with our customers, 
technology partners, and the world’s 
leading manufacturers to ensure that 
our green technologies create value by 
meeting current and future performance, 
productivity, design, proﬁtability, safety, 
and regulatory requirements.
Water Treatment
Our water treatment business has long 
been committed to developing products 
and services that help our customers lower 
their environmental impact. The product 
range is formulated and packaged in an 
ecologically responsible way; our R&D 
facilities continue to ﬁnd new ways for 
businesses, commercial and domestic 
customers to reduce their carbon footprint 
through improved energy efﬁciency. Our 
product range has been independently 
veriﬁed by the Carbon Trust and has been 
recognised as environmentally sound 
with additional accreditations from KIWA, 
Belgaqua, BuildCert, DWTA, as well as 
being Energy Savings Trust recommended. 
Our products lessen the impact on the 
planet by preventing corrosion and scale 
formation as well as delivering actual 
improvements in heat transfer capability. 
Effective water treatment is essential, not 
only to minimise overall carbon emissions, 
but to conserve fuel reserves. We are also 
extending our product portfolio specially 
designed for renewable technologies, to 
increase our ability to deliver greater energy 
efﬁciency across a breadth of applications.

initiatives, please visit 
www.alent.com/Sustainability
OUR PEOPLE
It is the policy of the Group to provide 
equal opportunities for all its people. We 
are committed to meeting the labour 
rights and legislation requirements in 
each country in which we operate. The 
International Labour Organisation has 
identiﬁed eight core conventions as being 
fundamental to the rights of people in the 
workplace. We note those conventions and 
express our support for the principles.
We believe in the importance of investing in 
and developing our most valued asset: our 
people. We utilise a variety of programmes 
tailored to help them enhance their 
performance, set and achieve objectives, 
and develop their leadership skills. In 
addition, we recognise and reward their 
achievements. Our programmes are based 
on our core values: 
 customer and marketplace-oriented 
innovation;
 teamwork and collaboration; 
 enthusiasm and passion; 
 results-orientation; people-orientation; 
and
 ﬂexibility, responsiveness, and agility.
There are several critical success factors 
that underpin our strategy while driving 
our people development initiatives: 
 we must be a customer and market 
driven company that our customers rely 
on and prefer to do business with;
 we must be a company that develops 
high value, innovative products in a 
timely manner; and
 we must create an organisation that has 
deep technical competence.
To achieve success, we need to ensure that 
we work within a culture that supports these 
critical success factors. Our comprehensive 
development opportunities help introduce, 
reinforce and further strengthen each of 
our people’s special talents. Regardless of 
what stage in their career, each programme 
challenges participants to learn new and 
better ways to achieve their personal and 
professional goals.
We believe our people are our 
competitive advantage and we have 
created comprehensive development 
opportunities to introduce, reinforce and 
further strengthen their special talents. 
These opportunities include:
 EDGE (Employee Development 
Generates Excellence) Programmes;
 Six Sigma;
 health & welfare plans;
 incentive plans;
 Alent leadership programmes; and
 Alent technical training.
We believe that these initiatives are 
an important reason for our ability to 
consistently help create added value for our 
customers, allowing us to outperform many 
other competitors in our industry segments. OUR PERFORMANCE www.alent.com

Our Approach to 
Corporate Responsibility continued
Charitable work
Alent has ofﬁces throughout the world 
and we seek to engage with the local 
community in each of our regional areas. 
The needs of the communities in which 
we operate are varied and diverse and 
although there are no global initiatives, 
there are numerous ‘grassroots’ charitable 
efforts carried out within the regions. 
Examples include:
 American Cancer Society — year round 
donations are generated through 
various events including participation in 
the ‘Relay for Life’ event; 
 donations are made to soup kitchens 
through Group sponsored food drives;
 Christmas gift purchases are donated to 
multiple charities; and 
 donations have been made throughout 
the years in support of natural disasters 
such as tsunamis, earthquakes and 
hurricanes.
Employee helpline
Alent has a 24-hour Employee Business 
Concern Helpline telephone and email 
facility. This is an independent and 
conﬁdential service through which 
our people worldwide may register 
any concerns about any incorrect or 
irregular practices they perceive in Alent’s 
workplaces.
POLICY
Alent recognises that appropriate 
attention to the fulﬁlment of our corporate 
responsibilities can enhance overall 
performance. In structuring our approach 
to the various aspects of corporate 
social responsibility, we take account 
of guidelines and statements issued by 
stakeholder representatives and other 
regulatory bodies from around the world. 
Social, environmental and ethical matters 
are reviewed by the Board, including the 
impact such matters may have on the 
Group’s management of risk. 
Particular emphasis is focused on the 
following areas: 
Code of Conduct: requiring all of our 
businesses and our people to comply with 
the highest standards of legal and ethical 
behaviour. 
Health, Safety and Environment:
protecting the health and safety of our 
people, contractors, customers and the 
general public and reducing energy 
consumption and waste in our operations. 
Products and Services: developing 
innovative products and services which 
promote sustainability in our customers’ 
production processes and products. 
CODE OF CONDUCT 
The Group has a Code of Conduct 
(“the Alent Code”), which has been 
distributed throughout the Group in 
over 25 languages and by which all of 
our businesses are required to operate. 
The Alent Code emphasises the Group’s 
commitment to compliance with the 
highest standards of legal and ethical 
behaviour. The Alent Code is reproduced 
in full on the Group’s website 
www.alent.com
The Alent Code sets out clear and simple 
principles covering: Customers, Products 
and Services; Our People; Investors; 
Society and Local Communities; Health, 
Safety and the Environment; Conﬂicts of 
Interest; and Competitors. 
Long-term customer satisfaction is 
recognised as being essential to 
the attainment of Group goals, as is 
maintaining a reputation for integrity in 
all business and other dealings both with 
customers and suppliers. The Alent Code 
deﬁnes how we must compete vigorously 
and honestly.
The Group believes it can only achieve 
its goals through the efforts of its 
people. Job satisfaction requires working 
environments that motivate our people, 
together with opportunities for training 
and development to maximise personal 
potential. Wherever they work, our 
people have the right to be treated 
in good faith and with respect for the 
dignity of the individual. All Group 
companies must ensure that recruitment, 
training, promotion, career development, 
termination and similar employment-
related issues are based on individual 
ability, achievement, experience and 
conduct without regard to race, colour, 
nationality, culture, ethnic origin, religion, 
gender, sexual orientation, age, disability 
or any other reason not related to 
job performance or prohibited by 
applicable law.
The Group is committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance and 
transparent investor communication, 
as discussed in more detail in the 
“Governance” section of this report. 
Alent seeks to be a good corporate citizen 
wherever it conducts business, to observe 
all national and local laws and take into 
account regional and local concerns, 
customs and traditions. 
The Alent Code requires all of its people, 
ofﬁcers and Directors to have a duty of 
loyalty to the Group. Personal interests 
that do, may or might appear to conﬂict 
with Group interests must be avoided at 
all times. 
Approach to anti-bribery and 
corruption training 
The Alent Code and its policies on 
anti-bribery and corruption require that 
employees and others working on behalf 
of the Company do not engage in any 
form of bribery or corruption. 
Our anti-bribery and corruption 
compliance programme will be 
refreshed and relaunched throughout 
the Company and will be implemented 
through a targeted face-to-face training 
programme. An e-learning module will be 
rolled out globally. New employees, as 
relevant, will go through the training as 
part of their induction process.  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

OUR PERFORMANCE
HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT 
(“HS&E”)
Alent is committed to operating a 
sustainable, responsible organisation 
that protects the environment and the 
health and safety of those with whom we 
have relationships — our customers, our 
suppliers, our shareholders, our people, the 
environment and the communities where we 
conduct our activities. Our commitment to 
protecting the environment is focused both 
on minimising the impact of our operations 
and on making a contribution towards a 
sustainable future through the design of 
our products. Compliance with applicable 
health, safety and environmental laws and 
regulations is a fundamental obligation for all 
our businesses. We therefore monitor energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 
as Group level KPIs.
We are committed to maintaining a 
level of health, safety and environmental 
performance that is amongst the leaders 
in the specialty chemicals industry, and to 
demonstrating respect for the individual 
and the environment. We recognise that 
successful HS&E management involves 
integrating sound principles and practice 
into our daily activities so that business 
management and good performance 
levels are achieved by the collaborative 
effort of all of our people. 
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Alent’s HS&E policy and for monitoring 
its implementation. Executives and 
line managers at all levels are directly 
responsible through the normal 
management structure for HS&E matters in 
the operations under their control.
Particular emphasis is focused on the 
following areas:
Regulatory compliance: compliance 
with air, water and waste emissions, and 
industrial hygiene criteria;
Health and Safety performance:
protecting the health and safety of our 
people, contractors, customers and the 
general public; and
Environmental performance: reducing 
energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Alent’s 23 manufacturing locations are 
certiﬁed to ISO 14001, the international 
standard for environmental management 
systems. In addition, 19 of our operations 
are certiﬁed to OHSAS 18001, the 
international occupational health and 
safety management system. Certiﬁcation 
to these international standards is not 
appropriate for all facilities, particularly 
smaller ones and those with very limited 
environmental impact.
Regulatory actions against Alent 
companies have been at a low level 
for several years. This is indicative of 
the emphasis on continuous HS&E 
performance improvement across the 
industry in relation to statutory obligations.
Like many manufacturers, some of our 
operations have potential environmental 
liabilities because of past operations 
at their current or former sites. Where 
remediation is required, we work with 
external specialists and with government 
authorities to ensure that remediation is 
conducted effectively and efﬁciently.
REACH
REACH is a European Union regulation 
concerning the Regulation, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals. 
The regulation came into force in 2007 and 
replaces a number of European directives 
and regulations with a single system. 
The REACH Regulation places greater 
responsibility on industry to manage 
risk and to provide safety information 
on chemicals used in its manufacturing 
processes. Manufacturers and importers 
are required to gather information on the 
properties of their chemical substances, 
and to register the information in a 
central database run by the European 
Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki. The 
Agency acts as the central point in the 
REACH system; it manages the databases 
necessary to operate the system, co-
ordinates the in-depth evaluation of 
suspicious chemicals and builds up a 
public database in which consumers and 
professionals can ﬁnd information on 
hazardous materials. 
All of the Alent operations involved in 
the manufacturing of chemicals have 
complied with the regulatory requirements 
of this EU initiative and continue to do so. 
We are also working intensively on the 
development and testing of alternative 
less hazardous substances for use in our 
electroplating processes.
RoHS
The Restriction of the Use of certain 
Hazardous Substances in Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment Directive was 
transposed into UK law on 2 January 2013. 
As a supplier to the electronics industry, 
our products must conform to the RoHS 
regulations and all of our products are 
certiﬁed to those standards.  OUR PERFORMANCE www.alent.com

Our Approach to 
Corporate Responsibility continued
HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE
Alent’s operations involve the normal 
health and safety risks associated with 
manufacturing and other activities in 
the countries we operate. Alent’s HS&E 
management programmes are designed 
to be forward-looking in the identiﬁcation, 
management and mitigation of HS&E risks.
We utilise audits, inspections and risk analyses 
to assess and continually improve our safety 
programmes. Both management system and 
compliance audits are performed and results 
shared across the organisation.
We developed a new communications 
vehicle in 2012, to address common safety 
concerns identiﬁed through incident 
reports and internal audits. Safety Bulletins 
serve as a concise platform to convey 
critical safety information and programmes 
that can be deployed throughout Alent in 
a timely manner. Safety Bulletins released 
in 2012 covered topics such as transferring 
and dispensing hazardous materials, 
incident reporting and investigation, and 
management of change.
Global incident Rate
Alent uses a number of metrics to evaluate 
health and safety performance globally. 
All Alent facilities report injuries in 
accordance with United States Department 
of Labor Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) record keeping 
rules. Our incident rates are compared to 
NAICS 35 — the chemical manufacturing 
incident rates from the US Dept. of Labor 
— Bureau of Labor Statistics.
T otal Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) measures 
the number of recordable injuries/illnesses 
per 100 workers. In 2012, Alent achieved 
a TRIR of 0.64, a 12.3% improvement over 
2011. Lost Work Incident Rate (LWIR) tracks 
the number of injuries/illnesses per 100 
workers with one day or more away from 
work. Alent’ s 2012 LWIR was 0.30, a 31.8% 
improvement over 2011. OSHA data for 2012 
has yet to be published.

ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE
Energy Consumption
Our manufacturing processes are not 
energy intensive and do not produce large 
quantities of air emissions. Alent operates a 
programme aimed at reducing energy use 
and its associated emissions of greenhouse 
gases (GHG). This programme trains our 
people to understand energy use and 
sets speciﬁc annual goals to reduce our 
energy consumption. We also leverage our 
extensive Six Sigma Programme to identify 
and execute projects around the reduction 
of energy consumption at our facilities 
around the world.
In 2012, Alent consumed 260,290 million 
Btu (British Thermal Units) (MM Btu) 
of energy. Of this, 82,397 MM Btu was 
electricity use (indirect energy). The 
remainder of our energy use consisted of 
natural gas and fuel oil (direct energy). On 
an absolute basis, our energy consumption 
was down 6.9% from 2011. 
GHG Emissions
Alent’s methodology for measuring GHG 
emissions follows the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocols of the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development and the World 
Resource Institute. Alent reports direct and 
indirect GHG emissions in terms of CO
2
-
equivalents (CO
2
-e). Direct GHG emissions 
are those that occur from stationary and 
mobile sources that Alent owns or controls. 
These emissions are also referred to as 
“Scope 1” emissions. Indirect emissions, or 
“Scope 2” emissions, are related to the use 
or purchase of electricity.
In 2012, Alent had 8,881 metric tons of 
direct and 15,660 metric tons of indirect 
GHG emissions. On an absolute basis, our 
total GHG emissions decreased 7.3% from 
2011. Similar to energy, this reduction was 
achieved through the implementation of 
energy and GHG reduction projects. OUR STRATEGY www.alent.com

adding, consumable products and 
services;
 our products constitute a small fraction of 
our customers’ costs, while signiﬁcantly

STOCK CODE: ALNT
OUR STRATEGY 
OUR STRATEGY
The key elements of our strategy are to:
Focus on high growth end-markets
The electronics market is forecast to 
experience strong growth in terms of 
value, but even higher growth in terms 
of unit volumes, which are driven in 
part by the trend towards multiple 
electronic devices per individual (e.g. 
mobile phone and tablet). We have 
leading positions in the smartphone and 
tablet markets in which strong growth 
is expected to continue. Unit growth is 
the more important driver of our growth, 
and, therefore, we are well positioned 
to beneﬁt from this trend. Similarly, the 
global automotive market is expected 
to produce over 100 million vehicles 
by 2015, which represents a CAGR of 
approximately 6%, from 2011-2015. There 
is a trend in the automotive industry 
towards increased electronic content 
in cars, and increased use of functional 
coatings for both decorative and anti-
corrosion applications, which is beneﬁting 
both of our strategic businesses. We also 
intend to further enhance our presence 
in key geographical growth regions and 
markets.
Further develop new markets and 
products
With our global presence and leading 
technologies, we are constantly 
identifying new opportunities in high 
growth complementary segments such as 
solar and LED. Although these markets 
are still at relatively early stages of their 
development, our Board believes they 
could provide signiﬁcant additional 
sources of revenue in the future. The 
opportunity comes both from leveraging 
existing products and technologies 
in these new markets and through 
developing new product solutions, 
as well as potentially through bolt-on 
acquisitions.
Expand our value-add and OEM sales 
strategy
We continue to focus on developing 
the value sales competencies across 
all our people so as to realise the full 
margin potential of the products and 
technologies we offer. In addition, 
we intend to increase the service 
element of revenue through technical 
process support and customer training 
academies, which improves margins 
and further deepens the customer 
relationship. We will continue to 
leverage our strong OEM relationships 
to further increase OEM qualiﬁcation 
and speciﬁcation of our specialty 
material chemistries and technologies.
Continue to develop higher-margin 
products and improve mix and 
operational efﬁciencies
We have pursued a strategy of moving 
away from lower-margin commoditised 
products (e.g. solder bar) and focusing on 
higher-margin, more innovative products 
such as novel alloys, damascene copper 
additives, solder preforms, immersion 
tin printed circuit board surface ﬁnishes, 
wafer plating, and plating on plastics. This 
process will continue, and the constant 
evolution through product innovation 
means that further opportunities for 
mix improvement will arise. In addition, 
we plan to further roll-out and develop 
operational excellence programmes 
increasing productivity and reducing costs. 
We have been incorporating Six Sigma 
practices into our operations since 2001.
Further develop our technology and 
innovation leadership
We have invested signiﬁcantly in R&D 
facilities and will continue to do so to 
ensure that we remain able to front-
run emerging trends, and maintain 
our leadership position in terms of 
innovation and product development 
in our market niches. Indeed, R&D is 
critical to our continued success. The 
drive for smaller, smarter and faster 
electronics in particular, and the pace 
of change, means that only those 
players with the required scale and 
technical expertise are able successfully 
to take advantage of these market 
opportunities. Historically, we have been 
at the forefront of market developments 
and we remain conﬁdent that we will 
continue to be successful in leading the 
world in key new developments. OUR STRATEGY www.alent.com

Corporate Governance
This report describes the Company’s 
corporate governance structure and 
explains how the Company applies 
the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in 2010 (“the Code”). 
The Company is committed to ensuring 
that the highest standards of corporate 
governance are maintained and intends 
to comply fully with the main and 
supporting principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. For the period from 
incorporation to listing on 19 December 
2012 the Company did not comply with 
the provisions of the Combined Code, 
as this was ultimately the responsibility 
of the Board of Cookson Group plc. With 
the exception of undertaking a Board 
evaluation, which has not been possible 
in the time period, the Company has 
complied with the Code from the date 
of listing.
LEADERSHIP
The Role of the Board
The Board is appointed by shareholders, 
who are the owners of the Company. The 
Board’s principal responsibility is to act 
in the best interests of the shareholders 
as a whole, within the legal framework 
of the Companies Act 2006. Ultimate 
responsibility for the management and 
long-term success of Alent rests with the 
Board of Directors. The Board focuses 
primarily upon strategic, policy and 
governance issues and is responsible 
for the Company’s long-term success. It 
approves the Company’s strategy, oversees 
the allocation of resources, approves the 
Company’s operating budgets which are 
normally proposed by the Chief Executive 
and monitors the performance of the 
Company against them. The Board is also 
responsible for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the key risks faced by 
the Company, and for establishing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems of 
internal controls. It has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved to it and delegates 
certain matters to committees as set out in 
the Report. In addition, the Non-executive 
Directors constructively challenge the 
Executive Directors and review their 
performance. The Board reviews, at least 
annually, the performance of the Chairman.
The Roles of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive and Division of 
Responsibilities
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive has 
been agreed by the Board and is set out 
in writing. 
The Chairman leads the Board, promoting 
a culture of openness, challenge and 
debate and ensuring its effectiveness and 
high standards of corporate governance 
to safeguard the interests of shareholders. 
The Chairman facilitates and encourages 
open communication and constructive 
working relationships between the 
executive and Non-executive Directors and 
provides overall guidance to the Executive 
Directors and senior management.
The Chairman in conjunction with 
the Nominations Committee is also 
responsible for Board succession 
planning and has ultimate responsibility 
for communication and dialogue with 
shareholders, together with ensuring 
that the Board acts in the best interest of 
shareholders taken as a whole. 
The Chairman in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary and Executive 
Directors sets the agenda for Board 
meetings and ensures that all Board and 
Committee members receive accurate, 
timely and clear information prior to 
meetings. A clear structure for the 
operation of the Board and its Committees 
is in place. The Chairman meets routinely 
with the Chief Executive, the Finance 
Director and the Company Secretary 
to discuss relevant matters. The Board 
considers that the Chairman is able to, and 
does, devote sufﬁcient time to his duties 
at Alent.
The Chief Executive has overall 
responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the business, the 
performance for which he is accountable 
and upon which he reports to the Board. 
He has the lead role in developing 
the Company’s strategic direction for 
consideration and approval by the Board, 
and for the implementation of the agreed 
strategy. The Chief Executive is responsible 
on a day-to-day basis for, and oversees, 
the Company’s performance in safety, 
health and environmental matters.
The Chief Executive is supported by the 
Finance Director in the provision to the 
Board of high quality ﬁnancial information 
on the company’s performance.
The biographical details of the Chairman 
and details of his relevant experience are 
set out on page 44.
The Role of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors have speciﬁc 
executive responsibilities, of which the 
Chief Executive’s are set out above. The 
Chief Executive provides leadership 
to the management team, sets the 
culture, standards, ethics and values 
of the Company, and is responsible for 
management development and succession 
planning within the Company. The Finance 
Director has particular responsibility for 
the accuracy and completeness of the 
Company’s ﬁnancial reporting, for treasury, 
tax and risk management, and for internal 
ﬁnancial controls.
Executive Directors are not members of 
the Board Committees, although they may 
be invited to attend.
The biographical details of the Executive 
Directors and details of their relevant 
experience are set out on page 44.
The Role of Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors bring a 
wide range of skills and international 
experience to the Board. Their role is to 
understand the business and its markets, 
to help shape and develop strategy, and 
to challenge constructively and support 
the management. Additionally, their 
role is also to satisfy themselves with 
regard to the integrity of the Company’s 
ﬁnancial information and to ensure that 
the Company’s ﬁnancial controls and 
risk management systems are robust 
and defensible. Collectively they hold 
or have held senior positions in their 
chosen ﬁelds and contribute a wide 
range of international experience and 
objective perspective to the Board. They 
represent a strong, independent element 
on the Board. As chairman of the Board 
committees, the independent Non- Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

executive Directors also fulﬁl important 
leadership roles. As members of the 
Board committees, the independent 
Non-executive Directors will bring focus 
on governance and succession planning, 
internal controls, risk management and 
remuneration policies.
The biographical details of the Non-
executive Directors and details of their 
relevant experience are set out on pages 
44 to 45.
The Senior Independent Director
The Board nominates one of the Non-
executive Directors to act as Senior 
Independent Director and provide an 
alternative contact at Board level, other 
than the Chairman, to whom shareholder 
matters can be addressed. The Senior 
Independent Director, when necessary, 
supports the Chairman and the other 
Non-executive Directors on Company 
related matters. He will act as a sounding 
board for the Chairman and, should it be 
required, can act as an intermediary for any 
concerns of other Non-executive Directors. 
There is a written job speciﬁcation for the 
role which will be reviewed annually by 
the Nomination Committee. The Senior 
Independent Director is responsible for 
undertaking the annual evaluation of the 
Chairman’s performance, leading the 
recruitment process for a new Chairman 
while ensuring an orderly succession 
process. Mark Williamson is the Senior 
Independent Director.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary supports the 
Chairman on corporate governance 
matters. Together with the Chairman he 
is responsible to the Board in respect 
of compliance with Board procedures, 
ensuring a timely ﬂow of information and 
for the setting of the annual programme 
of Board and Committee meetings 
and their agendas. Furthermore, he 
has responsibility, via the Chairman, for 
ensuring that the Board is kept up to date 
on legislative, regulatory and governance 
matters and developments and that all 
induction and professional development 
needs are met. 
The Company Secretary ensures that there 
is an appropriate level of communication 
between the Board and its Committees 
and between senior management and the 
Non-executive Directors. 
The Company Secretary is secretary 
to each of the board committees. All 
Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary.
Board meetings
The Board is presently scheduled to 
convene formally on eight occasions 
during 2013 and will hold any number of 
ad hoc committee meetings to consider 
non-routine business as necessary. In 
addition, it is envisaged that the Chairman 
and the other Non-executive Directors 
will meet routinely on their own without 
the executive Directors present, and, at 
least once each year the Non-executive 
Directors will meet without the Chairman 
being present to discuss matters such as 
the Chairman’s performance.
Speciﬁc matters reserved for the Board, 
which will be reviewed annually, include: 
reviewing Company and divisional 
performance; approving signiﬁcant 
transactions including acquisitions, 
divestments, capital expenditure and 
changes to the Company’s capital 
structure; setting and approving the 
Company’s strategy and annual budget; 
approving the Company’s ﬁnancing and 
treasury policies; declaration of dividends;

relating to the Demerger. No formal Board meetings were held between the listing of the Company on 19 December 2012 and 
31 December 2012 so no table of attendance is included. From January 2013 a normal schedule of Board meetings has commenced.
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The Composition of the Board
The Board currently has eight Directors, 
comprising the Non-executive Chairman, 
Peter Hill CBE; the Chief Executive, Steve 
Corbett; the Finance Director, David Egan; 
and ﬁve Non-executive Directors, Dr Emma 
Fitzgerald, Lars Förberg, Nöel Harwerth, 
Jan Oosterveld and Mark Williamson. 
Simon O’Hara serves as Company 
Secretary. All of the Non-executive Directors 
are considered to be independent, with the 
exception of Lars Förberg.
The Board seeks to ensure that both it 
and its Committees have the appropriate 
range of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independence to enable them to discharge 
their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. Alent is privileged to have a 
Board of Directors with such international 
business backgrounds and a range of diverse 
skills, experience and nationalities. This 
diversity will be invaluable in developing the 
Company’ s business strategy and will enable 
such a global manufacturing business to be 
effectively governed. 
The Board considers its size to be appropriate 
for the requirements of the business. 
No one other than Committee Chairman and 
members of the Committees are entitled 
to be present at meetings of the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees, 
but others may attend by invitation.
The Board considers the majority of the 
Non-executive Directors to be independent 
of management and free from any business 
or other relationship which could affect the 
exercise of their independent judgement. 
The Chairman satisﬁed the independence 
criteria on his appointment to the Board. 
Dr Emma Fitzgerald, Nöel Harwerth, Jan 
Oosterveld and Mark Williamson have 
been determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement. 
Lars Förberg is not considered to be 
independent as he is managing partner of 
Cevian Capital which holds 20% of Alent’s 
issued ordinary share capital. 
Mr Williamson currently serves as Senior 
Independent Director.
Appointments to the Board and its 
Committees
The Nominations Committee leads the 
process for Board appointments and 
makes recommendations to the Board. 
The Board through the Nominations 
Committee follows a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure based on objective 
criteria for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board. The Committee 
considers any proposed recruitment in 
the context of the Company’s strategic 
priorities. Board appointments are made 
on merit. Non-executive appointees 
are required to demonstrate that they 
have sufﬁcient time to devote to the 
role. The Nominations Committee is 
also responsible for reviewing the Board 
succession recognising the importance of 
recruiting Non-executive Directors with the 
necessary technical skills and knowledge 
relevant to the work of its committees. 
Further information on the Nominations 
Committee is set out in the Nominations 
Committee Report on page 55. OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

Corporate Governance continued
Time commitment of the Chairman and 
Non-executive Directors
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
each have a letter of appointment which 
sets out the terms and conditions of 
their directorship. An indication of the 
anticipated time commitment is provided 
in the recruitment role speciﬁcation, and 
their letters of appointment provide details 
of the meetings that they are expected to 
attend, along with indicating the need to 
accommodate travelling time (particularly 
for overseas trips) and to set aside 
sufﬁcient time to prepare for meetings 
and to regularly refresh and update their 
skills and knowledge. All Directors agree 
to commit sufﬁcient time for the proper 
performance of their responsibilities and 
understand that this will vary from year 
to year depending on the Company’s 
activities. Directors are expected to attend 
all Board meetings and any additional 
meetings (including Committee meetings) 
as required. Directors’ other signiﬁcant 
commitments are disclosed to the Board 
at the time of their appointment and they 
are required to notify the Board of any 
subsequent changes. The Company has 
reviewed the availability of the Non-
executive Directors and considers that 
each of them is able to, and in practice 
does, devote the necessary amount of 
time to the Company’s business. 
Induction and training
The Company Secretary is tasked 
with ensuring that a comprehensive 
induction programme is provided to 
all new Directors. This includes visits 
to manufacturing and other Company 
facilities, meetings with key Company 
executives and introductions to the 
Company’s principal external advisers, as 
appropriate. New Directors are advised of 
their legal and other duties and obligations 
as Directors of a listed company. 
Reference materials are provided, 
including information about the Board, its 
committees, Directors’ duties, procedures 
for dealing in the Company’s shares and 
other regulatory and governance matters. 
The Chairman will meet with Directors on 
an on going basis to review any training 
and development needs. In addition, 
the Directors are provided with details of 
seminars and training courses relevant 
to their role. They are encouraged to 
attend these as they consider appropriate 
and are supported by the Company in 
so doing. Where a general training need 
is identiﬁed, in-house training will be 
provided to the entire Board. 
Information
The Board has in place processes to ensure 
that it is supplied in a timely manner with 
information of an appropriate quality 
to enable it to adequately discharge 
its duties. Papers are provided to the 
Directors in advance of the relevant Board 
or committee meeting to enable them to 
make further enquiries about any matters 
prior to the meeting should they so wish. 
This also allows Directors who are unable 
to attend to submit views in advance of the 
meeting.
The Company Secretary oversees the 
distribution of these papers and ensures 
that there is an appropriate level of 
communication between the Board 
and its committees and between senior 
management and the Non-executive 
Directors. He also keeps the Board 
informed of relevant developments 
in corporate governance. The Chief 
Executive provides, as a matter of routine, 
a written update on important business 
issues between meetings and invites the 
views of the Directors on these.
Support
There is an agreed procedure in place to 
support Directors, in the furtherance of 
their duties, to take independent legal 
advice if necessary, at the Company’s 
expense.
Performance evaluation
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Code, the Board of Alent plc intends to 
undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation 
of its own performance and effectiveness 
and to assess the performance of its 
committees and individual Board 
members on an annual basis. Given 
that the Company was only listed on 
19 December 2012, no evaluation process 
was conducted in 2012. The Board will 
consider the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the 
Company on the Board, its diversity, 
including gender, how the Board works 
together as a unit and other factors 
relevant to its effectiveness.
The Chairman will be responsible for and 
will lead the evaluation process and will 
be assisted by the Company Secretary. 
In line with best practice, the Company 
will engage an external facilitator for the 
Board evaluation exercise as appropriate in 
accordance with its requirements to do so. 
The Senior Independent Director will be 
responsible for the performance evaluation 
of the Chairman.
Re-election of Directors
The Code recommends that all Directors 
of FTSE 350 companies be subject to 
annual election by shareholders. All 
the Directors will therefore be offering 
themselves for election at this year’s AGM, 
with the biographical details of each of 
the Directors, including details of their 
other directorships and relevant skills and 
experience set out in the 2013 Notice of 
AGM. The Board believes that each of the 
Directors standing for election is effective 
and demonstrates commitment to their 
respective roles. Accordingly, the Board 
recommends that shareholders approve 
the resolutions to be proposed at the 
2013 AGM relating to the election of the 
Directors.
The current policy is for Non-executive 
Directors to serve on the Board for nine 
years, with review at the end of three and 
six years, subject to mutual agreement and 
annual performance evaluation.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by section 236 
of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
have been granted Qualifying Third Party 
Indemnity Provisions by the Company. 
The indemnities for Directors of Alent 
plc have been in force since the date of 
appointment on 31 October 2012. 
Directors’ conﬂicts of interest

for Directors to review regularly their  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

interests and to deal with situations where 
a Director reports any conﬂicts of interest. 
Any conﬂict situation reported to the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary 
is considered by the Board based on its 
particular facts. Any authorisations given 
to a Director who has a conﬂict situation 
are recorded in the Board minutes and in 
a register of Directors’ conﬂicts which is 
reviewed annually by the Board. The Board 
believes that the systems it has in place for 
reporting Situational Conﬂicts will operate 
effectively.
ACCOUNTABILITY
The Audit Committee
The membership of the Audit Committee 
is set out on page 53. The Audit 
Committee report, which summarises the 
terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
and describes its work in discharging 
its responsibilities, is set out on pages 
53 to 55.
Financial and business reporting
In its reporting to shareholders the Board 
recognises its responsibility to present 
a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and 
prospects. The Business Review on pages 
14 to 25 sets out explanations for the 
basis on which the Company generates or 
preserves value over the longer term and 
the strategy for delivering the objectives of 
the Company. 
Directors’ and Auditor’s Responsibility
A statement of the Directors’ responsibility 
for preparing the Annual Report and 
accounts is included on pages 74 to 75.
A statement by the Auditor, KPMG LLP , 
setting out its reporting responsibilities is 
included on page 78. 
Going concern
The Directors consider that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future and accordingly, they have adopted 
a going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements of the Group and the 
Company.
Risk management and assessment and 
internal control systems
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the establishment and maintenance of the 
Company’s system of risk management 
and internal control, and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. This system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risks 
facing the Company and safeguard assets. 
No system of internal control can provide 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Company’s 
system is designed to provide the 
Directors with reasonable assurance that 
any problems are identiﬁed on a timely 
basis and are dealt with appropriately. 
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Code, the Directors conﬁrm that they 
have reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal control and 
that the necessary actions have been 
taken to remedy and control any control 
weaknesses identiﬁed during the year. 
Since the date of this review there have 
been no signiﬁcant changes in internal 
controls or other matters which could 
signiﬁcantly affect them. The key risks 
facing the Company are set out on 
pages 26 to 29.
There is a continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing any 
signiﬁcant risks faced by Alent. Company 
management operates a risk management 
process designed to identify the key 
risks facing each business and reports to 
the Board on how those risks are being 
managed. As a basis for this report, each 
of the Company’s major business units 
produces a “risk map” which identiﬁes 
their key risks and assesses the likelihood 
of those risks occurring, their impact if they 
do occur and the actions being taken to 
manage those risks to a desired level. As a 
new company, the Board expects to further 
develop its risk management structure 
and processes during 2013, as well as its 
procedures, and embedded processes 
in respect of its Ethics, Health, Safety, 
Environmental and Sustainability activities. 
Current activities are described in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility Review, on 
pages 30 to 35. At Board level, the Chief 
Executive currently takes the lead on these 
matters.
The Board reviews the role of insurance 
and other measures used in managing 
risks across the Company, receives regular 
reports on any major issues that have 
arisen during the year and makes an 
annual assessment of how the risks have 
changed over the period under review.
The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal controls, 
including ﬁnancial, operational and 
compliance controls, and risk management 
systems. The key features of the 
Company’s system of internal controls 
include:
Strategy and ﬁnancial reporting
The Company operates a comprehensive 
strategic planning and forecasting process, 
with an annual budget approved by 
the Board. Monthly operating ﬁnancial 
information is reported against this budget 
and key trends and variances analysed. 
Action is then taken as appropriate. 
The Board will also use one of its meetings 
in 2013 speciﬁcally to consider and 
review the Company’s strategy and its 
implementation, and its future prospects.
Company accounting policies and 
procedures are formulated and 
disseminated to all Company operations, 
covering the application of accounting 
standards and the maintenance of 
accounting records and key ﬁnancial 
control procedures. 
Operational controls 
Each operating company, including 
the Divisional and Corporate ofﬁces, 
maintains internal controls and procedures 
appropriate to its structure and business 
environment, whilst complying with 
Company policies on items such as the 
authorisation of capital expenditure, 
treasury transactions and the management 
of intellectual property. 
In addition, the Company’s ﬁnancial 
reporting process, including the 
preparation of the Company’s consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, incorporates the 
dissemination and use of common 
accounting policies and procedures and 
ﬁnancial reporting software.  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com
52
Corporate Governance continued
The Board considers signiﬁcant ﬁnancing 
and investment decisions concerning 
the Company, including the giving of 
guarantees and indemnities, and monitors 
policy and control mechanisms for 
managing treasury risk. 
Reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal controls
The internal control system is monitored 
and supported by the Company’s internal 
audit function. This function assists 
management and the Board in the 
effective discharge of their responsibility 
for internal control by conducting reviews 
of Alent’s businesses and reporting 
objectively both on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control in place and as to whether 
those businesses are in compliance 
with applicable Company policies and 
procedures. The Audit Committee receives 
reports from the Company Head of Internal 
Audit on a regular basis and reports to the 
Board on the results of its review. 
As part of the Board’s process for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control, it delegates the following matters 
to the Audit Committee to be carried out 
during the year: 
 review of external and internal audit 
work plans; 
 consideration of reports from 
management, internal audit and 
external audit on the system of internal 
control and any signiﬁcant control 
weaknesses; and 
 discussions with management on the 
actions taken on problem areas 
identiﬁed by Board members, in 
internal audit reports or in external 
audit management letters. 
At the year-end, following the review by 
the Audit Committee of internal ﬁnancial 
controls and of the processes covering 
other controls, the Board evaluates the 
results of the internal control and risk 
management procedures conducted 
by senior management. This includes a 
self-certiﬁcation exercise by which senior 
ﬁnancial and operational management 
throughout the Company certify the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls within the businesses for which 
they are responsible, together with their 
compliance throughout the year with the 
Company’s policies and procedures. 
Executive compensation and risk
All the independent Non-executive 
Directors serve on both the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. They are 
therefore able to bring their experience 
and knowledge of the activities of each 
Committee to bear when considering 
the critical judgements of the other. This 
means that the Directors are in a position 
to consider carefully the impact of incentive 
arrangements on the Company’s risk proﬁle 
and to ensure the Company’s remuneration 
policy and programme is structured so as 
to accord with the long-term objectives and 
risk appetite of the Company. 
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board believes that it is a priority 
to communicate with shareholders and 
uses various methods to reach as many 
shareholders as possible. There are 
programmes for the Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and the Head of Investor 
Relations to meet with the Company’s 
major institutional investors in the UK, the 
US and Continental Europe. The Board 
also seeks to ensure effective engagement 
with shareholders through the Company’s 
regular communications, the AGM, as 
well as through Capital Markets Days to 
provide the Company’s stakeholders with 
more detailed insight into the Company’s 
future strategy and investment proposition 
and other investor relations activities.
In addition, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee commenced, 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013, meetings 
with key institutional shareholders and 
their representative bodies to discuss 
the proposals for the Company’s new 
remuneration policy, and further meetings 
will be held during the year. 
The Chairman has met with shareholders 
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2013 and he, and also 
the Senior Independent Director, will each 
seek separate meetings with shareholders 
during the course of the year.
The Company’ s investor relations 
programme will be managed by the 
Chief Executive and Finance Director. 
The majority of meetings with investors 
will be led by them, but the Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and other 
Directors will also be available to meet with 
signiﬁcant shareholders as appropriate. At 
these meetings, investors will be offered 
the opportunity to meet with the Chairman 
or the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director.
The Company will report its ﬁnancial 
results to shareholders twice a year, 
with the publication of its Annual and 
Half-Yearly Financial Reports and will 
issue two further trading updates each 
year with the publication of its Interim 
Management Statements. In conjunction 
with these announcements, presentations 
or teleconference calls will be held with 
institutional investors and stock market 
analysts. Recordings of these will be made 
available on the Company’s website 
www.alent.com along with hard copies of 
any presentation materials issued. 
Regular updates on shareholder issues 
and discussions will be provided to the 
Board. Board members will continue to 
receive copies of signiﬁcant analysts’ notes 
issued on the Company. All Directors 
are expected to attend the Company’s 
AGM, providing shareholders with the 
opportunity to question them about issues 
relating to the Company, either during the 
meeting or informally.
Annual General Meeting
Communication with private shareholders 
is largely through the AGM, which is held 
at a central London location. 
Shareholders are given the opportunity 
to ask questions of the Board and the 
Chairman of each Board Committee 
during the AGM and to meet the Directors 
informally. Separate resolutions are 
proposed at the AGM on a poll for each 
item of business and shareholders are 
asked to vote “for”, “against” or “vote 
withheld” on each resolution. Votes are 
counted and an announcement conﬁrming 
whether each resolution was passed at the 
AGM is made through the London Stock  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Members
Mark Williamson (Committee Chairman)
Dr Emma Fitzgerald
Nöel Harwerth
Jan Oosterveld
The Audit Committee members are the 
independent Non-executive Directors, 
other than the Board Chairman. The Audit 
Committee is chaired by Mr Williamson, a 
qualiﬁed accountant. The Code requires 
the Board to be satisﬁed that at least one 
member of the Committee has recent 
and relevant ﬁnancial experience, and 
the Board considers that Mr Williamson 
possesses the requisite ﬁnancial 
experience to meet this requirement. 
The Board also considers that the Audit 
Committee members together possess the 
necessary commercial, ﬁnancial and audit 
expertise to help them assess effectively 
the complex accounting, audit and risk 
issues they have to address. 
At the invitation of the Audit Committee 
Chairman, the non independent Non-
executive Director Lars Förberg, the 
Chairman of the Company, the Chief 
Executive, the Finance Director and 
the Company’s Auditor, KPMG LLP , 
will regularly attend meetings. Other 
executives, including in particular the 
Group Financial Controller and the Head 
of Internal Audit, will be invited to attend 
as and when appropriate. It is envisaged 
that the Audit Committee will meet 
regularly with the Company’s External 
Auditor and the Company Head of Internal 
Audit without any executives being 
present.
The Audit Committee operates under 
formal terms of reference that will be 
reviewed on a regular basis. These terms 
of reference, which are available on the 
Company’s website, www.alent.com,
authorise the Committee to obtain outside 
legal or other independent professional 
advice at the cost of the Company and to 
secure the attendance at Audit Committee 
meetings of other parties with relevant 
experience and expertise should it be 
considered necessary. 
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reports the outcome of the Audit 
Committee meetings to the Board and all 
members of the Board receive the agenda, 
papers and minutes of Audit Committee 
meetings.
Role and responsibilities
The primary role and responsibilities of the 
Audit Committee are:
 monitoring the integrity of the 
Company’s Half-Year and Annual 
Financial Statements, the Interim 
Management Statements and any other 
formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s ﬁnancial performance;
 reviewing the process whereby the 
Board assesses the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems;
 establishing and reviewing procedures 
for detecting fraud, and systems and 
controls for the prevention of bribery, 
along with overseeing the Company’s 
arrangements for employees to raise 
concerns about possible wrongdoing in 
ﬁnancial reporting or other matters;
 monitoring and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function;
 monitoring and reviewing the Auditor’s 
independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness, taking into account 
professional and regulatory 
requirements;
 making recommendations to the Board 
on the appointment and dismissal of 
the Auditor and approving the 
remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the Auditor; and
 helping to strengthen the independent 
position of the Auditor by providing a 
direct channel of communication 
between it and the Non-executive 
Directors.
The Committee’s members met informally, 
including with the Auditor, prior to the 
Company’s listing on 19 December 2012 
to review and where necessary approve 
various matters relating to the Demerger. 
No Audit Committee meetings were held 
between 19 and 31 December 2012.
The Audit Committee expects to discharge 
its responsibilities as follows:
 review the Company’s Half-Yearly and 
Annual Results Announcement/Annual 
Report and Accounts, respectively. In 
doing so, the Committee will receive 
reports from management on 
signiﬁcant aspects of the Company’s 
ﬁnancial statements, including matters 
requiring signiﬁcant management 
judgement, asset impairment valuation, 
amounts reported at fair value, 
off-balance sheet items and contingent 
liabilities, and reports from the Auditor 
identifying any accounting or 
judgemental issues thereon requiring 
its attention;
 receive reports from the Company 
Head of Internal Audit covering, 
amongst other things, the work 
undertaken by the internal audit 
function and management responses to 
proposals made in the audit reports 
issued by the function during the year. 
The Committee will also review the 
results of an assessment which will be 
undertaken of the performance of the 
internal audit function and the 
Committee will review and approve the 
internal audit plan, submitted by the 
Company Head of Internal Audit;
 review periodically the Auditor’s control 
ﬁndings;
 review the results of an assessment 
which will be undertaken of the 
performance of the Auditor, based 
upon feedback received from the 
Company’s corporate and divisional 
ﬁnance management; 
 review and agree the audit plan 
presented by the Auditor, which will 
detail the approach and scope of the 
work to be undertaken and the level of 
fees to be charged;  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

operated by management designed to 
identify the key risks facing each 
business and how those risks were

Appointment of Auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible 
for making recommendations to the 
Board in relation to the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the Auditor. 
In undertaking this duty, the Committee 
takes into consideration a number of 
factors concerning the Auditor and the 
Company’s current activity, including: 
 the quality both of reports provided by 
the Auditor to the Audit Committee 
and the Board, and of advice given; 
 the level of understanding 
demonstrated of the Company’s 
businesses;
 the independence of the Auditor, in 
light of the provision of non-audit 
services;
 the objectivity of the Auditor’s views on 
the controls throughout the Company; 
 its ability to coordinate a global audit, 
working to tight deadlines; 
 the cost-competitiveness of the Auditor 
in relation to the audit costs of 
comparable UK companies; 
 the tenure of the incumbent Auditor; 
and
 the periodic rotation of the senior audit 
management assigned to the audit of 
the Company. 
In addition, the Audit Committee considers 
external reviews of the performance and 
quality of the Auditor, including:
 the Annual Report issued by the Audit 
Inspection Unit of the Financial Reporting 
Council on the work of the Auditor; and
 the Auditor’s own annual Transparency 
Report.
KPMG LLP has been appointed as the 
Company’s Auditor. The Company, at 
a time considered appropriate, will 
undertake a review of the ongoing 
provision of audit services with a view to 
complying with the Code requirement 
to put the external audit contract out to 
tender at least every ten years. The Audit 
Committee is recommending the Auditor 
for reappointment at the AGM in 2013.
The terms on which the Auditor is 
engaged do not include any contractual 
obligations which would prevent the 
Directors appointing a different audit ﬁrm 
should this be considered appropriate.
Independence and objectivity of Auditor 
The Audit Committee is cognisant of the 
need to ensure that the independence 
and objectivity of the Auditor is continually 
maintained. It has put in place safeguards 
to ensure that the independence of the 
external audit is not compromised. These 
safeguards include:
 seeking ongoing conﬁrmation that the 
Auditor is independent of the Company 
in its own professional judgement; and
 considering all the relationships 
between the Auditor and the Company, 
including those relating to the provision 
of non-audit services and whether these 
impair, or appear to impair, the 
Auditor’s judgement or independence.
The Audit Committee monitors the other 
services being provided to the Company 
by the Auditor. The Company has a policy 
governing the Company-wide conduct of 
non-audit work by the Auditor to ensure 
that this does not impair its independence 
or objectivity. The Auditor is prohibited 
from performing services where it:
 may be required to audit its own work;
 would participate in activities that 
would normally be undertaken by 
management;
 is remunerated through a “success fee” 
structure; or
 acts in an advocacy role for the Company.
The policy sets out the categories of 
work that the Auditor is prohibited from 
undertaking. Other than these, the 
Company does not impose an automatic 
prohibition on the Auditor undertaking 
non-audit work. The Auditor is eligible for 
selection to provide non-audit services 
that are not, or are not perceived to be, 
in conﬂict with Auditor independence, 
provided it has the skill, competence and 
integrity to carry out the work in the best 
interests of the Company. 
Recruitment to the Company of any new 
employee who had been employed by the 
Auditor in the last ﬁve years requires the 
approval of the Audit Committee.
Proposals for any non-audit related fees 
which the Company is intending to pay 
to the Auditor are presented to the Audit 
Committee. Any individual assignment 
where the fee is likely to be in excess of 
£30,000 must be pre-approved by the Audit 
Committee. Where appropriate, services 
are tendered prior to awarding work to the 
Auditor. Details of the amounts paid to the 
Auditor during the year for audit and other 
services are set out in note 7 on page 91. 
Internal audit
The Company’ s internal audit function 
operates on a global basis. The Company 
Head of Internal Audit is responsible 
for developing the function, within 
the framework of common Company 
policies and standards, and for carrying 
out assignments in accordance with an 
annual audit plan approved by the Audit 
Committee. In 2013, it is proposed that 27 
internal audit assignments be undertaken 
covering one-third, or approximately 30%, 
of the applicable businesses as required 
by the Audit Charter. The Company Head 
of Internal Audit reports directly to the 
Audit Committee Chairman with functional 
responsibility to the Chief Executive. The 
Audit Committee receives reports from the 
Company Head of Internal Audit and reports 
to the Board on the results of its review.  Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

The Remuneration Committee members are 
the Independent Non-executive Directors 
excluding the Board Chairman. The 
Committee’ s principal roles are to set the 
appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, 
the Executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary , and to monitor the levels and 
structure of remuneration below Board 
level. Further details of the Remuneration 
Committee and its activities are provided in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
56 to 69. The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee reports the outcome of 
Committee meetings to the Board.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
Members
Peter Hill (Committee Chairman) and the 
Non-executive Directors.
The Nominations Committee advises the 
Board on appointments to, and retirements 
and resignations from, the Board, and 
reviews the Company’s succession 
plans. The members of the Nominations 
Committee are the Chairman, and the Non-
executive Directors. The Committee meets 
as and when required and is chaired by 
the Chairman or a Non-executive Director. 
The Chairman would not act as Chairman 
of the Nominations Committee where it 
was dealing with the appointment of his 
successor. Formal meetings will be held to 
consider standing items of business; there is 
also expected to be a signiﬁcant level of 
ad hoc discussion between members of the 
Nominations Committee, particularly when 
a recruitment exercise is taking place.
When considering the appointment of new 
Directors, the Nominations Committee 
will draw up a speciﬁcation, taking into 
consideration the diversity of the Board, the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience, 
the independence of Board members and 
the ongoing requirements of the Company. 
The Nominations Committee’ s foremost 
priority will be to ensure that the Company 
has the best possible leadership. Its prime 
responsibility is to ensure the strength of the 
Board. Board appointments will be made on 
merit against objective criteria, selecting the 
best candidate for the post. 
The Nominations Committee will utilise, 
where appropriate, the services of executive 
search ﬁrms to identify appropriate 
candidates and will only use those ﬁrms 
that have adopted the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct addressing gender diversity 
and best practice in search assignments. 
Wherever possible, the Nominations 
Committee will arrange for all Directors 
to meet with the preferred candidate. 
The Nominations Committee will make 
recommendations for each appointment to 
the full Board. Care will be taken to ensure 
that all proposed appointees have sufﬁcient 
time available to devote to the role and do 
not have any conﬂicts of interest.
The Nominations Committee will review the 
Company’s succession plans for members 
of the Board. The Board as a whole also 
considers this subject. Both of Alent’s 
divisions will submit detailed succession 
plans in respect of senior divisional 
executives to the Board for review each 
year. The Board also considers succession 
planning for senior corporate executives.
The Nomination Committee will also 
consider diversity generally across the 
Company. It is the Company’s aim to 
maintain an appropriate level of diversity 
on the Board to reﬂect the diverse nature 
of the Company’s operations, and to 
increase the level of diversity in executive 
management below Board level.
The Board fully supports the 
recommendations of the Davies Report 
entitled “Women on Boards”. 
The Board actively seeks to meet with key 
executives throughout the Company so 
as to gain a greater understanding of the 
breadth and depth of management talent. 
This enables members of the Committee 
to adopt a more informed approach to 
succession planning.
The Chairman of the Nominations Committee 
reports the outcome of Nominations 
Committee meetings to the Board.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
INTRODUCTION
I am writing to you as the ﬁrst Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee of Alent 
plc (“Alent”), which began trading on the 
London Stock Exchange on 19 December 
2012. 
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, 
Alent was formed following the demerger 
of Cookson Group plc (“Cookson”). Alent’ s 
shares were admitted to the premium listing 
segment of the Ofﬁcial List and to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange’ s main market 
for listed securities on 19 December 2012. 
Consequently, Alent is now a separately 
listed leading global supplier of advanced 
surface treatment, plating chemicals and 
electronics assembly materials. 
This report covers:
 the remit and composition of the 
Remuneration Committee;
 details of payments and outstanding 
awards/entitlements that were made to 
Executive Directors during 2012 under 
the Cookson Executive Director 
remuneration arrangements; and
 details of the current and forward 
looking Alent remuneration policy and 
its proposed implementation, together 
with the Executive Director 
remuneration arrangements and policy 
for 2013.
Due to Alent being separately listed 
only for the last 13 days of 2012, from 
19 December to 31 December (being 
the period to which this report formally 
relates), we are required to disclose pay, 
annual incentive and other data only in 
respect of Alent, which is generally for the 
13 days only, and from 31 October 2012 in 
respect of the three new Non-executive 
Directors who were not on the Cookson 
board, with no historical comparisons. 
This report includes that data as we are 
required to do. Shareholders should 
also be mindful of the fact that Alent’s 
Remuneration Committee held no formal 
meetings in 2012, and its ﬁrst formal 
meeting was in January 2013.
In terms of the Company’ s overall 
remuneration policy for 2013, the 
remuneration structure for Executive 
Directors and other senior managers aims to:
 be sufﬁciently competitive to attract 
and retain high calibre and experienced 
executives, while reﬂecting the 
international complexity of the 
Company’s business and operations; 
 strongly support the Company’s 
strategy and long-term corporate 
success, having due regard to 
environmental, social and governance 
issues within the Company’s overall risk 
proﬁle; 
 align management’s interests with those 
of shareholders; and
 foster a high performance culture, with 
a substantial portion of remuneration 
being performance linked.
The Company aims to provide median total 
remuneration levels for target performance 
and up to upper quartile total remuneration 
levels for superior performance. This will 
be judged against FTSE 250 companies 
and relevant international sector-speciﬁc 
companies to reach a rounded judgement. 
The Alent Prospectus disclosed the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors 
of Alent at the time of the demerger, 
comprising base salary, annual incentive, 
intended participation in the new Alent 
Share Plan (a long-term incentive share plan 
for Executive Directors and other selected 
executives) and retirement and other 
beneﬁts. The Demerger, on the terms set 
out in the Alent Prospectus which contained 
these details (a copy of which can be found 
on the Company’ s website), together with 
the Alent Share Plan which was put as a 
separate resolution to be voted on, were 
both approved by Cookson shareholders. 
The Company is committed to open and 
transparent dialogue with its shareholders on 
remuneration as well as other governance 
matters. As a matter of course the 
Remuneration Committee will continue to 
consult with key institutional shareholders 
and various representative bodies about 
the pay and incentive arrangements of the 
Company’ s Executive Directors. Indeed, 
during the Demerger process, the views of 
Cookson’ s largest shareholders were sought 
on a number of matters, including in relation 
to the then proposed remuneration policy , 
structure and positioning of Alent, while 
earlier this year I met with a number of Alent’ s 
shareholders to begin the dialogue process 
and answer shareholders’ questions. The 
views of these shareholders were, on the 
whole, very supportive and we look forward 
to a continuing dialogue on both the new 
Alent business, and what we need to do in 
respect of overall remuneration practices for 
our Executive Directors and the Company as 
a whole. I hope you will be able to support 
the Committee’ s report at this year’ s Annual 
General Meeting. 
Yours sincerely, 
Noël Harwerth
Chairman, Remuneration Committee

OUR GOVERNANCE
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The primary role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are:
 setting the appropriate remuneration for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary;
 recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management, being the ﬁrst layer of management 
below Board level; and
 overseeing the operation of any executive share incentive plans.
A copy of the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference is available on the Company’s website www.alent.com
COMPOSITION OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The current members of the Remuneration Committee are Independent Non-executive Directors, namely Dr Emma Fitzgerald, 
Jan Oosterveld, Mark Williamson and Noël Harwerth, who also chairs the Remuneration Committee. Each of the members of the 
Remuneration Committee was appointed as a Director of the Company on 31 October 2012 and is independent. The Company 
Secretary acts as Committee Secretary. The Chairman, Chief Executive and any other Directors are invited to attend Committee 
meetings as appropriate but do not participate in discussions of their own remuneration.
ADVICE PROVIDED TO THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
In formulating its policies and deciding individual remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee is advised by the Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary, by the external advisers Towers Watson (“Towers”), and the law ﬁrm Clifford Chance LLP (“CC”). Towers has 
been appointed directly by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration matters, including remuneration 
structure and policy, updates on market practices and trends, and guidance on the implementation and operation of long-term 
incentive plans. Towers has also provided the Remuneration Committee with remuneration benchmarking data for certain executives. 
CC provides advice on the drafting and operation of the Alent Share Plan and other executive or employee share arrangements 
operated by the Company from time to time. Towers is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation 
to Executive Remuneration Consulting in the UK. 
Aon Hewitt (the parent company of NewBridgeStreet (NBS), a ﬁrm of remuneration consultants) provides administration and actuarial 
services in relation to the Company’s pension plans and NBS provides share award valuation advice to the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the provision of any of these services to the Company compromises the 
independence or integrity of the advice that it receives from Towers, Aon Hewitt and CC. 
ACTIVITIES OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Given that the Demerger did not become effective until 19 December 2012, the Remuneration Committee did not meet during the 
period under review. However, the Remuneration Committee expects to meet at least three times in 2013 to consider such matters as:
 salary review proposals for the Executive Directors and senior management;
 reviewing achievement against the performance targets, and approving payouts, in respect of the annual incentive arrangements;
 setting performance targets and approving the structure of the annual incentive arrangements; 
 considering the Company’s performance against the performance conditions applicable to the Cookson awards rolled over into 
awards over Alent shares, and authorising the vesting of these awards where relevant;
 setting the performance conditions and authorising the grant of awards under the Alent Share Plan;
 receiving feedback on the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s meetings with key institutional shareholders regarding the 
Company’s remuneration policy and practice, and, in the light of this, advice received from the external advisers regarding trends in 
remuneration practice and governance, discussing the Company’s approach to executive remuneration and reviewing whether any 
changes should be made; 
 reviewing the Remuneration Committee’s Terms of Reference, and recommending any amendments to the Board for approval; and
 reviewing and approving the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration Report.  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ANNUAL INCENTIVE AND LONG TERM INCENTIVE 2012 ENTITLEMENTS PURSUANT TO PRE-DEMERGER 
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS OPERATED BY COOKSON
ANNUAL INCENTIVES (COOKSON)
For the ﬁnancial year 2012, the Executive Directors’ annual incentives were based on Cookson Group adjusted operating proﬁt 
performance, with an adjustment based on Cookson’s working capital performance to focus greater attention on cash ﬂow performance. 
The effect of the latter was to reduce the level of any payout that the Executive Directors could achieve by up to 10% if speciﬁed 
working capital targets were not attained. The adjuster could increase the level of payout by up to 10%, but not above the usual plan 
maximum. Mr Butterworth’s annual incentive was assessed solely against this criterion, whilst half of Mr Corbett’s annual incentive was 
assessed against this criterion and the remainder was based upon the divisional trading proﬁt of the then Performance Materials division 
adjusted for performance against a key operating cash ﬂow target. Their maximum incentive potential was 100% of salary.
For 2012, the relevant performance resulted in the following annual incentive payments for Messrs Corbett (Chief Executive) and 
Butterworth (Interim Finance Director), who were both Directors during the period:
Name Measure Weighting
Target 
Performance*
Achieved
(% of salary)
Incentive
Paid
(% of salary)
Steve Corbett Group Adjusted earnings 50% £207.1m 0% 0%
Steve Corbett Performance Materials Trading Profit 50% £109.2m* 8.7% 8.7%
Mike Butterworth Group Adjusted earnings 100% £207.1m 0% 0%
* Adjusted earnings and proﬁts
An Annual Incentive equivalent to 8.7% of base salary will therefore be paid to Mr Corbett in respect of 2012. This annual payment is 
reported in the Directors’ remuneration table on page 67. Mr Butterworth was not eligible for an annual incentive. 
LONG TERM INCENTIVES (COOKSON) 
The demerger did not result in early vesting of awards held by Executive Directors under the Cookson Long Term Incentive Plan 
(Cookson LTIP). 
2010 Cookson LTIP Award
In the case of the awards made to Executive Directors in 2010 under the Cookson LTIP where the performance period was due to 
end on 31 December 2012, the period was shortened very slightly, to end immediately before the Demerger Effective Time, so that 
performance was measured purely in relation to Cookson’s performance — being relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
and growth in headline EPS (50% each). These awards are due to vest on 7 April 2013 and were rolled over to become awards over a 
combination of Alent and Vesuvius plc shares in the same combination that applied to Cookson shareholders under the terms of the 
Demerger. This reﬂects the fact that these awards relate to historic Cookson performance and not to the future performance of Alent or 
Vesuvius.
The shortened performance period mentioned above for 2010 awards ended on 18 December 2012. Cookson’s TSR performance during 
this three-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group (FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts) and it was 
determined that Cookson’s performance was between the median and the upper quintile, a level which would result in a 17.7% out of a 
maximum 50% vesting. In addition, Cookson’s annual compound headline EPS growth was assessed for the period as being over 10% 
above RPI, a level which would result in 50% out of a maximum 50% vesting. Prior to the vesting of any award, as an additional hurdle, 
vesting must be justiﬁed by the underlying ﬁnancial performance of Cookson over the performance period. It has been concluded that 
the vesting of the 2010 Cookson LTIP awards is justiﬁed by the underlying ﬁnancial performance of Cookson. Accordingly, 67.7% of the 
Cookson 2010 LTIP awards will vest on 7 April 2013.
2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP Awards
In the case of the grants made to Executive Directors in 2011 and 2012 under the Cookson LTIP , these awards over Cookson shares were 
rolled over to become awards over Alent shares of equivalent value. Performance will still be measured over a three-year period, but by 
reference to Cookson performance up to the Demerger Effective Time and by reference to Alent performance thereafter to the end of 
the period. The awards continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the existing Cookson LTIP , save that the relevant company 
(and relevant remuneration committee) is Alent instead of Cookson.

STOCK CODE: ALNT
OUR GOVERNANCE
The vesting of the awards, when originally granted, was based on Cookson’s performance against speciﬁed performance conditions 
measured over a three-year period. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded was based upon Cookson’s three-year TSR performance relative 
to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 250, excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on EPS growth over the three-year period. 
The two measures operated independently. 
The new Alent targets for measuring performance for the 2011 and 2012 Cookson LTIP awards, following the Demerger, is now as follows:
As regards the EPS target, the currently disclosed Cookson headline EPS threshold and maximum vesting targets for the ﬁnal year of 
the relevant three-year performance period have been split between Alent and Vesuvius by reference to their respective trading proﬁt 
contributions to Cookson’s total 2012 trading proﬁt such that the new Alent and Vesuvius targets aggregate to the currently disclosed 
Cookson targets. The respective Alent adjusted EPS values as reported for the ﬁnal year of the three-year performance period will then be 
compared with these new threshold and maximum targets to determine the vesting outcome. 
Vesting of 50% of Perfomance and Matching Share Awards under the 2011 LTIP awards is based on adjusted EPS growth in accordance with 
the following schedule:
Adjusted EPS for 2013 financial year
Performance Shares 
Vesting Percentage
Matching Shares Vesting Ratio 
(Matching Shares: Investment Shares)
Less than 33.4 pence 0% 0

As regards the TSR target, Cookson’s TSR growth from the start of the relevant three-year performance period up to the time of the 
Demerger will be determined and added to the TSR growth of Alent from the Demerger date to the end of the three-year performance 
period. This aggregate TSR growth will then be ranked against the TSR of the relevant comparator group and the resulting vesting 
outcome will be calculated against the TSR performance schedule in the Cookson LTIP .

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FOR 2013 
The remuneration policy of the Company aims to establish a remuneration structure for Executive Directors and other senior managers which:
 is sufﬁciently competitive to attract and retain high calibre and experienced executives, while reﬂecting the international complexity 
of the Company’s business and operations; 
 strongly supports the Company’s strategy and long-term corporate success, having due regard to environmental, social and 
governance issues within the Company’s overall risk proﬁle; 
 aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders; and
 fosters a high performance culture, with a substantial portion of remuneration being performance linked.
In formulating remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee has regard to the international scale and nature of the Company’s 
operations and takes into consideration the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and guidelines issued by its leading 
shareholders and bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. The Remuneration  OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com

Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other Company employees when determining Executive 
Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases. 
Given that the Executive Directors’ current remuneration arrangements were agreed on a conﬁdential basis before the Demerger was 
announced, so as to be disclosed in the Alent Prospectus, it was not possible to carry out an internal employee consultation. In the case 
of Mr Corbett, this was a promotion and in the case of Mr Egan, this was a new hire — with the result that external comparisons and 
benchmarks were used. It was not a case of comparing the new salaries with any more broadly based salary increases given across the 
Company. However, this data, and these comparative measures, will be included in next year’s Remuneration Report.
The base salaries and the overall incentives and remuneration structure for the Executive Directors at the time of the Demerger were 
described in the Alent Prospectus.
The Remuneration Committee also obtains information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other companies, in order to 
provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy. 
The Remuneration Committee is aware of the need to ensure that the remuneration policy is ﬁrmly linked to the Company’ s strategy , including its 
risk management philosophy . As all Remuneration Committee members also serve on the Audit Committee, each Committee beneﬁts from the 
Directors’ experience on the other . This is particularly relevant when the Remuneration Committee is considering matters such as the Company’ s 
achievement of performance conditions and the implications for the Company’ s risk proﬁle of the award of incentives under the Company’ s 
remuneration programmes. The Remuneration Committee considers the Company’ s executive remuneration policy and incentive structure to be 
compatible with the Company’ s risk management and internal control systems.
The Board’ s intention is that remuneration is linked to strategic objectives and the delivery of superior performance, over both the medium 
and longer term. In addition to base salary , pensions and other beneﬁts, the two key incentives for executives are the annual incentive plan 
and the long-term plans. The Board’ s objective is to provide long-term value creation for shareholders, both absolute and relative, while also 
delivering sustainable short and longer term proﬁts, earnings and cash ﬂow performance. The Company’ s strategy to achieve these objectives is 
to focus on high growth end-markets, with a continuing pipeline of innovative and superior new products driven by an exceptionally strong R&D 
capability , backed by a clear focus on servicing customers through a value-adding OEM sales strategy , an efﬁcient global footprint and continuous 
improvement programmes in its manufacturing and other processes. In addition, the Committee, in supervising the incentive schemes, is mindful 
to ensure that these do not encourage an inappropriate level of risk taking. 
The remuneration policy is designed to incentivise and reward executives to deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Company’ s 
strategy , with a signiﬁcant proportion of the Executive Directors’ total remuneration being based on the variable, performance-related elements 
of the annual incentive and the Alent Share Plan. The performance conditions under these arrangements are designed to support the Company’ s 
strategic objectives, including a focus on growth and shareholder returns by targeting key business imperatives. For 2013 these are relative total 
shareholder return (TSR), deﬁned as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). 
T argets are objective, auditable and transparent and as such are considered to be appropriate performance measures for management. T o 
ensure that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build a signiﬁcant stake in the Company in 
accordance with the Company’ s share retention guidelines. 
The Remuneration Committee will evaluate the efﬁcacy of the Company’s executive remuneration policy each year and commission 
formal reviews as it considers appropriate.

FURTHER DETAILS OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR 2013 
BASE SALARY 
Base salary levels reﬂect the individual’s contribution and experience, the Company’s ﬁnancial performance, and the salaries paid 
in comparator companies. At the time of the Demerger, Mr Corbett’s promotion was reﬂected in a salary increase of 20% due to his 
promotion to Chief Executive of the Company, his resultant changing role, and his increased responsibilities. Mr Corbett’s salary is 
$750,000. Mr Egan’s base salary is £310,000.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE 
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary and based on achievement 
of speciﬁed targets determined following consideration of the Company’s ﬁnancial budget and prior year actual ﬁnancial results. The 
targets will be set to ensure that maximum bonuses are only paid for signiﬁcantly exceeding expectations. There is no deferral of annual 
bonuses for Executive Directors.
Each year the Remuneration Committee will establish the ﬁnancial performance criteria for the forthcoming year. These criteria will be 
set by reference to the Company’s ﬁnancial budget and prior year actual ﬁnancial results. The target range will be set to ensure that 
maximum bonuses are only paid for signiﬁcantly exceeding market expectations. The Remuneration Committee considers that the 
setting and attainment of these targets is important in the context of achievement of the Company’s longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level at which Executive Directors 
are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their respective base salary and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award 
is earned. Mr Corbett’s maximum annual incentive potential is 125% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 62.5% of 
base salary. For Mr Egan, his maximum annual incentive potential is 100% of base salary and his target annual incentive potential is 50% 
of base salary.
The structure of the 2013 Annual Incentive plan for Messrs Corbett and Egan will be based primarily on the achievement of adjusted 
earnings per share targets for 2013, together with a deﬂator if working capital targets are not met.
ALENT LONG-TERM INCENTIVES 
Summary
The long-term incentives are awarded under the Alent Share Plan (the “Plan”), which was approved by Cookson shareholders at the 
time of the Demerger and rewards executives for delivering superior TSR, deﬁned as the increase in the value of a share, including 
reinvested dividends, and EPS growth over a set period of time, and as such is intended to align executive remuneration with 
shareholders’ interests. The Plan is structured as an “umbrella plan”, which gives greater ﬂexibility in terms of the awards which can be 
made, in line with current market practice. This means that the Company only needs to have one set of share plan rules to cover all its 
current and prospective discretionary share plan needs.
The Plan will permit awards to be granted as:
 performance share awards (“LTI”);
 deferred share bonus awards;
 restricted share awards; and
 market-price options. OUR GOVERNANCE www.alent.com
64
Eligibility and individual grant levels
For Executive Directors, awards granted within 12 months following the Demerger will be granted in the form of performance share 
awards. It is not intended to grant deferred share bonus awards or restricted share awards to Executive Directors, although David 
Egan will be awarded a one-off grant of restricted shares under the plan, to compensate him for the awards which he forfeited on 
leaving his previous employer. This award was calculated on 50% of his base salary, less the amount of his 2012 annual incentive award 
from his previous employer, referenced to the Alent share price on his date of joining. The resultant award is 23,909 Alent shares, 
with 50% vesting on 1 January 2014 and the remaining 50% vesting on 1 January 2015. The award will be issued immediately after the 
announcement of the annual results and subject to the rules of the Alent Share Plan (the “Alent Plan”), provided he had not given or 
received notice on each vesting date. 
For the 12 month period after the Demerger, the Remuneration Committee shall have the discretion to consider the grant of 
different types of award including the utilisation of market price options, in which case any performance share awards will be reduced 
accordingly. 
Executive Directors are eligible to receive, on an annual basis:
 a performance share award with a face value of up to 200% of base salary; or
 a market-price option with a face value of up to 300% of base salary.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to grant a mix of performance share awards and market-price options provided the 
commercial value of the mixed grants is not higher than the commercial value of an unmixed grant that would otherwise have been 
provided to the executive.
Performance conditions for performance share awards
The vesting of performance share awards granted by the Company will be based on the Company’s performance against speciﬁed 
performance conditions measured over a three-year period. 
For performance share awards granted in 2013, the proportion of shares vesting will be based on the Company’s performance against 
speciﬁed performance conditions. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded will be based upon the Company’s three-year TSR performance 
relative to that of the constituent companies, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts (or a bespoke group of at least 20 comparator 
companies as determined by the Remuneration Committee) and 50% will be based on growth in adjusted EPS over a three-year period. 
The two measures will operate independently.
The details regarding the performance conditions for performance share awards to be granted in 2013 (threshold and maximum targets 
to determine the vesting outcome etc.) have not yet been ﬁnally determined. However, the proposed concepts and structure have been 
discussed with key institutional shareholders and their comments noted.
The Remuneration Committee will obtain independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance 
condition at the end of the relevant performance period and to conﬁrm that the companies which make up the index and the 
measurement of the Company’s performance are both in accordance with the rules of the Plan. Measurement of the Company’s TSR 
takes place over a performance period commencing on the ﬁrst day of the Company’s ﬁnancial year in which the award is granted. TSR 
is measured as the percentage increase in a return index for the Company and each comparator company between the beginning and 
end of the performance period. The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each 
weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period. The same three-month averaging method is used to 
ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period. The companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to 
their TSR. If the Company is ranked at or above the median of the comparator group then a proportion of the awards is eligible to vest. 
Adjusted EPS will be calculated on a consistent basis. Growth in adjusted EPS is the annualised percentage growth over the 
performance period. Adjusted EPS for the base year (i.e. the calendar year prior to the award date) is compared with the ﬁnal year (i.e. 
the calendar year three years after the base year). 
CLAWBACK ARRANGEMENTS 
The Executive Directors are subject to clawback arrangements. In the event that a misstatement is identiﬁed in the Company’s 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements which requires the restatement of a prior year’s accounts in order to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards or any applicable law, then such portion as the Remuneration Committee

STOCK CODE: ALNT
OUR GOVERNANCE
deems appropriate of any variable executive remuneration (including from both the annual incentive and the Plan and on an after tax 
basis) resulting from a measure of ﬁnancial performance affected by the misstatement will be subject to clawback provisions.
SHARE USAGE
Under the rules of the Plan the Company has the discretion to satisfy awards either by the transfer of existing shares or by the allotment 
of newly issued shares. The decision on how to satisfy awards is taken by the Board, which considers the most prudent and appropriate 
sourcing arrangement for the Company. 
The Alent Share Plan complies with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should 
not exceed 10% over a ten-year period in relation to the Company’s issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year 
period on discretionary schemes. 
Details of the awards granted to Executive Directors and outstanding under the Cookson LTIP as at 31 December 2012 are given in note 
28 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and note 10 to the Company ﬁnancial statements. No awards exist under the Alent Share 
Plan as at 31 December 2012.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) GRAPH
Given that the Demerger did not become effective until 19 December 2012, it is not possible to produce a graph which compares 
the Company’s TSR over the last ﬁve years with the return on an appropriate index (in compliance with the Large & Medium sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts & Report) Regulations 2008). For completeness, and in accordance with the Regulations, the graph 
below does compare the Company’s TSR over the short period from the Demerger to 31 December 2012 with the return on the FTSE 
250 index (excluding Investment Trusts). This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reﬂect the size, international scope and 
diversity of the Company.

2013 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of the Company will be held at 
10.00 am on Tuesday 21 May at the ofﬁces 
of UBS, 1 Finsbury Avenue, London, 
EC2M 2PP . 
The notice of the 2013 AGM is 
contained in the circular to shareholders 
accompanying this Annual Report, 
together with an explanation of resolutions 
to be considered at the meeting.
GOING CONCERN
Information on the business environment 
in which the Group operates, including 
the factors that are likely to impact the 
future prospects of the Group, is included 
in the Chief Executive’s Statement and the 
Where we Operate: Our Markets section. 
The principal risks and uncertainties that 
the Group faces throughout its global 
operations are shown on pages 26 to 29. 
The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash 
ﬂows, liquidity position and debt facilities 
are described in the Financial Review. 
In addition, note 26 to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements sets out the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; ﬁnancial risks; 
ﬁnancial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit, 
market (both currency and interest rate-
related) and liquidity risk. Further details of 
the Group’s cash balances and borrowings 
are included in notes 14, 15 and 26 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
The Directors have prepared cash ﬂow 
forecasts for the Group for a period in 
excess of 12 months from the date of 
approval of the 2012 ﬁnancial statements. 
These forecasts reﬂect an assessment of 
current and future end-market conditions 
and their impact on the Group’s future 
trading performance. The forecasts 
completed on this basis show that the 
Group will be able to operate within the 
current committed debt facilities and show 
continued compliance with the Company’s 
ﬁnancial covenants. On the basis of the 
exercise described above and the Group’s 
available committed debt facilities, the 
Directors consider that the Group and 
Company have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt a going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Group and the Company.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

and a statement by the Auditor about its 
reporting responsibilities can be found on

Additional Statutory 
Disclosures
PENSIONS
In each country in which the Group operates, the pension arrangements in place are considered to be consistent with good 
employment practice in that particular area. Independent advisers are used to ensure that the plans are operated in accordance with 
local legislation and the rules of each plan. Group policy prohibits direct investment of pension fund assets in the Company’s shares. 
Outside the US, the majority of pension plans in the Group are of a deﬁned contribution nature. Current active employees in the UK are 
offered membership of a deﬁned contribution plan, which is operated on a contract basis, with oversight by a governance committee.
All US retirement plan assets are held in trust for the exclusive beneﬁt of plan participants and their beneﬁciaries. An independent 
ﬁnancial institution acts as the Trustee. The trust assets are protected by law and by Federal Government Regulation and are subject 
to annual audit by an independent accountant, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. Further details of pension 
arrangements are given in note 27.
DONATIONS
Donations of the Company in the UK for charitable purposes totalled £nil (2011 £nil). In accordance with Company policy, no political 
donations were made in either 2012 or 2011.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which business transactions with 
their suppliers are conducted. It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with these terms, provided that the 
supplier is also complying with all relevant terms and conditions. In the accounts of the Company as at 31 December 2012, the number 
of days’ purchases outstanding was 30 (2011: 27).
ESSENTIAL CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company is required to disclose any contractual or other arrangements with customers, contractors and suppliers which it considers are 
essential to its business. The Company has a number of contractual arrangements in support of its business activities. Whilst the loss of some 
of these arrangements may cause temporary disruption, none is considered to be essential in the context of Alent’ s business as a whole. 
SHARE CAPITAL
As at the date of this report, the Company had an issued share capital of 278,448,752 ordinary shares of 10p each, being the total 
number of Alent plc shares with voting rights. The Company currently has three classes of shares. Further information relating to the 
Company’s issued share capital can be found in note 7 to the Company ﬁnancial statements.
The Company operates a number of share-based incentive plans (further details about these are given in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report). For these plans, the Company can satisfy entitlements either by the acquisition of existing shares or by the issue of new 
shares. No ordinary shares have been issued in relation to the exercise of options granted under the Company’s share option schemes. 
Resolutions giving the Directors the authority to allot shares and make allotments of shares to persons other than existing shareholders 
in certain circumstances will be proposed at the AGM.
THE COMPANY’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 
The Company’s Articles of Association are available on the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of the Company’s website, 
and may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company. 
APPOINTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS
The Directors shall not be fewer than ﬁve nor more than 15 in number. The Company may, by ordinary resolution from time to time, vary 
the minimum number and/or maximum number of Directors. The Board may appoint any person to be a Director (so long as the total 
number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). Any such Director shall only hold ofﬁce until the next AGM

The Directors of Alent plc are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company (“the Company”) 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law they are

by the European Union and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable law (“UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice”).
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and the 
Company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

Union;
 for the Company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Company ﬁnancial statements; and

transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its

to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
Each of the Directors, as at the date of the Annual Report, whose names and functions are indicated below conﬁrms that to the best of 
their knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the

Group Statement of Changes in Equity
For the year ended 31 December 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Alent plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies 
(“the Group”) are set out on pages 4 to 11 and its registered address is Forsyth Road, Sheerwater, Woking GU21 5RZ.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The consolidated financial statements of Alent plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”).
2.2 GROUP REORGANISATION AND DEMERGER
The Performance Materials division was demerged from Vesuvius plc with effect from 19 December 2012 and the entities 
making up the Performance Materials division were transferred to a new parent company, Alent plc. Application was made 
to the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the issued share capital of Alent plc to be admitted to the 
premium listing segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s market for listed securities as from 
19 December 2012.
The demerger was effected by a three part transaction as follows:
 ❭ The entire share capital of Cookson Group plc was cancelled and shareholders were given one ordinary share in Vesuvius plc 
for every share in Cookson Group plc held;
 ❭ The entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited, the holding company of the companies making up the Performance 
Materials division was transferred to Alent plc;
 ❭ In return for the share capital of Alent Investments Limited, Alent plc allotted and issued to Vesuvius plc shareholders one 
Alent share (credited as fully paid) for each Vesuvius plc share held at 19 December 2012.
Although Alent plc acquired the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited, it did not have the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of the Performance Materials division. For that reason, the acquisition has been accounted for in 
accordance with the principles of reverse acquisition accounting as set out in IFRS 3, Business Combinations. For the purposes 
of these consolidated financial statements, this had the effect of the legal acquirer, Alent plc, being treated as having been 
acquired by its legal subsidiary, Alent Investments Limited. The impact of adopting this reverse acquisition accounting basis 
is set out in each applicable note to these consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared as if the continuing 
operations of the Group were in existence for the whole of the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012.
2.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its “subsidiaries”). Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable are taken into account. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis. All intra-Group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

STOCK CODE: ALNT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.4 FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRSs
These are the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS 1, First-time Adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards, has been applied with a transition date of 1 January 2011. Since no consolidated 
financial statements were previously prepared for Alent plc, no reconciliations to previous GAAP have been presented. In 
applying IFRS 1, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption from recording cumulative translation differences and 
hedging differences that existed at the transition date. 
2.5 GOING CONCERN
As discussed in more detail in the Directors’ Report on page 70, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they have adopted the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
2.6 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY
The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and 
rounded to one decimal place. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 26.1.
2.7 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but 
states key lines which should be disclosed, encourages disclosure of additional line items where such presentation will assist in 
understanding financial performance and requires separate disclosure of material items of income or expense. Accordingly, the 
Company discloses exceptional items separately on the face of its Group income statement, together with a full explanation of 
the nature and function of such items in the notes to the financial statements. 
Both materiality and the nature and function of the item are considered in deciding whether an item warrants treatment as an 
exceptional item. Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of major restructuring activity, profits or losses relating 
to current and non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, profits or losses arising on business 
disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the 
Group’s results either due to their size or nature. 
2.8 NEW AND REVISED IFRS
During the year a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a 
material impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share. A number 
of other new and amended IFRS were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2013, none 
of which are likely to have a material impact on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or 
earnings per share.
3. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events. The 
major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 GOODWILL
The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of 
the Group over future periods. To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of 
the carrying value of the Group’s capitalised goodwill. In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 2012, further details 
of which are given in note 18, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate 
of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates. The projection period is, in the opinion of the 
Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Group’s businesses for this purpose. Changes to the 
assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors’ assessment of the carrying value of goodwill. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

3. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY 
(CONTINUED)
3.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Group’s financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other 
post-retirement benefits to current and former employees. It is the Directors’ responsibility to set the assumptions used in 
determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations. The assumptions are set after consultation with 
the Group’s actuary, and whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions 
used would affect the Group’s profit and financial position.
3.3 LIABILITY RESERVES
Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering 
taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are 
insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues 
which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in 
respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the 
settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and 
amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. The Directors use their judgement and experience to make 
reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4 TAXATION
(a) Current tax
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group. In assessing 
the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering 
the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement. Any 
interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge. The Group operates internationally and is subject to 
tax in many different jurisdictions. As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by 
their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude. Provisions are made for known issues based upon the 
Directors’ interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
(b) Deferred tax
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number 
of the Group’s businesses. Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these 
assets are recognised. If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period 
over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in 
a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial 
statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not 
probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, 
such as capital profits. If operating or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other 
timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
4. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in addition to 
those reported in accordance with IFRS. The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when 
assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its businesses.
4.1 NET SALES VALUE
Net sales value is calculated as revenue, excluding the amount included therein related to commodity metals. 
4.2 RETURN ON SALES AND RETURN ON NET SALES VALUE
Return on sales is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Return on net sales value is calculated as adjusted 
operating profit divided by net sales value.

STOCK CODE: ALNT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
4. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)
4.3 UNDERLYING REVENUE
Underlying revenue is calculated as net sales value adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates and business 
acquisitions, disposals and closures. 
4.4 ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT
Adjusted operating profit is operating profit as reported in the Group income statement before the share of post-tax profits of 
joint ventures, exceptional items, demerger costs and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18.
4.5 ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX
Adjusted profit before tax is profit before tax as reported in the Group income statement before exceptional items, demerger 
costs and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18. 
4.6 ADJUSTED PROFIT FOR THE YEAR
Adjusted profit for the year is profit for the year as reported in the Group income statement, before exceptional items, 
demerger costs, exceptional tax and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18.
4.7 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share is based upon adjusted profit for the year.
4.8 ADJUSTED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS
Adjusted cash generated from operations is cash generated from operations as reported in the Group statement of cash flows 
after adding back £21.7m (2011: £nil) of Woking restructuring (note 8) and demerger cash costs (note 9).
4.9 FREE CASH FLOW
Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant 
and equipment and dividends from joint ventures but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans. 
4.10 AVERAGE WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES RATIO
The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised 
revenue for the year. Average working capital (comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other 
payables) is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the 
revenue for the previous six months. 
4.11      EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated as the total of operating profit before share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, exceptional items and 
depreciation charges. 
4.12 NET INTEREST
Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by 
the Directors to be exceptional.
4.13 INTEREST COVER
Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest. 
4.14 NET DEBT
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits. 
4.15 NET DEBT TO EBITDA
Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com
88
4. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)
4.16 RETURN ON NET ASSETS
Return on net assets (“RONA”) is calculated as adjusted operating profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by 
average net operating assets (being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital 
and other operating receivables and payables). 
4.17 RETURN ON INVESTMENT
Return on investment (“ROI”) is calculated as adjusted operating profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, 
divided by invested capital (being total equity plus net debt, net employee benefits liabilities and goodwill previously written off 
to, or amortised against, reserves). 
5. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which 
can be found in note 4.
5.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to 
customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group. Where a 
contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone 
basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if 
it were an individual contractual arrangement.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed 
sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the 
consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Construction contracts Where the outcome of a contractual arrangement, such as an equipment construction contract, can 
be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised as performance occurs by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the balance sheet date. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the 
expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
(b) Research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. 
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and 
the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. All other development expenditure is recognised in the 
income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
5.2 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments, namely Assembly Materials and Surface 
Chemistries. It is the Alent Board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments. The information used 
by the Board to review performance and determine resource allocation is presented with the Group’s activities analysed between 
these two business segments. Taking into account the basis on which the Group’s activities are reported to the Alent Board and 
the nature of the products and services within each of these business segments, the Directors believe that these two business 
segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Group’s results. The principal activities of each of these segments are described 
in the Business Unit Review on pages 16 to 17.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers (inter-segment revenue is not material) and segment result is 
operating profit before share of joint ventures and exceptional items and before corporate costs directly related to managing 
the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below. Segment result includes items directly attributable to a 
segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

8. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS (CONTINUED) 
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges for the year amounted to £3.5m (2011: £1.9m), principally arising in connection with initiatives that 
included redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure of facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the 
rationalisation of product lines. The net tax credit attributable to these restructuring charges was £0.6m (2011: £0.2m).
Cash costs of £19.8m (2011: £3.8m) were incurred in the year in relation to restructuring activities, including £16.0m related to 
the purchase of a property in Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis and over which an onerous lease 
reserve had been established in 2009. The other cash costs in the year were incurred in respect of the restructuring initiatives 
commenced both in 2012 and in prior years leaving provisions made but unspent of £3.8m (2011: £19.5m).
Loss on construction contract 
The one-off loss on a construction contract of £6.6m (2011: £nil) related to a contract for the installation of a chemical treatment 
line and represents the additional costs to complete the project incurred by Alent after the third party sub-contracted to carry 
out the work went into liquidation. The tax credit attributable to this loss was £1.9m (2011: £nil).
Disposal and closure costs 
Costs of £5.7m (2011: £3.6m) arose in relation to costs incurred in connection with the demolition, monitoring and clean-up of 
sites of former Group businesses that were either closed or disposed of in prior years. The net tax credit attributable to these 
costs was £nil (2011: £nil).
Gains relating to employee benefits plans 
The exceptional gain of £2.0m in 2011 arose from the closure of two defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands. The tax 
charge associated with this gain was £0.5m.

One-off costs of £10.7m (2011: £nil) were incurred in effecting the demerger of Alent from Cookson Group plc, of which £5.7m 
(2011: £nil) were paid in cash in the year. The costs principally related to professional fees for audit and accountancy services, 
pension advice, and legal and regulatory compliance services. In addition to these costs, £2.9m of fees associated with 
establishing Alent’s new bank facility have been capitalised against borrowings (note 26). The net tax credit attributable to these 
demerger costs was £nil (2011: £nil).
10. FINANCE COSTS AND FINANCE INCOME
10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is included within 
interest payable on loans and overdrafts. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised 
as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement using the 
effective interest rate method.

11. INCOME TAX
11.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except 
to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the 
associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly to equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or 
substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

Tax credited in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to £0.2m (2011: £nil) all of which related to 
net actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits plans. 
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices. Changes in any of these areas 
could, adversely or positively, impact the Group’s tax charge in the future. Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to 
absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2012, as effective 
tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses. Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in 
notes 3.4 and 11.1.

recognised is £nil (2011: £nil).
From 1 April 2012, the UK corporation tax rate reduced to 24%. A further UK corporation tax rate reduction to 23% was 
substantially enacted on 3 July 2012 and will have effect from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the Group’s closing UK deferred tax 
liability has been provided using a tax rate of 23%. There was no tax impact of using this lower tax rate on the exceptional tax 
credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets in the year to 31 December 2012.

For calculating diluted EPS 278.4 280.9
Prior to the demerger from Vesuvius plc on 19 December 2012, Alent was part of Cookson Group plc. Accordingly, Alent’s 
weighted average share capital has been calculated by reference to movements in the number of issued ordinary shares of 
Cookson Group plc for the period from 1 January 2011 to 19 December 2012 and by reference to movements in the number of 
issued ordinary shares of Alent plc with effect from 19 December 2012. 
For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares 
relating to the Company’s share-based payment plans. Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their 
conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations. 
Other than the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had no other outstanding options or 
share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the 
calculation of diluted EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented.

16. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
16.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY 
Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that 
they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins 
when the asset is available for use and is therefore not charged on construction in progress. Depreciation is charged to the 
Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated 
useful life as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life
Freehold property between 10 and 50 years
Leasehold property the term of the lease
Plant and equipment — motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years
— information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years
— other between 5 and 15 years
The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least 
at each financial year-end. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis 
as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. As described in note 18.1, an asset’s carrying amount is 
immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing the sales proceeds with the carrying amount and are 
recognised in the Group income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

17. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets comprise goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations.
17.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate 
of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over 
the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess 
is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication 
that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired. On disposal of a business, the 
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.

17.3 ANALYSIS OF GOODWILL BY CASH-GENERATING UNIT (“CGU”)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two CGUs: the Assembly 
Materials and Surface Chemistries businesses. These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is 
monitored.

18. IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
18.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Group’s tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not feasible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, to assess the need 
for any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these CGUs.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of (i) its fair value less costs 
to sell and (ii) its value in use. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the resulting 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other 
assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill 
may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the asset’s recoverable amount since the 
impairment loss was recognised. The value in use calculations of the Group’s CGUs are based on detailed business plans 
covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and 
perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period. The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current 
value using pre-tax discount rates.
18.2 KEY ASSUMPTIONS
The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, return on net sales value, growth rates and discount 
rates. Return on sales and return on net sales value assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor 
in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions; external forecasts and historical trends for the 
Group’s key end-markets of electronics and automotive; and expected growth in output within the industries in which each CGU 
operates. A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% (2011: 2.5%; 2010: 3.0%) has been applied based on the long-term growth rates 
experienced in the Group’s end-markets and external forecasts. The Group’s projections are based on historical trends and 
external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
each CGU. The pre-tax discount rate used for the Assembly Materials CGU was 13.8% (2011: 13.8%; 2010: 12.5%) and for the 
Surface Chemistries CGU 14.0% (2011: 15.0%; 2010: 14.1%).
18.3 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2012, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of 
the recoverable amount of the Group’s CGUs as at 31 December 2012. Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts 
significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Group’s CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were 
recognised.

19. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
19.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the

All of the Group’s operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers 
with whom they do business. Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision 
is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered. 
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or 
financial reorganisation proceedings. Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant 
outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience. Historical experience 
has shown that the Group’s trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt 
write-offs, without being excessive.

amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

20. INVENTORIES
20.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first in, first out method) and net realisable value. Cost comprises 
expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the 
inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal 
activity levels. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised 
as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was 
£408.7m (2011: £505.0m).
As at 31 December 2012, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held £13.8m (2011: £10.6m) 
of precious metals on consignment terms. Alent has entered into precious metal consignment arrangements with precious 
metals consigning entities (the “Consignors”). The metal which the Group uses in the manufacture of its finished products for 
customers may be purchased from a Consignor and sold concurrently to the customer as of the same metals valuation date. In 
addition, customers may supply metal which will be toll manufactured by the Group. In the later case, the Group will only invoice 
customers for the value-added fabrication services. As the Consignors retain title and associated risks and rewards of ownership 
under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the balance sheet. Consequently, the 
obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in the Group balance sheet. 
21. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and forward 
commodity contracts to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk. The way in which 
derivatives are used to manage the Group’s financial risk is detailed in note 26.
Derivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is 
calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date. 
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated 
as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Strict conditions 
have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on 
an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows 
attributable to the hedged risk. The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge 
accounting purposes is recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement. Wherever possible, the Group 
avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of 
hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within operating profit in the Group income 
statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative. No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.

21. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY (CONTINUED)
Cash ﬂow hedges
The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised 
immediately within operating profit. When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the 
cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the 
same period.
Fair value hedges
The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within operating profit in the 
income statement. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the 
hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.

Fair value hedges in the table above comprise forward foreign currency contracts used to hedge the currency risk in payables 
and receivables and forward metal sales contracts used to hedge the fair value risk relating to the balance sheet value of 
inventory arising from fluctuation in commodity metals prices.

for the receipt of the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited (note 2.2). Alent plc applied merger relief under section 612 of 
the Companies Act 2006 to this transaction and, accordingly, the excess of the total market value of Alent Investments Limited, being 
£862.4m, over the nominal value of the shares issued of £417.7m has been recorded in the other capital reserve. 
Other reserve
The other reserve in the table above arose as a result of applying reverse acquisition accounting following the demerger of the 
Alent Group from Cookson Group plc, and represents the difference between the capital reserves of the legal acquirer of the 
Alent Group, Alent plc, and those of the legal acquiree, Alent Investments Limited (note 2.2).
Translation reserve
The translation reserve in the table above comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent. 
These exchange differences arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and from the translation 
of financial instruments that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign operations. In addition to foreign exchange differences 
attributable to the owners of the parent, the Group statement of comprehensive income includes foreign exchange differences 
attributable to non-controlling interests.

26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
26.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition 
they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
(b) Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the 
Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date:
(ii) Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences 
arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement; and
(iii) Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (pounds sterling), its results 
and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
(ii) Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average 
rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a speciﬁc transaction, in which case the transaction rate is 
used; and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve 
in equity and are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.
Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are 
initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or 
loss on disposal of the net investment. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
26.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS
The Group’s treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for 
managing the financial risks faced by the Group. The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most 
significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
(a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments may fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices. The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates (“currency 
risk”) and interest rates (“interest rate risk”).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets (being cash and short-term deposits) that are 
denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. The Group’s general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile 
of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward 
foreign exchange contracts (“FX swaps”). The currency profile of the Group’s borrowings and financial assets is shown in the 
table below.

from a 10% strengthening of sterling would reduce reported equity by £5.9m (2011: £5.7m) and a corresponding 10% weakening 
of sterling would increase equity by £7.2m (2011: £7.0m).

floating rate interest at various rates.
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in 
market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest 
paid in the Group statement of cash flows by £1.4m (2011: decrease £0.5m) and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would 
decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement 
of cash flows by £1.4m (2011: increase £0.5m). Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of £nil 
(2011: £nil) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of £nil 
(2011: £nil) in the fair value of the Group’s net debt.
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations. The Group manages this risk by 
ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can 
meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial 
covenants. The level of operational headroom provided by the Group’s committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least 
annually as part of the Group’s three year planning process. Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is 
normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the 
capital markets.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of £300m (2011: £nil), of which £72.5m (2011: £nil) were 
undrawn. These undrawn facilities are due to expire in September 2017.

The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt. Following the demerger from Cookson 
Group plc in December 2012, the mix of the Group’s capital has changed considerably, while the overall amount of capital 
has remained relatively constant. At 31 December 2011, prior to the demerger, the Group’s capital amounted to £403.2m, 
comprising £454.7m of equity balances and £51.5m of net cash. As at 31 December 2012, the Group’s capital had increased to 
£420.4m, comprising £276.0m of equity balances and £144.4m of net debt. The reduction in equity balances and the increase in 
net debt since 31 December 2011, respectively reflect (a) the net capital contributions made to Vesuvius during the year and (b) 
the impact of the apportionment of Cookson Group plc’s net debt between Alent and Vesuvius as part of the demerger process.
The Group monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital 
to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios, RONA and ROI (note 4). The Group’s objectives when managing its capital are:
 ❭ to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates 
within the ﬁnancial covenants contained within its debt facilities;
 ❭ to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Group’s equity and net debt;
 ❭ to have available the necessary ﬁnancial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future 
returns; and
 ❭ to maintain sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants and has substantial liquidity headroom within 
its committed debt facilities. Details of the Group’s covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the 
Financial Review on page 22.
27. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
27.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Group’s defined benefits plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by 
discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity 
approximating the terms of the related pension liability. Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation 
is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions to the plan.
The expense for the Group’s defined benefits plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 27.7. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of 
comprehensive income; and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income 
statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a 
component of profit from operations. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

27.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefits and defined contribution type, 
and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19.
(a) Deﬁned beneﬁts pension plans
The Group’s principal defined benefits pension plans are in the US. The assets of these plans are held separately from the 
Group in trustee-administered funds. The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans’ beneficiaries. The Group 
also has defined benefits pension plans in other territories but these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a 
whole.
The Group’s US defined benefit plans are closed to new members and to future benefit accrual for existing members. The 
main US plan, the Retirement Security Plan, has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans, but with a minimum 
performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members’ accounts. The cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 
27.3(b) refers to this minimum return. The Group’s US defined benefits plans provide retirement benefits based on final salary 
or a fixed benefit. Actuarial valuations of the US plan are carried out each year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 
31 December 2011. At that date, the market value of the plan assets was £42.8m, representing a funding level of 73% of funded 
accrued plan benefits (using the projected unit method of valuation) of £58.9m. Funding levels for the Group’s US defined 
benefit plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US 
government regulations. 
(b) Deﬁned contribution pension plans
The total expense for the Group’s defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to £5.6m (2011: £5.3m) 
and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
27.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION 
The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Group’s defined benefits pension plans, as detailed below, 
are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries. 
(a) Mortality assumptions
The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Group’s US defined benefits pension liabilities are summarised 
in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans. The 
assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected 64 years for non-pensioners and 33 
years for pensioners using projection scale AA.

27. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
27.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)
The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the US plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be determined 
by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. The US discount rate in the above table is based on the 
Citigroup pension discount curve.
The expected asset return is the Company’s expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns: based on the “risk-
free” yield available by following a buy and hold investment strategy in government bonds; with returns for other bonds and 
equities estimated based on observed historic long-term strategic risk premia. These assumptions do not take account of the 
relative valuation of markets or of market momentum. 
(c) Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions
The following table analyses, for the Group’s US pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from 
changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant. 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on US plan liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.1% Decrease/increase by 1.3%
Mortality Increase by one year Increase by 3.6%
27.4 DEFINED BENEFITS OBLIGATION
The liabilities of the Group’s defined benefits pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes are 
measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit 
method, in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-
related earnings.
The average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Group’s US pension plans relate is 12 years.

— within finance income (2.3) (3.0)
Total net credit (1.0) (0.8)
The exceptional net gain relating to employee benefits plans of £2.0m in 2011 arose from the closure of two defined benefit 
pension plans in the Netherlands.
Administration costs charged within ordinary finance costs in 2012 were £0.2m. In accordance with IAS 19 (Revised), which takes 
effect from 1 January 2013, these costs would have been charged within operating profit and the net finance charge relating 
to the Group’s post-retirement benefit plans would have increased by £0.7m, resulting in an overall increase in the net finance 
charge of £0.5m. The implementation of the revised standard is expected to increase the net finance charge for pensions in 
2013 by some £0.5m.

30. LEASES
30.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to 
enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
30.2 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
2012
£m
2011
£m
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are 
payable as follows:
Not later than one year 5.9 7.2
Later than one year and not later than five years 13.5 20.6
Later than five years 2.7 35.5
Total operating lease commitments 22.1 63.3
The Group’s property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts. Where the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the 
Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation. Where all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor 
the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet. The net book value of the Group’s property, 
plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 was not material.
The majority of the decrease in the level of lease commitments in 2012 arose as a result of the purchase of Alent’s property in 
Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within 
operating profit, amounted to £7.2m (2011: £7.7m).
31. PROVISIONS
31.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the 
specific risks associated with the obligation. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time 
is recognised as a finance cost.

31. PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
31.2 ANALYSIS OF PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)
Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2012 of £20.1m (2011: £31.3m), £12.3m (2011: £25.7m) is recognised in the 
Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and £7.8m (2011: £5.6m) within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors’ best estimate of the costs to be incurred in the fulfilment of 
obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure and the demolition 
and clean-up of closed sites. The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of legal or other regulatory requirements, 
or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which 
provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some 
uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying 
estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters. 
Provisions for restructuring and other charges include the costs of all of the Group’s initiatives to rationalise its operating 
activities. Cash costs of £19.9m were incurred in the year ended 31 December 2012, of which £16.0m related to the purchase 
of Alent’s property in Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis and over which an onerous lease reserve 
had been established in 2009. The purchase of the property resulted in the extinguishing of that provision. The balance of £4.7m 
as at 31 December 2012 includes £1.7m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between two and 
sixteen years, and £3.0m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the 
next two years.
32. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES NET OF CASH ACQUIRED
During the year, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries for a total consideration of £3.2m, of which £0.4m was paid in 
cash and £2.8m being contingent upon future performance, £0.8m of which was paid in the current period. The fair value of 
net assets acquired was £0.4m (of which £nil was cash). Goodwill arising on these acquisitions amounted to £2.8m (note 17). 
The £1.4m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries net of cash acquired, 
comprised £0.4m paid for current year acquisitions, £0.2m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions 
and £0.8m of deferred consideration paid in respect of current year acquisitions.
33. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of 
business are not reported in the Group balance sheet. Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors 
include: inventory held either under precious metal consignment arrangements (note 20); future lease payments in relation 
to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases (note 30); and trade receivable balances that have been 
subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in 
exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees. All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject 
to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in 
the Group balance sheet. Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from 
its trade receivables. As at 31 December 2012, the Group balance sheet included £2.9m (2011: £13.2m) of cash that would 
otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place. Factoring fees incurred during the 
year ended 31 December 2012, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 
£0.1m (2011: £0.4m). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.alent.com

34. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those 
covering taxation and environmental matters. Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties 
alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the manufacture 
of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future. Several of the Group’s subsidiaries are 
subject to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company 
involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. 
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other 
regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims. As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is 
subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty. 
Certain subsidiary companies of Vesuvius plc and Alent plc are defendants in two actions, brought by MacDermid (incorporated 
in the United States), which are pending in the Connecticut Superior Court and arising out of corporate activity involving the 
parties in the autumn of 2006. The first action was commenced in 2009 and the second action was commenced in August 2012. 
MacDermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive or exemplary damages, costs and interest which are currently 
unquantifiable. Both Vesuvius and Alent believe these claims have no merit and are vigorously defending these actions. Each 
of Vesuvius and Alent anticipate filing motions for summary judgement in both cases by mid-2013 and, if any claims remain 
pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in the second half of 2013 or early 2014. Any liability 
relating to the MacDermid claim arising following the demerger of Cookson Group will be split equally between Alent plc and 
Vesuvius plc.

1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
1.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
Alent plc (“the Company”) was incorporated on 31 August 2012 and is registered in England and Wales.
At a General Meeting on 26 November 2012, the shareholders of Cookson Group plc approved the demerger of the 
Performance Materials division. On 19 December 2012 (the demerger date), the businesses making up this division were 
transferred to an unrelated company, Alent plc, in exchange for the entire share capital of that company. As a result of the 
demerger, Alent plc became the ultimate parent company of the Alent subsidiaries. Trading of shares in Alent plc on the 
London Stock Exchange commenced on 19 December 2012. 
The financial statements of Alent plc (“the Company”), are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and under the 
historical cost convention and in accordance with UK GAAP . The Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account, 
as permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
1.2 GOING CONCERN
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements of the Group and the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012.
2. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE
Details of the Directors’ remuneration are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 69. The Directors 
remuneration during the period was borne by other Group companies. 
3. AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES
Amounts payable to KPMG LLP in relation to audit and non-audit fees are disclosed within note 7 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
4. DIVIDENDS
A proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of £15.3m, equivalent to 5.5p per ordinary share, is subject to 
approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial 
statements. If approved by shareholders, the dividend will be paid on 13 June 2013 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 
10 May 2013.

7. ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
7.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
7.2 ANALYSIS OF ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL
On incorporation, the Company’s share capital consisted of one ordinary share with a par value of £1 ( “the subscriber share”).
On 18 September 2012, the Company issued 50,000 redeemable non-voting preference shares of £1 each. The preference 
shares were allotted for cash and remain unpaid by virtue of the holder giving an undertaking to pay up each share pursuant to 
section 583(2) and 583(3) of the Companies Act 2006.
On 19 December 2012, the Company issued 278,448,752 ordinary shares of £1.50 each to the public shareholders of Vesuvius plc 
in return for the receipt of the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited. The Company has applied merger relief under 
section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 and, accordingly, the excess of the total market value of Alent Investments Limited, 
being £862.4m, over the nominal value of the shares issued of £417.7m, has been recorded in an other capital reserve. On the 
same date, the subscriber share was converted into and redesignated as a deferred share of £1.
Subsequently, on 19 December 2012, the capital of Alent plc was reduced by:
a) cancelling and extinguishing paid-up capital on each of the Alent plc shares in issue immediately prior to the confirmation by 
the Court of the Alent plc capital reduction to the extent that the amount paid up on each such Alent plc share shall be 10 
pence; and
b) reducing the nominal value of each of the Alent plc shares to 10 pence each:
The rights attached to the redeemable non-voting preference shares are as follows:
a) the shares carry no rights to receive notice of or attend and vote at any General Meeting of the Company unless a resolution 
is proposed to wind up the Company or vary, modify, alter or abrogate any of the rights attaching to the redeemable non-
voting preference shares;
b) the shares carry no rights to participate in profits or assets of the Company except, if there is a return of capital on winding-
up or otherwise, the assets of the Company available for distribution among the members shall be applied first in repaying in 
full to the holder of the redeemable non-voting preference shares the amount paid up on such shares: and
c) subject to the provisions on the Companies Act, the Company may redeem the redeemable non-voting preference shares at 
their nominal amount at any time specified by either the Directors or the holders of the redeemable non-voting preference 
shares. On the redemption of any redeemable non-voting preference, such shares shall be cancelled.
The rights attached to the deferred share are as follows:
a) the deferred share shall carry no rights to receive any of the profits of the Company available for distribution by way of 
dividend or otherwise;
b) except as provided below, the deferred share shall carry no rights to participate in profits or assets of the Company;
c) if there is a return of capital on winding-up or otherwise, the assets of the Company available for distribution among the 
members shall be applied first in repaying in full to the holder of the deferred share the amount paid up on such share; and
d) the holder of the deferred share shall not be entitled to receive notice of or attend and vote at any General Meeting of the 
Company unless a resolution is to be proposed which varies, modifies, alters or abrogates any of the rights attaching to the 
deferred share.

8. RESERVES
8.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
(a) Taxation
Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the 
balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect 
of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred 
taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the 
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of 
the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued 
as receivable.

10. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Company principally operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees. Equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of 
the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards 
is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. The 
cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other 
non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value 
determined at the date of grant. For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form 
of stochastic option pricing model. For all other grants, fair value is measured using the Black–Scholes model.
10.2 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT RECOGNITION
The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed on pages 
58 to 59 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

statements.
11. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under the guarantee. Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2012 in respect of 
the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to £228.7m which includes £227.5m of drawings under the syndicated debt 
facility.
Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering 
taxation and environmental matters. Several of the Company’s subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which 
are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of 
issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities. While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can 
never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and 
its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially 
adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
12. RELATED PARTIES
All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in accordance with normal business terms. 
Transactions between related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.

BGA A BGA (Ball Grid Array) is a type of surface mount technology used for packaging integrated circuits.
Damascene copper Chemicals used to create nanoscale copper connections within semiconductor wafers.
Die attach products The “die” refers to the silicon die in active integrated circuit packages. The attachment is most commonly 
a thermal path to help draw the heat out of the package and is typically either a purely metal or a 
conductive polymeric bond. This application is critical to the integrated circuit’s reliability and ultimate 
performance.
Electroplating A plating process that uses electrical current to coat a conductive object with a thin layer of another 
material in order to bestow a desired property (e.g. abrasion-resistance and wear-resistance, aesthetic 
qualities, etc.) to a surface that otherwise lacks that property.
Flux A chemical-based material designed to help reduce oxides and clean metal surfaces in order to enable 
effective ‘wetting’ of metal surfaces to the molten solder alloy during the creation of a solder joint when 
attaching an electronic component to a printed circuit board.
Immersion silver A printed circuit board final finish that provides tarnish resistance, low contact resistance and ease of 
cleaning. Specially designed to meet printed circuit board lead-free assembly and OEM requirements.
Integrated circuit 
or IC

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
Shareholders are able to take their dividend as cash, or 
in shares through the DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) 
operated by the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti. Further details 
are available at http://www.shareview.co.uk/products/Pages/
DividendReInvestmentPlan.aspx or directly from Equiniti.
The Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) allows shareholders to use 
their cash dividends to buy more shares in their company. Rather 
than receiving a dividend cheque through the post or having their 
bank account credited with the dividend payment, shareholders 
can choose to use their cash dividend to buy additional shares.
Whole shares are purchased with any residual money being carried 
forward and added to the next dividend. However, if the amount 
of the dividend, less any dealing costs incurred in completing the 
purchase, is insufficient to buy a single share no charge is made 
and the dividend is carried forward.
E-COMMUNICATIONS
Using the Group’s website as the main method of distribution for 
many statutory documents is part of our commitment to reducing 
our environmental impact. You can choose to receive shareholder 
communications, including the Annual Report and Notice of 
Meetings, in electronic form rather than by post.
This has a number of advantages, including:
 savings on environmental resources;
 significant cost savings for the Company on the delivery of 
documents;
 speedier delivery of shareholder communications.
Shareholders can register through the online service provided by 
our Registrars, Equiniti, at www.shareview.co.uk. The registration 
process requires the input of a shareholder reference number 
(SRN), which can be found on the share certificate.
To ensure that shareholder communications are received in 
electronic form, "email" should be selected as the mailing 
preference.
Once registered, shareholders will be sent an email notifying them 
each time a shareholder communication has been published on 
our website, and providing them with a link to the page on our 
website where it may be found. Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012

ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION
WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS
Alent plc is legally obliged to make its share register available to 
the general public. Consequently some shareholders may receive 
unsolicited mail, including correspondence from unauthorised 
investment companies.
Companies have become increasingly aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls concerning 
their shareholding. These calls are typically from overseas 
based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to sell what 
often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK 
investments. They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
 ensure that you obtain the correct name of the person and 
organisation;
 check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before 
becoming involved. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk; and
 report the matter to the FSA by calling 0845 606 1234 or visiting

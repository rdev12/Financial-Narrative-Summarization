Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued £124m of shareholder equity to acquire Makro in the UK. Following the successful 
integration of Makro into the Group and a period of strong cash generation, the Board is proposing to implement a capital return 
to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately £61m, based on the current issued share capital of 
the Company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class of “B” shares which shareholders will be able to 
redeem for cash. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the Annual General Meeting 
on 9 July 2014. Further details of the proposed return of capital will be set out in a circular to shareholders which will accompany 
the notice convening this year’s Annual General Meeting. We currently anticipate returning a similar amount to shareholders in July 
2015 and will provide an update on this at the 2015 Final Results announcement in May 2015, in light of circumstances prevailing 
at that time.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report that Booker 
Group plc has delivered another good 
performance. In the 52 weeks to 28 
March 2014 sales rose by 17% to £4.7bn 
and operating proﬁt of £120.4m was up 
23%. Customer satisfaction continued 
to improve and we had our best 
satisfaction scores ever. The ﬁnancial 
performance was good and the Group 
ended the ﬁnancial year with net cash 
of £149.6m. The drive into the catering 
market is working, with Booker like-for-
like sales to caterers (excluding Makro) 
up by 7.1%. Booker like-for-like sales to 
retailers (excluding Makro) fell by 0.5%, 
due to a contraction in the UK duty paid 
tobacco market. Makro is now making a 
real contribution to the Group.
The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business 
are going well. In the 52 weeks to 28 
March 2014 Booker distributed £1.3bn 
of product to our customers’ premises 
versus £1.15bn last year as we continue 
to expand our delivered service. Booker 
Direct, Chef Direct, Classic and Ritter 
Courivaud, our specialist delivered 
businesses, had a good year. Internet 
sales were £777m compared to £704m 
in the previous year and sales at Booker 
India are making good progress. 
Much of the year has been spent 
bringing Makro into the Group. This is on 
track. We are delighted to have the team 
from Makro join Booker Group.
I should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of 
the Group in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share were 6.06 
pence, up from 4.51 pence last 
year. Given the strong operational 
performance and cash flow of the 
business the Board recommends the 
payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 2.75 
pence per share (2013: 2.25 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 3.20 pence per share (2013: 2.63 
pence per share). The ﬁnal dividend is 
payable on 11 July 2014 to shareholders 
on the register on 13 June 2014.
In addition to the ﬁnal dividend, the 
Board is recommending a special 
capital return to shareholders of 3.50 
pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £61m, based on the 
current issued share capital of the 
Company). We currently anticipate 
making a similar return to shareholders 
in July 2015 and will provide an update 
on this at the 2015 Final Results 
announcement in May 2015, in light of 
circumstances prevailing at that time.
Outlook
The Group’s trading in the ﬁrst seven 
weeks of the current ﬁnancial year is 
ahead of last year. We anticipate that 
the challenging consumer and market 
environment will persist through the 
coming year and the UK’s food market 
remains very competitive. 
Whilst there is increasing price 
competition in the UK grocery and 
discount sectors, we will continue to 
deliver our plans to offer our customers 
even better choice, prices and service 
supported by the continued delivery of the 
Makro synergy plans and our efﬁciency 
programmes. We are on track to deliver 
an outcome for the new ﬁnancial year in 
line with our plans and to make progress 
in this challenging environment. 
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 9 July 2014. The notice of Annual 
General Meeting and a circular setting 
out further details of the proposed 
return of capital which itself, requires 
shareholder approval, will be issued to 
shareholders in due course.

Booker Group plc has delivered  
another good performance 04

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and 
Broaden’ the business. We continue to 
make good progress. 
Focus  
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efﬁcient operator in our sector. Bryn 
Satherley and his team continue to 
improve business efﬁciency. We ‘stop, 
simplify and standardise’ work and 
invest most of the savings in customer 
service. Much of the year has been 
spent integrating Makro into the Group. 
Through tight cash management we 
have now increased net cash from 
£77.2m last year to £149.6m this year. 
Makro business centres are now 
operating on the Booker systems. 
We have also generated synergies of 
approximately £26m through improving 
systems, processes and buying across 
the enlarged Group. 
Drive  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 503,000 customers 
this year up from 486,000 last year. 
 
 
Guy Farrant and the team continue to 
‘Drive’ choice, price and service for our 
customers. Each year we survey 40,000 
customers to identify where improvements 
can be made. Customer satisfaction 
improved again this year and our 
customer count has increased again, by 
17,000 customers. Customer satisfaction 
is a key measure within the business and 
we have made signiﬁcant progress since 
2006, achieving our highest ever levels of 
satisfaction this year. 
Choice Up
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 28 March 2014 
were £65m. The quality and freshness 
of the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• During the year we rebranded Booker 
Basics as Chef’s Essentials to appeal 
to a wider audience. Chef’s Essential 
sales are now £95m per annum.
• We also launched CleanPro. This 
range of 73 professional cleaning 
products has been well received 
by customers.
Prices Down
• We operate in a very price 
competitive market. Every week we 
monitor prices versus competitors 
and during the year our price 
index remained competitive. In the 
year we “locked down” prices for 
caterers which has proved very 
effective in helping caterers plan 
their menu with conﬁdence.
Better Service
• Our people are doing an excellent 
job. Our customers rate Booker 
people highly. Business Centre 
teams at Makro have been trained in 
PRIDE to help improve the Parking, 
Reception, Internal, Delivery and Exit 
experience.
• We have continued to expand and 
improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers 
and greengrocers within the business 
than last year.
Catering
• Catering like for like sales grew by 
7 .1%, as our choice, price and service 
continued to improve. Our catering 
development sales force continues to 
serve our existing customers and to 
introduce new customers to Booker.

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew to 2,982 stores (2,802 stores 
last year). Sales to these customers 
grew by 12%. The retail development 
team has put a lot of work into both 
compliance and building the sales 
and proﬁts of existing Premier stores.
Family Shopper
• During the year we launched Family 
Shopper. This is a local discount 
store. We now have six stores and, 
although it is early days, the response 
has been encouraging.
Broaden 
(commenced April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the 
best choice, price and service to 
caterers, retailers and small business. 
We also seek to become the suppliers’ 
preferred route to market. We also want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Makro
• The most important change we have 
made to Broaden the Group is the 
acquisition of Makro. Makro serves 
around one million small business 
customers, has great people, good 
locations and excellent products. 
Through Booker and Makro coming 
together we seek to become the 
UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, 
retailers and small businesses. 
We will offer our customers better 
choice, prices and service via the 
internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
The transaction was cleared by the 
Competition Commission on 19 April 
2013. Makro has ﬁtted nicely into 
the Group. We have embarked on 
a rapid turnaround. As a result cash 
management has been tightened and 
we have improved proﬁts from a loss 
of £18m in 2012, to a proﬁt of £1 1m this 
year. Having exited some unproﬁtable 
product categories, sales were down 
9% but customer satisfaction has 
improved signiﬁcantly. We are planning 
that Makro will continue to experience 
a sales loss in the year ahead, as we 
continue to focus on professional 
customers. In Shefﬁeld, Belfast and 
Preston we have developed a new 
Makro/Booker format. The format has 
been tailored to the local market and 
we expect to complete ﬁve more of 
these conversions in the year ahead. 
Critically, Makro is increasing our 
capacity to grow delivered sales. This 
should help the Group grow to an 
estimated £6bn of sales in the next 
few years. I am pleased the team at 
Makro have settled into the Group. It 
is a credit to the teams at Booker and 
Makro that the integration has gone 
so smoothly. I am very grateful to all 
the teams for the hard work this year.
Improving the Cash and Carry 
Business Centre Experience
• We have now converted 150 of our 
172 business centres to the ‘Extra’ 
format. This features a lighter, 
brighter business centre environment 
and an improved choice, price and 
service. The conversion pays back in 
around a year and we plan to convert 
a further three business centres to 
‘Extra’ in the year ahead. The lessons 
from Extra will be rolled to the rest of 
the business and to Makro.
Harnessing the Internet
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £777m, 
up from £704m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
334,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 255,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. We have also 
doubled the number of stock keeping 
units available to a typical customer 
on the website through our special 
order system. This has generated 
incremental sales of £4m. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic Drinks/Chef Direct
• Mark Aylwin and his team are building 
our delivered wholesale business. 
Booker Direct has great customers 
including the prison service in England 
and Wales, Marks & Spencer and 
most of the cinema chains in the UK.
• In 2010 we acquired Classic Drinks, 
an on-trade wholesaler supplying 
pubs and licensed customers mainly 
in the North West. We are in the 
process of rolling this expertise out 
on a national basis.
Chef’s Essentials 06
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic Drinks/Chef Direct 
continued
• In 2010 we acquired Ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. Through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from Ritter-Courivaud and the 
Groups’ buying scale, we launched 
Chef Direct in 2012. Chef Direct is 
based in Didcot and has won some 
important clients such as Aramark. 
Aramark serves 250,000 meals a day 
and through working with Booker 
Direct, the road miles have been 
halved and service improved.
• In the last year the Group delivered 
£1.3bn of product to retailers and 
caterers in the UK. Through using 
some of the space in the Makro 
business centres we will be able to 
increase our delivered business. 
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
ﬁrst business centre in Mumbai. 
We now have four branches in 
Mumbai, one in Surat and one joint 
venture branch in Pune. We serve 
over 21,000 customers and have 
also launched 200 Happy Shopper 
symbol retailers, which harness the 
lessons learned from Premier in the 
UK for the Kirana stores of Mumbai. 
We are reviewing growth options in 
India and look forward to developing 
the Booker offer to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers.
Sustainability 
• Booker was the ﬁrst UK wholesaler to 
achieve a third consecutive Carbon 
Trust Standard and the ﬁrst in the 
UK to achieve the new Carbon Trust 
Waste Standard. Booker are also The 
Grocer Gold “Green Wholesaler of 
the Year” 2013.
• 16,000 customers are now recycling 
with Booker through our packaging 
and used cooking oil recycling 
services. This helps our customers 
save money, increase recycling 
levels and support more sustainable 
communities throughout the UK.
• Customer recycling volumes are up 
40% against last year.
• We donated surplus food equivalent 
of 200,000 meals to local charities in 
the last year
• We also helped many customers and 
communities who were impacted 
by the flooding. In the sixteen most 
impacted locations we supported 
customers with a fund of £350,000 
of free stock and support.
People
• The progress made by the business 
this year is a credit to our great team 
of people. We are committed to 
continuing to make Booker better 
and safer for colleagues. We are 
also developing talent. For example, 
there is a shortage of butchers in the 
trade, so we have partnered with the 
University of West London to develop 
a formal “butchery apprenticeship”. 
28 new butchers graduated this year. 
We developed a similar scheme for 
greengrocers with 50 colleagues 
graduating this year. We intend to run 
both schemes again in 2014/15.
• For the seventh year running, 
the performance of the business 
means our people have shared in 
our success through our bonus 
system. With this great team of 
people, Booker will continue to make 
progress in the year ahead. 
• During the storms and flooding, 
our people did a fantastic job of 
maintaining service to our customers.
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden 
the business remains on track. 
Customer satisfaction continued to 
improve and we grew the Group to 
£4.7bn of sales. Most importantly we 
teamed up with Makro to become the 
UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, 
retailers and small businesses. We will 
provide our customers with improved 
choice, prices and service via the 
internet, delivery and cash and carry. 
We have a great team at Booker and 
Makro and together we will help our 
customers prosper in the year ahead.

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT
Financial Review 
In 2013/14 IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ was adopted and the prior year’s ﬁgures have been restated to reflect the change. 
In order to make a comparison to last year, all reported income statement numbers in the Group Finance Director’s Report are 
compared with last year’s restated position. Makro has been consolidated since 19 April 2013.

Overall Group revenue increased by 17% 
to £4.7bn. Booker non tobacco like for 
like sales (excluding Makro) increased 
by 4.4% while like for like tobacco sales 
decreased by 1.7%. 
Operating margin increased by 0.12 
percentage points to 2.57% (2013: 
2.45%) increasing group operating proﬁt 
by £22.5m to £120.4m. The improvement 
in margin was due to a favourable product 
mix and control of costs. 
A net £3.4m exceptional credit has 
been taken to the income statement in 
the period (2013: £3.0m charge). The 
credit relates to the £11.2m difference 
between the fair value of Makro’s assets 
and liabilities at the date of consolidation 
and the fair value of consideration paid, 
offset by £7.8m of exceptional costs.
The net ﬁnance charge of £1.7m (2013: 
£2.8m) relates mainly to the unwind of 
the discounting of provisions.
Proﬁt before tax rose £30.0m to £122.1m 
(2013: £92.1m), an increase of 33%.
The underlying effective tax rate (the tax 
charge as a percentage of proﬁt before 
taxation and exceptional items) for the 
Group of 14.8% (2013: 16.9%) was 
below the standard rate of corporation 
tax in the UK of 23% (2013: 24%). This 
was due principally to the utilisation of 
ACT from prior years, the release of a 
prior year provision held in respect of 
former overseas businesses and tax 
relief arising from exercise of share 
options during the year. The Group holds 
signiﬁcant tax assets, notably Makro 
tax losses and ACT, which continue 
to be unrecognised as the quantum 
and timing of their utilisation remains 
uncertain. Utilisation of these assets 
could result in the underlying effective 
rate of tax remaining below 20% for the 
next three years.
A tax credit of £0.7m arises on the 
exceptional item, which is after taking 
account of a charge arising from the 
revaluation of Makro’s deferred tax asset 
at the balance sheet date following the 
enactment on 2 July 2013 of reduced 
future rates of corporation tax. The 
effective rate of tax on post exceptional 
proﬁts is 13.8% (2013: 17.5%).
Proﬁt after tax was £105.2m, an increase 
of £29.2m compared to 2013.
Basic earnings per share rose to 6.06p, 
up 34% from 4.51p in 2013.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a ﬁnal 
dividend of 2.75 pence per share (2013: 
2.25 pence per share), up 22%, payable 
(subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on 9 July 2014) on 11 July 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at 13 June 
2014. The shares will go ex-dividend on 
11 June 2014.
The ﬁnal dividend increases the total 
dividend for the year to 3.20 pence per 
share, up 22% on 2013 (2013: 2.63 
pence per share).  08

GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
Return of Capital
In July 2012 Booker Group plc issued 
£124m of shareholder equity to 
acquire Makro in the UK. Following the 
successful integration of Makro into 
the Group and a period of strong cash 
generation, the Board is proposing 
to implement a capital return to 
shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary 
share (at a cost of approximately 
£61m, based on the current issued 
share capital of the Company). It is 
proposed that this is achieved by the 
issue of a new class of “B” shares which 
shareholders will be able to redeem for 
cash. The return of capital requires the 
approval of shareholders, which will be 
sought at the Annual General Meeting 
on 9 July 2014. Further details of the 
proposed return of capital will be set 
out in a circular to shareholders which 
will accompany the notice convening 
this year’s Annual General Meeting. We 
currently anticipate returning a similar 
amount to shareholders in July 2015 
and will provide an update on this at 
the 2015 Final Results announcement 
in May 2015, in light of circumstances 
prevailing at that time.
Cash Flow
Management has continued to focus 
on cash generation resulting in a net 
improvement of £72.4m in the year 
to close with a net cash position of 
£149.6m at 28 March 2014. Earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’) of £141.5m 
and proceeds from asset disposals 
of £17.6m, funded capital additions of 
£18.0m (2013: £14.1m) and the payment 
of £46.6m of dividends (2013: £37.0m). 
Pensions
The Booker Pension Scheme (‘the 
Scheme’) is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme 
that was closed to new members in 
October 2001, and was closed to future 
accruals for existing members in August 
2002. At 28 March 2014, the Scheme 
had an IAS 19 deﬁcit of £3.6m (2013: 
£6.8m), comprising Scheme assets 
of £611.0m and estimated liabilities of 
£614.6m. The Group contributed £9.6m 
(2013: £9.6m) in the year.
The 2013 Triennial valuation has been 
agreed with the pension fund Trustee 
and reflects a Scheme Funding deﬁcit of 
£23.8m at 31 March 2013 to be recovered 
by £9.6m of scheduled payments in 
the year to 31 March 2014 and by an 
assumed outperformance of investment 
returns relative to the rate at which the 
future liabilities of the scheme have been 
discounted. As a consequence, there 
will be no cash contributions required 
from the Company after the scheduled 
quarterly payment of £2.4m on 31 March 
2014, subject to the results of subsequent 
Triennial valuations. The next Triennial 
valuation date is 31 March 2016.
Goodwill
The net book value of goodwill on 
the balance sheet is £436.4m (2013: 
£436.4m). The goodwill carrying value is 
more than supported by expected future 
cash flows discounted back to present 
day values at a pre-tax discount rate of 
10.5% (2013: 10.8%). 
Capital Structure
The Group ﬁnances its operations 
through a combination of bank facilities, 
leases and retained proﬁts and its capital 
base is structured to meet the ongoing 
requirements of the business. As at 28 
March 2014, the Group had net cash of 
£149.6m (2013: £77.2m).
Borrowing Facilities
The Group entered into a ﬁve year facility 
on 28 July 201 1 comprising an unsecured 
£120.0m revolving credit facility. 
The Group’s borrowings are subject 
to covenants set by the lenders. In 
the event of a failure to meet certain 
obligations, or if there is a covenant 
breach, the principal amounts due and 
any interest accrued are repayable  
on demand.
The ﬁnancial covenants are Fixed 
Charge Cover, measured by the ratio 
of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, 
tax, exceptional items, depreciation, 
amortisation and rent) to interest plus 
rent (tested half yearly on a rolling basis) 
being greater than 1.5, and Leverage, 
measured by the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) (tested 
half yearly on a rolling basis) being less 
than 3.0.
The Group complied with its covenants 
throughout the year. At 28 March 2014 
the Group achieved a Fixed Charge Cover 
of 3.9 and Leverage of nil, comfortably 
exceeding its covenant obligations. 
In addition to these ﬁnancial covenants 
the Group’s borrowing agreements 
include general covenants and potential 
events of default. The Group has 
complied in all respects with the terms 
of its borrowing agreements at the date 
of this report. 
Interest Rates 
Funds drawn on the revolving credit 
facility bear floating interest rates linked 
to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%, where 
the ratio of net debt/EBITDA is less than 
one. A commitment fee is payable at 
0.5% of the unutilised facility. 
The net cost of the facility during the 
year was £0.2m (2013: £0.5m).
Liquidity
At 28 March 201 4, the Group held £1 49.6m 
in cash and cash equivalents. The Group 
also had in issue £4.9m of guarantees 
(2013: £5.5m) leaving undrawn facilities at 
28 March 2014 of £115.1m.
The Company did not draw down on 
its revolving credit facility on a cleared 
basis in the year to 28 March 2014 giving 
a minimum facility headroom in the year 
of £113.0m after taking into account the 
guarantees facility of £7.0m. 09

Guidance
Whilst there is increasing price 
competition in the UK grocery and 
discount sectors, we will continue to 
deliver our plans to offer our customers 
even better choice, prices and service 
supported by the continued delivery of the 
Makro synergy plans and our efﬁciency 
programmes. We are on track to deliver 
an outcome for the new ﬁnancial year in 
line with our plans and to make progress 
in this challenging environment.
The Acquisition of Makro
On 4 July 2012 Booker Group plc 
acquired Makro Holding Limited and 
two subsidiaries: Makro Self Service 
Wholesalers Limited and Makro 
Properties Limited (together ‘Makro’). 
The transaction was subject to 
competition approval and, during this 
process, we were required to hold 
Makro separate from the rest of Booker 
in accordance with undertakings given 
to the competition authorities in the 
normal way. The competition review 
was still ongoing at 29 March 2013 
and during this hold separate period, 
under accounting rules (IFRS 3 and IAS 
27), Makro’s results were required to 
be excluded from the Group’s results. 
At 29 March 2013, therefore, the 
consideration paid for Makro was held 
as an investment in the Group’s balance 
sheet. Full clearance of the transaction 
was received by the Competition 
Commission on 19 April 2013 and 
Makro was consolidated from that date.
In the year ended March 2014, the 
Group’s operating proﬁt increased by 
circa £11m as a result of the acquisition. 
This is the aggregate of an estimated 
base operating loss of £15m for Makro 
and Group synergy beneﬁts in the 
year of approximately £26m across 
the Group. We anticipate additional 
synergy beneﬁts of £4m next year and 
£2m the following year. This will help 
improve choice, price and service for 
our customers.
Booker was required to fair value 
Makro’s assets and liabilities at the date 
of consolidation. At this date Makro 
had 24 freehold and six long leasehold 
properties, which were independently 
valued at £144m on a vacant 
possession basis in 2012. The fair value 
of Makro’s assets and liabilities at the 
date of consolidation was approximately 
£156.1m, greater than the fair value 
of consideration paid by £11.2m, and 
this difference has been credited to 
the Group’s income statement as 
an exceptional item in the period. 
Restructuring and integration costs of 
£5.8m, and stock write downs following 
a rationalisation of product ranges of 
£2.0m, have also been charged as 
exceptional items in the period.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
The Group recognises that it has social and environmental responsibilities arising from its operations and is committed to 
responsible business practices. These improve the welfare of colleagues and the communities in which we operate, and reduce 
our impact on the environment.
Colleagues
It is the Group’s policy to involve colleagues in the business and to ensure that matters of concern to them, including the Group’s aims 
and objectives and its ﬁnancial performance, are communicated in an open and regular way and, where appropriate, colleagues’ 
views are taken into account. This is achieved through the use of business brieﬁngs and other less formal communication. The 
Directors encourage colleagues to become shareholders in order to promote active participation in, and commitment to, the 
Group’s success. This policy has been extended to all colleagues through the provision of a SAYE share scheme. 
As at 28 March 2014, the following number of colleagues were contributing monthly to the following schemes:
• 3,449 colleagues – 2013 SAYE scheme;
• 1,751 colleagues – 2012 SAYE scheme;
• 2,136 colleagues – 2011 SAYE scheme.
Booker is an inclusive organisation where no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, nationality, marital 
status, colour, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation or disability. The promotion of equal opportunities for all employees is 
regarded as an important Group priority. 
An analysis of Directors, senior managers and other employees by gender as at 28 March 2014 is as follows:-
Male 
Number
Female 
Number
Directors 9 2
Senior managers 57 7
Other employees 8,653 4,099
Community
The Group builds sustainable relationships primarily through improving its products and services, supplied to its customers, who 
are often independent businesses at the heart of their communities. Additional support provided this year has included:
• Each business centre, distribution centre and support centre has nominated a local charity to support. For the year ended 28 
March 2014, colleagues raised £85,814 for these charities; 
• Throughout the year the Group donated surplus food to local homeless charities from Booker business centres and distribution 
centres. The equivalent of 200,000 meals were donated to charities across the UK, with an additional 30 tonnes of food 
reprocessed for animal feed; 
• Floods and storms caused disruption throughout the winter of 2013/14 and many of our customers’ businesses were affected. 
Booker colleagues went the extra mile to maintain deliveries and support customers during this time. In addition, the Group 
established a fund of £350,000 to enable branches in the worst affected areas to support customers recovering from the 
damage. The following testimonials are from customers who have beneﬁted from this fund:
Kris Cruisers – Datchet, Surrey “Our family have run the business since 1966. The devastating floods at the start of this year 
caused us to close down for ﬁve weeks with the loss of eight weeks work. We have been overwhelmed by the generosity and 
support of Booker colleagues in assisting us to replace lost and damaged stock, which has meant we can open in time for 
Easter.” (Paul Clark, Owner)
The Willow Bistro – Perranporth, Cornwall “We opened our restaurant in September 2013 with no experience. Since then 
Booker have done so much for us, from the time we walked through the branch door, to the advice from the Catering Development 
Manager and the care and attention shown by the Area Manager has been superb. On 3 January we were flooded by the storms 
on the ﬁrst occasion. We had just recovered when a month later we were hit again. We can’t believe how helpful Booker and 
all the branch staff have been; they rallied round to support us and helped get us re-opened” (Janine & Stuart Branch, Owners) 11
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Blue Shed Coffee House – Sutton Green, Surrey “My business was badly impacted by the flooding and high winds which 
brought down power cables. I was unable to get to the branch for stock and, as we had lost power, a lot of stock was wasted. 
Booker kindly offered to replace the damaged stock free of charge, which was critical to me given my business is still young and 
growing. Many thanks from The Blue Shed Coffee House” (Paul Dickson, Owner)
Seaton Beach Café – Looe, Cornwall “I have owned Seaton Beach Cafe, near Looe in Cornwall, for the past ten years and have 
used Booker as one of my main suppliers from the very beginning. I have always been delighted with the service they provide and 
their friendly staff. Recently, we were severely affected by the storms and have spent months closed whilst we re-built the cafe. I 
was overwhelmed by the support that Booker showed me during this difﬁcult time, providing us with all sorts of products free of 
charge and lots of moral support” (Nicki Barry, Owner)
Environment – Carbon Reduction
Awards
The Carbon Trust Standard is a voluntary certiﬁcation and mark of excellence that enables organisations to demonstrate their 
success in cutting their carbon footprint. Booker obtained a third consecutive Carbon Trust Standard in 2013. This award 
demonstrates Booker’s long term commitment to successfully measuring, managing and reducing its carbon footprint consistently 
over a six year period. We were also awarded, in 2013, 2012 and 2010, “Green Wholesaler of the Year” at the Grocer Gold Awards, 
sponsored by the industry journal “The Grocer”.
Energy Efficiency 
The Group regularly reviews its operations to ensure that energy efﬁcient practices are put in place and continues to seek out 
innovative investments in sustainable technology. Examples are provided below: 
Business Centre Design
New and reﬁtted business centres have energy efﬁcient features included in their designs:
 • Maximum transparent roof area, light-sensitivity and occupancy controls and energy-efﬁcient lighting;
 • High efﬁciency heaters, timing controls and re-circulation fans; 
 • High thermal efﬁciency cold rooms; and
 • New cladding and rooﬁng to improve insulation.
Transport
The efﬁcient movement of stock is a key focus and we collaborate with suppliers to ﬁnd ways to reduce food miles from the total 
supply chain by minimising empty journeys. In a recent development, double deck vehicles have been introduced, which provide 
the capacity to load 44 pallets rather than the standard 26, reducing the number of delivery trips from our distribution centres to our 
business centres. During the year ended 28 March 2014, double deck deliveries were extended to nine business centres. 
Voltage Optimisation
Voltage Optimisation is a technology which, when ﬁtted to an incoming electrical supply, acts to reduce energy consumption. At 
March 2014, units had been installed in 75 Booker sites. During an initial measurement period (3 December 2013 to 27 February 
2014) the savings exceeded 10% of consumption in these sites compared to the prior year. 12

Environment – Waste Reduction and Recycling
Awards
The Carbon Trust Waste Standard is a new international waste standard that certiﬁes the waste reduction efforts of companies. 
We participated in the pilot for the new Standard in September 2013 and was the ﬁfth company in the UK (and the ﬁrst wholesaler) 
to receive this certiﬁcation. The Standard was awarded for achievements made in improving waste management over the three 
year period ended March 2013. Initiatives included: customer recycling services, donation of surplus food to local charities, 
prevention of waste, diversion of waste food to animal feed, and management of waste to landﬁll. 13
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Packaging Improvements
The Group reviews the packaging on its own brand products at every opportunity. This includes developing packaging to protect 
stock from damage thereby reducing food waste, reducing the weight of the packaging and better sealing of packs to extend 
shelf life.
Company Waste Reduction and Recycling
We continue to work to prevent waste, redistribute ﬁt for purpose food, increase recycling and divert waste away from landﬁll. 
We use the Government’s “waste hierarchy” which sets out 5 steps for dealing with waste ranked by their environmental impact, 
to ensure all waste is dealt with in the most environmentally positive way. During the last year we increased the volume of waste 
recycled and sent to recovery processes by 15% and reduced waste to landﬁll by 9%. 
We are an active contributor to the Institute of Grocery Distributors Product & Packaging Waste Prevention Group, whose aim is 
to prevent waste throughout the food industry. This has focused on delivering savings against a voluntary industry commitment 
to eliminate 200,000 tonnes of waste by the end of 2014. During 2013 we led the industry working group to increase redistribution 
of ﬁt for purpose food to charity and animal feed. 
Customer Packaging Recycling
In April 2012 our packaging recycling service was launched, and now over 9,000 customers are regularly using the service. 
Volumes of cardboard recycled in the year ended March 2014 are up 40% on prior year and feedback is very positive.
“The recycling service at Booker is a real life line for our business. Most of our waste is cardboard and without this service it would 
have gone to landﬁll; the service is absolutely invaluable!” (Mark Baravelli, Artisan Chocolatier, Conwy)
Customer Used Cooking Oil Recycling
Customers deposit used cooking oil at their local business centre or a collection can be arranged from their premises. The Group 
operates a simple rebate scheme per litre recycled. Approximately 7,000 customers are using the service and 2.5 million litres of 
waste oil have been recycled into sustainable bio fuels in the year ended March 2014. 
“The service is always good. Drivers are great and always friendly. It saves me time, money and is more convenient than 
transporting the oil to the branch myself” (Katie Smith , Proprietor, Oriel y Parc, Pembrokeshire)
Ethical Sourcing
We use Fair Trade and Farm Assurance schemes and all suppliers are required to complete a sustainability and ethics questionnaire. 
Examples of our approach are:
Sustainable Palm Oil: All Happy Shopper, Chef’s Larder and Euroshopper ranges of biscuits and snack products contain 
sustainable palm oil. 
Rain Forest Alliance: Happy Shopper Tea Bags have attained the Rain Forest Alliance standard. The 
Rainforest Alliance seal assures consumers that the product they are purchasing has been grown and 
harvested using environmentally and socially responsible practices.
Fair Trade: The Group continues to expand its range of catering products that are certiﬁed Fair Trade, with 
all Chef’s Larder tea and coffee products now being Fair Trade accredited. The Lichﬁeld Fair Trade range 
now has 22 products across tea, coffee, sugar and biscuits.
Red Tractor Farm Assured: The Red Tractor Farm Assurance scheme recognises good standards of 
animal welfare on UK livestock farms. The Group has 120 own label products displaying the red tractor logo 
across its retail and catering ranges and continues to work to widen the products covered by this standard. 14

The principal risks and corresponding mitigation set out below represent the principal uncertainties that the Board believes may 
impact the Group’s ability to deliver effectively its strategy in the future. The list does not include all risks that the Group faces and 
it does not list the risks in any order of priority.
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Increasing price 
competition in the  
UK grocery and  
discount sectors
A decline in selling prices could have 
an adverse impact on the Group’s sales 
and operating proﬁts.
We will continue to offer our customers even better choice, price 
and service supported by the continued delivery of the Makro 
synergy plans and our efﬁciency programmes.
Failure to respond to 
competition
This could have an adverse impact on 
the Group’s sales and operating proﬁts.
The industry is extremely competitive with the market being served 
by numerous competitors, ranging from national multiple retailers 
to regional independent wholesalers. The Group competes by 
closely monitoring the activities of competitors and ensuring it 
continues to improve the choice, price and service to its customers.
Changes in regulation Changing legislation may impact our 
ability to market or sell certain products 
or could cause the Group to incur 
additional costs or liabilities that could 
adversely affect its business.
The Group operates in an environment governed by strict 
regulations to ensure the safety and protection of customers, 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and the operation 
of an open and competitive market. These regulations include food 
hygiene, health and safety, data protection, the rules of the London 
Stock Exchange and competition law. In all cases, the Board 
takes its responsibilities very seriously, and recognises that any  
breach of regulation could cause reputational and ﬁnancial damage 
to the Group.
Product quality  
and safety
This could have an adverse  
impact on the Group’s reputation, sales 
and operating proﬁts.
The quality and safety of our products is of critical importance 
and any failure in this regard would affect the conﬁdence of 
our customers in us. We work with our suppliers to ensure the 
integrity of the products supplied. Food hygiene practices are 
taken very seriously throughout the Group, and are monitored 
both through internal audit procedures and by external bodies 
such as environmental health departments. We have well prepared 
procedures for crisis management in order to act quickly when 
required. We are aware that if we fail, or are perceived to have 
failed, to deliver to our customers’ satisfaction the expected 
standards of quality and safety in our products their loyalty to us 
may be potentially impacted. This in turn could adversely impact 
on our market share and our ﬁnancial results.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 15
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Strategic Report
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Risk Impact Mitigating factors
Employee engagement  
and retention
The continued success of the Group 
relies heavily on the investment in 
the training and development of our 
employees. 
The Group’s employment policies, remuneration and beneﬁts 
packages are designed to be competitive, as well as providing 
colleagues with fulﬁlling career opportunities. The Group 
continually engages with employees across the business to 
ensure that we keep strengthening our team at every level.
Supplier credit Availability of supplier credit is essential 
for the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. 
If the providers of credit insurance 
withdraw or materially reduce the levels 
of cover they provide, this might affect the  
Group’s ability to obtain products from 
those suppliers. 
The Group Finance Director regularly meets key credit  
insurers to ensure that they have an up to date view of  
the Group’s ﬁnancial position.
Pension funding A worsening funding position may 
require the Group to invest additional
cash contributions or provide further 
assurance to cover future liabilities.
The Group seeks to agree appropriate investment policies with 
the Trustee and closely monitors the funding position with the 
Trustee. Both the Company and the Trustee take advice from 
independent qualiﬁed actuaries.
Failure of the Group’s  
information technology  
systems
The maintenance and development of 
information technology systems may 
result in system failures, including cyber 
security breaches which may adversely 
impact the Group’s ability to operate. 
The Group has appropriate controls in place to mitigate the risk 
of systems failure, including systems back up procedures and 
disaster recovery plans, and also has appropriate virus protection 
and network security controls.

The Directors present their report and audited accounts for the 
52 week period ended 28 March 2014.
Much of the information previously provided as part of the 
Directors’ Report is now required to be presented as part 
of the Strategic Report. This Directors’ Report includes the 
information required to be given by the Companies Act 2006, 
or where provided elsewhere, an appropriate cross reference 
is given. 
Dividends
The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 2.75 
pence per ordinary share. If approved by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 9 July 2014, this final dividend  
will be payable on 11 July 2014 to shareholders on the register  
of members at the close of business on 13 June 2014.  
An interim dividend of 0.45 pence per share was paid on  
29 November 2013.
If the final dividend is approved by shareholders, dividends 
for the year will total 3.20 pence per ordinary share (2013: 
2.63 pence).
Return of Capital
The Company is proposing to implement a capital return to 
shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of 
approximately £61m based on the amount of issued share 
capital of the Company). It is proposed that this is achieved by 
the issue of a new class of B Shares which shareholders will be 
able to redeem for cash.
Interests of Directors in Contracts
During the period no Director had any material interest in any 
significant contract to which the Company or any subsidiary 
was a party.
Changes of Control
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions 
relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and 
awards normally vest and become exercisable on a change 
of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance 
conditions at that time. The Company is not a party to any 
other significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control following a takeover bid other than 
its bank facility agreement, which provides that on a change 
of control the lender shall not be obliged to fund a utilisation 
(except for a rollover loan) and, if it so requires, may cancel 
its commitment and declare its participation in all outstanding 
utilisations immediately due and payable. Further the Company 
is not party to any agreement with the Directors or employees 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or 
otherwise) that occurs as a result of a takeover bid other than 
with Charles Wilson, in that in the event of a change of control 
of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate 
his employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment 
equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Throughout the year ended 28 March 2014 and to the date of this document, the Company complied with the provisions and 
applied the Main Principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the “Code”).
This Corporate Governance Report, together with the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the 
Remuneration Report, describes how the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code.
The Role of the Board and its Committees 
The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’) chaired by Richard Rose. The Board currently consists 
of five Executive Directors and six Non-Executive Directors. 
Richard Rose was an Executive Director and Chairman of Blueheath immediately prior to the reverse acquisition of Blueheath by 
the Booker Group in 2007 and became Non-Executive Chairman of the Company upon completion of the merger. The Group’s 
combined business is significantly different to and larger than Blueheath and there is a division of responsibilities between Richard 
and the Executive Directors and, in particular, Charles Wilson as Chief Executive, such that his current and former roles can be 
considered incomparable. Having regard to all the circumstances, including the independence Richard has demonstrated as 
Chairman, the Board is satisfied and has determined that Richard is independent.
Consequently, all the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any 
business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement in accordance with 
the Code. The independence of Non-Executive Directors is considered at least annually and is based on the criteria suggested 
in the Code. The Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge and bring independence to the Board and its decision 
making process.
The Board believes that it is appropriate to have a Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Lord Bilimoria fulfils this role. 
He is available to shareholders where concerns have not been resolved through the normal channels and for when such contact 
would be inappropriate. 
The Board believes that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it is not so large as to be 
unwieldy. The Board contains a balance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors such that no individual, or group of individuals 
can dominate the Board’s decision making. No one individual has unfettered powers of decision. 
Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ biographies on pages 18 and 19.
The Board meets regularly on at least twelve scheduled occasions during each year and more frequently if necessary. There were 
twelve Board meetings, five Audit Committee meetings, two Nomination Committee meetings and five Remuneration Committee 
meetings held in the year under review and the attendance by Directors was as follows:

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the Group is appropriately managed and that it achieves its objectives. 
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and regulatory issues. At its meetings, the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses 
reports to shareholders. Matters not specifically reserved for the Board and its committees under its schedule of matters and the 
committees’ terms of reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated to members of the Executive Committee.
It is the Company’s policy that the roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate, with their roles and responsibilities 
clearly divided and set out in writing. The Chairman’s main responsibility is the leadership and management of the Board and its 
governance. The Chairman’s commitment to the Company is usually two days per month. His other significant commitments are 
disclosed in his biography on page 18. The Board considers that these commitments do not hinder his ability to discharge his 
responsibilities to the Company effectively.
The Chief Executive is responsible for the leadership and day-to-day management of the Group. This includes formulating and 
recommending the Group’s strategy for Board approval in addition to executing the approved strategy.
Recommendations for appointments to the Board are made by the Nomination Committee. The Committee follows Board 
approved procedures (available on our website) which provide a framework for the different types of Board appointments on 
which the Committee may be expected to make recommendations. Appointments are made on merit and against objective 
criteria with due regard to diversity (including skills, experience and gender). Non-Executive appointees are also required to 
demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to the role.
Information and Professional Development 
Directors are continually updated on the Group’s businesses, the markets in which they operate and changes to the competitive 
and regulatory environment through briefings to the Board and meetings with senior executives. Board visits to Group business 
locations enable the Directors to meet with local management and employees and to update and maintain their knowledge and 
familiarity with the Group’s operations.
Non-Executive Directors are also encouraged to visit Group operations throughout their tenure to increase their exposure to 
the business.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The provision of information 
to the Board was reviewed during the year as part of the performance evaluation exercise referred to below. To ensure that 
adequate time is available for Board discussion and to enable informed decision making, briefing papers are prepared and 
circulated to Directors in the week prior to scheduled Board meetings. All Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to make 
further enquiries as they feel appropriate of the Executive Directors and executives. In addition, Board committees are provided 
with sufficient resources and the power to co-opt such additional support as they may require from time to time, to undertake 
their duties. 
All Directors are entitled to receive independent professional advice at the Company’s expense and have access to the services 
of a professionally qualified and experienced Company Secretary, who is responsible for information flows to the Board and 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters. This ensures compliance with Board procedures and applicable laws and 
regulation. The Board has responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Company Secretary.
On appointment, individual Directors undergo an induction programme covering, amongst other matters:
• the business of the Group;
• their legal and regulatory responsibilities as directors of the Company;
• briefings and presentations from Executive Directors and senior executives;
• opportunities to visit business operations.
Performance Evaluation
An external evaluation process was conducted by the Institute of Directors in April 2013. The next externally facilitated board 
evaluation will be conducted in April 2016. 
During the year, the Board conducted an evaluation of its own performance and that of its three principal committees. The individual 
performance of the Non-Executive Directors was also evaluated through one to one interviews with the Chairman. In April 2014, 
each Director completed a questionnaire prepared by the Chairman and the Company Secretary to rate the collective performance 
of the Board and its committees. The Company Secretary collated the evaluation results and the Chairman then reviewed an 
unattributed executive summary, highlighting key outcomes. A report of the findings was then presented to and discussed by 
the Board. No actions were considered necessary as a result of these evaluations and the Chairman confirms that each Director 
continues to make a valuable contribution to the Board and, where relevant, its Committees and devotes sufficient time to the role.  22
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
During the year, the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors met in the absence of the Executive Directors. There was also 
one meeting of the Non-Executive Directors chaired by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director at which the Chairman 
was not present in order to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The Senior Independent Director provided feedback to the 
Chairman of this review.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee to oversee and debate 
issues of policy outside main Board meetings. Throughout the year, the Chairman of each committee provided the Board with 
a summary of key issues considered at the committee meetings. Board committees are authorised to engage the services of 
external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the Company’s expense. 
The Audit Committee Report is on pages 25 to 29, the Nomination Committee Report is on pages 30 to 31 and the Remuneration 
Report is on pages 32 to 49.
Re-election of Directors 
All Directors are required by the Company’s Articles of Association to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at the first 
Annual General Meeting after their appointment and thereafter by rotation at least once every three years. In accordance with the 
Code all directors will, however, stand for re-election annually. 
Relations with Shareholders 
In fulfilling their responsibilities, the Directors believe that they govern the Group in the best interests of shareholders, whilst having 
due regard to the interests of other stakeholders in the Group including customers, employees and suppliers. 
The Code encourages a dialogue with institutional shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. The Executive 
Directors have regular and ongoing communication with major shareholders throughout the year, by participating in investor 
roadshows and presentations to shareholders. Feedback from these visits is reported to the Board. The Executive Directors 
also have regular contact with analysts and brokers. The Chairman, Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and other Non-
Executive Directors receive reports on matters raised at the meetings with shareholders and are offered the opportunity to attend 
meetings with major shareholders. As a result of these procedures, the Non-Executive Directors believe that they are aware of 
shareholders’ views. During the year, the Chairman met with one shareholder. In addition, Lord Bilimoria, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director, is available to meet with major shareholders. No shareholders asked to meet with him during the year. 
Arrangements can also be made through the Company Secretary for major shareholders to meet with newly appointed Directors.
The Group maintains a website at www.bookergroup.com which is regularly updated and contains information about the Group. 
The Code encourages boards to use the Annual General Meeting to communicate with investors and to encourage their 
participation. In compliance with the Code, the Board welcomes as many shareholders as possible to attend the Annual General 
Meeting to discuss any interest or concern, including performance, governance or strategy, with the Directors. 
All Directors are expected to attend the Annual General Meeting. The Chairs of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder questions, through the Chairman of the Board, on 
the responsibilities and activities of their Committees. Shareholders also have the opportunity to meet with the Directors following 
the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting.
In compliance with the Code, at the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman will announce the level of proxies lodged on each 
resolution, the balance for and against and abstentions, and such details will be placed on the Group’s website following the 
meeting. A separate resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting in respect of each substantially separate issue. 
Directors’ Conflicts of Interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and section 175 of the Companies Act 2006, formal procedures for the 
notification and authorisation of potential and actual conflicts of interest have been approved by the Board. 
These procedures, which enable the Directors to impose limits or conditions when giving or reviewing authorisation, ensure 
that only Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered can authorise conflicts, and require the Board to review 
the register of Directors’ conflicts annually and on an ad-hoc basis when necessary. Any potential conflicts of interest in relation 
to newly appointed Directors are considered by the Board prior to appointment. These procedures have operated effectively 
throughout the current financial period.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED 23
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Internal controls and risk management 
The Board attaches considerable importance to, and acknowledges its responsibility for, the Group’s systems of internal control 
and risk management and receives regular reports on such matters. The Board’s policy is to have systems in place which 
optimise the Group’s ability to manage risk in an effective and appropriate manner. The Board has delegated to the Executive 
Committee detailed responsibility for identifying, evaluating and monitoring the risks facing the Group and for deciding how these 
are to be managed. In addition to formal reviews of risk management by the Executive Committee, members are expected to 
report to the Executive Committee as necessary the occurrence of any material control issues, serious accidents or events that 
have had a major commercial impact, or any significant new risks which have been identified. Such matters are reported to the 
next Board meeting and/or Audit Committee meeting as appropriate. 
The Group also has in place systems and procedures for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts which are monitored by the Audit Committee on the Board’s behalf and reviewed 
annually by the Board. These include:
• the formulation and deployment of Group accounting policies and procedures;
• Group policies governing the maintenance of accounting records, transaction reporting and key financial control procedures;
• monthly operational review meetings which include, as necessary, reviews of internal financial reporting issues and financial 
control monitoring; and
• ongoing training and development of financial reporting personnel. 
The Group’s systems and procedures are designed to identify, manage and, where practicable, reduce and mitigate the effects 
of the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They are not designed to eliminate such risk, recognising that any system can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board formally reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls on an annual basis. The 
latest review covered the financial year to 28 March 2014. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified from this review. 
The Board has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group. This process is continual and has 
been in place for the year under review up to the date of this report, and is regularly reviewed by the Board in accordance with 
relevant guidance. There is an established framework of internal controls, which is set out in procedures approved by the Board 
and which include financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. These procedures are readily accessible 
to staff, who follow their guidance. The more important elements of this framework are as follows: 
Management structure 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Company and the Executive Committee has responsibility for specific aspects of the 
Group’s affairs. The Board and each of its committees operate under a schedule of matters or terms of reference and the Board 
determines how the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee may operate within a framework of delegated authorities and 
reserved powers which seek to ensure that certain transactions which are significant in terms of their size or type, are undertaken 
only after Board review. 
The Executive Committee is chaired by Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and comprises Jonathan Prentis (Group Finance 
Director), Mark Aylwin (Managing Director – Booker Direct), Guy Farrant (Managing Director – UK Cash and Carry), Bryn Satherley 
(Operations Director), Mark Chilton (Company Secretary and General Counsel) and other senior executives representing the 
operational functions within the Group. It meets twice a month to discuss operational matters, compliance, health and safety and 
trading performance. 
Corporate accounting and procedures 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part of the corporate communication procedure. Accounting, 
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures, together with the general 
ethos of the Group are included in these communications, and standardised accounting policies are in place reflecting this policy. 
These procedures are subject to review to ensure that improvements to enhance controls can be made.  24
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Quality and integrity of personnel 
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training. Quality 
personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment and the ethical standards expected are communicated 
through senior members of staff. 
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget, which includes an assessment of key risk areas. Performance is monitored 
and relevant action taken throughout the year by regular reporting to the Board of updated forecasts together with information 
on key risk areas.
Risk management
The Board assesses risk management throughout the Group aided by detailed reviews of internal controls and risk  
management procedures. The Group’s risk register is reviewed by the Board as part of annual strategic planning and 
budgetary cycles.
Investment appraisal 
Capital expenditure is regulated by the use of authorisation levels. For all expenditure beyond specified levels, Board approval  
is required. 
Internal audit 
The Group’s internal audit function, which reports to the Group Finance Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, monitors 
the effectiveness of key internal controls and the adequacy of these controls to manage business risk and to safeguard the Group’s 
assets and resources, in accordance with a work plan approved and monitored by the Audit Committee. Its conclusions are 
communicated to the relevant level of management and the function has a direct reporting responsibility to the Audit Committee.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2014.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Audit Committee Report
I am pleased to report on the activities of the Committee for 2014, a year that has seen a number of regulatory changes which 
have reinforced the role of the Committee, on behalf of the Board, in ensuring that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.
In this report we have detailed how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities in relation to the three areas highlighted in 
the Code, namely:
• Addressing significant financial statement reporting issues;
• Addressing external audit effectiveness; and
• Appointing the external auditor and safeguards on their independence.
In addition, set out below are details of the processes we have in place to monitor the provision of non-audit services by 
and objectivity of our relationship with the external auditor and the role played by internal audit to ensure we have effective 
control processes. 
We also reviewed the Committee’s own terms of reference.
I will be available to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM to answer any questions relating to the role of the Committee.
On behalf of the Board.
Andrew Cripps
Chairman of the Audit Committee
21 May 2014 
Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting; monitoring the integrity of the 
financial statements and other announcements of financial results published by the Group; and reviewing and challenging as 
necessary the judgements and actions of management in relation to the financial statements. The Committee additionally reviews 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial control and financial risk management systems. The Committee also monitors 
and reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function and, on behalf of the Board, manages the appointment 
and remuneration of the external auditor as well as monitoring their performance and independence. The Group supports an 
independent and confidential whistle blowing procedure and the Committee monitors the operation of this facility.
Following publication of the revised version of the Code, which applies to financial years commencing on or after 1 October 2012, 
the Board requested that the Committee advise whether it believes the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference have been amended to reflect this requirement and can be found in the Investor Relations/
Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary.  26

of the Committee have the right to attend committee meetings, however, during the year, Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, 
Jonathan Prentis, Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives from KPMG, the External Auditor, were 
invited to attend meetings. The Committee also meets separately with the Head of Internal Audit and the External Auditor without 
management being present. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Audit Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Committee met five times during the year ended 28 March 2014. Members’ attendance record was as follows:
Attendance
Committee member Number of meetings attended Percentage attendance
Andrew Cripps (Chairman) 5 100%
Lord Bilimoria 5 100%
Stewart Gilliland 5 100%
Since 28 March 2014, the Audit Committee has met three times.
In respect of the year to 28 March 2014, the Committee reviewed the Preliminary Results Announcement for the period to 29 
March 2013, the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts, the Interim Results Announcement for the period to 13 September 2013 and 
Interim Management Statements in the twelve weeks to 29 March 2013, the twelve weeks to 21 June 2013, the twelve weeks to 
13 September 2013 and the sixteen weeks to 3 January 2014 and made recommendations to the Board. In carrying out these 
reviews, the Committee considered:
• Whether the Group had applied appropriate accounting policies and practices both on a year on year basis and across  
the Group;
• the significant areas in which judgement had been applied in preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out on pages 62 to 66. 
• reports from the Group Finance Director and the External Auditor;
• the clarity and completeness of disclosures and compliance with relevant financial reporting standards and corporate 
governance and regulatory requirements; and 
• whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Committee also:
• approved the internal and External Auditor’s work plans for the Group;
• considered periodic reports from the Head of Internal Audit on their work;
• reviewed the External Auditor’s independence and objectivity, the effectiveness of the audit process, the re-appointment of  
the External Auditor and approved the External Auditor’s remuneration; 
• approved the appropriateness of the External Auditor providing non-audit services and related fees; and
• recommended revisions to the Board in the Committee’s terms of reference. 27

Significant Judgemental Areas
The significant areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year to 28 March 2014 and 
how these were addressed are outlined below.
In addition, each of these areas received particular focus from the External Auditor, who provided detailed analysis and assessment 
of the matters in their report to the Committee.
Acquisition Accounting in relation to Makro Holding Limited and its Subsidiaries (“Makro”)
On 4 July 2012 the Group acquired the share capital of Makro. The transaction was subject to approval by the competition 
authorities and full clearance was not received from the Competition Commission until 19 April 2013. Makro was then consolidated 
in the Group’s results from that date. We are required to fair value Makro’s assets and liabilities at the date of consolidation. There 
is an exercise of judgement involved in identifying and valuing the consideration and assets acquired in a business combination. 
The Committee assessed the processes used in the identification and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including the 
reasonableness of assumptions used. The Committee also assessed the allocation of consideration between goodwill and 
identified intangible assets. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements exercised were appropriate.
Property Provisions
The Group has recorded property provisions in the sum of £25.5m as outlined in note 20 to the financial statements, which, by 
their nature, are uncertain and highly judgemental. We scrutinised the key elements of judgement with management to assure 
ourselves as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the provisions. Following this review, we were satisfied that the judgements 
exercised were appropriate. As part of the year end audit, KPMG considered the nature of the provisions, the potential outcomes, 
any developments relating to specific claims, and the prior history of lease obligations, provisions and claims in order to assess 
whether the provisions recorded were appropriate.
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme Accounting
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, as outlined in note 19 to the financial statements. 
Although the defined benefit scheme is closed to future accrual it is sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions. We challenged 
the valuations prepared by the Group’s pension advisors and, following discussions with management, were satisfied that the 
judgements exercised were appropriate. During their audit, KPMG evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used by the 
Group’s actuarial advisors and assessed whether the assumptions made were appropriate and not materially different from external 
benchmarks. KPMG reported to us on the assumptions used and with the way that our schemes had been accounted for. 
Following discussions with the External Auditor, and the deliberations set out above, we were satisfied that the financial statements 
dealt appropriately with each of the areas of significant judgement.
The External Auditor also reported to the Committee on any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work. The 
Committee noted their work and were satisfied that no material amounts required adjustment.
Fair, Balanced and Understandable Assessment
One of the key compliance requirements of a group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. The coordination and review of Group wide contributions into the Annual Report and Accounts 
follows a well established and documented process, which is performed in parallel with the formal process undertaken by the 
External Auditor.
The Committee received a summary of the approach taken by management in the preparation of the 2014 Annual Report 
and Accounts to ensure that it met the requirements of the Code and our Terms of Reference. This, and our own scrutiny of 
the document, enabled the Committee, and then the Board, to confirm that the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts taken as a 
whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Internal Controls
The Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls 
and financial risk management systems. Within this, the Committee continued to focus on the control environment in the evolving 
business in India.
In carrying out these responsibilities, the Committee reviewed reports issued by both Internal Audit and the External Auditor and 
held regular discussions with the Group Finance Director, the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the External Auditor.  28
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Internal Audit
The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function including 
its focus, plans, activities and resources.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee reviewed and approved the Internal Audit plan for the year having considered 
the principal areas of risk in the business and the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function. During the year, 
the Committee received regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings from the work of Internal Audit and 
the responses from management to deal with the findings. The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of the action 
plans on significant findings to ensure these are completed satisfactorily. 
External Audit
It is the responsibility of the Committee to monitor the performance, objectivity and independence of the External Auditor. In 
February 2014, we met with KMPG, the External Auditor, to agree the audit plan for the year, highlighting the key financial 
statement and audit risks, to ensure that the audit was appropriately focused. In addition, KPMG’s letter of engagement was 
reviewed by the Committee in advance of the audit.
In May 2014, in advance of the finalisation of the Group’s financial statements, we received a report from KPMG on their key audit 
findings, which included the key areas of risk and significant judgements referred to above, and discussed the issues with them in 
order for the Committee to form a judgement on the financial statements. In addition, we considered the Letter of Representation 
that the External Auditor requires from the Board.
At least once a year, we meet with the External Auditor privately to discuss any matters they may wish to raise without management 
being present.
Assessment of Effectiveness of External Audit
The Committee reviewed KPMG’s performance and on-going independence, taking into account input from management, 
consideration of responses to questions from the Committee and the audit findings reported to the Committee. As part of the 
process, the Committee reviewed the feedback from the Public Report on the Audit Quality Inspection of KPMG, issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) in May 2013.
Based on all of this information the Committee concluded that the external audit process was operating effectively and KPMG 
continued to prove effective in its role as External Auditor.
The current External Auditor, KPMG Audit Plc, were first appointed in 2005 and the external audit has not been tendered since 
then. The Committee, does however review the relationship the Company has with KPMG annually.
The External Auditor is required to rotate the audit partner every five years. The most recent change occurred in the year to  
March 2011 and, therefore, partner rotation is due after the March 2015 audit.
The Committee, having completed the activities outlined, remains confident that the effectiveness and independence of the 
External Auditor is not impaired in any way. There are no contractual restrictions on the choice of external auditor. For the 
year ended 28 March 2014, the Committee was satisfied with the performance, objectivity and independence of KPMG as the 
External Auditor. 
KPMG LLP has requested that it be appointed as the Company’s External Auditor, following a decision to wind down KPMG 
Audit Plc as part of a KPMG internal reorganisation. Pursuant to section 519 of the Companies Act 2006, KPMG Audit Plc have 
informed the Company that they are not seeking reappointment and have provided a statutory statement of circumstances upon 
ceasing to hold office. 
The Committee, having satisfied itself as to the appropriateness of this change, has therefore recommended to the Board and to 
shareholders that KPMG LLP should be appointed as the Company’s External Auditor at the AGM on 9 July 2014. 
The Committee will continue to assess the effectiveness and independence of the External Auditor. In doing so, the Committee 
will consider a formal tender process in accordance with the provisions of the Code. We will comply with FRC’s Guidance to Audit 
Committees issued in September 2012 and the Competition Commission Order relating to the statutory audit market for FTSE 
350 companies, which is expected to come into effect from 1 October 2014. Under the proposed transitional arrangements, the 
Committee expects a formal tender process to be held no later than two years from the end of the current audit engagement 
partner rotation period. As partner rotation is due after the March 2015 audit, a tender process is expected to be held no later 
than March 2017. 29
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Non-Audit Services
The Committee recognises the potential for any non-audit services to compromise auditor independence and the External 
Auditor is not permitted to conduct any assignment which may affect objectivity or independence. Subject to this, where it is 
helpful to the Group for KPMG to provide assistance, the Committee monitor the services provided and fees charged.
Non-audit work comprised small assignments to assist with tax compliance and other matters for aggregate fees of £144,000. 
The Committee believes that there are sound commercial and practical reasons for this work being conducted by the External 
Auditor and that it is not of a nature which would affect their independence as External Auditor. 
Whistleblowing Programme
The Group has a whistleblowing programme in all of its operations whereby employees can, in confidence, report on matters 
where they feel a malpractice is taking place, or if health and safety standards are being compromised. Additional areas that are 
addressed by this procedure include criminal activities, improper or unethical behaviour and risks to the environment.
The programme allows employees to raise their concerns with their line manager or, if that is inappropriate, to raise them on a 
confidential basis. An externally facilitated confidential helpline and confidential email facility are provided to protect the identity of 
employees in these circumstances. Any concerns are investigated on a confidential basis by the Human Resources Department 
and/or the Company Secretary and feedback is given to the person making the complaint as appropriate via the confidential email 
facility. An official written record is kept of each stage of the procedure and reported to the Committee. 
Committee Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee is reviewed on an annual basis by both the Board and the Committee itself. Both reviews 
concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively and efficiently.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2014.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Nomination Committee Report
I am pleased to present the Report of the Nomination Committee for 2014. This Report provides shareholders with an overview 
of the activities carried out during the year. Last year we appointed Helena Andreas as a new Non-Executive Director. This year 
we made no changes to the Board, although we did renew the terms of three of our Non-Executive Directors; Lord Bilimoria, 
Andrew Cripps and Stewart Gilliland. This was our primary focus, along with reviewing the terms of reference of the Committee. 
On behalf of the Board.
Richard Rose
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
21 May 2014
Role and Responsibilities of the Committee
The Committee has defined Terms of Reference which were reviewed in October 2013 and can be found in the Investor Relations/
Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the Company Secretary. The Committee is 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of additional Directors and for reviewing the size, 
structure and composition of the Board and the membership of Board committees to ensure that they have the necessary range 
of competencies, knowledge and experience required for the direction and oversight of the business.
Membership
The Committee is chaired by Richard Rose, the Chairman, and also comprises Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps, all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Richard Rose does not chair the Committee when it is dealing with his re-appointment or 
the evaluation of his performance and no member of the Committee participates in discussions concerning or votes on his own 
re-appointment or evaluation of his own performance. Details of the skills and experience of the Directors are contained in the 
Directors’ biographies on pages 18 and 19. Their remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report. 
The quorum necessary for the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be a Non-Executive Director. Only members 
of the Committee have the right to attend committee meetings, however, during the year, Charles Wilson (Chief Executive) and 
Stewart Gilliland (Non-Executive Director) were invited to attend meetings. 
The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee.
Meeting Frequency and Main Activities in the Year
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year ended 28 March 2014 to:
• Review the Committee’s report within the 2013 Annual Report and recommend approval to the Board;
• Review the size, structure and composition of the Board; 
• Recommend to the Board that Lord Bilimoria, Andrew Cripps and Stewart Gilliland be re-appointed as Non-Executive 
Directors; and
• Review and recommend to the Board the revised Terms of Reference of the Committee. 31
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
As part of its review of the composition of the Board, the Committee focused in particular on the performance and independence 
of each of Lord Bilimoria, Andrew Cripps and Stewart Gilliland as the appointment of each of these Non-Executives was due for 
renewal and each of them had confirmed his willingness to be re-appointed. 
Following a rigorous review, the Committee concluded that, notwithstanding Lord Bilimoria’s and Andrew Cripps’ length of service 
(six years as Non-Executive Directors of the Company), both Lord Bilimoria and Andrew Cripps were still independent in character 
and judgement. The same judgement was reached in respect of Stewart Gilliland. Accordingly, the Committee recommended to 
the Board that each of these independent Non-Executive Directors be proposed for re-appointment as a director of the Company 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Neither Lord Bilimoria nor Andrew Cripps participated in the Committee’s evaluation 
of his own performance or the recommendation relating to his re-appointment.
Members’ attendance record was as follows:
Attendance
Committee member Number of meetings attended Percentage attendance
Richard Rose (Chairman) 2 100%
Lord Bilimoria 2 100%
Andrew Cripps 2 100%
Board Composition/Succession
The Board plans for its own succession, with the support of the Committee. The Committee remains focused, on behalf of the 
Board, on Board succession planning for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors. As part of this planning, the Board has 
made valuable additions in terms of strength, skills and experience to progressively refresh the Board. By way of example, since 
June 2009, four Directors have joined the Board and two Directors have left the Board.
The Committee aims to ensure that:
• the succession pipeline for senior executive and business critical roles in the organisation is adequate;
• processes are in place to identify potential successors and manage succession activity;
• there is a structured approach to developing and preparing possible successors; and
• processes are in place to identify “at risk” posts. 
Diversity
We value diversity in the Boardroom and see it as a wider topic than simply gender. Our Directors come from different backgrounds 
and each brings unique capabilities and perspectives to our discussions, with a wide range of professional and geographical 
backgrounds. We are committed to maintaining a diverse Board. Appointments to the Board and throughout the Group will 
continue to be made on merit and overall suitability for the role against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity 
(including skills, experience and gender). The Committee at the present time has not determined to set targets for the number of 
women on the Board. Statistical employment data for the Group can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on 
page 10.
Board Composition
As in previous years, as part of the Company’s annual evaluation of Board performance, all Directors were consulted on the 
composition of the Board, and were of the view that it has sufficient members to contain a balance of skills and experience, but it 
is not so large as to be unwieldy. The Board contains a balance of executive and non-executive directors such that no individual, 
or group of individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. No one individual has unfettered powers of decision. As such, 
no additional appointment is considered necessary at the present time.
Committee Performance and Effectiveness
The Board additionally undertook an annual review of the Committee’s performance and effectiveness and concluded that the 
Committee operated effectively.
This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 21 May 2014.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Chairman’s Introduction to the Remuneration Report
I am pleased to present the Report of the Remuneration Committee for 2014, which sets out the remuneration paid to the 
Directors in the financial year ended 28 March 2014 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
This year sees the introduction of a binding shareholder vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (see pages 34 to 42) in addition 
to the advisory vote on the Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration (see pages 43 to 48). The format of the Remuneration 
Report is broadly the same as last year, the Remuneration Committee having agreed to adopt some of the key requirements of 
the then draft new rules in advance of the formal regulations coming into force this year.
Our Remuneration Policy remains largely unchanged from last year. In presenting the policy, the Committee aims to ensure 
that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the new regulations, whereby: Directors should not be rewarded 
for failure and incentives for Directors and executives should be closely linked to performance, thus aligning the interests of 
Directors, executives and shareholders; and Directors’ rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of 
the business. The Committee believes that the Company’s remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining 
and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business. 
Alignment between the Directors, executives and shareholders is also significantly increased by personal shareholdings. Directors, 
executives and colleagues own in aggregate over 7% of the issued share capital of the Company outright. 
The Committee is of the view that we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses and long term incentives which are 
aligned to the creation of shareholder value. We are satisfied that the outcomes have reflected business performance.
The Committee believes that this remuneration system has a proven track record of encouraging strong performance, does not 
reward failure and reflects the Company’s overall goal of creating value for shareholders.
Moreover, we believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework in place is working well to support the Company’s 
strategy, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders. 
The Board recommends this Directors’ Remuneration Policy to shareholders. It will provide the framework to allow us to recruit, 
motivate and retain the talent the Company needs and to ensure the alignment of executive remuneration with the creation of 
value for shareholders.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at this year’s AGM.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 21 May 2014.

Key Remuneration Principles
The principles supporting the Executive Directors’ reward packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they continue to 
underpin the Group’s strategy. 
The Committee’s overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages. The Company 
wishes to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and executives of the requisite quality. Accordingly, the Committee’s 
policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which reward Executive Directors and executives fairly for 
their contribution. The Committee will take into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when 
determining Executive Directors’ remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.  34

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The policy for Executive Directors, set out below, will apply from the date of the 2014 AGM (subject to approval), and is  
available to view in the Investor Relations/Investor Centre/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be 
obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee will consider the remuneration policy annually to ensure that it continues to underpin the Group’s strategy. It 
is, however, intended that the policy set out below will apply for three years from the 2014 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to 
approve any amendments to the policy during that three year period.

Committee considers:
• Business and individual performance;
•  Current remuneration against internal  
and external benchmarks; and
•  Average salary increases for the wider 
Company workforce.
When external benchmarking is used,  
the comparator groups are chosen  
having regard to:
•  Size – market capitalisation, turnover, 
profits and the number of employees;
• Diversity and complexity of the business.
Over the policy period, salaries for current 
Executive Directors will broadly increase in 
line with the range of increases applying to 
the employee population, other than where 
there is a change in role or responsibility, 
where there are major changes within 
the Group or where a significant variance 
to the market arises, that warrants a 
more significant increase, or where the 
Committee judges that there is a risk in 
relation to attracting or retaining Executive 
Directors. Any such changes, should they 
occur, will be fully explained to shareholders 
in the next Remuneration Report.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive 
Directors may on occasion have their 
salaries set below the benchmark policy 
level while they become established in the 
role. In such cases, salary increases may be 
higher than the employee population until 
the target positioning is achieved.

Notes to Future Policy Table
Bonus 
The Earnings before interest and tax (“EBIT”) bonus scheme, which is consistent with the FY14 bonus scheme, covers Executive 
Directors, executives, branch managers and sales teams, comprising approximately 1,700 colleagues of the Group. The aggregate 
bonus pool is determined each year by the level of improvement in Group EBIT year on year and no bonus is paid unless 
there is an improvement. The maximum bonus achievable for an Executive Director is 100% of basic salary. Charles Wilson, 
Chief Executive, does not participate in this bonus scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with 
shareholder interests which arise from his significant shareholding in the Company. Payments to Executive Directors are based 
upon a percentage of basic salary and do not form part of pensionable earnings. The proportion of the bonus pool accruing to 
Executive Directors is less than 15%. 
PSP 
The PSP scheme allows Executive Directors and approximately 1,000 employees to receive share awards, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three year period. Awards are made annually and, 
other than in exceptional circumstances, will not be more than 150% of annual salary for Executive Directors.
For the 2011/14 PSP cycle, the performance measures were share price based. Details of structure and outcome are set out on 
page 44.
For the 2012/15 and 2013/16 PSP cycle, the Committee resolved to grant maximum awards at 150% of base salary for the 
Executive Directors. Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight line basis, as follows:
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting at 8% growth per 
annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting for 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 years from 
the award date.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Future Policy Table continued 37
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
• 50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving 
Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as 
measured between March 2012 and March 2015 and March 2013 and March 2016.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account the TSR returns achieved by companies in the 
FTSE350 commencing with the three year period to May 2002 and then walking forward on a weekly basis with the last data point 
being the returns of each company through to July 2012.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the PSP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
The performance measures for the 2014/17 cycle for the Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson) are expected to be similar 
to the 2013/16 PSP cycle.
Fixed and Variable Pay Mix
Individual reward elements for all Executive Directors (excluding Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, who does not participate in 
any incentive schemes) are designed to provide a balance between fixed remuneration and variable “at risk” reward, linked to 
the performance of the Company. Charles Wilson, Chief Executive, has chosen from the outset not to participate in the bonus 
scheme. The Committee views this as appropriate given the alignment with shareholder interests which arises from his significant 
shareholding in the Company.
Illustrative scenarios
Below is an illustration of the value that could be received by each Executive Director under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in respect of 2015, showing:
• minimum, which comprises base salary, benefits and employer pension contributions only (equivalent to 15% of base salary) 
(total fixed pay);
• on-target, which includes total fixed pay and assumes an on-target award for the Bonus (50% of salary) and 50% of maximum 
PSP vesting; 
• maximum, which includes total fixed pay and a maximum award under the Bonus (100% of salary) and 100% of maximum 
PSP vesting; 
• the salaries included are those that will apply from 1 April 2014. The benefit values included are estimates. The amounts shown 
in relation to Bonus and PSP do not take account of any share price appreciation or depreciation; and
• the PSP vesting is calculated using a share price of 166.7p being the closing share price on 28 March 2014.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Use of Discretion by Remuneration Committee
Malus in Incentive Plans
The Committee has the discretion under both the Bonus scheme and the PSP to claw back bonus and unvested share awards 
in the following circumstances:
• misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to the Company’s prospects, finances or brand reputation; 
and/or
• actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.
Other Uses of Discretion
The Committee will operate the Company’s incentive plans according to their respective rules, the policy set out in the table above 
and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
The Committee retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the incentive plans. These 
include, but are not limited to, determining who participates in the incentive plans, the time and size of awards, measurement of 
performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction and the adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. 
rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends). The discretions that can be applied in the 
case of leavers under the Bonus and PSP are set out in the section on ‘Policy on Payment for Loss of Office’ on page 39.
Any exercises of discretion by the Committee will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee will also use its judgement as to what is appropriate within the terms of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy,  
to make decisions that do not involve the exercise of discretion.
Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
The remuneration of any new Executive Director will be determined in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
the elements that would be considered by the Company for inclusion are:
•  salary and benefits, including defined contribution pension participation and relocation costs, where appropriate;
•  participation in the Bonus: pro-rated for the year of recruitment to reflect the proportion of the year remaining after the date of 
commencement of employment. 
•  participation in the PSP: awards would be granted on the same terms and subject to the same performance conditions as 
those which apply to PSP awards granted to existing Executive Directors in the year of recruitment.
The maximum annual level of variable remuneration that may be granted to a newly recruited Executive Director (excluding any 
awards to compensate for incentives forgone on recruitment) would be in line with that of the existing Executive Directors:
•  Bonus award: maximum 100% of salary; and
•   PSP award: maximum 400% of salary for a full PSP cycle commencing after appointment, plus pro-rated awards in relation to 
PSP cycles outstanding at the time of recruitment (up to a further 150% of salary).
In addition, the Committee may, in its discretion, compensate a newly recruited Executive Director for incentives forgone from 
a previous employment as a result of their resignation. The Committee would seek validation of the value of any potential 
incentives forgone.
Awards made by way of compensation for incentives forgone would be made on a comparable basis, taking account of 
performance achieved (or likely to be achieved), the proportion of the performance period remaining and the form of the award. 
Compensation would, as far as possible, be in the form of awards under the PSP in order to immediately align a new Executive 
Director with Company performance. 39
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Policy on Payment for Loss of Office
Contractual Notice Period and Pay in Lieu
All current Executive Directors have a rolling service contract with a notice period from the company of 12 months. As an 
alternative, the Company may, at its discretion, pay in lieu of that notice. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given 
in the event of gross misconduct.
Payment in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ pension 
contributions, and other contractual benefits. Where possible, the Company will seek to ensure that where a leaver mitigates 
their losses by, for example, finding new employment, there will be a corresponding reduction in compensation payable for loss 
of office. The Company’s approach to the termination of contracts of service of Executive Directors is dictated by the relevant 
events, bearing in mind the circumstances of termination and the interests of the Company. A bonus element is not normally 
included in the termination payment, however, if the Company enforces the non-compete clause, up to 12 months on target 
bonus will be payable.
An Executive Director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under relevant employment 
legislation in the UK.
Under Charles Wilson’s contract, in the event of a change of control of the Company, Charles Wilson has the right to terminate his 
employment on 30 days’ notice and to receive a payment equal to his gross salary for his contractual notice period. 
Termination by Mutual Agreement
In certain circumstances it can be in the best interests of the Company for the Board to proactively manage succession planning 
and the development of the senior talent pipeline. In such circumstances, the Board may agree that an executive’s departure will 
be by mutual agreement. In order for this to apply, the Committee will need to be satisfied that the executive has demonstrated 
performance in line with expectations and where required they should have contributed to an orderly succession. The Company’s 
experience is that this approach is successful and has previously enabled the Company to recruit a former Executive Director to 
lead Makro on an interim basis immediately after its acquisition.
An Executive Director terminated by mutual agreement will be treated as a “good leaver” for the purposes of the Bonus and PSP 
plans. If the termination date falls during the financial year, they will be eligible to be paid a pro-rated on target bonus and if they 
are employed at the end of the financial year, the bonus payable would be based on actual results.
Other than as set out above, the Committee does not anticipate using the discretion provided by the Bonus and PSP plan  
rules in respect of termination payments. There may, however, be unforeseen circumstances where this is in the best interests  
of the Company and its shareholders. Where such discretion is exercised, explanations will be provided in the next 
Remuneration Report. 40

The Committee would only exercise the discretions available in the Bonus and PSP plan rules relating to:
• whether an award is made or an unvested award forfeited; and
•  the extent and timing of any such award or forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example permanent disablement.
Notice periods would not usually be included when calculating the pro-rata amount of Bonus and PSP awards that vest. The 
Committee would only exercise its discretion to include some or all of the notice period in such calculation in exceptional 
circumstances, such as ill health, and would not do so in circumstances of poor performance.
The Committee has the discretion to determine that an individual should be treated as a Good Leaver for the purposes of the 
PSP. In exercising such discretion the Committee will consider factors such as personal performance and conduct, overall Group 
performance and the specific circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure including, but not restricted to, whether the 
Executive Director is leaving by mutual agreement with the Company. If an individual is not a Good Leaver then they will be treated 
as an Other Leaver, as set out above.
Committee Interaction with Stakeholders
The Committee engages with shareholders on remuneration matters. Discussions were held with a number of shareholders and 
with shareholder representative organisations over the year.
Legacy Arrangements
The Committee reserves the right to honour any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office not in line with the policy 
set out above where the terms of those payments were (i) entered into with current or former directors before this policy came 
into effect or (ii) at a time when the relevant executive was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, 
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes payments of variable remuneration under the Bonus scheme and the PSP in line with 
the terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted.
The Committee may make minor changes to this policy, which do not have a material advantage to Directors, to aid its operation 
or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders but without the need to seek shareholder approval. 41
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Consideration of Employment Conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration for its Executive Directors. 
Salary increases for Executive Directors will broadly increase in line with the general workforce other than when there is a change 
in role or responsibility, or a significant variance to the market arises, warranting a larger increase.
Newly promoted or recruited Executive Directors to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the benchmark 
policy level while they become established in role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than the general workforce until 
the target positioning is achieved.
Group employees’ salaries are compared to cross-industry standards to ensure fair pay for that job. The Company does 
not directly consult with employees as part of the process of determining Directors’ remuneration. While formal comparison 
measurements were not used in determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee made decisions in the knowledge 
of incentive arrangements of the rest of the Group, upon which the Committee is briefed regularly.
Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors is consistent with that of other senior employees. This group of 
approximately 1,700 people also participates in and receives payments under the EBIT Bonus scheme. Eligibility to participate in 
the PSP extends to a similar set of around 1,000 employees in total.
Outside the senior employees’ group, the composition of remuneration differs. Of the Group’s average 13,000 employees, 
over 9,000 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on “customer satisfaction”. Customer satisfaction is measured 
independently by calling 10,000 customers selected at random covering retailers, caterers, delivered and collect across our 202 
branches each quarter to ask them to rate key areas of service. 
Around 1,300 logistics employees are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency 
targets at the site at which they are employed. 
In addition from time to time certain incentive arrangements may be introduced for executives and colleagues in order to achieve 
particular objectives.
Eligibility for, and participation in, benefits and incentive plans differs depending on location, seniority, length of service and other factors.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods for Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling service contracts with a notice period of 12 months. All new 
appointments will have 12-month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, 
a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used.
This is in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM.
Details of Current Executive Directors’ Contracts
The table below summarises the service contracts of the Executive Directors.
Copies of the service contracts will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during business hours and at

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
External Appointments 
Executive Directors are not permitted to hold directorships or offices of companies whose shares are listed on a recognised stock 
exchange and, accordingly, no Executive Director serves as a Non-Executive Director of any such company.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors
The policy for Non-Executive Directors will apply for three years from the date of the 2014 AGM (subject to approval), and is 
available to view in the Investor Relations/Legal Documents section of the Group’s website. A copy may be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.
Shareholders will be asked to approve any changes to the policy during that three year period. The Non-Executive Directors do 
not receive bonuses or pension contributions and are not entitled to participate in any of the Company’s share schemes.

•  The time commitment and responsibilities of the role;
•  Current remuneration against external  
benchmarks; and
•  Average salary increases for the wider 
Company workforce.
When external benchmarking is used, the  
comparator groups are chosen having regard to:
•  Size – market capitalisation, turnover, profits  
and the number of employees;
• Diversity and complexity of the business.
An additional fee is paid for acting as chairman of a

The Board has determined that the time commitment of Non-Executive Directors should be 12 days per annum, other than the 
Chairman whose time commitment should be 24 days per annum. The time commitment for Non-Executive Directors is set out 
in the relevant Non-Executive Director’s letter of appointment. 
Non-Executive Directors are entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in carrying out their duties as 
Directors of the Company. 
Details of Letters of Appointment and Notice Periods for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of 3 years subject to termination on one month’s 
notice. In addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that all Non-Executive Directors stand for re-election annually.  
Non-Executive Director appointments are also subject to the Articles of Association of the Company.

Notes to Single total figure of remuneration – Executive Directors
• Salary – salary received in the year.
• Taxable benefits – all taxable benefits in kind arising from the individual’s employment in 2013.
• Bonus – the bonus relating to the Company’s performance in 2013, paid in 2014.
• PSP – Based on the share price at the date of actual vesting.
• No PSP options were awarded to Directors in 2009. This was considered and reflected in determining the value of the 
award granted in the following year. All performance conditions attached to these awards were met in full and the awards 
subsequently vested in October 2013. Guy Farrant received a ‘signing-on bonus’ including a special performance award in 
October 2010, part of which vested in 2012 with the remainder vesting in 2013. 
• Pension Benefits – the value of Company contributions to pension plans or any cash allowances paid in lieu of  
pension contributions.
• No consideration was paid to third parties for making available the services of any person as a Director of the Company during the year. 
Bonus (audited information)
The level of pre-bonus earnings before interest and tax (“EBIT”) achieved in 2014 gave rise to the following awards to the  
Executive Directors:
Director EBIT award as % of salary
Jonathan Prentis 61.20%
Mark Aylwin 61.20%
Guy Farrant 61.20%
Bryn Satherley 61.20%
The EBIT bonus scheme covers approximately 1,700 colleagues, including the Executive Directors, (other than Charles Wilson). 
The scheme has been in operation since 2007 (albeit that up to 2012 it was based on increases in earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) and is targeted on increasing the Group EBIT year on year. The Group EBIT increase of £22.5m to 
£120.4m resulted in a bonus being awarded to Executive Directors of 61.20% of salary. The maximum bonus payable under the 
scheme to Executive Directors was 100% of salary, had the Group EBIT exceeded £134.6m, an uplift on prior year of £36.7m. If 
EBIT had not increased year on year no bonus would have been paid. Bonus is paid on basic salary as at 31 March each year. The 
proportion of the total scheme bonus pool accruing to Executive Directors was less than 15%, in accordance with the Company’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 44

a) PSP Options Granted in 2010
In October 2010, the Company made awards under the PSP in relation to a total of 11.3m new Ordinary Shares. The performance 
conditions specified that a quarter of each option would vest upon reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 
90p, in each case sustained over a consecutive 60-day period. All four share price conditions were met and the options became 
exercisable three years from the date of the award. The options will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration continued
Participation
As well as the Executive Directors, approximately 1,000 employees have been granted PSP options. In addition 3,449 employees 
participate in the 2013 SAYE scheme, 1,751 employees participate in the 2012 SAYE scheme and 2,136 participate in the 2011 
SAYE scheme. The Executive Directors have chosen not to participate in any of the current SAYE schemes. 
The high number of employees participating in these schemes is consistent with the Group’s policy of ensuring that the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders. 
Since 2007, when the reverse takeover of Blueheath was completed and the Company became admitted to trading on AIM, the 
equity value of the Company has increased from approximately £300m to over £2.6bn as at 21 May. The value of the PSP options 
awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
Statement of Directors’ Shareholdings (audited information)
Alignment to shareholder interests is a key element of the Group’s remuneration policy which maintains commitment over the 
long term and ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. The Committee sets 
shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors. The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal (and/or 
spousal) holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least the Executive Director’s annual base salary. All of the 
Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines. Details of the share interests of all Executive Directors are shown below.

Relative Performance Graph
The Company’s performance from 27 March 2009 to 28 March 2014 measured by Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’), is compared 
in the chart below with the performance of the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) and FTSE AIM All Share Index. 
These are considered the most appropriate indices against which to measure performance following the reverse acquisition 
of Blueheath in June 2007, which was at that time listed on AIM, the Company’s admission to listing on the Official List and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange plc’s main market for listed securities in July 2009 and its inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index 
in December 2009. 
TSR is defined as the return a shareholder would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends over 
a period of time. Assuming dividends are reinvested into the Company’s shares, it measures the percentage growth in the 
Company’s share price together with any dividends paid. 
The closing mid market price of an Ordinary Share on 28 March 2014 was 166.7p and the price range during the year was  
116.4p to 176.5p.

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Governance
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the 
group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
• the Strategic and Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements  
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Booker Group plc 
for the year ended 28 March 2014 set out on pages 55 to 92. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
28 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then 
ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU); 
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on our audit were as follows. 
Fair values of assets and liabilities in relation to the 
acquisition of Makro Holding UK Limited and its 
subsidiaries (“Makro”)
Refer to page 27 (Audit Committee Report), page 61 
(accounting policy) and page 70 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group entered into an unconditional agreement 
to acquire Makro on 4 July 2012, however the acquisition was 
subject to approval by the Competition authorities and, as a 
result, was not completed until 19 April 2013. The Group is 
required, under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, to consolidate 
Makro from the date it secured control of the business, which 
the Directors deemed, in accordance with the provisions of 
IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements, to be 
19 April 2013. At this date the Group was required to evaluate 
the fair value of purchase consideration (which, as the Group 
already held Makro as an investment prior to securing control, 
was equal to the fair value of the investment at the date of 
acquisition) and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. 
Both the assessment of control and the determination of fair 
values on acquisition are areas that are open to interpretation, 
judgement and estimate. As such there is a risk that the date 
of acquisition, the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
at that date, the fair value of the purchase consideration, and 
consequently the gain on bargain purchase recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income, could be materially 
misstated through inappropriate judgements or the incorrect 
application of accounting requirements.
Our response – Our audit procedures included, amongst 
others, evaluating the critical judgements made by the Directors 
in respect of both the date of acquisition, the fair value of the 
purchase consideration and the fair value of the assets and 
liabilities acquired. In respect of the date of acquisition, we 
critically assessed the facts and circumstances surrounding 
the transaction and took into consideration the undertakings 
provided to the Competition Authorities in respect of the ‘hold 
separate’ requirements for the period prior to control being 
obtained. In our examination of the Directors’ assessment 
of the fair value of consideration paid, which was equivalent 
to the fair value of the investment in Makro at the date of 
acquisition, we critically assessed the Directos’ judgement that 
the re-measurement of fair value at acquisition resulted in no 
change to the fair value recorded at the previous balance sheet 
date of 29 March 2013. We did this through an assessment of 
the performance of, and consideration of potential changes 
in, the underlying business to which the investment related. 
We challenged the Directors’ assessment of the fair value of 
the assets and liabilities acquired with reference to evidence 
provided by the Directors and by third parties (such as 
property surveyors) in relation to those fair values. The most 
significant fair value assessment related to property valuations 
in respect of the freehold properties acquired. To evaluate 
this, we obtained the third party property valuation used by 
the Directors and critically assessed the assumptions adopted 
in the valuation of the property portfolio to ensure that it was 
prepared on a reasonable and appropriate basis. Where 
appropriate, we utilised our own specialists to further assess 
the values adopted. Because the fair value of consideration 
paid and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired resulted 
in a ‘gain on bargain purchase’ , we considered whether this was 
an indication of inappropriate fair values having been applied 
in the acquisition accounting through a detailed assessment of 
the calculations, source documentation and consideration of 
possible omitted adjustments. 
We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the acquisition of Makro.
Valuation of property provisions
Refer to page 27 (Audit Committee Report), page 64 
(accounting policy) and page 82 (financial disclosures).
The risk – The Group has recorded a number of property 
related provisions on its balance sheet, principally in respect 
of onerous leases. These provisions require the application of 
assumptions, including the expected cash flows associated 
with the properties over the remaining lease term, the expected 
utilisation of the properties, and the rate used to discount future 
cash flows to account for the time value of money. As such there 
is a risk that the provisions, and associated charges or credits 
in the statement of comprehensive income, are materially 
misstated through the use of inappropriate assumptions.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE 
MEMBERS OF BOOKER GROUP PLC ONLY 52
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE 
MEMBERS OF BOOKER GROUP PLC ONLY CONTINUED
Our response – Our procedures included, amongst others, 
obtaining the provision calculations for a sample of properties, 
sampled from a complete list of vacant properties, including 
the discounted cash flow assessments and associated 
assumptions set by the Directors, where relevant. We 
assessed the assumptions adopted in respect of the expected 
usage of the properties during the lease term and the 
anticipated cash flows through challenging the estimates and 
forecasts prepared by the Directors. In doing so we critically 
evaluated the underlying assumptions and compared these 
to the Group’s supporting internal and external data. We read 
Board minutes to compare the assumptions in relation to the 
proposed usage of the properties with the documented plans 
noted in those minutes, where available. Where appropriate, 
we compared the assumptions with the current circumstances 
and the Directors’ current expectations going forward. We 
critically evaluated the discount rate used to discount forecast 
cash flows associated with the properties by comparing the 
rate to market data and we performed our own sensitivity 
analysis of the provision to changes in the rate used. We also 
critically evaluated any changes in the assumptions used to 
assess the level of provision compared to previous years to 
ensure that changes were appropriate and supportable.
We have evaluated the disclosures provided in the Group 
financial statements in respect of the provisions in accordance 
with the requirements of IAS 37.
Valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme
Refer to page 27 (Audit Committee Report), page 61 
(accounting policy) and page 80 (financial disclosures).
The risk – Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
post-retirement defined benefit scheme and small changes 
in assumptions and estimates used to value the group’s net 
pension deficit would have a significant effect on the results 
and financial position of the Group.
Our response – In this area our audit procedures included, 
amongst others, testing of the controls over the maintenance 
of the scheme’s membership data as well as sample testing 
from that data to the source documentation establishing the 
obligation to members, and vice versa. With the support of 
our own actuarial specialists, we then challenged the key 
assumptions applied to that data to determine the Group’s 
net deficit, being the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality/
life expectancy. This included a comparison of these key 
assumptions against externally derived data. We also 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the sensitivity of the deficits to these assumptions. We also 
considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation 
to the pension scheme, including the disclosures in respect of 
the change in accounting policy resulting from the adoption of 
the revisions to IAS 19.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in relation to the pension scheme, including the disclosures in 
respect of the change in accounting policy resulting from the 
adoption of the revisions to IAS 19.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £6.0m. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, which we 
consider to be one of the principal considerations for members 
of the Company in assessing the financial performance of the 
group. Materiality represents 4.9% of Group profit before tax 
and 5.1% of Group profit before tax adjusted for exceptional 
items as disclosed on the face of the income statement.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all corrected 
and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit 
with a value in excess of £0.3 million, in addition to other audit 
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Audits for group reporting purposes were performed by the 
group audit team at the two key reporting components in 
the UK. These group audit procedures covered 98% of total 
Group revenue; 91% of Group profit before taxation; and 98% 
of total Group assets. 
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the 
key reporting components of the Group were all performed 
to materiality levels set individually for each component and 
ranged from £3.2m to £5.0m.
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006;

contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge 
or the financial statements, a material misstatement of fact, or 
that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if:

financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Report has not been prepared by 
the company
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 17, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Report on page 
20 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified 
for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 50, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description 
of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided

Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
a) Overview
Booker Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom (Registration number 05145685). The 
Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is Equity House, Irthlingborough Road, Wellingborough, 
Northamptonshire, NN8 1LT. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic and 
Directors’ Reports.
b) Basis of accounting
In accordance with EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002), the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted for use in the EU as at 28 March 2014 (‘adopted IFRS’), International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’).
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). 
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
The financial statements for the current period have been prepared for a 52 week period to reflect internal management reporting.
c) Basis of consolidation
On 4 June 2007 the Company, then named Blueheath Holdings plc, became the legal parent company of Giant Topco Limited in 
a share-for-share transaction. Due to the relative values of the companies, the former Giant Topco Limited shareholders became 
the majority shareholders with 90.36% of the enlarged share capital. As part of the business combination Blueheath Holdings 
plc changed its name to Booker Group plc and changed its accounting reference date to 31 March. Following the transaction, 
the Company’s continuing operations and executive management were predominantly those of Giant Topco Limited. IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ defines the acquirer in a business combination as the entity that obtains control. Accordingly, the 
combination was accounted as a reverse acquisition i.e. as if Giant Topco Limited had acquired Blueheath Holdings plc in return 
for consideration equal to the fair value of the shares issued.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
During the prior period, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited (‘Makro’) which has two subsidiaries: 
Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service Wholesalers Limited. The transaction was subject to Competition Commission 
approval and, whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in 
accordance with undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way. As a result, the Group had neither control 
nor significant influence over Makro, and therefore it had not met the requirements for consolidation as set out in IFRS3 (revised) 
‘Business Combinations’ and IAS27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. In accordance with IAS39 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, the investment was held as an available for sale financial asset. Cash subsequently 
advanced from Makro at the prior year end was shown within creditors.
Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received from the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro has been 
consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group. See note 9 for more details. 59

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
d) Accounting standards adopted in the period
The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations: 
• Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Defined Benefit Plans (2011)’
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
• Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (2010)’
As a result of IAS 19 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or 
expense related to the defined benefit pension scheme. 
Under IAS 19 (2011), the Group determines the net interest expense/(income) for the period on the net defined benefit liability/
asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined 
benefit liability/asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/asset during 
the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. 
Previously, the Group determined interest income on plan assets based on their long term rate of expected return.

The application of these standards and interpretations is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Group’s financial statements. 60
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1. General information continued
f) Going concern
The risks noted in the Strategic Report are those known to the Directors at the date of this Report which the Directors consider 
to be material to the Group, but these do not necessarily comprise all the risks to which the Group is exposed. In particular, the 
Group’s performance could be adversely affected by poor economic conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties currently 
unknown to the Directors, or which the Directors currently believe are immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition or prospects of the Group.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated a new unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of possible changes in trading performance and considering the risks identified, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its bank facility.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group and Company financial statements. 
g) Use of assumptions and estimates
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors 
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement and the Directors believe that the most critical accounting policies and 
significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for:
• IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. The acquisition accounting in relation to Makro Holding Limited and its subsidiaries. The 
Directors are required to fair value both Makro’s assets and liabilities and the consideration paid at the date of consolidation. 
This requires significant judgements to be made especially with regard to property valuations.
• IAS37 ‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’. The Group is party to a number of leases on properties that are 
no longer required for trading. Whilst every effort is made to profitably sub-let these properties, it is not always possible to do 
so. Where a lease is onerous to the Group, a provision is established for the difference between amounts contractually payable 
to the landlord and amounts contractually receivable from the tenant (if any) for the period up until the point it is judged that the 
lease will no longer be onerous. In addition, provisions exist for the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties 
and the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. The Directors believe that their estimates, 
which are based upon the advice of an in-house property department who monitor the UK property market, are appropriate. 
• IAS19 ‘Employee benefits’. Defined benefit schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of an independent 
qualified actuary but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, 
inflation, investment returns and mortality that underpin their valuations.
• IAS36 ‘Impairment of assets’. In testing for impairment of goodwill, the Directors have made certain assumptions concerning 
the future development of the business that are consistent with its annual budget and forecast into perpetuity. Should these 
assumptions regarding the discount rate or growth in the profitability be unfounded then it is possible that goodwill included 
in the balance sheet could be impaired. At 28 March 2014, the Directors do not consider that any reasonably likely changes in 
key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the goodwill to become impaired.
• IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’. In applying the Group’s accounting policy in relation to deferred tax, as set out below, the Directors are 
required to make assumptions regarding the Group’s ability to utilise historical tax assets following an assessment of the likely 
quantum and timing of future taxable profits. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that the Directors are confident 
that the Group’s future profits will utilise historical tax assets. 61
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
2. Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
Group financial statements. 
Intangible assets
a) Business combinations and goodwill
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill 
represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 
2006, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of 
whether those rights are separable.
Goodwill is capitalised and is subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value 
may not be recoverable. 
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs related to the 
acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Any contingent 
consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is 
not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
b) Other intangibles
Customer relationships and know-how are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 5 years and charged to 
administrative expenses.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents all costs incurred up to the point of sale including the operating expenses of the trading outlets.
Employee benefits
a) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement  
as incurred.
b) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its 
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet 
date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The defined benefit 
obligation calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses were recognised at 1 April 2006, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs. In respect of actuarial 
gains and losses that arise subsequent to 1 April 2006, the Group recognises them in the period they occur directly in other 
comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds 
from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Under IAS 19 (2011), the Group determines the net interest expense/(income) for the period on the net defined benefit liability/
asset by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the net defined 
benefit liability/asset at the beginning of the period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/asset during 
the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments.  62
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. Accounting policies continued
c) Short term benefits
Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is 
provided. A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and 
the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets 
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes 
no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by 
the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so 
classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up 
share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated 
with financial instruments that are classified in equity are treated as distributions and are recorded directly in equity.
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, available for sale financial assets, cash and cash 
equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
a) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
b) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on 
demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
d) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. Costs associated with extending the bank 
facility have been recognised in the income statement. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. 63

Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of 
the transaction.
Guarantees
Third party property guarantees are initially recognised as a financial liability under IAS 37 ’Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets”. These are measured and recognised at fair value. These property guarantees are included within ‘Provisions’ 
on the balance sheet.
Impairment 
The carrying values of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount and is 
recognised in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on either the weighted average principle or 
the replacement cost and includes certain warehousing and distribution costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their existing 
location less supplier volume rebates. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of disposal.
Investment in joint ventures
The Group conducts its joint venture arrangements through jointly controlled entities and accounts for them using the equity 
method of accounting. The Group records its share of the joint controlled entities’ post tax profit or loss within the income 
statement and its share of the net assets within investments. Where the Group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, 
unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture.
Other investments 
As stated in the basis of consolidation, the investment in Makro was shown in the prior period in other investments and 
represented an available-for-sale financial asset and is held at fair value. Competition Commission clearance was received on 
19 April 2013, since then Makro has been treated as a subsidiary.
Leases
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Where a lease has a minimum fixed increase, the total minimum lease payments are spread over the lease term. The total 
amount payable over the life of the lease remains unchanged but the timing of the income statement charge changes. The excess 
of the rent charged over the cash payment in any period will be held on the balance sheet within ‘Accruals and deferred income’.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.  64

2. Accounting policies continued 
Operating Segments
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires that segments should be reported on the same basis as the internal reporting information 
that is provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). The CODM has been identified as the CEO. In accordance with 
IFRS 8, the Group may aggregate operating segments into one reportable segment to the extent that the criteria for aggregation 
in IFRS 8 are met. These criteria include consideration of whether the operating segments have similar economic characteristics; 
similar nature of products and services; similar type or class of customers; similar methods used to distribute products or provide 
services; and similar regulatory environments. 
The CODM receives turnover information analysed in a number of different ways (for example by customer and product types, 
by delivery channels and between Booker Wholesale, Booker Direct, Chef Direct, Classic Drinks, Ritter-Courivaud and Makro). 
However, none of these ‘possible’ segments have a unique management structure, products share the same supply chain and 
distribution channels, and there are a large amount of supplier rebates, expenses and assets/(liabilities) that are not specific. It 
is therefore not possible to analyse, and the CEO does not receive, information in respect of profitability or balance sheets in the 
same way in which turnover is analysed. Internal reports reviewed regularly by the CEO focus on the operations of the Group as 
a whole and report the results and financial position on an IFRS basis. 
As a result, the Group has not disclosed discrete financial information about any of the ‘possible segments’, which in any event 
would meet the criteria for aggregation under IFRS 8, separately in these financial statements. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment. Labour and associated costs that have been incurred specifically on the ‘Extra’ business centre conversions 
have been capitalised in leasehold improvements and are being depreciated over the lesser of 10 years or the number of years 
remaining on the lease.
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately 
from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their 
fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings   30 years
• Leasehold improvements   lesser of the unexpired term of the lease and 50 years
• Plant and equipment   3–20 years
• Motor vehicles    4 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation expense is primarily charged in cost of sales with an immaterial amount in administrative expenses.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a 
past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected, risk adjusted, future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised when goods are received by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to them. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods net 
of discounts, volume rebates and value added tax. Discounts are accounted for in the period they are earned. Provision is made 
for expected customer returns. 65
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Share based payments
The Group has issued equity settled share based payments to certain employees in exchange for services rendered by them. The 
fair value is measured using an option valuation model at the date of grant and is recognised as an employee expense over the 
period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options, with a corresponding increase in equity, shown in 
a separate share option reserve. This valuation is based on estimates of the number of options that will eventually vest, taking into 
account service conditions and market performance.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
Supplier rebates
Supplier allowances and credits are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned according to the underlying 
agreement. Allowances consist primarily of promotional allowances, quantity discounts and payments under merchandising 
agreements. Amounts received under promotional or other merchandising allowance agreements that require specific performance 
are recognised when the performance is satisfied, the amount is fixed and determinable and the collection is reasonably assured. 
Taxation
Tax expense included in the Income Statement comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is provided using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent 
that, following an assessment of the quantum and timing of future taxable profits, it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the amount which is recognised is 
increased or reduced to the extent that it is then probable or no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when they relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.

Tax losses can be claimed from Makro from the time when the shares were legally acquired. As Makro was not consolidated until 
19 April 2013, and it is group policy not to pay for group relief, the benefit of the prior year trading losses (tax value of £4.0m) has 
been accounted for as a permanent difference in the Group’s prior year tax charge.
A tax credit of £0.7m arises on the net exceptional credit of £3.4m, which is after taking account of a charge arising from the 
revaluation of Makro’s deferred tax asset at the balance sheet date, following enactment on 2 July 2013 of reduced future rates 
of corporation tax.
The effective rate of tax on profit after exceptional items becomes 13.8% (2013: 17.5%).

20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. 
This will reduce the Company’s future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the deferred tax assets/liabilities at  
28 March 2014 which has been calculated based on the rate of 20% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 69

share options and dilutive shares issuable under the Group’s share plans. The number of shares included in the diluted EPS in 
relation to the SAYE and the share option schemes has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings per Share’.

9. Business combination
During the prior period, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Makro Holding Limited and its subsidiaries (‘Makro’). 
The transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval. Full clearance to the acquisition of Makro was received on 
19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from this date, being the date that control passed to the Group.
Through Booker and Makro coming together, the Group seeks to become the UK’s leading wholesaler to caterers, retailers and 
small businesses by: 
• combining the best ranges from Makro and Booker to improve overall choice; 
• consolidating buying volumes to improve prices for customers; 
• improving service due to an increased capacity for delivery; and 
• improving availability by integrating the supply chain. 70

Net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities 131.5 24.6 156.1
Gain on bargain purchase (included in exceptional items) 11.2
Total consideration 144.9
The fair value adjustments made on acquisition have had the effect of:
• increasing the property valuations;
• providing for onerous contracts; and
• recognising a deferred tax asset in relation to accelerated capital allowances.
The fair value of the consideration is based upon the fair value of the investment held in Makro prior to the date of consolidation. 
The investment was measured at fair value in accordance with IAS39 as it was an available for sale financial asset. The fair value 
was initially determined by reference to the consideration transferred as set out below at completion, and the subsequent fair 
value was considered to be unchanged at both 29 March 2013 and 19 April 2013 and therefore there has been no valuation gain 
or loss recorded in comprehensive income. The subsequent investment fair value was measured by reference to the performance 
of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets of the business, predominantly properties.
Consideration for purchase of investment comprised of: £m
Issue of 156,621,525 new ordinary shares – determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc 
at the date of completion, taking into account a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from 
being sold for one year after the date of completion
124.2
Cash consideration 15.8
Cash paid to reflect a targeted cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012 4.9
144.9
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is higher than the fair value of consideration paid, resulting in a ‘gain on bargain 
purchase’ of £11.2m, which has been included in exceptional items. The Directors considered whether this indicated inappropriate 
fair values underlying the acquisition accounting and concluded that all the fair values were reasonable.
In the 49 weeks to 28 March 2014, Makro contributed turnover of £599m and, after synergies, a profit before interest, tax and 
exceptional items of £11m. If the acquisition had occurred at the start of the reporting period, turnover would have been £632m 
with profit before interest, tax and exceptional items of £10.7m. 71

During the period, the Group paid £2.5m as an interim amount in accordance with the procurement agreement with Provenance 
Too Limited which holds the intellectual property in Provenance Limited (‘Provenance’). 
Goodwill arose in the Group from the following:
• the acquisition of the Big Food Group Limited by Giant Topco Limited in 2005; and
• the acquisition of Ritter-Courivaud Limited in 2010.
Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group is required to test its fixed assets for impairment at least annually, or more 
frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Impairment reviews compare the carrying value of goodwill, other intagible fixed assets 
and tangible fixed assets contained in each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is considered to be its value in use, calculated by reference to the pre tax cash flow 
projections of each CGU based on the Group’s approved budget for 2015 and plan for 2016. Cash flows beyond this period are 
extrapolated into perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2% (2013: 2%), being the Directors’ estimated view of the long term 
compound growth in the economy. This is considered appropriate because the CGU is considered to be a long term business. 
The discount rate used reflects the market assumptions for the risk free rate and equity risk premium and also takes into account 
the cost of debt.
The main assumptions on which the forecast cash flows were based include the level of sales, gross margin and expenses within 
the business and have been set by the Directors based on their past experience of the business and its industry together with 
their expectations of the market. The level of sales depends upon the size of the markets in which the Group operates together 
with the Directors’ estimations of its market share and competitive pressures. Gross margin is dependent upon the net costs to 
the business of purchasing products together with the level of supplier rebates and income to support sales activities. Expenses 
are based on the current cost base of the Group adjusted for variable costs and known plans for the business.  73
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The Directors believe that three CGUs now exist within the Group:
a) Ritter (intangible assets of £12.6m and tangible assets of £1.0m)
A pre tax discount rate of 10.4% (2013: 10.5%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 5% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 5%, would require an impairment to 
be made.
b) Makro (tangible assets of £133.6m)
The majority of Makro’s assets relate to freehold and leasehold property which were fair valued on consolidation.
c) Remaining business (intangible assets of £426.1m and tangible assets of £69.9m)
A pre tax discount rate of 10.5% (2013: 10.8%) has been applied to the projected cash flows. 
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions. With all other assumptions 
held constant, neither a 10% increase in the pre tax discount rate, nor a decline in growth of 10%, would require an impairment 
to be made.
The Directors believe that the assumptions on which the carrying value of fixed assets is supported are reasonable and that no 
impairment to fixed assets is required.

a cash consideration of £15.8m. Makro Holding Limited has two subsidiaries; Makro Properties Limited and Makro Self Service 
Wholesalers Limited.
This was held as an investment at 29 March 2013, while the transaction was subject to Competition Commission approval and, 
whilst this process was in progress, the Group was required to hold Makro separate from the rest of Booker in accordance with 
undertakings given to the competition authorities in the normal way. As a result, the Group had neither control nor significant 
influence over Makro at the previous year end, and therefore it did not meet the requirements for consolidation as set out in 
IFRS3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. In accordance with IAS39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, the investment was initially held as an available for sale financial asset. 
Cash that was subsequently advanced from Makro is held within creditors. 
The shares issued as consideration for the investment were valued at their fair value of £124.2m, at the date of completion. 
Fair value was determined by reference to the share price of Booker Group plc at the date of completion, taking into account 
a discount to reflect the restrictions preventing the shares from being sold for one year after the date of completion. In addition 
a further £4.9m was paid to reflect an above target cash and working capital position as at 30 June 2012. The investment was 
measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 39 as it is an available-for-sale financial asset. 
The fair value of the financial asset subsequent to the date of completion, but prior to consolidation, was measured by reference 
to the performance of Makro compared to expectations and the underlying market value of the assets in the business, 
predominantly property.
Full clearance to the transaction was received by the Competition Commission on 19 April 2013 and Makro was consolidated from 
this date, being the date that control passes to the Group. The fair value of the investment, at the date of consolidation, became 
the fair value of the consideration in respect of the acquisition, and is considered to be unchanged since the date of completion. 75

Loans and other receivables represent amounts receivable from the sale of goods, together with amounts due from rebates (see 
note 16) and are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently held at amortised cost.
Fair value of property guarantees have been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and 
maturity and risk of each guarantee crystallising.
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique 
used to determine fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Liquidity risk
The Group will finance operations and growth from existing cash resources, finance leases and committed borrowing facilities 
to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of reasonably priced funding to meet both current and future 
forecast requirements.
In July 2011, the Group negotiated an unsecured bank facility of £120m for a period of 5 years. The revolving credit facility bears 
floating interest rates linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25%. In the event of default of covenants on the bank facility, any drawn 
facility and any interest accrued are repayable on demand.

It is not possible to quantify the timing of the cash flows relating to the property guarantees.
The undiscounted cash flows for borrowings differ from their carrying value in the balance sheet due to the inclusion of contractual 
interest payments and the adjustment for non cash items including unamortised borrowing costs. The undiscounted cash flows 
for financial instruments reflect the amounts payable on these instruments which differs from the fair value recorded on the 
balance sheet. There is no difference between the discounted and undiscounted cash flows associated with trade payables due 
to their short term nature.
Credit risk
The Group is predominantly a cash sales business with low levels of trade receivables in comparison to total sales for the year and 
has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. It is the Group’s policy that 
all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group has an accounting policy 
to provide for certain overdue trade receivables based on past experience, and believe that there are no significant unprovided 
overdue financial assets.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is relatively small to the Group, as there are no fixed borrowings and the revolving credit facility is only partially 
drawn for a small part of the year. Therefore the Group has chosen not to hedge its borrowings.  79
Booker Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Financial Statements
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
benefits for other stakeholders; and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it 
in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital 
all components of equity are taken into account (i.e. share capital and retained earnings). The Group has £149.6m of net cash as 
at 28 March 2014 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. Management of capital therefore focuses around 
its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for 
managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to 
shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
Foreign currency risk
Less than 1% of purchases are denominated in foreign currencies.
The majority of sales are denominated in sterling, with the exception of sales made from the Group’s Indian operation which are 
denominated in rupees.
The Directors do not consider that the Group has significant exposure to movements in foreign exchange and the Group does 
not hold any foreign exchange contracts.
19. Post employment benefits
The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements, covering both funded defined benefit and funded 
defined contribution schemes to provide benefits to both full-time and part-time employees. 
Change in accounting policy
As a result of IAS 19 (2011), the Group has changed its accounting policy with respect to the basis for determining the income or 
expense related to the defined benefit pension scheme as described in note 1.
Defined contribution schemes
Pension contributions of £5.0m (2013: £3.5m) were charged to defined contribution schemes in the period. Included within 
accruals is £0.4m (2013: £0.3m) of outstanding pension contributions.
Defined benefit schemes
The Booker Pension Scheme (‘the Scheme’) is a funded pension arrangement based on final salary and was closed to new 
entrants in 2001 with benefits ceasing to accrue from 2002. However, active members’ benefits retain a link to their final salaries. 
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by independent fund managers appointed 
by the Trustees. 
The benefit obligations as at 28 March 2014 have been calculated by an independent actuary on an IAS 19 basis using the results 
of the 31 March 2013 triennial actuarial valuation which has then been updated to 28 March 2014. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method. 80

Pension increases in payment   +/- 0.1%  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £4m
Life expectancy for current and future pensioners +/- 1 year  Increase/decrease in liabilities by £20m
Changes in RPI inflation impact pension increases both before retirement and in payment.
(h) Contributions to be paid
The Trustees have recently completed their 31 March 2013 triennial valuation of the Scheme. The Trustees assessed the funding 
position to be a shortfall of approximately £24m at this date. This shortfall is expected to be recovered through Company deficit 
contributions (£9.6m of deficit contributions were paid into the Scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014) and the returns 
achievable on the assets of the Scheme.
Of the £9.6m paid to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2014, £2.4m was paid on 31 March 2014, in the next reporting period. 
No further contributions to the Scheme are expected to be made until the funding position is reviewed following the next actuarial 
valuation of Scheme, which is scheduled for 31 March 2016. 82

• the expected future dilapidation cost on leasehold properties; and
• the expected future costs of removing asbestos from leasehold properties. Although not a health risk, the Group is legally 
required to undertake a programme of removal.
Property provisions are discounted at 7.0% (2013: 7.0%), being the long term expected yield for the Group’s leased properties 
and are expected to be utilised over the terms of the leases, with approximately £3.0m expected to be utilised in the year to 
March 2015.
Other provisions relate to third party property guarantees, for which the timing and quantum of payments is uncertain. Payment

register at 13 June 2014. The shares will go ex-dividend on 11 June 2014. 
The Board is proposing to implement a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately 
£61m, based on the current issued share capital of the company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class 
of “B” shares. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the AGM on 9 July 2014.  84

24. Share based payments
The Group has a number of share schemes for employees. The total charge for the period relating to employee share based 
payments was £4.3m (2013: £3.1m), all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
a) Sharesave schemes
The Sharesave scheme has been in operation since 2008 and all employees are eligible to participate once the necessary service 
requirements have been met. Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the average of the market value of a share on the 
three dealing days immediately preceding the offer. Options are exercisable three years after the commencement of the savings 
contract and not more than six months thereafter. The options granted have been fair valued using the Black Scholes option 
pricing model, using the following assumptions:

b) Performance Share Plans (PSP)
In 2008 a discretionary PSP for the benefit of certain employees was established by the Remuneration Committee. The awards are free 
share based awards and normally vest three years after the grant date, provided relevant performance criteria have been met.
PSP 2012 and 2013
The options granted in November 2012 (6.3 million options) and October 2013 (5.4 million options) to senior employees had the 
same conditions. They will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment 
and the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of 
award. The awards are granted in two tranches:
i) Earnings Per Share (EPS) condition 
50% of each award will be linked to an absolute EPS performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth of 
6% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 12% growth per annum, as measured at the year end 
prior to the grant and then 3 years later.
ii) Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition
50% of each award will be linked to an Absolute TSR performance target with 25% of this element vesting for achieving growth 
of 8% per annum and rising on a straight line basis with full vesting requiring 15% growth per annum, when measured over the 3 
years from the grant date.
PSP 2011
In November 2011, 7.0 million options were granted to senior employees which will vest and become exercisable three years from 
the date of the award subject to continued employment and the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will 
lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award. A fifth of the shares subject to each option will vest on reaching each 
of the share prices of 85.8p, 89.4p, 100.1p, 128.7p and 153.0p, in each case sustained over a consecutive 60-day period. As at 
28 March 2014, all of the share price targets had been met. 85

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing 
with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its 
own profit and loss account.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS1 (5a) and consequently no cash flow is presented for the Company.
Guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats 
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. The carrying values of investments are reviewed for 
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Share based payments
The Company has issued equity settled share based payments to employees of a subsidiary. The fair value is measured using 
an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. This fair value is 
accounted as an investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in equity.
2. Profit and loss account
In accordance with the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the 
Company is not presented separately. The profit recognised for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2014 was £119.9m (52 weeks 
ended 29 March 2013: profit £40.0m).
The audit fee of £0.1m (2013: £0.1m) for the current and prior period was borne by another group undertaking without recharge.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 2.75 pence per share, which will absorb £48m of distributable reserves. Subject

register at 13 June 2014. The shares will go ex-dividend on 11 June 2014. 
The Board is proposing to implement a capital return to shareholders of 3.50 pence per ordinary share (at a cost of approximately 
£61m, based on the current issued share capital of the company). It is proposed that this is achieved by the issue of a new class 
of “B” shares. The return of capital requires the approval of shareholders, which will be sought at the AGM on 9 July 2014.

HIGHLIGHTS USES OF NATURAL GAS
From the moment we wake up in the morning 
until the moment we turn off the lights at night  
we are constantly using natural gas in one way 
or another. Gas is used for cooking, powering  
the boiler in our central heating and hot water 
and to generate the electricity to light our homes. 
Gas is not just a fuel that we burn for energy though. It is also a 
raw material used in the manufacture of chemicals that are used 
in a wide range of products we use every day, including medicines, 
clothing, buildings, vehicles, computers, and green technologies, 
such as wind turbines and energy efficient materials. So even 
when we have transitioned to renewable, low-carbon energy 
sources, we will still need gas to make these essential items
1
.
Heat
84% of homes in the UK rely on natural gas 
for central heating. That means that not only 
are your radiators more than likely keeping 
you warm thanks to gas, but the hot water 
you need for showers, baths and even doing 
the washing up is all heated by the little blue 
gas flame in your boiler.
Electricity 
In 2015, a third of the UK’s electricity  
was generated from gas
3
. Gas-fired power 
stations are able to run continuously, or as 
flexible back-up for intermittent wind and 
solar – right now, we cannot rely solely  
on renewables for our electricity supply.

WHAT NATURAL GAS MEANS TO YOU Food production 
Nitrogen fertiliser was applied to 
75% of all farmland in Great Britain 
in 2013. Natural gas is one of the main 
components of ammonia, which is widely 
used in nitrogen based fertilisers that are 
needed for food production.

NORTH WEST  
ROUND 14 NEW BLOCKS OFFERED
In the North West, blocks SJ64, SJ65, SJ75 and SJ76 have been  
offered to a joint venture comprising IGas and ENGIE E&P . IGas will be 
operator of the two licences with a 65% interest and ENGIE E&P will 
have a 35% interest. A work programme consisting of 2D seismic and 
two drill or drop wells will help to establish the hydrocarbon potential 
of the shale in this area.
EAST MIDLANDS AND YORKSHIRE 
ROUND 14 NEW BLOCKS OFFERED
In the East Midlands and Yorkshire, a total of 3 licences across 7 
blocks – SE41e, SK49, SK89e, SK88b SK87c, SE31c and SK59b – have 
been offered to a joint venture comprising IGas, Total and Egdon 
Resources plc (“Egdon”). IGas will be operator of all the licences  
with a 35% interest, Total will have a 50% interest and Egdon a  
15% interest. These licences are located in the Gainsborough  
Trough close to where IGas currently operates 80 sites, the majority 
of which have been in production for many years. IGas will conduct 
a shale related work programme including 3D seismic surveys and 
three firm wells on these new licences. 
The East Midlands work programme also contains a further two 
drill or drop wells targeting conventional prospects on two separate 
licences. IGas will be operator with a 100% interest.
THE WEALD  
ROUND 14 NEW BLOCKS OFFERED
In the South East, IGas has been offered blocks SU81c, SU81d, SU90a 
and TQ34d and will be the operator with a 100% interest. These blocks 
have conventional oil and gas potential and are located adjacent to 
the IGas Singleton and Bletchingley fields in the Weald Basin. A work 
programme consisting of 2D seismic acquisition will drive the decision 
on the three drill or drop wells. 
IGas is seeking to develop extensive shale 
resources across Britain and is currently focused 
on two areas; the Bowland Basin in the North 
West and the Gainsborough Trough in the East 
Midlands and Yorkshire.
We operate a combined carried gross work programme of up to  
$255 million, as at 31 December 2015, from our farm-in partners – 
Total E&P UK Limited (“Total”), ENGIE E&P UK Limited (“ENGIE E&P”) 
and INEOS Upstream Limited (“INEOS”).
IGas is also focused on maximising economic recovery from its 
existing fields primarily in the East Midlands and in the Weald Basin  
in the South East.

DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL RESOURCES Financial Strategy
Our financial strategy is to maintain flexibility and a strong 
balance sheet. During the period the farm-out to INEOS 
improved the Group’s cash position and the amendment to the 
bond terms in August 2015 has provided the Group with more 
financial flexibility. During the period the Group implemented 
a series of cost saving initiatives that have materially reduced 
operating costs and G&A spend.
Hedging Strategy
IGas has an ongoing hedging programme to mitigate the 
commodity price risk associated with our oil revenues. The 
hedging strategy is to use a mix of puts, swaps and zero 
cost collars to protect against the downside risk whilst also 
minimising the cost of the hedges. We aim to hedge 60% of 
our production on a rolling 12 month basis. As at 31 December 
2015 the Group’s derivative instruments had a net positive fair 
value of £6.6 million (31 March 2015: £1.4 million).

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT CONTINUED
PRUDENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Sound financial management and maintenance of 
Balance Sheet strength for a sustainable business. DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES
In conjunction with specialists, we are 
developing technologies and applications  
to assist future shale development.
PRODUCING ASSETS
Improving the performance of wells that are 
already producing is a cost effective way to 
offset natural decline, extend field life and 
improve recovery.
Water injection and recycling
The aim of our pilot projects is to assess the potential of increasing oil recovery from our existing fields using produced water 
to increase the pressure and enhance production. As the oilfields mature they produce increasing volumes of water. From a 
sustainability perspective, it is prudent to recycle this water to maintain reservoir energy. The technology involves removal 
of solids and salts. The efficient recycling of water has several advantages including reduced water use, fewer vehicle 
movements and an overall operating cost reduction. This technology will be vital for recycling flowback water from shale 
wells and help to protect the environment.
Monetising Gas and Green Completions
Mini Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”) offers a solution for the early monetisation of gas, particularly during the pilot 
development phase of shale gas, and prior to the installation of the permanent facilities. The mini CNG plants will be 
modular and therefore could be re-deployed to new sites when the permanent facilities are commissioned. This will help 
reduce the need for flaring as well as providing a carbon benefit; for example, CNG can be used for fuelling HGVs.
Technology development – “digital oilfield”
The IGas “digital oilfield” initiative is about integrating technology and information to increase asset integrity and production, 
whilst reducing operating costs. Wherever appropriate, we will use IT capability to instrument and control the oil fields and 
gain both cost savings and efficiencies through the deployment of this technology. As well as enhancing performance in the 
existing mature fields, our experience of applying technology can be utilised in deploying similar systems to manage the 
shale developments when they are implemented.

OPTIMISATION OF ASSETS
To maintain and grow existing production IGas continuously looks to additional 
initiatives to extend asset uptime, and optimise the extraction, processing and 
delivery of hydrocarbons downstream; whilst retaining a focus on managing 
operational costs. IGas is using and developing technologies in its existing 
assets that will also assist shale development. During the nine months to 
December 2015, we made 
significant progress with 
our high potential shale gas 
acreage, despite the very weak 
oil price environment affecting 
our near term conventional 
production.
Critically, in May 2015, we increased 
our carried shale work programme and 
strengthened the balance sheet by farming 
out part of our acreage to INEOS. Also, early 
in the period we were proactive in reviewing 
our cost base and, as a result, operating 
costs have reduced by over 25%. 
After the farm-out to INEOS, we still operate 
one of the largest net acreage positions in 
the UK, with a very significant total gross 
carried shale work programme amounting 
to up to $255 million at the period end, 
which we operate on behalf of ourselves 
and our partners, Total, ENGIE E&P and 
INEOS. In the summer, we announced our 
five year development plan to evaluate and 
develop our shale gas resources to take them 
forward to commercial production. We have 
delivered against 2015’s planned goals, with 
the completion of a significant 3D seismic 
programme in the North West, on time and 
on budget, and the submission of a planning 
application to drill two wells in North 
Nottinghamshire. 
As regards our producing assets, we 
continue to devote the effort needed to 
maximise economic recovery. The progress 
we have made with the production assets 
has resulted in a 2P reserves replacement of 
over 150% in the period. This is largely due 
to a combination of reduced operating costs, 
better than anticipated field performance 
and our work on maximising economic 
recovery from existing assets.
As a Board we remain focused 
on maintaining flexibility for the 
business in the current oil price 
environment and on continuing 
to deliver against our strategy.
STRATEGIC REPORT

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CONTINUING OUR PLAN We were very pleased with the results of 
the 14
th
 Onshore Licensing Round, which has 
further increased our net acreage position 
by 25%, with the addition of 17 blocks. We 
are the largest UK shale player by gross 
acreage. We now have sufficient acreage 
across all of the UK’s shale basins to be well 
placed to make a significant contribution 
to home grown gas production from shale, 
assuming successful commercialisation, and 
potentially to make a significant contribution 
to Britain’s energy needs for the future.
During the period, the Government 
announced that the need to explore and 
test for shale gas is a “national priority” and 
set out to all Local Authorities a number of 
measures that have been implemented to 
ensure the planning system works effectively. 
The Government also committed to 
close all British coal fired power plants 
by 2025, making the UK the first country 
to set an end date for use of this fuel 
for electricity generation. Coal currently 
makes up approximately 30% of UK 
electricity generation. As recognised by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
gas has around half the emissions of coal, 
and so transitioning to gas is necessary in the 
medium-term to meet the UK’s energy needs 
in the most environmentally responsible 
way. In the UK, gas and renewables can work 
together to replace coal and provide lower 
emissions. We currently rely on gas to meet 
a third of our energy needs and we will 
continue to depend on gas in the medium-
term, especially given that eight out of ten 
homes use gas for heating. 
I firmly believe that shale gas does not 
present a threat to renewables; it is in fact 
complementary. In the US, we have seen 
wind and solar generation and shale gas 
production grow most quickly in those states 
that have fully embraced shale; so that 
together they have contributed to reducing 
emissions and reducing reliance on imports. 
The North Sea is now ever more challenged 
by reduced commodity prices; the UK 
has become a net gas importer, with 
the National Grid estimating that import 
dependency will reach 69% by 2018/2019. 
The UK is increasingly dependent on 
imported gas to meet its needs. This means 
that we are ever more reliant on other 
countries to supply our energy needs, with 
imported energy also being at a greater cost 
to the environment – it takes a lot of energy 
to freeze gas, transport it on a ship and then 
re-gasify it at a British terminal. Imported gas 
is costing around £11 million a day – money 
that is not generating jobs or tax revenues 
in Britain. 
As regards the leadership of the Company, 
in September 2015, we appointed Julian 
Tedder as Chief Financial Officer. His wealth 
of experience in the sector, most recently 
at Tullow Oil where he was part of the 
team that grew the business from being 
an explorer to a significant international oil 
and gas company operating with multiple 
partners, complements IGas’ existing 
leadership very well. I would like to thank  
the executive team, my board colleagues 
and all our employees for everything that 
they have done and continue to do for the 
success of the Company. Finally, my thanks 
go to our shareholders and bondholders,  
for the support you have shown us during 
this turbulent period.
In this protracted period of low oil prices, 
our focus remains on balance sheet strength 
and preserving cash, whilst continuing to 
deliver value adding activity. 
Francis Gugen
Non-executive Chairman

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    11 The oil price has fallen significantly over the 
last 18 months with Brent crude below $28 
a barrel in January 2016, for the first time 
since 2003. As a reaction to this downturn 
the industry has enforced unprecedented 
cutbacks in both activity and spending. 
However, the industry has experienced 
and weathered these cycles before and it 
can have positive impacts too in efficiency 
gains – be it standardisation of equipment, 
or sharing technology and knowledge about 
challenging basins. 
Whilst UK gas prices have fallen they have not 
suffered the same fate as the oil price and 
the long-term fundamentals for developing 
a domestic gas supply are still there, due 
to Britian’s significant reliance on gas – 
heat for 84% of our homes and generating 
approximately one third of electricity 
consumed. Gas is not just a fuel that we 
burn for energy. It is also a raw material 
used in the manufacture of chemicals that 
have application in a wide range of day to 
day products including medicine, clothing, 
buildings, vehicles and computers and we will 
still need gas to make these essential items 
once we have made the transition to low 
carbon energy. It is vital, therefore, that the 
UK has a secure and competitive long-term 
supply of gas to underpin the future of the 
manufacturing sector .
The onshore exploration of home-grown 
sources of oil and gas in the UK can be 
traced back to 1850. The techniques used 
by the onshore oil and gas industry, are 
not new. Some 2,230 wells have now been 
drilled onshore in the UK with more than 
10% of them having been hydraulically 
fractured.
The UK Government has publicly stated its 
commitment to the development of shale 
gas in Britain giving it “national priority” 
status and has written to Local Authorities 
to set out a number of measures that have 
been implemented to ensure the planning 
system is working effectively.

To that end, in November 2015, the 
Secretary of State for Communities and 
Local Government announced that he would 
determine Cuadrilla’s appeals after the 
Planning Inspector has concluded and written 
a report and recommendation following the 
Public Inquiry that commenced in February 
2016. These appeals relate to the proposed 
exploratory shale gas sites and monitoring 
arrays at Preston New Road and Roseacre 
Wood, Lancashire. 
A decision is also awaited on the planning 
application submitted by Third Energy 
seeking permission to frack an existing well 
at Kirby Misperton in North Yorkshire. 
The 14
th
 Onshore Licensing Round awards 
made in August 2015 and December 2015 
have opened up approximately 4,500 square 
miles of new shale exploration licences. 
Across those blocks, companies, including 
IGas, have set out plans to drill up to 68 wells 
over the next five years and to hydraulically 
fracture at least 14 of those wells.
There is a significant resource in the ground, 
according to the British Geological Survey 
over 1,300 trillion cubic feet
1
 of shale gas 
can be found in the North of England, and 80 
trillion cubic feet
2
 in Scotland. In the UK, we 
use less than 3 trillion cubic feet a year, so 
if we could only get a tenth of the shale gas 
out of the ground, it would be enough for 
more than 40 years supply.
Indigenous production on this scale could 
not only create upwards of 60,000 jobs
3
 but 
protect some of the two million jobs that 
support manufacturing and heavy industry 
that is reliant on gas.

STRATEGIC REPORT
12    |    IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015
OUR MARKETPLACE
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW There were several significant policy 
developments during the period, with many 
policies being restated and clarification being 
added to areas of existing legislation.
Following the Conservative Party’s victory 
in the General Election in May 2015, and 
her appointment as Secretary of State for 
Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd 
has made several supportive statements 
in respect of the development of the UK’s 
shale gas reserves. She has acknowledged 
the role of shale in “adding new sources of 
home-grown supply to our real diversity of 
imports
1
” and meeting the UK’s security of 
supply challenge. She also announced her 
Government’s intention to replace all UK 
coal-fired power plants by 2025, replacing 
them with new gas and nuclear plants
2
. 
In August 2015, a joint statement from the 
Departments of Energy and Climate  
Change (“DECC”) and Communities and  
Local Government (“DCLG”), which outlined 
steps to facilitate the “national need to 
explore and develop our shale gas and oil 
resources in a safe, sustainable and timely 
way”
3
. The measures announced include:
• Appeals against refusals of planning 
permissions or non-determination  
will be treated as a priority for urgent 
resolution by DCLG;
• The Secretary of State for Communities 
and Local Government will revise the 
recovery criteria and will also actively 
consider calling in shale applications; and
• The Government is to identify 
“underperforming local planning 
authorities that repeatedly fail to 
determine oil and gas applications  
within statutory timeframes.”
We are backing the safe development of 
shale gas because it’s good for jobs giving 
hardworking people and their families more 
financial security, good for our energy security 
and part of our plan to decarbonise the economy.
Amber Rudd
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
Proposals to bring planning permissions 
required by the onshore oil and gas  
industry for monitoring boreholes into line 
with a range of other industries, such as 
farming, are expected later in the year. This 
follows a commitment from Ministers to 
change the “permitted development rights”  
for groundwater monitoring boreholes  
and boreholes for seismic investigation and 
monitoring, allowing the industry to drill 
them without the need to seek planning 
permission
4
. These proposals will speed 
up the delivery of essential monitoring 
information for safety and environmental 
protection.
Further definitions were added to the 
Infrastructure Act in mid-December, 2015, 
with MPs voting in favour of the Government’s 
Draft Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing (Protected 
Areas) Regulations 2015
5
. These regulations 
clarify that UK onshore oil and gas companies 
are allowed to drill wells under National Parks, 
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the 
Broads and World Heritage Sites at depths of 
at least 1,200m, subject always to compliance 
with the extensive regulations ensuring  
safe operations.

The Task Force on Shale Gas published its 
final report
6
 in December 2015, concluding 
“shale gas can be produced safely and 
usefully in the UK”, as well as finding that 
there is “no more risk to the public from 
fracking than other comparable industries.”

POLITICAL AND REGULATORY REVIEW We undertake an Environmental Risk Assessment 
(“ERA”) (for shale gas only).
It is a comprehensive review of all potential safety 
and environmental (including health) risks relevant 
to the proposed shale gas activities, and to show 
how these will be mitigated and managed.  
The ERA considers various factors such as:
• Waste;
• Drainage;
• Air quality; and
• Foliage.
REGULATORY & OPERATIONAL ROADMAP
We engage in pre-application 
discussion with local communities, 
minerals planning authorities 
(determining council), local MPs, 
businesses and a number of  
other stakeholders.
OGA issues us a  
Petroleum and Exploratory 
Development Licence 
(“PEDL”).
A PEDL allows a company 
to pursue a range of oil and 
gas exploration activities, 
subject to necessary drilling/
development consents and 
planning permission.
To receive a PEDL  
applicants must prove: 
• Technical competence;
• Environmental  
competence; and
• Financial capability.
We secure  
landowner consent 
for exploration and/or 
production activity.
British Geological 
Survey (“BGS”)  
informed and Coal 
Authority permission 
sought (if required).
3D seismic acquired 
if intention is to 
hydraulically fracture for 
shale under permitted  
development.
Community  
engagement starts. 
Scoping document

ERA EIA
We undertake an Environmental  
Impact Assessment (“EIA”)  
subject to screening.
The EIA considers various  
factors including: 
• Traffic generation;
• Waste management;
• Lighting & safety;
• Water environment;
•  Ecology;
• Noise;
• Air quality; and
• Seismic testing.
The community
Stakeholder engagement process
We initiate 
Community Liaison 
Groups (“CLGs”) 
where new 
developments  
are proposed.
We are one of the most heavily regulated 
industries in Britain and, in terms of onshore  
oil and gas, the world. In terms of best 
practice, the UK leads the way. Our industry 
body, UKOOG, has in the last few years 
published best practice on well integrity and 
baseline monitoring and addressing public 
health in EIAs. Baseline monitoring before any 
activity takes place is particularly important,  
as the public will be able to measure the 
specific impacts of oil and gas operations.
The onshore oil and gas industry has an 
excellent track record in relation to health and 
safety and environment protection. Onshore 
oil and gas regulation in the UK has been 
recognised as an exemplar by the rest of the 
world. The industry is regulated by a number 
of statutory bodies including the Environment 
Agency (“EA”), Health and Safety Executive 
A SAFE SOLUTION
If safely and economically 
extracted, shale gas can 
develop a new onshore gas 
industry, which provides local 
employment and ensures 
security of supply for the UK
1
.
(“HSE”), the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) 
and the local minerals planning authority. 
In addition, the industry is governed by 14 
separate pieces of European legislation.
The following prominent European 
organisations have conducted extensive recent 
research into shale and found that the risks  
of fracking are low, and manageable, and do 
not pose a significant hazard to public health:
• The Royal Society and The Royal Academy 
of Engineering; 
• The Chartered Institute of Water  
and Environmental Management;
• Public Health England;
• European Academies Science  
Advisory Council;
• Scottish Government’s Independent Expert 
Scientific Panel on Unconventional Gas;
• ReFINE; and
• National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    15 Our strategy is to build a material 
onshore energy company in 
Britain in collaboration with 
the communities in which we 
operate and deliver value for  
all our stakeholders.
We have made good progress 
across the business in the 
nine months to 31 December 
2015 against a difficult oil price 
environment for our production 
business. Gas prices have 
also been impacted during the 
period, although less so than  
oil, with UK gas prices still  
more than double US prices. 
As previously announced, we implemented 
a cost saving programme early in the period, 
and the effects are demonstrated in these 
results, with operating costs of approximately 
$24.6/boe (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: $34.6/boe), excluding reorganisation 
costs of £2.1 million which were incurred 
in the period to 31 December 2015. We 
remain focused on our operating cost per 
barrel in this oil price environment, being 
on both absolute costs and maintaining 
our production volumes. Given the actions 
we have already taken, further significant 
reductions in operating costs per barrel  
will be more challenging. 
As at 31 December 2015, the Company had 
cash of £28.6 million and net debt of £73.3 
million. IGas continues to employ a rolling 
hedging programme in order to plan and 
protect its cash flows. At the period end, the 
Company had 390,000 barrels hedged in the 
12 month period to December 2016 – at an 
average floor price of approximately $62 per 
barrel. The mark to market value of hedges 
at 31 December 2015 was £6.6 million.  
The Company will continue to add to its 
hedge position as market conditions allow.
The impact of the prolonged oil price 
decline, with an average realised price of  
$58.9/boe (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: $94/boe), and the considerably lower 
forward oil price curve has resulted in 
impairment charges of £48.1 million (net of 
tax) in the nine months ended 31 December 
2015, of which £8.9 million (net of tax) 
relates to producing assets.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN CHALLENGING MARKETS Effi  cient development
of potenti al resources
Following receipt of all the necessary 
consents and approvals from the DECC the 
INEOS farm-out deal completed on 7 May 
2015 with a consideration of £30 million 
cash and a gross carried work programme  
of up to £138 million.
Production assets
Average net production in the nine months 
to 31 December 2015 was 2,570 boepd  
(12 months ended 31 March 2015:  
2,737 boepd).
In terms of maintaining and growing 
production we have been focused on 
activities such as sidetracks, workovers, 
water injection and gas monetisation 
projects as well as further progress on our 
digital oilfield initiative. We continue to 
monitor and evaluate our water injection 
pilots and to consider methods to increase 
injection rates and improve reservoir 
management to enhance production and 
recovery. These initiatives have contributed 
to reserves replacement of over 150% 
based on production of 0.71mmboe in the 
period. In the current oil price environment 
expenditure will be focused on maintaining 
and increasing production from existing 
sites, thereby reducing operating cost per 
barrel and improving pay back periods and 
returns on capital employed. 
We will continue to move forward other 
projects to final investment decision, so 
that when the commodity prices and the 
corporate economic hurdles are met,  
we can advance these projects. 
Appraisal assets
The industry is working towards a goal of 
establishing commercial production of shale 
gas by the end of the decade. The Company 
continues to make progress against its five 
year shale development plan and further 
details are outlined in the operational 
review. In the period we completed the 
acquisition of 110km
2
 of 3D seismic in the 
North West, without incident, on time and 
on budget. This data is currently being 
processed and interpreted and is likely to  
be completed in the third quarter of 2016.

Disciplined asset The planning application for two exploration 
wells at the Springs Road site was validated 
by the local council on 30 October 2015.
There followed a period of consultation both 
with the public and a number of statutory 
consultees and since the period end the 
council has written to IGas to seek further 
information on a range of matters. Once 
we have submitted that information, a 
further consultation period will take place 
before determination of the application, 
which we expect in the third quarter 2016, 
subject to any further request for additional 
information. Also, since the period end  
we have been granted permission to  
drill Groundwater Monitoring Boreholes  
at Springs Road and these have now  
been installed.
We are in the process of identifying a number 
of sites for further shale appraisal drilling and 
hydraulic fracturing of wells to determine 
flow rates and assess commerciality.

th
 Onshore Licensing Round
IGas has been offered a total of 17 blocks 
across three basins representing a total 
additional gross area of c. 270,000 acres; 
IGas’ net interest is c. 163,000 acres. These 
new licences will be formally awarded in 
April 2016 and further increase our oil and 
gas operations onshore in Britain whilst 
extending our acreage position in the 
strategically important shale basins. We are 
also particularly pleased to be strengthening 
the relationships with our existing partners 
Total, ENGIE E&P and Egdon.
Following the formal award of these blocks, 
IGas will have a total of c. 876,000 net 
acres under licence. The work programmes 
associated with the blocks will be phased 
and are subject to finalisation with the OGA. 
Under these work programmes, IGas has 
a minimum committed spend in the first 
two years of approximately £3 million net 
to IGas, focused on geological studies and 
seismic assessments. This will be followed by 
exploration drilling, targeting the prospective 
hydrocarbon bearing formations. 
Political and regulatory update
In August 2015, IGas welcomed the 
announcement by Government that 
gives greater clarity on the timetable for 
determining planning decisions for onshore 
oil and gas exploration and underlines 
Government’s commitment to get shale  
gas exploration underway in the UK. 
Following this, in November 2015, the 
Secretary of State for Communities and 
Local Government announced that he would 
decide the Cuadrilla Lancashire appeals  
after the Planning Inspector has conducted 
the Public Inquiry and produced a report  
and recommendations. The Public Inquiry  
is nearing conclusion.
In the Autumn Statement, the Chancellor 
announced that 10% of tax revenues  
from shale gas developments, up to a 
maximum of £10 million per site, will be 
put into a Shale Wealth Fund which could 
deliver up to £1 billion of investment 
in local communities hosting shale gas 
developments over the next 25 years.  
This provides a considerable opportunity 
in addition to the 1% of production 
revenues that shale gas companies have 
already committed to put back into local 
communities if shale gas exploration  
proves successful.
In December 2015, MPs voted to allow 
fracking for shale gas 1,200m below national 
parks and other protected sites. The new 
regulations permit drilling from outside the 
protected areas. The amending Order to 
allow groundwater monitoring boreholes  
to be granted under Permitted Development 
Rights bringing the onshore oil and gas 
industry in line with water companies  
and other industries which drill dozens  
of boreholes each year is likely to come  
into force later this year.
The fourth and final report of Lord Smith’s 
Task Force on Shale Gas was published in 
December 2015 and recommended fracking 
should get underway to establish how much 
shale gas there is in the UK. The report calls 
on the government and local communities  
to allow initial exploratory wells and 
concluded that it had found that, with  
the right regulations in place, fracking  
could take place safely.
International assets disposal programme
Further progress has been made on the 
rationalisation of non-core international 
assets with the disposal and relinquishment 
of licences in Australia and the majority 
of the Indonesian interests, which both 
completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Health and safety
Health and safety is of vital importance 
throughout the business in providing the 
highest level of protection to our employees, 
contractors, visitors, neighbours and the 
environment. Whilst we are keeping a 
tight control on costs there has been no 
compromise on the integrity and safety  
of our operations as demonstrated by  
zero Lost Time Incidents in the period.
2015 was our ninth consecutive year of 
receiving a Gold ROSPA Award, validating our 
commitment to the prevention of accidents 
in the work place by having robust policies 
and procedures, risk assessments, accident 
incident investigation and lessons learned.
IGas in the community
We continue to embrace the need to 
communicate effectively with local 
communities. Two years ago the industry 
launched its own community engagement 
charter which specifies that developers need 
to engage as early as possible, well before 
any planning applications are submitted. 
Over the course of the last nine months we 
have been working hard in the communities 
where we operate, engaging in a host of 
community events and initiatives. 
We have distributed over 37,000 leaflets and 
letters across our acreage, held 4 community 
exhibitions, presented at parish council 
meetings, engaged with local MPs, spoken 
at roundtable events and visited a number 
of projects that have benefited from our 
community fund.
In October 2015 we announced the  
launch of the 2016 round of our IGas Energy 
Community Fund. Further information about 
the fund and its recipients can be found in 
the sustainable and responsible business  
section of this Report.

I would like to thank each and every one 
of our employees for their hard work and 
commitment in what has been an extremely 
challenging environment. 
In a difficult operating environment it is even 
more important to recognise and reward 
our employee’s contribution. Although the 
Company did not make cash bonuses in 
respect of 2015, the Board approved a new 
Management Retention Plan in November 
2015, resulting in the award of options 
over IGas Energy plc ordinary shares to all 
permanent employees. Subject to remaining 
in employment, these awards vest in 
December 2016 with a further 12 month 
retention period before they may be sold.
Outlook
In the production business, we will continue 
to seek to mitigate the underlying decline 
and for the year ended 31 December 2016 
we expect production to be in the range of 
2,500 – 2,700 boepd. We have reduced our 
capital expenditure in light of the current 
oil price environment and 2016 capital 
expenditure is expected to be less than  
$10 million.
The Round 14 Licences are expected to be 
issued by the OGA in April 2016, increasing 
our acreage by more than 25% to over 
1m acres (gross) and the next step will be 
to undertake desktop analysis to refine 
our proposed work programmes. There 
is significant opportunity across our shale 
asset port olio and we are making progress 
against our five year plan including the 
submission of planning applications in North 
Nottinghamshire and the interpretation and 
processing of the 3D seismic acquisition in 
the North West. At the same time we are 
pursuing sites across the acreage and starting 
preparation work on scoping reports.
2016 is likely to be another challenging year 
for the industry. With commodity prices still 
remaining at low levels, our focus remains 
on retaining balance sheet strength and 
preserving cash. Whilst the steps we have 
taken to manage costs and improve the 
strength of the balance sheet have helped 
the business in this environment, we must 
remain focused on cost effective, value 
adding activity both on the production  
and appraisal assets.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
A PROMISING FUTURE Production performance
Average net production in the nine months  
to 31 December 2015 was 2,570 boepd  
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: 2,737 
boepd). Production delivery was initially very 
strong, benefiting from the determined focus 
on production optimisation and the reduction 
of unplanned deferred production.
However, production in the latter part of 
the period was impacted by a deferral in 
workover activity to allow an extended 
maintenance programme on a key workover 
rig to be conducted. This unit has now been 
returned to service and the level of workover 
activity has now resumed with the aim of 
restoring production back to projected levels.
Maximising economic recovery from  
existing assets
We continue to offset the underlying natural 
decline in our fields through focused technical 
and operational expertise. Opportunities for 
incremental production are technically and 
commercially evaluated to meet the relevant 
screening criteria aimed at maximising the 
economic recovery from the existing assets. 
Detailed subsurface studies are utilised 
in conjunction with field operating 
experience to select appropriate production 
enhancement candidates taking into account 
relevant constraints. 
One area where we have seen significant 
progress has been artificial lift optimisation, 
resulting in incremental production and 
reduced operating costs. This positive 
outcome has been heavily influenced by 
the installation of Rod Pump-Off Controllers 
(“RPOC’s”), part of the Group investment in 
the “Digital Oilfield” technology. This initiative 
is beginning to bear fruit and is being adopted 
more widely across the assets.
The adoption of cost effective technology to 
unlock value in our assets remains a key part 
of our overall strategy. 
Another initiative, under the “digital oilfield” 
project has been the implementation of “real 
time” field monitoring and reporting. We 
have been able to build “in house” much of 
the necessary architecture and the results not 
only allow more effective field management 
but deliver significant cost savings. This 
capability is also being developed with a view 
to planning future field instrumentation and 
remote management, something that will be 
particularly beneficial for shale development.
The potential to enhance production and 
reserves through the application of secondary 
recovery methods, e.g. water injection, is 
another initiative that is being pursued. Two 
“pilot schemes” have been implemented in 
our East Midland fields. Preliminary results 
are encouraging and whilst we continue to 
monitor and evaluate our water injection 
pilots, based on these early results, we are 
looking at measures to increase injection 
rates aiming to further enhance production 
and recovery. Depending on the success of 
these trials we will look to further expand 
the initial pilot schemes as well as looking 
at adopting a similar approach in other 
candidate fields. 
To maximise the benefits of secondary 
recovery by water injection it is advantageous 
to ensure the produced water is treated 
before it is re-injected into the producing 
reservoir . We instigated a number of trials on 
a water treatment plant at our Welton facility 
to “field prove” the technology. The results 
from these trials look very encouraging for  
a wider field application. 
A detailed and extensive study of the 
Stockbridge Field in the Weald Basin has 
been completed resulting in an updated Field 
Development Plan (“FDP”). This is one of 
several such studies that are being conducted 
on the major fields in the port olio. The 
Stockbridge FDP has identified some infill 
drilling opportunities that offer the possibility 
of incremental production and reserves. 
Three sidetracks, from existing , low 
productivity wells, were successfully drilled 
by the period end; on time, on budget and 
without incident. All three wells, each drilled 
horizontally through the main carbonate 
reservoirs, encountered the formations and 
hydrocarbons as prognosed. At the period 
end the wells were being completed and 
preliminary production testing was being 
initiated. Current production across the 
three wells is c. 100 boepd, which is below 
expectations, but an extended production 
period will be necessary to ascertain long-
term, stable rates. 
Gas monetisation of the Albury, Bletchingley 
and Lybster fields continues to be progressed. 
Project plans have been developed and 
market quotes for the activities obtained  
for both Albury and Bletchingley.

 across our acreage 
in the North West covering PEDLs 
189 and 190, to the north of Chester . 
This data will enhance our regional 
understanding of the basin, structure 
and target depths of the shale. The 
data is currently undergoing processing 
and interpretation, the results of which 
will determine future exploration and 
appraisal work across this acreage.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    21 Albury, which had been granted planning 
consent for a mini Liquefied Natural Gas 
(“LNG”) development, has been revisited and a 
new application submitted to develop the field 
for a mini Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”) 
development. CNG represents a simpler and 
cheaper solution. The Bletchingley Field gas 
offtake assumes the gas will be exported via the 
local grid network. Both planning applications 
have been submitted, validated and we await 
determination. However , final project sanction 
will depend on being able to negotiate suitable 
commercial terms with the offtakers, in today’s 
more difficult market. 
At Lybster , in Scotland, we are redeveloping 
the existing facilities whilst we continue 
discussions with a number of entities to 
evaluate the offtake options for the associated 
gas. In the interim, the well remains shut-in 
while the various site upgrades are completed. 
Consideration will be given to recommencing 
oil production during 2016 but the duration  
of the flow period will be determined by the 
gas offtake discussions.
During the course of the period an extensive 
cost saving programme was undertaken. 
This has resulted in a significant reduction in 
operating expenditure from $34.6/boe (12 
months ended 31 March 2015) to $24.6/boe 
(including a one-off rates rebate equivalent 
to $5.5/boe). The focus continues on 
maintaining production at broadly historical 
levels whilst managing absolute costs but 
ensuring safety is not compromised.
As part of the cost saving programme,  
a new production division organisational 
structure was implemented as of 1 October 
2015 which introduced a rationalised, but 
standardised approach to the delivery of 
safe, compliant and efficient production 
operations. The new structure emphasises 
accountability and responsibility for delivery 
whilst encouraging optimisation and 
knowledge exchange across the business. 
Underpinning these changes is a clear focus 
on the business priorities, which is essential 
in the current climate.
Reserves update
Despite reduced commodity price 
assumptions, potentially affecting the 
commercial lives of the fields, we have  
seen 2P reserves replacement of over  
150% based on a cumulative production  
of 0.71 mmboe in the period. This is  
largely due to a combination of reduced 
operating costs, better than anticipated  
field performance combined with the  
various initiatives outlined above.
More than 2,000 responses were received 
during public consultation on the application, 
and the Council has recently written to IGas 
to seek further information on a range of 
matters including site selection and sequential 
testing, surface water run-off, ecology, traffic 
and transportation, and landscape and visual 
impact. This is a usual part of the planning 
process for major developments, particularly 
those subject to an environmental impact 
assessment. Once we have submitted the 
additional information, a further period of 
public consultation will take place before NCC 
determines the application. IGas has agreed 
with NCC that such a decision would be made 
before the end of July 2016, subject to further 
requests for information.
As part of the Springs Road site programme, 
IGas lodged a planning application to seek 
consent to drill a series of groundwater 
monitoring boreholes adjacent to the Springs 
Road site. These boreholes allow groundwater 
to be monitored before, during and after 
any IGas operations on the Springs Road 
site. This application was granted in January 
2016 and the boreholes were successfully 
drilled and completed in February 2016. Data 
gathered from these boreholes will provide 
further information relating to the current 
local surface and groundwater quality and will 
allow for a full understanding of conditions 
before, during and after our operations.
The drilling of the two exploration wells 
at Springs Road will be an important step 
in helping us to understand the shale gas 
potential in North Nottinghamshire and more 
widely in the East Midlands and Yorkshire. 
A successful exploration well would, in all 
likelihood, lead to a subsequent planning 
application to flow test a well which would 
involve hydraulic fracturing.
IGas embarked on a community engagement 
process that began in early 2014, including 
the formation of a Community Liaison Group 
(“CLG”), providing community representatives 
with a forum to meet with members of the 
IGas project team, discuss the proposals and 
make recommendations. There have also 
been three public information events to give 
residents the opportunity to find out more 
about activity at the proposed site.

Shale gas – delivery against the five  
year development plan 
Recent activity, outlined below, commences 
our work on the five year development plan 
to advance the evaluation and development 
of our shale gas resources through to 
commercial production. 
North West
We have successfully completed a significant 
3D seismic acquisition programme in the 
North West covering an area of 110km². We 
are now in receipt of some of the preliminary 
results and the processing and interpretation 
phase has commenced. This is likely to 
complete in the third quarter of 2016.
As we move into the appraisal stage, we 
are in the process of identifying a number 
of sites for further appraisal drilling and 
hydraulic fracturing of the wells to determine 
flow rates and assess commerciality. The 
results from the 3D survey will determine 
our future exploration and appraisal work 
programme in the area.
East Midlands and Yorkshire
In October 2015, we submitted a planning 
application at our Springs Road site, in North 
Nottinghamshire. The proposal is to drill two 
exploratory wells in order to evaluate the 
geology in the local area and begin assessing 
its potential for shale gas recovery. The site 
is located in PEDL 140, where we operate on 
behalf of Total, Egdon and eCorp Oil & Gas 
UK Ltd.
The planning application supported by an 
Environmental Statement, for two exploration 
wells at the Springs Road site was validated 
by Nottinghamshire County Council (“NCC”) 
on 30 October 2015. There followed a 
period of consultation both with the public 
and a number of statutory consultees. 
Planning law prescribes circumstances where 
consultation must take place between a local 
planning authority and certain organisations 
referred to as statutory consultees, prior to a 
decision being made on an application. The 
organisations in question are under a duty to 
respond to the local planning authority within 
a set deadline and must provide a substantive 
response to the application in question.

DELIVERING ON OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN
• Groundwater monitoring boreholes installed at  
Springs Road; and 
• Scoping report submitted for a single exploration  
well – PEDL 200. In the adjoining licence block, PEDL 200, we 
have identified a new site, Tinker Lane, and 
have submitted an initial scoping request to 
NCC to drill a single vertical exploration well 
to obtain key geological data, including logs 
and cores. 
We continue to work with local businesses 
and energy intensive industries to build a 
supply chain capable of supporting the shale 
industry. We are also actively identifying 
opportunities across our acreage where  
we can utilise infrastructure and resources  
to ensure, where possible, we minimise  
our surface footprint and local impacts.  
These are fundamental considerations  
for any site selection. 
International assets
Following the acquisition of Dart Energy in 
2014, the Group has been through a process 
of disposing of non-core assets acquired as 
part of this transaction. 
The Group divested by way of relinquishment, 
asset sale or corporate disposal all of its 
operational interests in Australia. 
Following the closure of the Singapore office 
in March 2015, one employee remains 
to assist with the ongoing operations and 
divestment of non-core assets.
An office presence is maintained in China 
where the formal process of deregistering  
the legal entities registered there continues.
In India, IGas remains as Operator of the 
Assam Block AS-CBM-2008/IV and retains a 
10% working interest. The outstanding work 
programme is scheduled to complete on time 
in early 2016. The exploration phase has been 
completed with two test production wells to 
drill and flow-test. It is likely that the licence 
will be relinquished once the minimum work 
programme has been completed as required 
by the Regulator . 
A Share Purchase Agreement for Dart  
Energy (Indonesia) Holdings Pte. Ltd. was 
executed in May 2015 and completed in 
November 2015. Bank guarantees totalling 
US$2.6 million have been received to date. 
IGas retains a working interest in the  
non-operated Sangatta West PSC.
 
Health, safety and environmental protection
IGas is committed to conducting 
its operations in a safe, secure and 
environmentally responsible manner . 
Maintaining the highest standards of safety 
and environmental protection is something 
we take seriously, and is the top priority at 
each and every one of our operational sites. 
Throughout the business there is a strong 
and visible commitment to HSE management 
and promoting a positive culture within the 
Company and that focus resulted in achieving 
zero Lost Time Incidents for the period. 
We have again maintained our ISO 9001 
and 14001 accreditation with no major 
non-conformances identified. We remain 
committed to maintaining these international 
standards in 2016. 
Minimising our impact on the environment
At IGas, we work to minimise our impact on 
the environment and during the period we 
volunteered as entrant to the Energy Saving 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) to reduce 
energy usage across our operations. The ESOS 
has been established by DECC in response  
to the requirement to implement Article 8  
of the Energy Efficiency Directive. 
We are in the process of replacing 
approximately half of our combustion engine 
vehicle fleet with electric vehicles in the East 
Midlands. This will reduce vehicle exhaust 
emissions and noise in the local communities 
in which we operate. The electricity will be 
supplied from our own generating capacity. 
The business continues to review its 
environmental performance in reducing its 
emissions to the environment and has been 
awarded funds from Innovate UK to trial 
methods to capture low volumes of methane 
for beneficial use. 
Waste heat will also be recovered and used 
to aid oil water separation in the onsite oil 
tanks which will reduce transport costs and 
movements. 
Regulation 
IGas continues to cooperate and collaborate 
with industry and regulators to further 
progress the development, updating and 
implementation of best available techniques 
for both conventional and unconventional 
operations, transferring best practice and 
lessons learned where applicable. There have 
been many developments during 2015 which 
have given much needed clarity to IGas and 
industry including issues relating to technical 
underground trespass and the issuing of 
regulatory position statements around 
such matters as flaring, hydraulic fracture 
programmes and site safety assessments.

Operating cashflow is key to providing 
funding for investing in the business as  
we pursue our growth strategy. The Group 
generated £1.0 million in the period 
which was significantly impacted by the 
reduction in the oil price in the period and 
the reduction in production due to the 
availability of a workover rig.

for funding of the Group. To ensure this 
target is met an appropriate level of capital 
investment is planned to mitigate against the 
underlying decline in our mature fields. In 
the nine months ended 31 December 2015 
production amounted to 2,570 boe/d which 
was below the expected level. The principal 
reason for the short all was a deferral in 
workover activity to allow an extended

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
MEASURING OUR PROGRESS We remain focused on 
maintaining flexibility for the 
business in the current oil price 
environment. 
Good progress was made  
in the nine months ended  
31 December 2015 in 
strengthening the Group’s 
balance sheet. The farm-out  
to INEOS in May 2015 for  
£30 million in cash and up to 
a £138 million carried gross 
work programme has improved 
the Group’s cash position and 
the amendment of the bond 
terms in August 2015 provided 
the Group with more financial 
flexibility. As at the period end, 
the Group has a carried gross 
work programme of up to $255 
million on its shale assets which 
will enhance the Group’s ability 
to deliver on its strategy.
However, the last nine months has seen a 
further decline in the oil price and this has 
materially impacted the financial results. In 
the nine months ended 31 December 2015 
adjusted EBITDA
1
 was £18.3 million (12 months 
ended 31 March 2015: £21.6 million) whilst a 
loss was recognised from continuing activities 
after tax of £44.8 million (12 months ended 
31 March 2015: profit £5.2 million). The main 
factors explaining the movements between  
the nine months ended 31 December 2015 
and the 12 months ended 31 March 2015 
were as follows: 
• Reduced revenues of £25.1 million  
(12 months ended 31 March 2015:  
£58.2 million) principally due to  
reduced oil prices;
• Restructuring costs of £2.1 million  
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: £nil) 
following completion of a cost reduction

Income statement
The Group recognised revenues of £25.1 
million in the nine months (12 months  
ended 31 March 2015: £58.2 million).  
Group production in the nine months was  
an average of 2,570 boepd (12 months ended  
31 March 2015: 2,737 boepd). Revenues 
for the nine months included £2.4 million 
(12 months ended 31 December 2015: £7.7 
million) relating to the sale of third party oil, 
the bulk of which is processed through  
our gathering centre at Holybourne in  
the Weald Basin. 
The average realised price for the nine 
months per barrel pre hedge was $51.3  
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: $84.1)  
and post hedge $58.9 (12 months ended  
31 March 2015: $94.0). The average exchange 
rate for the nine months was £1: $1.53 (12 
months ended 31 March 2015: £1: $1.63) 
which positively impacted revenues.
Cost of sales for the nine months were  
£21.5 million (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £42.7 million) including depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation (“D,D&A”) of 
£7.1 million (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £12.8 million), and operating costs  
of £14.4 million (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £29.9 million). Operating costs include 
a £2.2 million charge (12 months ended  
31 March 2015: £7.2 million) in relation  
to processing third party oil, a decrease of  
£5.0 million from the comparative period 
due to the decreased number of barrels 
purchased from third parties and processed 
by us and the significant fall in the oil price. 
The contribution received from processing 
this third party oil was £0.2 million (12 
months ended 31 March 2015: £0.5 million).

Operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent 
were £16.1 ($24.6), excluding the third party 
costs (12 months ended 31 March 2015: 
£21.5 ($34.6) per barrel). The reduction in

rates following discussions with the 
Valuation Office Agency. 
Adjusted EBITDA

(12 months ended 31 March 2015: £15.4 
million). Administrative costs decreased by 
£3.4 million to £6.0 million (12 months ended 
31 March 2015: £9.4 million) principally due 
to the cost reduction exercise.
Net back per boe (on an Income Statement

G&A basis was $34.3 (£22.4) (12 months 
ended 31 March 2015: $59.0 (£36.3)).
The Group recognised an impairment charge 
of £48.1 million (net of tax) (12 months 
ended 31 March 2015: £1.6 million) relating 
to producing assets (£8.9 million net of tax) 
and goodwill (£39.2 million), principally 
as a result of the reduction in commodity 
forward curves at the year end. Exploration 
costs written off were £10.0 million  
(net of tax) (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £6.4 million).

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    27 Other income of £5.0 million (12 months 
ended 31 March 2015: £0.3 million) has 
been recognised in the period relating to 
a fair value adjustment on the contingent 
deferred consideration in relation to 
amounts payable to a joint venture partner.
Net finance costs were £7.8 million in the 
nine months (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £12.5 million), which primarily relate 
to interest on borrowings of £8.7 million 
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: £12.6 
million), a gain on fair value of warrants 
of £0.2 million (12 months ended 31 
March 2015: gain of £5.4 million), a net 
foreign exchange gain of £0.1 million (12 
months ended 31 March 2015: loss of £6.3 
million) and a realised gain on the bonds 
repurchased of £0.9 million (12 months 
ended 31 March 2015: £1.4 million).
The Group made a gain in the nine months 
on oil price derivatives of £8.6 million (12 
months ended 31 March 2015: £7.0 million).
Portfolio management
During the nine months, the Group 
completed the farm-out to INEOS, who 
acquired an interest in certain licences in 
the North West and East Midlands and 
the Group's participating interest in the 
acreage held under PEDL 133 in Scotland. 
The consideration for IGas’ participating 
interests comprised £30 million cash which 
was received on completion and a funded 
forward work programme of up to £138 
million gross, of which IGas’ share to be 
funded fully by INEOS is expected to amount 
to approximately £65 million. The Group 
recognised a profit of £4.0 million on this 
transaction.
Cash flow
Net cash generated from operating activities 
in the nine months amounted to £1.0 million 
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: £26.5 
million). The Group invested £9.4 million 
across its asset base in the nine months 
(12 months ended 31 March 2015: £16.8 
million), of which £6.4 million was invested 
in the conventional assets, principally 
related to the three Stockbridge sidetracks 
completed in the period, where we continue 
to invest to maintain our production at 
current levels. 
IGas repaid £6.1 million ($8.2 million) of 
principal on borrowings to bondholders in 
the period in accordance with the terms 
of the bonds (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: £5.2 million ($8.3 million)), which

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED original principal amount of the secured 
bonds. In the nine months ended 31 
December 2015, the Company repurchased 
bonds with a face value of $7.0 million for 
$5.3 million (12 months ended 31 March 
2015: face value of $15.7 million for $13.2 
million). 
IGas paid £5.9 million ($9.0 million) in 
interest (12 months ended 31 March 2015: 
£11.5 million ($18.5 million)). Cash and cash 
equivalents were £28.6 million at the period 
end (31 March 2015: £19.0 million).
Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 December 2015 amounted 
to £98.8 million (31 March 2015: £146.6 
million) with the decrease in net assets 
principally resulting from the loss during 
the nine months ended 31 December 2015 
from continuing activities which was due to 
impairments to assets and goodwill caused 
by the reduction in commodity prices.
The Group hedges its oil production through 
the use of a mixture of puts, swaps and zero 
cost collars, therefore minimising the cost 
of the hedge instruments. At 31 December 
2015, the Group’s derivative instruments 
had a net positive fair value of £6.6 million  
(31 March 2015: £1.4 million).
Net debt, being borrowings less cash, at  
the period end amounted to £73.3 million 
(31 March 2015: £86.4 million).
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group constantly monitors the Group’s 
risk exposures and reports to the Audit 
Committee and the Board on a regular basis. 
The Audit Committee receives and reviews 
these reports and focuses on ensuring that 
the effective systems of internal financial 
and non-financial controls including the 
management of risk are maintained. The 
results of this work are reported to the 
Board which in turn performs its own  
review and assessment.
The principal risks for the Group can be 
summarised as:
• Strategy fails to meet shareholder 
expectations;
• Planning, environmental, licensing and 
other permitting risks associated with its 
operations and, in particular, with drilling 
and production operations;
• No guarantee can be given that oil or 
gas can be produced in the anticipated 
quantities from any or all of the Group’s 
assets or that oil or gas can be delivered 
economically;
• Successful development of shale  
gas resources;
• Loss of key staff; 
• Market price risk through variations in  
the wholesale price of oil in the context  
of the production from oil fields it owns 
and operates;
• Market price risk through variations in the 
wholesale price of gas and electricity in 
the context of its future unconventional 
production volumes;
• Exchange rate risk through both its major 
source of revenue and its major borrowings 
being priced in $ while most of the Group’s 
operating and G&A costs are denominated 
in UK pounds sterling;
• Liquidity risk through its operations;
• Capital risk resulting from its capital 
structure, including operating within  
the covenants of its existing bond 
agreements; and
• Political risk such as change in 
Government or the effect of local or 
national referendum.
Going concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its 
liquidity risks. Cash forecasts for the Group 
are regularly produced based on, inter alia, 
the Group’s production and expenditure 
forecasts, management’s best estimate of 
future oil prices (based on current forward 
curves, adjusted for the Group's hedging 
programme) and the Group’s borrowing 
facilities. Sensitivities are run to reflect 
different scenarios including, but not limited 
to, possible further reductions in commodity 
prices below the current forward curve  
and reductions in forecast oil and gas  
production rates. 
The ability of the Group to operate as a going 
concern is dependent upon the continued 
availability of future cash flows and the 
availability of the monies drawn under its 
Bonds, which in turn is dependent on the 
Group not breaching its bond covenants. 
In response to the significant reduction in 
oil prices, the Board implemented a series 
of cost saving initiatives during the period 
that have materially reduced both operating 
costs and G&A spend. In addition, following 
positive discussions with the bondholders, 
the net leverage covenant, inter alia, was 
amended to take account of the Group’s 
improved cash position following the INEOS 
farm-out, which was completed during  
the period.
Whilst the Group has delivered on the 
above initiatives and has significant cash 
balances, the continuing low commodity 
price environment means that the Group's 
current forecasts, utilising the current oil 
price forward curve, project non-compliance 
with certain of its covenants in the second 
half of 2016. The Board is pursuing actions to 
alleviate a covenant breach including, but not 
limited to, further cost reductions, monetising 
existing hedged oil positions, bond buy-
backs, and asset port olio management. 
Concurrently, the Board will continue 
to evaluate all other options, including 
transactions that would increase the Group’s 
cash and/or earnings, which could reduce 
the need for the mitigating actions set out 
above. Nevertheless, based on the current oil 
price and forward curve, the directors cannot 
be certain that these will fully mitigate any 
potential covenant short all in respect of the 
testing period ending 31 December 2016. 
Whilst pursuing the options listed above, the 
Board will continue its proactive dialogue 
with bondholders and, if appropriate, seek 
to modify or temporarily waive the existing 
covenants ahead of the time at which the 
Group submits its compliance certificate in 
respect of that testing period, which would 
be by 30 April 2017. 
The risk that the Group will be unable 
to either enact appropriate mitigating 
actions to a sufficient extent before the 
31 December 2016 measurement date 
or secure an appropriate relaxation or 
amendment of its financial covenants prior 
to 30 April 2017 represents a material 
uncertainty that may cast doubt upon  
the Group’s ability to continue as a  
going concern.
The Board believes, after making appropriate 
enquiries, and on the information currently 
available, that the Group is likely to be able 
to either implement sufficient mitigating 
actions to ensure that the Group is 
compliant with its covenants and/or secure 
a relaxation to the covenants as described 
above and it is therefore considered 
appropriate to adopt the going concern  
basis in preparing the financial statements.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    31 IGas is committed to acting openly and honestly with the local communities in which we 
operate by establishing engagement programmes at the early stages of any development and 
keeping people informed throughout the lifecycle of the project. Through our Community Fund, 
the Company has a strong track record of supporting local community-led organisations and 
projects, helping to support and in some cases, transform communities.
LISTENING AND RESPONDING 
As a signatory to the UKOOG Community Engagement Charter , 
we are committed to open and transparent communications with 
the communities in which we operate and our wider stakeholders. 
Many of our 158 employees, live and work locally to our operations, 
therefore the strength of our relationships with our neighbours is  
vital to our ongoing success.
For all of our projects, we have a dedicated engagement programme 
which begins in advance of any operational activity such as 3D seismic 
acquisition or any applications for planning permission. This gives the 
community an opportunity to understand the proposed plans and 
ask questions. We listen to concerns and help to allay some of those 
concerns by outlining the steps we take to mitigate any impacts and 
ensure protection for the environment.
It also provides the opportunity for local communities to give us 
feedback on our plans and suggest amendments. This approach has 
been successful in a number of areas, such as seeing us change our 
proposed traffic routes in the Springs Road planning application and 
improve our engagement with local residents during our seismic 
acquisition in the North West.
An important part of local engagement involves setting up a 
community liaison group within the local area of any proposed 
site or planning application. We invite local parish councillors and 
representatives from the community to attend regular meetings 
where we can ensure that our neighbours have access to the most 
up to date and relevant information and expert guidance. This keeps 
them well informed of our progress and of the facts about our 
operations. It also provides an opportunity for the community to 
share their concerns with us so that we can answer questions and  
offer independent guidance and expertise.
We set up our Springs Road liaison group in the East Midlands in 
June 2014, before we had even identified a site, and it has been 
meeting at least monthly since then.  
It has proved a very successful way of engaging with the  
local community.
The Group’s agenda is agreed by the membership, with IGas 
providing support by bringing along experts to give presentations on 
topics such as seismic acquisition, drilling, planning and regulation.
We have also provided a continued point of contact for the local 
community, with a dedicated Local Communications Manager based 
in the area, ensuring that there is a continuous two way conversation 
between the local community and IGas.
For our shale gas developments in the East Midlands we have held 
several community exhibitions, with IGas employees present from 
all disciplines and representatives from the EA and DECC available to 
answer questions. Four of these exhibitions have now been held and 
they were all very well attended.
We have distributed a follow up newsletter for the East Midlands  
and the North West regions which were sent by Royal Mail to over 
18,000 local residents.
To provide the most up to date information on our live planning 
application at Springs Road, a dedicated website has been set up: 
www.springsroad.co.uk.
In relation to the people who live closest to our sites, we send out 
letters regularly updating them on our progress and inviting them 
to meet and discuss developments. Team members are happy  
to visit local residents in their homes and spend time answering  
their questions.
The purpose of this engagement is to ensure that the local 
communities understand our proposed developments and that 
we can understand residents’ concerns, from their own unique 
environment, and are able to address them. It forms an integral  
part of our commitment to be good neighbours and become  
part of the communities in which we work.

WOMEN’S POTENTIAL
IGas is committed to tackling gender 
diversity within the energy sector by 
making a pledge to support the aims  
of POWERful Women (“PfW”). 
Launched by Baroness Verma in 
summer 2014, PfW seeks to showcase 
female leadership potential in the UK's 
energy sector. Of the top 100 energy 
companies headquartered in the UK, 
only 5% of executive board seats in 
total are held by women. PfW aims to 
change this and targets to have 40% of 
energy company middle management 
and 30% of executive energy board 
members to be female by 2030

.
PfW initiatives include, “POWERful 
Connections”, which matches females 
aspiring to move into senior leadership 
positions within the next 5 years, with 
some of the most influential leaders and 
entrepreneurs from the energy sector, who 
mentor the women on career progression 
and personal development. Various 
individuals at IGas have been attending  
PfW events and are also participating  
in the mentoring scheme. 
SUPPORTING OUR 
COMMUNITIES
IGas businesses have been operating 
in the UK for over three decades and 
we pride ourselves on being a good 
neighbour, placing the community 
and local relationships at the heart of 
everything we do. Established in 2008, 
the IGas Community Fund supports 
community-led organisations that can 
make a real difference, helping to  
improve amenities locally.
To be eligible for an award, projects must 
be able to demonstrate real community 
impetus and benefits, for example, 
organisations that involve a broad span 
of the community, education and skills 
development, or projects that celebrate 
and protect local heritage. Additionally, 
during the 2015 round, the panel focused 
on supporting projects that promote 
sustainable development and initiatives 
of local significance.
During the period, we visited many 
of the projects, offering our help and 
support when needed. This allowed IGas 
employees the opportunity to see first-
hand, the positive impact we have made 
to projects, which often bring wellbeing 
and social cohesion into deprived and 
disadvantaged areas.
Having visited numerous groups across 
the UK, and learning best practice within 
community-based organisations, the 
team is well placed to share experiences 
and encourage continual development  
of these projects.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    35 HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT 
IGas is committed to conducting its operations in a safe, secure and 
environmentally responsible manner, to providing healthy and injury 
free workplaces for its employees and contractors and to being a good 
neighbour in the local communities within which it operates. 
Throughout the business there is a strong and visible commitment 
to HSE management and promoting a positive culture within the 
Company. We encourage personnel to report all incidents, near  
misses and concerns to embed a culture of continual learning  
and improvement of HSE performance.
Over the period, we achieved zero Lost Time Incidents. Our 
performance was primarily due to an even greater focus on our safety 
culture and practices by our leadership team and operations personnel, 
who continue to promote a safety culture that is embedded in the 
workforce to ensure zero Lost Time Incidents. 
We have again maintained our ISO 9001 and 14001 accreditation  
with no major non-conformances identified. We remain committed  
to maintaining these international standards in 2016. 
Minimising our impact on the environment
At IGas we work to minimise our impact on the environment and 
during the period we volunteered as an entrant to Energy Saving 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) to reduce energy usage across  
our operations. 
The ESOS has been established by the DECC in response to the 
requirement to implement Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive. 
This regulation came into force on 17 July 2014. Alongside the EU 
obligation, ESOS is also being introduced as a route to stimulate 
economic savings to be achieved by businesses, estimated to be 
in the region of £1.6 billion by 2020. In general, the result of the 
audit supported that IGas’ energy performance is good and there 
are presently no energy consuming factors that would mandate a 
near term repeat energy audit. The Company is evolving and the 
need for enhanced energy controls will be kept under review. As the 
organisation develops then the position regarding ESOS audit will be 
reviewed to ensure that we remain focused on our key priorities.

EDUCATING 
A FUTURE 
WORKFORCE  
IN SHALE
The aim of the National College for 
Onshore Oil and Gas (“NCOOG”) is to 
educate and inspire the next generation 
of onshore engineers and other 
specialists, ensuring that the industry 
can employ highly-skilled British workers 
to uphold the highest standards of 
safe, environmentally sensitive and 
transparent operations. 
In July 2015, NCOOG submitted a 
Business Plan and capital funding 
application to the Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills. In 
November’s Autumn Statement, it was 
announced that NCOOG was one of five 
industry specific National Colleges that 
would be taken forward, subject to final 
due diligence. 
The NCOOG Board has been established, 
with the first two Board meetings held 
in October 2015 and November 2015. 
The Board is composed of academic 
and industry specialists, including 
John Blaymires from IGas, with the 
Department for Business, Innovation 
and Skills having observer status. An 
Advisory Council has also been set up, 
and the industry has made a number of 
secondments to NCOOG, to support its 
development over the coming months. 
NCOOG and the industry are working 
with OPITO, the skills body for the 
offshore oil and gas industry, to agree 
industry training standards. These 
standards will then be used by NCOOG 
to develop courses at the levels the 
industry needs. The first standard, 
which is nearing completion, will cover 
Health, Safety, Security and Environment 
(“HSSE”), and will ensure that workers 
on drilling sites have a core level of 
competence in these vital areas. 
Over the next few months, NCOOG will 
begin to develop both short and longer 
courses, and will begin outreach work. 
The aim is to start training the first 
students in late 2016.
STRATEGIC REPORT
36    |    IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015
SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONTINUED We are in the process of replacing 50% of our combustion engine 
vehicle fleet with electric vehicles. This will reduce vehicle exhaust 
emissions as well as noise in the local communities in which  
we operate. The electricity will be supplied from our own  
generated electricity. 
The business continues to review its environmental performance 
in reducing its emissions and has been awarded funds from 
Innovate UK to trial methods to capture low volumes of methane 
for beneficial use. The trial will take place at the Scampton North 
Oilfield where low volumes of methane are vented, under permit, 
to atmosphere from the oil storage tanks. The methane currently 
vented will be captured and used as fuel in a Stirling Heat Engine 
to produce electricity for the site reducing imports from the local 
electricity network.
In addition to the benefits of producing electricity, the scheme 
will also enhance oil production by reducing back pressure on 
the wells. Waste heat will also be recovered and used to aid oil 
water separation in the onsite oil tanks which will reduce overhaul 
transport costs and vehicle movements. Oil water from the site 
would normally be transported offsite to a central gathering system 
for processing and then dry oil would be transported onto the 
refinery. The new scheme will allow dry oil to be transported  
directly to the refinery from the site.
Regulator monitoring
The HSE make regular visits to IGas sites on an announced and 
unannounced basis.
During the HSE’s unannounced visits, a number of checks are 
made including our use of personal protective equipment; general 
inspection of the security and safety awareness on site; and full 
compliance with our site safety plan. Each week we are required  
to send a report to the HSE detailing all the operations conducted  
in the previous seven day period.
Alongside the testing and approval of all water and chemicals  
on IGas sites, the EA carries out spot checks on the general  
site condition.
OUR PEOPLE 
IGas endeavours to be a first class employer and believes that 
the key to the success of its business is based on the strength 
and calibre of the people we employ. We ensure that we foster 
good relationships with all personnel, including contractors. 
We value diversity and we encourage open communication 
and dialogue across the business.
One of the key challenges for the Human Resources  
function lay in managing costs as efficiently as possible  
within increasingly difficult economic conditions during  
the year. In addition to a company-wide review of the use  
of contractors, during the period the total number of 
employees in the UK reduced from 195 to 158.
We promote training and education of all employees, in  
order to benefit both themselves and the Company. During 
the period the Company has augmented the annual appraisal 
and competency assessment procedures by automating the 
traditionally “paper-based” process. Going forward, this will 
allow employees access to their own performance records 
and assist in the identification of training needs.
We continue to support three apprentices who joined 
towards the end of 2014:
An apprentice Mechanical Engineer (Well Services) who 
completed “classroom” based training at end of April and  
is now working in the field full-time, and two apprentice E&I 
Technicians (Maintenance) who continue to combine both 
work and study as part of their apprenticeships. 
Jack Parker has completed his apprenticeship and has  
been working in a permanent role as E&I Technician since  
1 October 2015. Danny Coo, a former apprentice who 
became an Operator in January 2014, successfully applied  
for an internally advertised role of Production Technician  
in December 2015.

SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONTINUED
WELL INTEGRITY
Key to the protection of the 
environment is the well design. 
Regulations enforced by the  
HSE require an independent  
well examiner to assess the  
design, construction and 
maintenance of the well.
SHALE IN CONTEXT
Shale resources are usually 1,600m 
or more below the surface, twice the 
depth of the UK’s deepest coal mine. The Strategic Report, as set out on 
pages 1 to 39, has been approved  
by order of the Board.

The design and construction of the well is 
key to subsurface environmental protection. 
Through the use of multiple physical 
barriers of casing and cement, as well as 
utilising natural impermeable geology layers 
as protection, the well will protect any 
migration of hydrocarbons or well fluids  
into the surrounding rock formation. 
During site construction, a thick impermeable 
membrane is placed across the entire site 
which prevents any potential spills leaking 
into the groundwater . The membrane holds 
all site surface water which is also tested  
prior to disposal.
The EA, which regulates shale extraction, has 
investigated the likelihood of groundwater 
contamination in detail and judged that the 
environmental risks at each individual stage 
of exploratory shale gas operation, after 
proper management and regulation, are 
“low”
1
. The EA will not permit activities if 
they are close to drinking water sources,  
such as groundwater from aquifers. 
According to a joint Royal Society and the 
Royal Academy of Engineering report the 
risk of water contamination is very low 
provided that shale gas extraction takes 
place at depths of many hundreds of metres 
or several kilometres – which would be the 
case in the UK
2
.
The Chartered Institution of Water and 
Environmental Management (“CIWEM”) 
also agree that risks to groundwater quality 
are generally considered to be low in the 
UK where the shale rock in question often 
exists at considerable depths below aquifers 
and gas would be required to migrate many 
hundreds of metres between source rock 
and sensitive groundwater
3
.
PROTECTING THE 
ENVIRONMENT
The UK onshore oil and gas industry is 
committed to working with regulators 
and within local areas to ensure that 
any activity is done safely and with 
as little impact to the environment as 
possible. Throughout our operations and 
the lifecycle of our wells robust safety 
measures are in place to protect the 
environment.
Protection of aquifers and ground water  
is essential. IGas wells are all designed with 
the minimum of three layers of steel casing 
– the surface casing, the intermediate 
casing and the production casing. The 
intermediate casing ensures that there 
can be no leakage path from the shale 
reservoir up to the aquifer .
The main UK legal regulations covering  
well design, construction and 
decommissioning are:
• Offshore Installations and Wells  
(Design and Construction etc.)  
Regulations 1996 (“DCR”);
• Borehole Sites & Operations  
Regulations 1995 (“BSOR”);
• Dangerous Substances and Explosive 
Atmospheres Regulations 2002  
(“DSEAR”); and
• Provision and Use of Work Equipment 
Regulations 1998 (“PUWER”).
Prior to any drilling activity, we must 
send our proposed well design to an 
independent well examiner. Once the 
design has been satisfactorily assessed 
by the examiner, we must then notify 
the HSE of the well design and operation 
plans. The HSE carries out its own review 
of these plans, taking into account any 
comments or recommendations made  
by the independent well examiner. 
Remediation and restoration
As a responsible operator, we ensure 
our old sites are remediated to the 
highest standard. An example of this 
is the restoration carried out this year 
at our Egmanton site. Once the site of 
the Egmanton oilfield Central Gathering 
Station, we have removed all the plant 
equipment and machinery, including 
pipelines. In agreement with the 
landowner and Planning Officers, the land 
was restored to a mixture of woodland, 
grassland and wetland. The work is now 
complete and wildlife has already started 
to colonise the new habitats that have 
been created.

Summary of the Committee’s responsibilities
The Committee’s responsibilities include the following:
• Considering the size, structure and composition of the Board of Directors, retirements and appointments of additional and replacement

Key areas of focus in the nine months ended 31 December 2015
The principal activities of the Committee during the period were as follows:
• The appointment of Stephen Bowler as new Chief Executive Officer in May 2015, following the resignation of Andrew Austin; 
• The search for a new Chief Financial Officer following the appointment of Stephen Bowler as Chief Executive Officer. This resulted in the

Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and reviewing its 
effectiveness. The procedures that include, inter alia, financial, operational, health & safety, compliance matters and risk management  
(as detailed in the Strategic Report) are reviewed on an on-going basis. 
The Group’s internal control procedures include the following:
• Board approval for all significant projects, including corporate transactions and major capital projects;
• The Board receives and reviews regular reports covering both the technical progress of projects and the Group’s financial affairs to 
facilitate its control; 
• There is a comprehensive budgeting and planning system for all items of expenditure with an annual budget approved by the Board.  
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the annual planning cycle;
• The Group has in place internal control and risk management systems in relation to the Group's financial reporting process and the 
Group's process for preparing consolidated accounts. These systems include policies and procedures to ensure that adequate accounting 
records are maintained and transactions are recorded accurately and fairly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS; and
• The Audit Committee reviews draft annual and interim reports before recommending their publication to the Board. The Audit 
Committee discusses with the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and external auditors the significant accounting policies, 
estimates and judgments applied in preparing these reports. 
The internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
considered the need for a separate internal audit function but, bearing in mind the present size and composition of the Group, does not 
consider it necessary at the current time. 
UK Bribery Act
IGas has reviewed the appropriate policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act. The Company continues to  
actively promote good practice throughout the Group and has initiated a rolling programme of anti-bribery and corruption training for  
all relevant employees.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders and bondholders are considered important by the Directors. The primary contact with shareholders, 
bondholders, investors and analysts is through the Chief Executive Officer. The other Executive Directors, however, regularly speak to 
investors and analysts during the year. Company circulars and press releases have also been issued throughout the year for the purpose  
of keeping investors informed about the Group’s progress.
The Company also maintains a website (www.igasplc.com) that is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information about  
the Group.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    45
This report explains our remuneration policy for Directors and sets out how decisions regarding Directors’ pay for the period under review 
have been taken.
Annual statement
There has been significant change in the leadership team at IGas and their remuneration packages. 
At the beginning of the year following the restructuring of the management team, the Remuneration Committee recognised an immediate 
need to have a strong retention mechanism in place for the Executive Directors who are critical to executing the business strategy over 
the next phase of the Company’s development. The existing Executive Directors agreed to waive their outstanding entitlements under the 
Company’s 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan and the Value Creation Plan and were subsequently made awards under the Executive Director 
Retention Plan, a one off plan introduced for this purpose. 
Recognising a period which saw the impact of low oil prices result in restructuring and a range of cost cutting measures, including 
redundancies, the Company considered it appropriate to impose a company-wide restriction on pay awards and subsequently declared 
there would be no cash payments under the annual short term incentive bonus programme. 
The Remuneration Committee have recently adopted a new long term incentive plan, the Executive Incentive Plan (“EIP”) which balances 
the need to retain and motivate management in this highly challenging operating environment and the alignment of their interests with 
those of shareholders over the long term. It is intended that the first grant of share awards under the EIP will be made around the time 
of writing of this report and is in the form of a restricted stock style award (i.e vesting of shares is principally related to continuity of 
employment) but which features:
• an upwards multiplier on the number of shares awarded if significant value has been created for shareholders through the successful 
execution of the business strategy; and
• a clawback mechanism to the number of shares awarded if the Remuneration Committee are not satisfied with the overall corporate 
performance of the Company over the vesting period.
To reflect the guaranteed element of the shares awarded under the EIP , individual award levels have been set at a significant discount to the 
market level for Executive Directors in the sector (75% of salary). However, the multiplier effect ensures that total remuneration levels will 
be competitive in the market if significant value is created for shareholders over the longer term. 
Directors’ remuneration policy
Remuneration policy
The Company’s policy is to maintain levels of remuneration sufficient to attract, motivate and retain senior executives of the highest 
calibre who can deliver growth in shareholder value. Executive Director remuneration currently consists of basic salary, pensions, benefits, 
annual bonus (based on annually set targets), and long term incentives (to reward long term performance). The Company seeks to strike 
an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related reward so that the total remuneration package is structured to align a 
significant proportion to the achievement of performance targets, reinforcing a clear link between pay and performance. The performance 
targets for staff, senior executives and the Executive Directors are each aligned to the key drivers of the business strategy, thereby creating  
a strong alignment of interest between staff, Executive Directors and shareholders.
The Committee will continue to review the Company’s remuneration policy and make amendments, as and when necessary, to ensure it 
remains fit for purpose and continues to drive high levels of executive performance and remains both affordable and competitive in the 
market.
Element of reward Operation and performance conditions Maximum opportunity
Base salary 
The purpose of the base salary 
is to:
• help recruit and retain key 
individuals;
• reflect the individual’s 
experience, role and 
contribution within the 
Company; and ensure fair 
reward for “doing the job”.
The Committee reviews base salaries annually to ensure that 
Executive Directors pay remains competitively aligned with external 
market practices.
In determining whether to increase levels the Committee will take 
the following into consideration:
• the performance of the individual Director;
• the individual Director’s experience and responsibilities;
• impact on fixed costs of any increase; and
• pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The Committee will retain 
the discretion to increase an 
individual’s salary where there is 
a significant difference between 
current levels and a market 
competitive rate for similar 
positions in similar organisations 
(based on size, complexity and 
sector).
Other benefits  
including pension
The Company provides Executive Directors with benefits in kind, 
with a pension contribution up to 15% of base salary, as well as 
other benefits in kind including medical and disability insurances 
and death-in-service life assurance.

Annual Cash Bonus Executive Directors and staff are eligible to participate in a 
discretionary bonus plan.
The Committee will determine on an annual basis the level  
of deferral, if any, of the bonus payment into Company shares. 
Maximum bonus levels and the proportion payable for on target 
performance are considered in the light of market bonus levels  
for similar roles among the industry sector.
Bonuses paid in cash are not pensionable.
In terms of bonus targets a balanced scorecard approach is 
operated which focuses on a mixture of strategic, operational, 
financial and non-financial metrics. The Committee have 
determined that it is inappropriate to disclose the actual targets due 
to commercial sensitivity.
The percentage of maximum 
bonus entitlement received is 
based on the achievement of 
individually challenging targets 
supporting corporate objectives. 
The maximum potential bonus 
entitlement for Executive 
Directors under the plan is  
to up to 100% of base salary.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan, adopted by the Board in 2011 
participants can each be granted two types of award: an Initial 
Award and an Annual Award. Both types of award are in the form 
of a nil cost option. If the relevant conditions attaching to the 
awards are met at the end of a three year vesting period, then the 
participant has a further seven years in which to exercise the award.
The primary purpose of the Initial Awards is to aid the recruitment 
of key executives. These awards vest at the end of a three 
year performance period provided the Company’s share price 
performance exceeds the Company’s weighted average cost  
of capital of 10%.
The LTIP also provides for Annual Awards to be granted which will 
vest at the end of a three year period provided certain challenging 
corporate performance conditions have been met. The purpose 
of the Annual Award is to provide a competitive annual total 
remuneration package which retains and motivates the Executive 
Directors and other selected executives.
The maximum individual limit 
for an Initial Award is 300% of 
salary.
The maximum individual limit 
for an Annual Award in any 
financial year is 200% of salary 
(this limit was increased from 
150% during the 2014/15 
financial year).
IGas 2014 Value Creation Plan 
(“VCP”)
During 2015 the Executive Directors each gave up their  
entitlements under the VCP .
No further awards will be made under this plan which will not  
be operated on an ongoing basis.

Executive Incentive Plan Under the EIP adopted by the Board in March 2016, participants 
will be granted a share award in the form of a nil-cost option. This 
option will be released at the end of a three year holding period 
provided that the Executive remain in employment and that the 
Remuneration Committee are satisfied that corporate performance 
has been satisfactory (with reference to share price). A multiplier 
will also apply to this share award to ensure that management are 
focussed on the execution of the business strategy and the creation 
of long-term value for shareholders. For the first share award the 
multiplier will be set as follows:
Share price target Multiplier
50p 1.5 times the shares awarded
75p 2 times the number of shares awarded
Given the current share price and economic outlook, the Committee 
believe that these targets are highly demanding and will not be 
attained through external market volatility.
Executives will be required to build a shareholding over the next five 
years of at least 150% of salary to further support the alignment of 
their interests with those of shareholders. 
Annual award to the current 
Executive Directors of no more 
than 75% of salary (100% in 
exceptional circumstances) 
subject to two times multiplier 
(i.e. the maximum number of 
shares which could vest is equal 
to 150% of salary).
Executive Director  
Retention Plan
Under the EDRP , participants are granted nil cost options which vest 
and become exercisable on the first anniversary of grant subject 
to the Directors’ continued employment and to a one year holding 
period following the date of vesting.
The EDRP was adopted as an 
exceptional share arrangement 
and S Bowler was made an 
award of options over 3,500,000 
ordinary shares and J Blaymires 
was made an award of options 
over 3,000,000 ordinary shares 
in July 2015.
Share Investment Plan (“SIP”) In 2013, the Company adopted an HMRC approved Share Investment 
Plan for all employees of the Group. The scheme is a tax efficient 
incentive plan pursuant to which all employees are eligible subscribe 
for up to £150 (or 10% of salary, if less) worth of IGas ordinary  
shares per month.
Shares are acquired on a quarterly basis. The Company 
automatically matches the employee contribution and acquires 
matching ‘Partnership’ shares on a 1-to-1 basis. Subject to the 
Company achieving pre-defined quarterly production targets, the 
Company increases the matching element for that quarter such that 
it will contribute Partnership shares on a 2-to-1 basis. To receive 
their allocation of Company Partnership shares, employees must 
ordinarily remain employed by the Company for a period of 3 years 
from the date of grant of the matching award.
Employees are eligible to 
acquire up to £150 (or 10% 
of salary, if less) worth of IGas 
ordinary shares per month from 
gross salary.
The Company will match the 
shares purchased on a 1-to-
1 basis and, subject to the 
Company having met pre-
defined quarterly production 
targets, will increase the 
matching element for that 
quarter to 2-to-1.

 S Bowler was appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 8 May 2015. Prior to this he was Chief Financial Officer. A Austin resigned as Chief Executive Officer on 7 May 2015. 
Recognising the ongoing challenging oil price environment, and following a zero pay-out for the bonus scheme in 2014/15, the Board 
determined a further zero cash bonus pay-out for the April – December 2015 period.
Following his appointment, J Tedder was made an Initial Award in the form of an option over 1,315,789 ordinary shares in the Company 
under the 2011 LTIP on 25 November 2015.
In July 2015 S Bowler and J Blaymires waived their entitlements to all outstanding LTIP awards and VCP award made in July 2014. 
As noted in the Annual Statement the Remuneration Committee recognising the need to have a strong retention mechanism in place  
for the Executive Directors adopted the IGas Energy PLC 2015 Executive Director Retention Plan in July as an exceptional share arrangement. 
On 13 July 2015 the Executive Directors received awards under the plan in the form of nil cost options (S Bowler was made an award in  
the form of an option over 3,500,000 ordinary shares in the Company, and J Blaymires over 3,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company). The 
options issued under the Plan will vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the retention award subject 
to the Executive Directors continued employment with the Group and will be subject to a one year holding period following the date of 
vesting. Options will normally remain exercisable for seven years following the date of vesting. It is not intended that the Plan will be used  
to grant any further awards over the next stage of the Company's development. 
Each of the Executive Directors devotes such time as is required to discharge his duties, which in all cases is full time.

Auditor
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors the review of the Group’s external audit services. Notwithstanding that 
review, the current auditor, Ernst & Young LLP , has indicated its willingness to continue in office. Subject to the outcome of the review of 
external audit services, a resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young LLP as auditor will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting at a fee  
to be agreed in due course by The Audit Committee and the Board in accordance with section 487 of the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to the auditor
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing its report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries  
of fellow Directors, each Director has taken all the steps that a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken as a Director in  
order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    53
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group financial statements for each financial period. Under 
that law, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union. Under Company Law the Directors must not approve the Group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group 
financial statements the Directors are required to:
• Present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Group;
• Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then 
apply them consistently;
• Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• Make judgements that are reasonable;
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs as adopted by the European Union is insufficient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group‘s financial position and 
financial performance; 
• State whether the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• Prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, 
management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group‘s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors  
are also responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the Strategic Report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and  
applicable regulations.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
• The financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Group and the undertakings included  
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties faced.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION  
TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
54    |    IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015
We have audited the financial statements of IGas Energy plc for the nine months ended 31 December 2015 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and  
Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Cash Flow Statements and the related notes 1 to 30 of the consolidated financial statements and notes 1 to 17 of the parent 
company financial statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities in Relation to the Group Financial Statements and Annual Report  
and Parent Company Financial Statements – Directors’ Statement of Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation  
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts for the nine 
months to 31 December 2015 to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that 
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
• The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 
and of the group’s loss for the nine months then ended; 
• The group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• The parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union  
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Emphasis of matter 
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made  
in note 1 to the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The conditions as explained in note 1 
to the financial statements indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue 
as a going concern.

Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
• The parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• Certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of IGas Energy plc (the “Company”) and subsidiaries (the “Group”) have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards, adopted for use by the European Union (“IFRSs”) as they apply to the Group for the nine 
months ended 31 December 2015 and with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting periods are not comparable as this 9 month period 
represents a short period of account to align the year end with the year end of major operating partners. The accounts were approved by 
the Board and authorised for issue on 15 March 2016. IGas Energy plc is a public limited company incorporated, registered in England and 
Wales and is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).
The Group financial statements are presented in UK pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) except  
when otherwise indicated.
The comparative amounts have been amended to reflect the finalisation of the acquisition accounting for Dart (note 9).
Changes in presentation and disclosures 
In previous years, certain exceptional items, as defined in the Group’s accounting policies, were disclosed separately under the heading 
“exceptional items” in the income statement after operating profit. During the current period, all exceptional items are reported within 
operating profit, thereby increasing administrative expenses and reducing operating profit by £867k in the year ended 31 March 2015, 
which represent costs relating to acquisitions. Administrative expenses for the nine months ended 31 December 2015 include £107k of costs 
relating to acquisitions. The Directors consider this change to provide more reliable and relevant information as the nature of separately 
disclosed exceptional items was not sufficiently distinct from other separately disclosed material items in the income statement.
In addition, the Group no longer presents adjusted earnings per share (EPS); the comparative period disclosures have therefore also 
not been presented. Management considers the removal of adjusted EPS to result in clearer disclosure and more reliable and relevant 
information, recognising that the adjusted earnings measure is not defined by IFRS and required judgement in determining the relevant 
adjustments.
Furthermore, the Group no longer presents intangible exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) asset impairments and E&E write offs separately. 
During the nine months to 31 December 2015, impairment of £5.9 million (year ended 31 March 2015: £15.2 million) and write offs of  
£7.0 million (year ended 31 March 2015: £0.2 million) have been aggregated in “Exploration and evaluation assets written off” in the income 
statement. The Directors consider this change to provide more reliable and relevant information as the nature of the two concepts was not 
sufficiently distinct from each other to merit separate disclosure.
There are no new standards, interpretations and amendments to adopt which are effective as of 1 April 2015.
New and amended standards and Interpretations
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory only for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods and which the Group has not adopted early. Those that may  
be applicable to the Group in future are as follows: 
IFRS 10 and IAS 28  Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture –  1 January 2016* 
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 
IFRS 11  Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11 1 January 2016*
IAS 1  Disclosure initiative – Amendments to IAS 1 1 January 2016*
IAS 16 and IAS 38  Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation –  1 January 2016* 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 
IAS 7  Disclosure initiative – Amendments to IAS 7 1 January 2017*
IFRS 15  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018*
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments 1 January 2018*
IFRS 16  Leases 1 January 2019*
* The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism. In the 
majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Group‘s discretion to early 
adopt standards.
The Group is currently assessing the impact that these amendments will have on its financial position. The Group does not anticipate 
adopting these standards and interpretations ahead of their effective dates.

1 Accounting policies continued
(b) Going concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risks. Cash forecasts for the Group are regularly produced based on, inter alia, the 
Group's production and expenditure forecasts, management's best estimate of future oil prices (based on current forward curves, adjusted 
for the Group's hedging programme) and the Group's borrowing facilities. Sensitivities are run to reflect different scenarios including, but 
not limited to, possible further reductions in commodity prices below the current forward curve and reductions in forecast oil and gas 
production rates. 
The ability of the Group to operate as a going concern is dependent upon the continued availability of future cash flows and the availability 
of the monies drawn under its Bonds, which in turn is dependent on the Group not breaching its bond covenants. In response to the 
significant reduction in oil prices, the Board implemented a series of cost saving initiatives during the period that have materially reduced 
both operating costs and G&A spend. In addition, following positive discussions with the bondholders, the net leverage covenant, inter alia, 
was amended to take account of the Group’s improved cash position following the INEOS farm-out, which was completed during the period.
Whilst the Group has delivered on the above initiatives and has significant cash balances, the continuing low commodity price environment 
means that the Group’s current forecasts, utilising the current oil price forward curve, project non-compliance with certain of its 
covenants in the second half of 2016. The Board is pursuing actions to alleviate a covenant breach including, but not limited to, further 
cost reductions, monetising existing hedged oil positions, bond buy-backs, and asset port olio management. Concurrently, the Board will 
continue to evaluate other cash and earnings accretive transaction options which could reduce the need for the mitigating actions set out 
above. Nevertheless, based on the current oil price and forward curve, the Directors cannot be certain that these will fully mitigate any 
potential covenant short all in respect of the testing period ending 31 December 2016. Whilst pursuing the options listed above, the Board 
will continue its proactive dialogue with bondholders and, if appropriate, seek to modify or temporarily waive the existing covenants ahead 
of the time at which the Group submits its compliance certificate in respect of that testing period, which would be by 30 April 2017.
The risk that the Group will be unable to either enact appropriate mitigating actions to a sufficient extent before the 31 December 2016 
measurement date or secure an appropriate relaxation or amendment of its financial covenants prior to 30 April 2017 represents a material 
uncertainty that may cast doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Board believes, after making appropriate enquiries, and on the information currently available, that the Group is likely to be able to either 
implement sufficient mitigating actions to ensure that the Group is compliant with its covenants or secure a relaxation to the covenants as 
described above and it is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
(c) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of IGas Energy plc and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements are based on consistent accounting policies 
to the parent. All intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies, including unrealised profits arising from them, are 
eliminated in full. Where shares are issued to an Employee Benefit Trust, and the Company is the sponsoring entity, it is treated as an 
extension of the entity.
At 31 December 2015, the Group comprised the Company and entities controlled by IGas Energy plc (its subsidiaries). There have been  
no new subsidiaries acquired during the period.
(d) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately  
in the income statement. Acquisition costs are expensed and shown as a separate line in the income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(e) Assets held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable within a year from the classification date. They 
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal, except for assets such as deferred tax assets and 
financial assets, which are specifically exempt from this requirement. 
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs of disposal. 
A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs of disposal of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any 
cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset 
(or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.
(f) Joint arrangements
Certain of the Group’s licence interests are held jointly with others under arrangements whereby unincorporated and jointly controlled 
ventures are used to explore, evaluate and ultimately develop and produce from its oil and gas interests. Accordingly, the Group accounts 
for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of these joint operations, classified in the appropriate balance sheet and income 
statement headings, except where its share of such amounts remain the responsibility of another party in accordance with the terms of 
carried interests as described at (j). 
Where the Group enters into a farm-in agreement involving a licence in the exploration and evaluation phase, the Group records all costs 
that it incurs under the terms of the joint operating agreement as amended by the farm-in agreement as they are incurred. 
Where the Group enters into a farm-out agreement involving a license in the exploration and evaluation phase, the Group does not 
record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It also does not immediately recognise any gain or loss on its exploration and 
evaluation farm-out arrangements, but redesignates any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the 
partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalised in relation 
to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
When the Group, acting as an operator or manager of a joint arrangement, receives reimbursement of direct costs recharged to the joint 
arrangement, such recharges represent reimbursements of costs that the operator incurred as an agent for the joint arrangement and 
therefore have no effect on profit or loss.
(g) Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements and 
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are 
continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates. 
In particular, the Group has identified the following areas where significant judgements and estimates are required, and where if actual 
results were to differ, this could materially affect the financial position or financial results reported in a future period. Further information  
on each of these and how they impact the various accounting policies are described in the relevant notes to the financial statements. 
Recoverable value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets
The Group has capitalised intangible exploration and evaluation assets in accordance with IFRS 6, which are evaluated for impairment as 
described at (j) below. Any impairment review, where required, involves estimates and assumptions related to matters (when appropriate) 
such as recoverable reserves, production profiles, review of forward oil, gas and electricity prices, development, operating and off-take 
costs, nature of land access agreements and planning permissions, application of taxes and other matters. Where the final outcome or 
revised estimates related to such matters differ from the estimates used in any earlier impairment reviews, the results of such differences, 
to the extent that they actually affect any impairment provisions, are accounted for when such revisions are made. Details of the Group’s 
intangible exploration and evaluation assets are disclosed in note 11.
Recoverable value of property, plant and equipment
Management reviews the Group’s property, plant and equipment periodically for impairment indicators. The determination of recoverable 
amounts in any resulting impairment test requires judgement around key assumptions. Key assumptions in the impairment models include 
those related to prices that are based on forward curves and long-term corporate assumptions thereafter, discount rates that are risked to 
reflect conditions specific to individual assets, future costs, both capital and operating that are based on management’s estimates having 
regard to past experience and the known characteristics of the individual assets, reserves and future production, discussed further below. 
Details of the Group’s property, plant, and equipment are disclosed in note 12.

(g) Significant accounting judgements and estimates continued
Recoverable value of goodwill
The Group assess goodwill each reporting period to determine whether there is any impairment. The assessment requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions such as long-term oil prices, discount rates, reserves, production profiles and capital expenditure. These 
estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will impact 
these projections, which may impact the recoverable value of goodwill. Details of the Group’s goodwill are disclosed in note 10.
Proved and probable reserves and contingent resources
The volume of proved and probable oil and gas reserves is an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of producing oil and 
gas property, plant and equipment as well as being a significant estimate affecting decommissioning provisions, impairment calculations and 
the valuation of oil and gas properties in business combinations. Contingent resources affect the valuation of exploration and exploration 
assets acquired in business combinations and the estimation of the recoverable value of those assets in impairment tests. Proved and 
probable reserves and contingent resources are estimated using standard recognised evaluation techniques. Estimates are reviewed at least 
annually and are regularly estimated by independent consultants. Future development costs are estimated taking into account the level of 
development required to produce the reserves by reference to operators, where applicable, and internal engineers.
Deferred tax asset recognition
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be 
recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. Estimates of 
future taxable profits are based on cash flows expected to be generated from internal estimates of projected production and costs. Details 
of the Group’s deferred tax assets, including those not recognised due to uncertainty regarding the future utilisation, are disclosed in note 7.
Decommissioning costs
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the producing lives of fields is reviewed periodically and is based on forecast price 
levels and technology at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for the estimated cost at the balance sheet date, using a discounted cash 
flow methodology and a risk free rate of return. Details of the Group’s decommissioning provisions are disclosed in note 21.
Business combinations 
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by reference to the contractual 
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Petroleum reserves and resources used in the 
assessment of fair values on acquisition refer to independent reports. Where resources are significant they are risked on the basis of their 
inherent uncertainty. Discounted cash flow models are used to reflect the revenues and expenditures related to the extraction of those 
reserves. Comparable resource multiples achieved in recent market activity are used for resources. Other assets and liabilities are valued by 
reference to market-based observations or independent valuations where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is 
required in establishing fair values. Details of business combinations occurring in the current period and prior year are disclosed in note 9.
Functional currency 
The determination of functional currency often requires significant judgement where the primary economic environment in which 
a company operates may not be clear. The parent entity reconsiders the functional currency of its entities if there is a change in the 
underlying transactions, events and conditions which determines the primary economic environment.
(h) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which, in the opinion of the Directors, due to their nature and infrequency 
require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year. 
A full explanation of such items is given, where applicable, in the notes to the financial statements.
(i) Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of goods and services supplied by the Group, net of value added tax and trade discounts. Revenue is 
recognised in the case of oil, gas and electricity sales when goods are delivered and title has passed to the customer. This generally occurs 
when the product is physically delivered to the customer’s premises or transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism. 
Revenue from the production of oil from fields in which the Group has an interest with other producers, is recognised based on the Group’s 
working interest and the terms of the relevant production sharing contracts. Where oil produced by third parties is processed and delivered 
to a refinery by the Group, the measurement of the revenue depends upon whether physical title to the oil passes to the Group or whether 
the Group simply acts an agent for the producer.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(j) Non-current assets 
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised  
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (“CGU”) or group of CGUs to 
which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets
The Group accounts for exploration and evaluation costs in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 6 “Exploration for and Evaluation  
of Mineral Resources” as follows:
• Any costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement. Expenditures 
related to development and production activities are not recognised as exploration and evaluation assets;
• Expenditures recognised as exploration and evaluation assets comprise those related to acquisition of rights to explore, topographical, 
geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling (including coring and sampling), activities in relation to evaluating 
the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons (including appraisal drilling and production tests) and any land 
rights acquired for the sole purpose of effecting these activities. These costs include employee remuneration and directly attributable 
overheads, materials and consumables, equipment costs and payments made to contractors;
• Tangible assets acquired for use in exploration and evaluation activities are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the 
extent that such tangible assets are consumed in developing an intangible exploration and evaluation asset, the amount reflecting that 
consumption is recorded as part of the exploration and evaluation asset;
• Expenditures recognised as exploration and evaluation assets are initially accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate 
geographic areas;
• Exploration and evaluation assets are carried at cost less any impairment and are not depreciated or amortised; and
• Expenditure recognised as exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to property plant and equipment, interests in oil and gas 
properties when technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting hydrocarbons is demonstrable. Exploration and evaluation 
assets are assessed for impairment (on the basis described below), and any impairment loss recognised, before reclassification.
Impairment testing of exploration and evaluation assets
Expenditures recognised as exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances suggest that 
they may be impaired, which includes when a licence is approaching the end of its term and is not expected to be renewed, there are no 
substantive plans for continued exploration or evaluation of an area, the Group decides to abandon an area, or whilst development is likely 
to proceed in an area there are indications that the exploration and evaluation asset costs are unlikely to be recovered in full either by 
development or through sale.
Property plant and equipment – interests in oil and gas properties
Property plant and equipment, interests in oil and gas properties are accounted for as follows:
• Oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses;
• The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into 
operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation and, for qualifying assets (where relevant), borrowing costs. The purchase 
price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. The 
capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment;
• When a development project moves into the production stage, the capitalisation of certain construction/development costs ceases,  
and costs are either regarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs which qualify for capitalisation;
• Expenditure relating to interests in oil and gas properties includes both expenditure which is depleted on a unit of production basis, 
commencing at the start of commercial production and expenditure which is depreciated on a straight line basis over the relevant asset’s 
estimated useful life. Where expenditure is depreciated on a unit of production basis, the depletion charge is calculated according to the 
proportion that production bears to the recoverable reserves for each property;
• The Group’s interests in oil and gas properties are assessed for indications of impairment including events or changes in circumstances 
which indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, when impairment is computed on the basis as set out below. 
Any impairment in value is charged to the income statement; and
• Net proceeds from any disposal of development/producing assets are compared to the previously capitalised costs for the relevant asset  
or group of assets. A gain or loss on disposal of a development/producing asset is recognised in the income statement to the extent that 
the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset or group of assets.

(j) Non-current assets continued
Impairment
Impairment tests, when required as described above, are carried out on the following basis:
• By comparing the sum of any amounts carried in the books as compared to the recoverable amount;
• The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The Group generally assesses the  
value in use using the estimated future cash flows which are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU; and
• Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a 
change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time. In reversing impairment 
losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value and the carrying value that would have 
been determined (net of depletion) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Decommissioning
Where a liability for the removal of production facilities or site restoration exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised. The amount 
recognised is discounted to its present value and is reflected in the Group’s non-current liabilities. A corresponding asset is included in the 
appropriate category of the Group’s non-current assets (intangible exploration and evaluation assets and property plant and equipment), 
depending on the accounting treatment adopted for the underlying operations/asset leading to the decommissioning provision. The asset  
is assessed for impairment and depleted in accordance with the Group’s policies as set out above.
Carried interests
Where the Group has entered into carried interest agreements in exploration and evaluation projects and the Group’s interest is being 
carried by a third party, no amounts are recorded in the financial statements where expenditure incurred under such agreements is not 
refundable. Where expenditure is refundable, out of what would but for the carry agreements have been the Group’s share of production, 
the Group records amounts as non-current assets, with a corresponding offset in current liabilities or non-current liabilities, as appropriate, 
but only once it is apparent that it is more likely than not that future production will be adequate to result in a refund under the terms of 
any carry agreement; the Group records refunds only to the extent that they are expected to be repayable.
Other property plant and equipment
Other property plant and equipment is stated at cost to the Group less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on such assets, 
with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, over their 
estimated useful lives at the following rates, with any impairment being accounted for as additional depreciation:
Equipment used for exploration and evaluation – between six and twelve years on a straight line basis
Freehold land – indefinite useful life
Buildings/leasehold property improvements – over five to ten years on a straight line basis/over the period of the lease 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – between three and twenty years on a straight line basis
Motor vehicles – over four years on a straight line basis 
The Group does not capitalise amounts considered to be immaterial. 
(k) Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash held on current account or on short-term deposits at variable interest rates  
with original maturity periods of up to three months. Any interest earned is accrued monthly and classified as interest income within 
finance income. 
Other financial assets – Restricted cash
Restricted cash relates to bond guarantees issued to governments for the performance under the terms of work programs. Funds are only 
classified as cash and cash equivalents when monies are transferred to and under the control of the Group.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value when related amounts are invoiced, then carried at this amount less any allowances 
for doubtul debts or provision made for impairment of these receivables.
Trade and other payables
These financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration payable. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
66    |    IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015
1 Accounting policies continued
(k) Financial instruments continued
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group enters into derivatives to manage its exposure to variability in the price realised on a proportion of its crude oil production.  
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value at each period end. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, 
all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise, otherwise they are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties 
in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be 
incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted 
values of cash flows. The fair value of derivative financial instruments has been calculated on a discounted cash flow basis by reference to 
forward market prices and risk free returns adjusted in the case of derivative financial liabilities by an appropriate credit spread.
Derivatives embedded in host contracts, such as warrants attached to loans, are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair 
value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not held for 
trading or designated at fair value though profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in the income statement. 
Warrants
When warrants do not qualify as equity instruments under IAS 39 due to the variable number of shares that would be issued in each 
case they are accounted for as financial liabilities. The warrants are initially recognised at fair value on the date they are issued and are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value at each period end. All changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets 
In relation to financial assets, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or 
significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of 
the invoice. The carrying amount of receivables is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised when 
they are assessed as uncollectible.
(l) Borrowings
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”) method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. When management estimates of the amounts or timings of 
cash flows are revised, borrowings are re-measured using the revised cash flow estimates under the original effective interest rate with any 
consequent adjustment being recognised in the income statement.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of these assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the periods in which they are incurred.
(m) Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date 
including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys  
a right to use the asset.
Operating leases
Rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.

(m) Leases continued
Finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at their capital value and depreciated over their useful lives. Capital 
value is defined as the amount equal to the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. Lease payments consist of capital and finance charge elements; the finance charge element 
is charged to the income statement.
(n) Inventories
Inventories, consisting of crude oil, drilling materials and maintenance materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs comprise all costs of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition. Weighted average cost is used to determine the cost of ordinarily inter-changeable items.
(o) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. Taxable  
profit/(loss) differs from the profit/(loss) before taxation as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s  
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except 
when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Temporary differences arise 
from differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than 
not that they will be recovered.
The carrying amount of deferred tax is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised  
or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised  
in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
(p) Share based payments
Where share options or warrants are awarded to employees including Directors, the fair value of the options or warrants at the date of  
the grant is recorded in equity over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions, but only those related to service and performance, 
are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately,  
the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. All other vesting 
conditions, including market vesting conditions, are factored into the fair value of the options or warrants granted. As long as all other 
vesting conditions are satisfied, the amount recorded is computed irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.  
The cumulative amount recognised is not adjusted for the failure to achieve a market vesting condition; although equity no longer required 
for options or warrants may be transferred to another equity reserve.
Where the terms and conditions of options or warrants are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, 
measured by the change from immediately before to after the modification, is also recorded in equity over the remaining vesting period.
When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised on the 
award is recognised immediately.
Where an equity settled award is identified as a replacement it will be treated as a modification to the original plan where the incremental 
fair value of the replacement award is expensed over the vesting period of the replacement award. The fair value of the original award on 
its grant date is continues to be recognised over its original vesting period. 
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the amount recognised in equity is the fair value of goods and 
services received.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Accounting policies continued
(p) Share based payments continued
Charges corresponding to the amounts recognised in equity are accounted for as a cost against profit and loss unless the services rendered 
qualify for capitalisation as a non-current asset. Costs may be capitalised within non-current assets in the event of services being rendered 
in connection with an acquisition of intangible exploration and evaluation assets or property, plant and equipment.
Where shares are issued to an Employee Benefit Trust, and the Company is the sponsoring entity, the value of such shares at issue will be 
recorded in share capital and share premium account in the ordinary way, but will not affect shareholders’ funds since this same value will 
be shown as a deduction from shareholders’ funds by way of a separate component of equity. 
(q) Post-retirement benefits
A subsidiary within the Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those  
of the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount charged to the Income Statement represents the contributions payable  
to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
(r) Equity
Equity instruments issued by the Company are usually recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, and allocated between 
called up share capital and share premium accounts as appropriate.
(s) Foreign currency 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in UK pound sterling, the primary economic environment of the Company. 
Transactions denominated in currencies other than functional currency are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the  
balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement.
For the purposes of consolidation, the income statement items of those entities for which the UK pound sterling is not the functional 
currency are translated into UK pound sterling at the average rates of exchange during the period. The related balance sheets are translated 
at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such 
operations, are reported in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
The exchange differences arising on intercompany balances that form part of an entity’s net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve until the disposal of the foreign operation.
On disposal of entities with a different functional currency to the Company’s functional currency, the deferred cumulative exchange 
differences recognised in equity relating to that particular operation would be recognised in the income statement.
(t) Discontinued operations
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through 
a sale rather than through continuing use. Such non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to dispose are the incremental costs directly attributable to the sale, 
excluding the finance costs and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is 
available for immediate distribution in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that 
significant changes to the sale will be made or that the sale will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale being expected 
within one year from the date of the classification. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. 
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.
A disposal group qualifies as a discontinued operation if it is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of, or is classified  
as held for sale, and:
• Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;
• Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or
• Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after 
tax from discontinued operations in the income statement. All other notes to the financial statements include amounts for continuing 
operations, unless otherwise mentioned.

2 Revenue and segment information
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess 
their performance, and for which financial information is available. In the case of the Group, the CODM are the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Board of Directors and all information reported to the CODM is based on the consolidated results of the Group representing core (UK) 
and non-core (Rest of the World) operating segments. Therefore the Group has two operating and reportable segments as reflected in the 
Group’s consolidated financial statements.
All revenue, which represents turnover, arises solely within the United Kingdom and relates to external parties. Revenues of approximately 
£11.8 million and £10.1 million were derived from the Group’s two largest customers (Year ended 31 March 2015: £25.1 million and  
£26.9 million). 
The majority of the Group’s non-current assets are in the United Kingdom.

Profit on disposal of oil and gas assets
Profit on disposal of oil and gas assets has arisen as a result of the farm-out agreement entered into between the Group and INEOS 
Upstream Limited (“INEOS”) which completed on 7 May 2015. 
INEOS acquired a 50% interest in IGas' UK Onshore PEDLs 147, 184, 189 and 190 and a 60% interest in IGas' UK Onshore PEDLs 145,  
193 and EXL 273, (the "Bowland Licences") in the North West of England. In addition, INEOS acquired IGas' entire working interest in  
the acreage held under PEDL 133 in Scotland. In the East Midlands, INEOS also acquired a 20% interest in PEDLs 012 and 200. INEOS will  
assume operatorship of PEDLs 145 and 193 and EXL 273. IGas will retain operatorship of all other Bowland Licences.
INEOS made a cash payment to IGas of £30.0 million on completion of the deal (resulting in a gain of £4.0 million) and will provide a fully 
funded future work programme of up to £138.0 million gross, of which IGas’ share is expected to amount to approximately £65.0 million.

ii) Factors affecting the tax charge
The majority of the Group’s profits are generated by “ring-fence” businesses which attract UK corporation tax and supplementary charge  
at a combined average rate of 50% previous year 59.04%.
A reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate applied to the Group’s loss before tax to the Group’s total tax credit is as follows:

Tax rate change      – (13,924)
Tax credit on loss on ordinary activities     (17,257) (23,769)
With effect from 1 January 2015, the rate of supplementary charge has been reduced from 32% to 20%. This change has been reflected  
in the current period credit included in the deferred tax credit for the period relating to the group’s ring-fence activities. 
During the year legislation was enacted to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015.  
These rates are reflected in the calculation of deferred tax balances in respect of the group’s non ring-fence activities.
Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 for which Royal Assent was received on 18 November 2015 further reduced the main rate of corporation tax  
to 19% effective for the periods starting from 1 April 2017 and to 18% for the periods from 1 April 2020. It is anticipated that the majority  
of the non-ring fence losses would be utilised prior to 2020 and it is considered that the impact of the change in the tax rate is immaterial  
to the Group’s results.

iv) Tax losses 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences where the Directors believe it is probable 
that these assets will be recovered. Such tax losses include £58.7 million (31 March 2015: £43.0 million) of ring-fence corporation tax losses.
The Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of approximately £187 million (31 March 2015: £177.4 million) 
for which no deferred tax asset is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. 
Such losses carried forward include losses arising in Dart UK companies acquired in the prior year. 
The unrecognised losses may affect future tax charges should certain subsidiaries in the Group produce taxable trading profits in future 
periods where there is currently uncertainty of the timing of future taxable profits.
8 Earnings per share (EPS)
Basic EPS amounts are based on the loss for the period after taxation attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent of £44.8 million  
(31 March 2015: £5.2 million) and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period of 295.9 million  
(31 March 2015: 247.6 million).
Diluted EPS amounts are based on the loss after taxation attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent and the weighted  
average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued  
on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive ordinary shares into ordinary shares, except where these are anti-dilutive. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9 Acquisitions
Acquisition of Dart Energy Limited
On 16 October 2014, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dart Energy Limited (“Dart”) on a share for share exchange 
basis for a consideration of 89,997,626 Ordinary Shares of 10p each (the “Acquisition”). The fair value of that consideration was £67.4 million. 
The combination created a market leading onshore UK oil and gas company with the largest area in the UK under licence of over 1 million net 
acres including major UK shale basins.
The non-core assets (those Dart assets located outside of the UK), have been classified on acquisition as assets held-for-sale (note 17). 
The accounting for the acquisition of Dart Energy Limited as of 16 October 2014 (acquisition date) was provisionally determined in respect 
of the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2015. During the 
period to 31 December 2015, the necessary valuations and assessments have been undertaken so that the accounting for this acquisition 
has been finalised.

Impairment testing of goodwill
Due to the change in the port olio of assets resulting from the Dart acquisition, management has now assigned goodwill to the conventional 
and unconventional CGUs, the level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The goodwill related to the 
conventional assets was impaired in full; the carrying value of goodwill as at 31 December 2015 relates entirely to the unconventional assets.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. During the 
period ended 31 December 2015, the Group has undertaken an impairment test of goodwill due to the decline in the oil price. The Group 
assessed whether goodwill was impaired by calculating fair value less cost of disposal (“FVLCD”) using discounted future cash flows of the 
cash generating unit and comparing this to the total carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill. 
FVLCD calculations are based on cash flows expected to be generated by projected oil production profiles (including incremental production 
projects) up to the expected cessation of production dates. Future operating and capital expenditure were based on management’s 
assessment, and production and reserve profiles were based on proved and probable reserves as determined by internal estimates.
The calculation of FVLCD includes the following key assumptions:
• Future production volumes;
• Crude oil prices; and
• Discount rate.
Estimated future production volumes are based on detailed data for each of the Group’s fields and take into account development plans  
for the fields which would be expected to be undertaken by a market participant. 
The crude oil prices used are based on the forward oil price curve for three years followed by management’s view of long term price ($75/bbl).
The post-tax discount rate in 2015 is 9.0 per cent. The period over which the Group has projected cash flows is in excess of five years and  
is considered to be appropriate by the Group as it is underpinned by estimates of reserves and resources. 
It was determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is impaired by £39.2 million (31 March 2015: £nil). The fair value is a level 3 fair 
value measurement, as defined in note 25. There is no tax effect in respect of the impairment of goodwill.
During the interim period ended 30 September 2015, the Group recognised impairment in goodwill of £14.5 million. The increase in the 
recorded impairment loss during the three months to period ended 31 December 2015 is triggered by reduced short-term oil prices. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

written off (31 March 2015: £0.2 million).
Under the terms of the Secured Bond agreement, the Bondholders have a fixed and floating charge over these assets.
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
Due to the continued decline in the oil price, assets with conventional oil resources were tested for impairment. As a result of these tests, 
there was impairment of £5.9 million pre-tax (£2.9 million post-tax) in the UK-conventional E&E assets (31 March 2015: £15.2 million  
pre-tax (£6.2 million post-tax)). 
In calculating this impairment, management used risked contingent resource estimates, internal cost estimates and a range of assumptions 
with regard to future oil prices. The recoverable amount was based on management’s estimate of the FVLCD. The fair value is a level 3 fair 
value measurement, as defined in note 25.

Sensitivity of changes in assumptions
As discussed above the principal assumptions are recoverable future production and resources and the estimated price per boe of risked 
resource. A 10% boepd reduction in production would result in a full impairment of the UK-conventional E&E assets. An average $10.0/boe 
reduction in the estimated price per boe of production would result in a full impairment of the UK-conventional E&E assets.

Under the terms of the Secured Bond agreement, the Bondholders have a fixed and floating charge over these assets. 
Impairment of oil and gas properties
Due to the continued decline in the oil price, oil and gas properties were tested for impairment. As a result, an impairment charge  
of £17.7 million pre-tax (£8.8 million post-tax) was recognised in the period to 31 December 2015 (Year to 31 March 2015: £3.9 million  
pre-tax (£1.6 million post-tax)). The impairment charge and recoverable amount of the CGUs where impairment was charged are  
set out on the table on page 78.
Previously, IGas has identified its CGUs based on the individual fields, or pools of fields where there is shared infrastructure such as  
a common processing facility. During the period, management has reassessed its CGUs for impairment testing due to the restructuring  
of the operations of the Group which include changes in the way the Group operates, manages and monitors its oil and gas properties. 
Management concluded that the CGUs for impairment purposes are the group of fields whereby technical, economic and/or contractual 
features create underlying interdependence in cash flows. The Group has identified the three main producing CGUs as: North; South;  
and Scotland.
The recoverable values of CGUs were calculated based on management’s estimate of the FVLCD. The fair value is a level 3 fair value 
measurement, as defined in note 25. 
During the interim period ended 30 September 2015, the Group recognised impairment in oil and gas properties of £10.1 million.  
The increase in the recorded impairment loss during the three months to period ended 31 December 2015 is triggered by reduced  
short-term prices. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Sensitivity of changes in assumptions
As discussed above the principal assumptions are recoverable future production and resources and the estimated dollar per boe of risked 
resource. A 10% boepd reduction in production would result in a further impairment of £15.7 million. An average $10.0/boe reduction  
in the estimated dollar per boe of production would result in a further impairment of £29.9 million.

Certain assets acquired as part of the Dart Acquisition, namely the Rest of the World segment principally consisting of Australian and 
Indonesian assets, were acquired with the intention to divest all business and activities in all these countries. The sale of these assets 
completed in October and November 2015, which resulted in a gain of £1.4 million. There was £0.07 million tax charged on this amount.
The gain for the period before tax in respect of discontinued operations was £2.4 million (31 March 2015: a loss of £0.08 million).  
Other than the tax on disposal described above, there is no tax charged on this amount.

In 2013, the Company and Norsk Tillitsmann (“Bond Trustee”) entered into a Bond Agreement for the Company to issue up to $165.0 million 
secured bonds and up to $30.0 million unsecured bonds (issued at 96% of par). These bonds were subsequently listed on Oslo Bors and the 
Alternative bond market in Oslo. During the period to 31 December 2015 the Company amended the terms of the Bond agreement. The 
primary changes were in relation to the covenants and the maintenance of financial ratios including the establishment  
of the DSRA.
Both secured and unsecured bonds carry a coupon of 10% per annum (where interest is payable semi-annually in arrears). Secured bonds 
are amortised semi-annually at 2.5% of the initial loan amount. Final maturity on the secured notes is on 22 March 2018 and on the 
unsecured notes is 11 December 2018.
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 5,414,747 secured bonds resulting in an aggregate gain  
of £0.5 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: 14,667,530 secured bonds resulting in a gain of £1.3 million). 
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 1,600,000 unsecured bonds resulting in an aggregate gain  
of £0.4 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: 1,000,000 unsecured bonds resulting in a gain of £0.1 million).

As at 31 December/31 March     147 349
Warrants issued can be exercised in three different ways and, although the cost to the Group would be the same under each exercise 
option, these warrants do not qualify as equity instruments under IAS39 due to the variable number of shares that would be issued  
in each case. Accordingly they have been accounted for as financial liabilities.
All warrants vested on grant and accordingly the key assumptions made in arriving at the Black-Scholes valuations were: share price on  
date of valuation adjusted for subsequent consolidations where appropriate and the length of time for which the warrants were expected  
to remain exercisable. A risk free interest rate of 1.09% and an implied volatility of 35% were used in valuing the warrants at the time  
of grant, and an interest rate of 0.82% and an implied volatility of 75.15% at 31 December 2015. It was also assumed that no dividends 
would be paid during the life of the warrants.
The movement in warrants during the period was as follows:

During the period, no warrants were exercised, therefore no ordinary shares have been issued (31 March 2015: 1,500,000 shares issued 
with a nominal value of 10p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the warrants outstanding as at 31 December 2015 is 2.0 years (31 March 2015: 2.75 years).

Decommissioning provision
Provision has been made for the discounted future cost of restoring fields to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The 
abandonment of the fields is expected to happen at various times between 2 and 32 years from the period end (31 March 2015: 5 to 29 
years). These provisions are based on the Groups’ internal estimates as at 31 December 2015. Assumptions based on the current economic 
environment have been made, which management believes are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These 
estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs  
will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required that will reflect market conditions  
at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically 
viable rates. This, in turn, will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
The risk free rate range of 0.68% to 3.58% is used in the calculation of the provision as at 31 December 2015 (31 March 2015: Risk free rate 
range of 0.26% to 2.54%). FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The deferred consideration amount relates to the amount payable by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group (acquired as part of the Dart 
acquisition), GP Energy Ltd, to its earlier joint venture partner in certain licences contingent upon various exploration and development 
success outcomes, which has been risked at 10%, due to the Group’s reassessment of the assets during the period. Should the relevant 
contingent outcomes materialise, the amounts are expected to fall due in two equal tranches on each of 31 July 2022 and 30 June 2024.
23 Pension scheme
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The pension charge for the period ended 31 December 2015 represents 
contributions payable by the Group to pension funds and amounted to £0.76 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £0.93 million).

 The fair value of borrowings (hierarchy level 1) has been calculated by reference to quoted market prices for these specific liabilities. 
Fair value hierarchy
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: other valuation techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3: valuation techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data. 
For financial instruments there are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have there been any transfers between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the fair value hierarchy as at the reporting dates as follows:

25 Financial instruments and risk management continued
Fair value of derivative financial instruments
The fair values of the commodity price options were provided by counterparties with whom the trades have been entered into. These 
consist of Asian style put and call options to sell/buy oil. The options are valued using a Black- Scholes methodology; however, certain 
adjustments are made to the spot-price volatility of oil prices due to the nature of the options. These adjustments are made either through 
Monte Carlo simulations or through statistical formulae. The inputs to these valuations include the price of oil, its volatility, and risk free 
interest rates.
Fair value of warrants
The warrants are valued using Black-Scholes method, which incorporates the inputs as detailed in note 20.
Fair value of contingent deferred consideration
Inputs that may have a significant effect on the recorded fair value have been identified as the (i) technical and commercial risk factors;  
(ii) change in the discount rate used to discount future cash flows; and (iii) other unobservable factors such as the time periods over which 
this monies are expected to be paid, which is based on internal estimates.
Management regularly assesses possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above and determines their 
impact on the total fair value. The fair value of the deferred consideration is sensitive to a reasonable change in the time assumption  
and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. 
Derivative financial instruments
In the current period the Group has entered into certain put/call options and swaps in order to manage its exposure to commodity price  
risk associated with sales of oil in US dollars.

The derivatives outstanding at 31 March 2015 mature over the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016. During the year to 31 March 
2015 oil hedges for 757 thousand barrels matured generating a net gain of £6.2 million. 
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
The carrying values of the financial assets and financial liabilities (except bonds) are considered to be materially equivalent to their fair values.
Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, warrants and trade and other payables. The main 
purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations, including the Group’s capital expenditure programme, and to fund 
acquisitions. The Group has trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents that are derived directly from its operations and 
restricted cash. The Group also enters into derivative transactions. 
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks in accordance with its financial risk management policy. The objective of the policy  
is to support the Group’s financial targets while protecting future financial security. The Group is exposed to the following risks:
• Market risk, including commodity price and foreign currency risks;
• Credit risk; and 
• Liquidity risk.
The Group is not exposed to interest rate risk as at 31 December 2015 as all the Group’s borrowings are at a fixed rate.
Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below. It is the Group’s policy that all 
transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the Group. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative exposures.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factors, 
such as commodity price and foreign currency. 
The sensitivity analyses below have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments 
in foreign currencies are all constant and that financial derivatives are held to maturity. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the 
sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ 
equity, where applicable. 
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: 
• The sensitivity of the relevant profit before tax item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based  
on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2015 and 31 March 2015; and
• The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax and ignores the effects of deferred tax, if any. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

25 Financial instruments and risk management continued
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in prevailing market commodity prices (primarily crude oil) on the mix of oil and gas 
products it produces. The Group’s policy is to manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments. 
The following table summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in commodity prices on the fair value of derivative financial 
instruments. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax as these derivative financial instruments have not been 
designated as hedges and are classified as held-for-trading. 
The analysis is based on derivative contracts existing at the balance sheet date, the assumption that crude oil price moves 15% over all 
future periods, with all other variables held constant.

Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in currencies other than the UK pound 
sterling, the functional currency of all Group companies. The Group’s sales are denominated in US dollars, and around 5% of costs are 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities within the Group, primarily US dollars. 
The following table summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate on the financial 
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at period end, principally relating to the Group’s borrowings which are denominated in US dollars. 
The impact on equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is based on the assumption that the pound moves 10%, with all other variables held constant.

10% (31 March 2015: 10%) weakening of the pound against the US dollar     (6,750) (8,987)
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy to assess the credit risk of new customers before 
entering contracts. Under this policy, each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment 
and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank and 
trade references.
The exposure to credit risk from credit sales is not considered significant given the small number of well-established credit customers and 
zero historic default rate.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had 2 customers (31 March 2015: 2) that owed the Group more than £1.0 million each and accounted 
for approximately 87% (31 March 2015: 89%) of all receivables owing. The need for impairment is analysed at each reporting date on an 
individual basis for major clients.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and restricted 
cash, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount  
of these instruments. The Group limits its counterparty credit risk on these assets by dealing only with financial institutions with credit 
ratings of at least A or equivalent other than if the UK government is a majority shareholder. £20.5 million (31 March 2015: £10.1 million)  
of cash and cash equivalents were held with two institutions.

Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from
current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder value. 
The Group’s funding needs are met through a combination of debt and equity and adjustments are made in light of changes in economic 
conditions. The Group’s strategy is to maintain ratios in line with covenants associated with the issued bonds.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by equity plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt, 
interest bearing bank loans less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Capital includes share capital, share premium, other reserves 
and accumulated losses. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

26 Share capital 
On 31 December 2007 the Company completed a reverse takeover whereby Island Gas Limited (“IGL”) became a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of the Company but with IGL’s shareholders acquiring 94% of the ordinary share capital of the combined entity (the “Reverse”).
In accordance with the required accounting for a reverse, the nominal value of the Company’s share capital is not reflected in the Group’s 
consolidated equity. For the purposes of the consolidated accounts share capital was recorded at the date of the Reverse at a value equal  
to the deemed cost of the Reverse, being the adjusted market value of the Company as last quoted immediately prior to the announcement 
of the Reverse, plus the equity of IGL; the effective acquiring Company.

27 Share premium and capital redemption reserve account
Share premium account
The share premium account of the Group arises from the capital that the Company raises upon issuing shares for consideration in excess 
of the nominal value of the shares, net of the costs of issuing the new shares. During the period the Company issued 1,899,102 ordinary 
shares at a nominal value of 10p each (Year ended 31 March 2015: 92,199,800 shares issued). The prices of each of these issuances are 
disclosed in note 26. The cost of these issues was £nil (31 March 2015: £1.9 million). Together these events resulted in a net movement  
in the share premium reserve of £0.3 million (31 March 2015: £58.5 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During the year ended 31 March 2013 the Company repurchased 100% of its outstanding deferred shares which had been issued with  
a nominal value of 40p each. These deferred shares were subsequently cancelled by the Company. This resulted in a reduction in share 
capital and a corresponding recognition of a capital redemption reserve of £41.2 million.

Management Retention Plan (“MRP”)
In December 2015, the Group adopted a new share-based payment scheme, the Management Retention Plan (“MRP”). Under the MRP , 
participants are granted nil cost options which vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of grant subject to the Directors’ 
continued employment and to a one year holding period following the date of vesting. 
Employees were granted 7,143,610 options in the MRP in lieu of waived options granted under the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) and 2015 cash bonuses. The options designated by the Group as replacement awards at grant date and were accounted for as a 
modification of the original scheme and were valued at grant date and the options awarded in lieu of cash bonuses were measured with 
reference to the fair value of the services received.
The fair value of the cancelled awards was re-measured at the replacement date based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The key inputs 
into the model were: replacement date share price of £0.14, threshold price of between £1.351 and £1.664, a risk free interest rate of 
between 0.37% and 0.42% and an implied share price volatility of between 73% and 86%. It was also assumed that no dividends would be 
paid during the life of the options. This resulted in an incremental fair value of £0.17 million.
The MRPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining contractual life and maximum term remaining  
of 7.9 years. The fair value of the replacement awards granted under the MRP was the grant date share price. 
The total charge for the year was £0.14 million. Of this amount, £0.05 million was capitalised and £0.09 million was charged to the  
Income Statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Executive Director Retention Plan (“EDRP”)
In July 2015, the Group adopted a new share-based payment scheme, the Executive Director Retention Plan (“EDRP”). Under the EDRP , 
participants are granted nil cost options which vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of grant subject to the Directors’ 
continued employment and to a one year holding period following the date of vesting. 
Executives were granted 6,500,000 options in the EDRP in lieu of waived options granted under the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) and the Value Creation Plan (VCP). The options have been designated by the Group as replacement awards at grant date and were 
accounted for as a modification of the original scheme. 
The fair value of the cancelled awards was re-measured at the replacement date based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value 
of waived options was based on the share price at grant date of £0.2475. The fair value of replacement awards was based on the Monte 
Carlo valuation model. The key inputs into the model were: replacement date share price of £0.2475, threshold price of between £0.945 
and £1.664, a risk free interest rate of between 0.49% and 0.60% and an implied share price volatility of between 70% and 78%. It was  
also assumed that no dividends would be paid during the life of the options. This resulted in an incremental fair value of £1.5 million.
The EDRPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining contractual life and maximum term remaining  
of 7.5 years. The fair value of the replacement awards granted under the EDRP was the grant date share price.
The total charge for the year was £0.7 million. Of this amount, £0.3 million was capitalised and £0.4 million was charged to the  
Income Statement.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 (“2011 LTIP”)
In November 2011 the Company adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan scheme for certain key employees of the Group. Under the LTIP , 
participants can each be granted nil cost options over up to 300% of remuneration for the Initial Award and up to 150% of remuneration 
for the Annual Award (subject to an overall plan limit of 10% of the issued share capital of the Company for all participants). The LTIP has 
a three year performance period and awards vest subject to share price performance exceeding the Company’s weighted average cost of 
capital of 10%. On a change of control prior to the third anniversary of the grant date, a proportion of the options that vest will take into 
account items such as the time the Option has been held by the participant and the performance achieved in the period from the grant 
date. Other than on a change of control, 100% of vested awards can be exercised and sold on vesting. 
There were no LTIPs exercised during the year. The LTIPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining 
contractual life and maximum term remaining of 9.9 years (31 March 2015: 8.6 years). The fair value of the awards granted under the plan 
are measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The total charge for the period was £0.19 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £0.73 million). Of this amount, £0.06 million was capitalised 
(31 March 2015: £0.32 million) and £0.13 million was charged to the Income Statement (31 March 2015: £0.41 million).
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company undertook a restructuring programme. The share options and units previously 
granted to employees under 2011 LTIP have been forfeited, none of which having vested or become exercisable prior to this date due to 
the termination of employment. This resulted in a release of prior charges under IFRS 2 – credit to the income statement of £0.089 million, 
credit against exploration and evaluation assets of £0.069 million and a charge to other reserves of £0.158 million.
Value Creation Plan (“2014 VCP”)
In July 2014, the Company adopted the IGas 2014 Value Creation Plan (“VCP”). Under the VCP , performance units will be granted which 
convert into a certain number of shares at the end of a three year performance period. The VCP requires creation of shareholder value in 
excess of a threshold hurdle of 10% annualised share price growth from 1 April 2014. If this hurdle is met at the end of the performance 
period, participants will receive in aggregate 12.5% of the shareholder value created above the hurdle. 50% of this value will vest in shares 
of equivalent value at end of the performance period and 25% at the end of each of the following two years. The awards granted under the 
VCP scheme are measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
For the VCP , when significant additional capital is raised (more than 10% of the Company’s issued share capital) following the grant date,  
a separate tranche of the VCP award is created with its own threshold price and share capital. Therefore any additional shares issued will 
have to be considered separately in determining the VCP accounting expense for periods following this capital event.

Other share based payments
In 2013, the Group adopted an HMRC approved Share Investment Plan (“SIP”) for all employees of the Group. The scheme  
is a tax efficient incentive plan pursuant to which all employees are eligible to acquire up to £150 (or 10% of salary, if less) worth of IGas 
ordinary shares per month or £1,800 per annum. Under the SIP employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares.  
If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares the Company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award  
of shares (matching shares), on a one-for-one or two-for-one basis. 
The total charge for the period was £0.2 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £0.2 million). Of this amount, £0.04 million was capitalised  
(31 March 2015: £0.02 million) and £0.16 million was charged to the income statement (31 March 2015: £0.18 million).
There were no options exercised during the period. The options outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining 
contractual life and a maximum term of 6.9 years (31 March 2015: 7.6 years).
In October 2015, the Group issued 573,576 ordinary shares with a fair value of £0.1 million to Jefferies International Limited’s in connection 
with advisory services relating to the Group’s farm-out and purchase agreement with INEOS which completed on 7 May 2015.
Treasury shares 
The Treasury shares of the Group have arisen in connection with the shares issued to the IGas Employee Benefit Trust, of which the 
Company is the sponsoring entity. The value of such shares is recorded in the share capital and share premium accounts in the ordinary 
way and is also shown as a deduction from equity in this separate reserve account. There is therefore no net effect on shareholders’ funds. 
During the period ended to 31 December 2015 there were no shares issued to the Employee Benefit Trust (Year ended 31 March 2015: nil).

PARENT COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT
FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
98    |    IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015
1 Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation of financial statements
The Parent Company financial statements of IGas Energy plc (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with International  
Financial Reporting Standards, adopted for use by the European Union (“IFRSs”) as they apply to the Company for the nine months ended  
31 December 2015, and with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting periods are not comparable as this 9 month period represents  
a short period of account to align the year end with the year end of major operating partners. The accounts were approved by the Board  
and authorised for issue on 15 March 2016. IGas Energy plc is a public limited company incorporated, registered in England and Wales  
and is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”).
The Company’s financial statements are presented in UK pound sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) except 
when otherwise indicated. 
As a Consolidated income statement is published in this Annual Report, a separate income statement for the Company is not presented 
within these financial statements as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
There are no new standards, interpretations and amendments to adopt which are effective as of 1 April 2015.
New and amended standards and Interpretations
Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been published and are mandatory only for the 
Company’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 or later periods and which the Company has not adopted early. Those 
that may be applicable to the Company in future are as follows: 
IAS 1 Disclosure initiative – Amendments to IAS 1 1 January 2016*
IAS 16 and IAS 38  Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation –  1 January 2016* 
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 
IAS 7  Disclosure initiative – Amendments to IAS 7 1 January 2017*
IFRS 9  Financial Instruments 1 January 2018*
IFRS 16  Leases 1 January 2019*
* The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB/IFRIC standards and interpretations. As the Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union (EU), the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism. In the 
majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Company‘s discretion to 
early adopt standards.
The Company is currently assessing the impact that these amendments will have on its financial position. The Company does not anticipate 
adopting these standards and interpretations ahead of their effective dates.
(b) Going concern
The Company closely monitors and manages its liquidity risks. Cash forecasts for the Company are regularly produced based on, inter alia, 
the Company's production and expenditure forecasts, management's best estimate of future oil prices (based on current forward curves, 
adjusted for the Company's hedging programme) and the Company's borrowing facilities. Sensitivities are run to reflect different scenarios 
including, but not limited to, possible further reductions in commodity prices below the current forward curve and reductions in forecast oil 
and gas production rates. 
The ability of the Company to operate as a going concern is dependent upon the continued availability of future cash flows and the 
availability of the monies drawn under its Bonds, which in turn is dependent on the Company not breaching its bond covenants. In response 
to the significant reduction in oil prices, the Board implemented a series of cost saving initiatives during the period that have materially 
reduced both operating costs and G&A spend. In addition, following positive discussions with the bondholders, the net leverage covenant, 
inter alia, was amended to take account of the Company’s improved cash position following the INEOS farm-out, which was completed 
during the period.
Whilst the Company has delivered on the above initiatives and has significant cash balances, the continuing low commodity price 
environment means that the Company's current forecasts, utilising the current oil price forward curve, project non-compliance with certain 
of its covenants in the second half of 2016. The Board is pursuing actions to alleviate a covenant breach including, but not limited to, further 
cost reductions, monetising existing hedged oil positions, bond buy-backs, and asset port olio management. Concurrently, the Board will 
continue to evaluate other cash and earnings accretive transaction options which could reduce the need for the mitigating actions set out 
above. Nevertheless, based on the current oil price and forward curve, the Directors cannot be certain that these will fully mitigate any 
potential covenant short all in respect of the testing period ending 31 December 2016. Whilst pursuing the options listed above, the Board 
will continue its proactive dialogue with bondholders and, if appropriate, seek to modify or temporarily waive the existing covenants ahead 
of the time at which the Company submits its compliance certificate in respect of that testing period, which would be by 30 April 2017.

1 Accounting policies continued
(b) Going concern continued
The risk that the Company will be unable to either enact appropriate mitigating actions to a sufficient extent before the 31 December 2016 
measurement date or secure an appropriate relaxation or amendment of its financial covenants prior to 30 April 2017 represents a material 
uncertainty that may cast doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Board believes, after making appropriate enquiries, and on the information currently available, that the Company is likely to be able 
to either implement sufficient mitigating actions to ensure that the Company is compliant with its covenants or secure a relaxation to the 
covenants as described above and it is therefore considered appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
(c) Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below: 
Recoverable value of investment in subsidiaries:
The Company evaluates investments in subsidiaries for indicators of impairment as described in (d) below. Any impairment test, where 
required, involves estimates and associated assumptions related to matters (when appropriate), such as recoverable reserves; production 
profiles; forward gas and electricity prices; development, operational and offtake costs; nature of land access agreements and planning 
permissions; application of taxes, and other matters. Where the final outcome or revised estimates related to such matters differ from the 
estimates used in any earlier impairment reviews, the results of such differences, to the extent that they actually affected any impairment 
provisions, are accounted for when such revisions are made. Details of the Company’s investments are disclosed in note 2.
Functional currency
The determination of a company’s functional currency often requires significant judgement where the primary economic environment 
in which it operates may not be clear. The Company’s financial statements are presented in UK pound sterling, the primary economic 
environment of the Company.
(d) Non-current assets
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in group companies held as non-current assets are held at cost less provision for impairment unless the investments were 
acquired in exchange for the issue or part issue of shares in the Company, when they are initially recorded in the Company’s balance sheet 
at the fair value of the shares issued together with the fair value of any consideration paid, including costs of acquisition less any provision 
for impairment.
The Company’s investments in group companies held as non-current assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable, when impairment is calculated on the basis as set 
out below. Any impairment is charged to the income statement. 
Loans to group companies are stated at amortised cost.
Impairment
Impairment tests, when required, are carried out on the following basis:
• By comparing any amounts carried as investments held as non-current assets with the recoverable amount; and
• The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The Company generally assesses value  
in use using the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a 
change in circumstances to the extent that the recoverable amount is higher than the net book value at the time. In reversing impairment 
losses, the carrying amount of the investment will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value and the carrying value that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the 
cost of fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, over their estimated useful lives at the following rates, with any impairment being 
accounted for as additional depreciation:
Buildings – over five years on a straight line basis
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – between three and five years on a straight line basis
Motor vehicles – over four years on a straight line basis  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(e) Financial Instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash held on current account or on short-term deposits at variable interest rates  
with original maturity periods of up to three months. Any interest earned is accrued monthly and classified as interest income within 
finance income. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value when related amounts are invoiced, less any allowances for doub tul debts  
or provision made for impairment of these receivables. 
Trade and other payables
These financial liabilities are all non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received. 
Impairment of financial assets 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency 
or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Company will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms 
of the invoice. The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account. Impaired debts are derecognised 
when they are assessed as uncollectible.
Warrants
When warrants do not qualify as equity instruments under IAS 39 due to the variable number of shares that would be issued in each 
case they are accounted for as financial liabilities. The warrants are initially recognised at fair value on the date they are issued and are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value at each period end. All changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”) method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities 
are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. When management’s estimates of the amounts or timings of cashflows 
are revised, borrowings are re-measured using the revised cash flow estimates under the original effective interest with any consequent 
adjustment being recognised in the income statement.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of these assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
(f) Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at inception date 
including whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys  
a right to use the asset.
Operating leases
Rentals are charged to the income statement in the year on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(g) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the tax authorities. Taxable profit/
(loss) differs from the profit/(loss) before taxation as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IGas Energy plc Annual report and accounts Nine months to 31 December 2015    |    101
1 Accounting policies continued
(g) Taxation continued
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except 
when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Temporary differences arise 
from differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are not discounted. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than 
not that they will be recovered.
The carrying amount of deferred tax is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the assets are realised or  
the liability is settled, based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised  
in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
(h) Share based payments
Where share options or warrants are awarded to employees (including Directors), the fair value of the options or warrants at the date of  
the grant is recorded in equity over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions, but only those related to service and performance, 
are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately,  
the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest. All other vesting 
conditions, including market vesting conditions, are factored in to the fair value of the options or warrants granted. As long as all other 
vesting conditions are satisfied, the amount recorded is computed irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.  
The cumulative amount recognised is not adjusted for the failure to achieve a market vesting condition; although equity no longer required 
for options or warrants may be transferred to another equity reserve.
Where the terms and conditions of options or warrants are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, 
measured by the change from immediately before to after the modification, is also recorded in equity over the remaining vesting period.
When an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised  
or the award is recognised immediately.
Where an equity settled award is identified as a replacement it will be treated as a modification to the original plan where the incremental 
fair value of the replacement award is expensed over the vesting period of the replacement award. The fair value of the original award on 
its grant date is continued to be recognised over its original vesting period. 
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the amount recognised in equity is the fair value of goods and 
services received.
Charges corresponding to the amounts recognised in equity are accounted as a cost against the profit and loss which will usually be to the 
income statement unless the services rendered qualify for capitalisation as a non-current asset. Costs may be capitalised within non-current 
assets in the event of services being rendered in connection with an acquisition or intangible exploration and evaluation assets or property, 
plant and equipment.
Where shares are issued to an Employee Benefit Trust, and the Company is the sponsoring entity, the value of such shares at issue will be 
recorded in share capital and share premium account in the ordinary way, but will not affect shareholders’ funds since this same value will 
be shown as a deduction from shareholders’ funds by way of a separate component of equity (Treasury shares). 
(i) Equity
Equity instruments issued by the Company are usually recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, and allocated between 
called up share capital, share premium accounts or merger reserve as appropriate.
(j) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency UK pound sterling are translated at the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

* Additional transaction costs relating to the debt of £1.0 million (2015: £nil) have been netted off against the liability.
In 2013, the Company and Norsk Tillitsmann (“Bond Trustee”) entered into a Bond Agreement for the Company to issue up to $165.0 million 
secured bonds and up to $30.0 million unsecured bonds (issued at 96% of par). These bonds were subsequently listed on Oslo Bors and  
the Alternative bond market in Oslo. During the period to 31 December 2015 the Company amended the terms of the Bond agreement.  
The primary changes were in relation to the covenants and the maintenance of financial ratios including the establishment of a DSRA.
Both secured and unsecured bonds carry a coupon of 10% per annum (where interest is payable semi-annually in arrears). Secured bonds 
are amortised semi-annually at 2.5% of the initial loan amount. Final maturity on the secured notes is on 22 March 2018 and on the 
unsecured notes is 11 December 2018.
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 5,414,747 secured bonds resulting in a combined gain  
of £0.5 million (31 March 2015: 14,667,530 secured bonds resulting in a gain of £1.3 million). 
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 1,600,000 unsecured bonds resulting in a gain of £0.4 million 
(31 March 2015: 1,000,000 unsecured bonds resulting in a gain of £0.1 million).

Warrants issued can be exercised in three different ways and, although the cost to the Group would be the same under each exercise 
option, these warrants do not qualify as equity instruments under IAS39 due to the variable number of shares that would be issued  
in each case. Accordingly they have been accounted for as financial liabilities. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9 Other liabilities continued
All warrants vested on grant and accordingly the key assumptions made in arriving at the Black-Scholes valuations were: share price on date 
of valuation, adjusted for subsequent consolidations where appropriate and the length of time for which the warrants were expected to 
remain exercisable. A risk free interest rate of 1.09% and an implied volatility of 35% were used in valuing the warrants at the time of grant, 
and an interest rate of 0.82% and an implied volatility of 75.15% at 31 December 2015. It was also assumed that no dividends would be paid 
during the life of the warrants.
The movement in warrants during the period was as follows:

During the year, no warrants were exercised, therefore no ordinary shares have been issued (31 March 2015: 1,500,000 shares issued with 
 a nominal value of 10p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the warrants outstanding as at 31 December 2015 is 2.0 years (31 March 2015: 2.75 years).

 The fair value of borrowings (hierarchy level 1) have been calculated by reference to quoted market prices for these specific liabilities.
Fair value hierarchy
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
• Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly  
or indirectly; and 
• Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data. 
For financial instruments there are no non-recurring fair value measurements nor have they been any transfers between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the fair value hierarchy as at the reporting dates as follows:

The warrants are valued using Black- Scholes method, which incorporates the inputs as detailed in note 9.
Financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings, warrants and trade and other payables, including amounts due to 
subsidiary undertakings. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s subsidiary operations and to fund 
acquisitions. The Company has trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents that are derived directly from its operations  
and restricted cash. 
The Company manages its exposure to key financial risks in accordance with its financial risk management policy. The objective of the policy 
is to support the Company’s financial targets while protecting future financial security. The Company is exposed to the following risks:
• Market risk including interest rate, and foreign currency risks;
• Credit risk; and 
• Liquidity risk. 
Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below. It is the Company’s policy that all 
transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the Company. The Company does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative exposures. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11 Financial instruments and risk management continued
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market factors, 
such as interest rate and foreign currency. 
The sensitivity analyses below have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, and the proportion of financial instruments  
in foreign currencies are all constant and that derivatives are held to maturity. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity 
to changes in market variables on the Company’s financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity, 
where applicable. 
Interest rate risk
The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s loans with related parties.  
The Company currently has all of its external borrowings at fixed rates of interest. 
The following table summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in interest rates on the fair value of the loans to related parties.  
The analysis is based on the assumption that LIBOR moves 50 basis points, with all other variables held constant.

Foreign currency risk
The Company has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from purchases in currencies other than the UK pounds sterling, 
the functional currency of the Company. 
The following table summarises the impact on profit before tax for changes in the US dollar/UK pound sterling exchange rate on financial 
assets and liabilities as at the year end, principally relating to the Groups borrowings which are denominated in US dollars. The impact on 
equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax.
The analysis is based on the assumption that the pound moves 10%, with all other variables held constant.

10% weakening of the pound against the US dollar     (8,243) (9,867)
Credit risk
With respect to credit risk arising from the financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and amounts due 
from subsidiary undertakings, the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure 
equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The credit risk on amounts due from subsidiary undertakings are limited as these are 
assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable. The Company limits its 
counterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by dealing only with financial institutions with credit ratings of at least A or equivalent 
other than if the UK government is a majority shareholder. £20.5 million (2015: £10.1 million) of cash and cash equivalents were held with 
two institutions.

Liquidity risk
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the subsidiaries liquidity needs, the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and 
future operating commitments.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash from operations to manage liquidity risks arising 
from current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
Capital management
The Company manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder 
value. The Company’s funding needs are met through a combination of debt and equity (2014: funding requirements through a 
combination of debt and equity) and adjustments are made in light of changes in economic conditions. The Company’s strategy is to 
maintain ratios in line with covenants associated with the senior debt facility.
The Company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by equity plus net debt. The Company includes within net 
debt, interest bearing bank loans less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Capital includes share capital, share premium, other 
reserves and accumulated losses. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The costs of all share issues have all been charged to the share premium account and are as disclosed in the Parent Company statement  
of changes in equity.
13 Share premium and capital redemption reserve account
Share premium account
The share premium account of the Company arises from the capital that the Company raises upon issuing shares for consideration  
in excess of the nominal value of the shares net of the costs of issuing the new shares. During the period the Company issued 1,899,102 
ordinary shares at a price of 10p each (2015: 92,199,800 shares issued). The cost of the issue was £nil million (2015: £1.9 million).  
Together these events resulted in a net movement in the share premium reserve of £0.3 million (2015: £58.5 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During the period ended 31 March 2014 IGas repurchased 100% of its outstanding deferred shares which had been issued with a nominal 
value of 40p each. These deferred shares were subsequently cancelled by the Company. This resulted in a reduction in share capital and  
a corresponding recognition of a capital redemption reserve of £64.9 million. 
14 Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose as a result of a reverse acquisition on 31 December 2007 whereby Island Gas Limited (“IGL”) became a wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Company but with IGL’s shareholders acquiring 94% of the ordinary share capital of the Company. The reserve 
represents the difference in the fair value and the nominal value of the shares issued. The reserve is not distributable.

Management Retention Plan (“MRP”)
In December 2015, the Group adopted a new share-based payment scheme, the Management Retention Plan (“MRP”). Under the MRP , 
participants are granted nil cost options which vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of grant subject to the Directors’ 
continued employment and to a one year holding period following the date of vesting. 
Employees of the Group were granted 7,143,610 options in the MRP in lieu of waived options granted under the 2011 Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) and 2015 cash bonuses. The options designated by the Group as replacement awards were accounted for as a modification of 
the original scheme and were valued at grant date and the options awarded in lieu of cash bonuses were measured with reference to the 
fair value of the services received.
The fair value of the cancelled awards was re-measured at the replacement date based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The key  
inputs into the model were: replacement date share price of £0.14, threshold price of between £1.351 and £1.664, a risk free interest rate 
of between 0.37% and 0.42% and an implied share price volatility of between 73% and 86%. It was also assumed that no dividends would 
be paid during the life of the options. This resulted in an incremental fair value of £0.17 million.
The MRPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining contractual life and maximum term remaining  
of 7.9 years. The fair value of the replacement awards granted under the MRP was the grant date share price. 
The total charge for the period was £0.14 million. Of this amount, £0.0138 million was capitalised and £0.002 million was charged to the  
income statement. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Executive Director Retention Plan (“EDRP”)
In July 2015, the Group adopted a new share-based payment scheme, the Executive Director Retention Plan (“EDRP”). Under the EDRP , 
participants are granted nil cost options which vest and become exercisable on the first anniversary of grant subject to the Directors’ 
continued employment and to a one year holding period following the date of vesting. 
Executives were granted 6,500,000 options in the EDRP in lieu of waived options granted under the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) and the Value Creation Plan (VCP). The options have been designated by the Group as replacement awards at grant date and were 
accounted for as a modification of the original scheme. 
The fair value of the cancelled awards was re-measured at the replacement date based on the Monte Carlo valuation model. The key inputs 
into the model were: replacement date share price of £0.2475, threshold price of between £0.945 and £1.664, a risk free interest rate of 
between 0.49% and 0.60% and an implied share price volatility of between 70% and 78%. It was also assumed that no dividends would be 
paid during the life of the options. This resulted in an incremental fair value of £1.5 million.
The EDRPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining of 7.5 years. The fair value of the replacement awards 
granted under the EDRP was measured at grant date share price.
The total charge for the period was £0.7 million. Of this amount, £0.6 million was capitalised and £0.1 million was charged to the  
Income Statement.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 (“2011 LTIP”)
In November 2011 the Company adopted a Long Term Incentive Plan scheme for certain key employees of the Group. Under the LTIP , 
participants can each be granted nil cost options over up to 300% of remuneration for the Initial Award and up to 150% of remuneration 
for the Annual Award (subject to an overall plan limit of 10% of the issued share capital of the Company for all participants). The LTIP has 
a three year performance period and awards vest subject to share price performance exceeding the Company’s weighted average cost of 
capital of 10%. On a change of control prior to the third anniversary of the grant date, a proportion of the options that vest will take into 
account items such as the time the Option has been held by the participant and the performance achieved in the period from the grant 
date. Other than on a change of control, 100% of vested awards can be exercised and sold on vesting. 
In June 2015, the awards granted in June 2012 under 2011 LTIP lapsed due to performance criteria not being met. The number of awards 
that lapsed is 1,071,542 and the amount previously recognised in other reserves of £0.3 million is transferred to retained earnings.
There were no LTIPs exercised during the year. The LTIPs outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining 
contractual life and maximum term remaining of 9.9 years (31 March 2015: 8.6 years). The fair value of the awards granted under the  
plan are measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The total charge for the period was £0.19 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £0.73 million). Of this amount, £0.21 million was capitalised 
(31 March 2015: £0.60 million) and £0.02 million was credited to the Income Statement (31 March 2015: £0.13 million).
During the period to 31 December 2015, the Company undertook a restructuring programme. The share options and units previously 
granted to employees under 2011 LTIP and the VCP have been forfeited, none of which having vested or become exercisable prior to this 
date due to the termination of employment. This resulted in a release of prior charges under IFRS 2 – credit to the income statement of 
£0.35 million, credit against investment of £0.65 million and a charge to other reserves of £1.0 million.
Value Creation Plan (“2014 VCP”)
In July 2014, the Company adopted the IGas 2014 Value Creation Plan (“VCP”). Under the VCP , performance units will be granted which 
convert into a certain number of shares at the end of a three year performance period. The VCP requires creation of shareholder value in 
excess of a threshold hurdle of 10% annualised share price growth from 1 April 2014. If this hurdle is met at the end of the performance 
period, participants will receive in aggregate 12.5% of the shareholder value created above the hurdle. 50% of this value will vest in shares 
of equivalent value at end of the performance period and 25% at the end of each of the following two years. The awards granted under the 
VCP scheme are measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
For the VCP , when significant additional capital is raised (more than 10% of the Company’s issued share capital) following the grant date,  
a separate tranche of the VCP award is created with its own threshold price and share capital. Therefore any additional shares issued will 
have to be considered separately in determining the VCP accounting expense for periods following this capital event.
The total charge for the period was £0.70 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £1.72 million). Of this amount, £0.44 million was capitalised 
(31 March 2015: £1.31 million) and £0.26 million was charged to the Income Statement (31 March 2015: £0.41 million).
The VCP was replaced by EDRP in its entirety.

Other share based payments
In 2013, the Company adopted an HMRC approved Share Investment Plan (“SIP”) for all employees of the Company. The scheme is a tax 
efficient incentive plan pursuant to which all employees are eligible to acquire up to £150 (or 10% of salary, if less) worth of IGas ordinary 
shares per month or £1,800 per annum. Under the SIP employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares. If an 
employee agrees to buy partnership shares the Company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award  
of shares (matching shares), on a one-for-one or two-for-one basis. 
The total charge for the period was £0.2 million (Year ended 31 March 2015: £0.2 million). Of this amount, £0.2 million was capitalised  
(31 March 2015: £0.03 million) and £nil was charged to the income statement (31 March 2015: £0.17 million).
There were no options exercised during the period. The options outstanding at 31 December 2015 had both a weighted average remaining 
contractual life and a maximum term of 6.9 years (31 March 2015: 7.6 years).
In October 2015, the Group issued 573,576 ordinary shares with a fair value of £0.1 million to Jefferies International Limited’s in connection 
with advisory services relating to the Group’s farm-out and purchase agreement with INEOS which completed on 7 May 2015.
Treasury shares 
The Treasury shares of the Company have arisen in connection with the shares issued to the IGas Employee Benefit Trust, of which the 
Company is the sponsoring entity. The value of such shares is recorded in the share capital and share premium accounts in the ordinary 
way and is also shown as a deduction from equity in this separate reserve account. There is therefore no net effect on shareholders’ funds. 
During the period ended to 31 December 2015 there were no shares issued to the Employee Benefit Trust (Year ended 31 March 2015: nil).
Capital contribution 
The capital contribution relates to cash received following the acquisition of IGas Exploration UK Limited. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Contingent  Contingent Recoverable Resource estimates are prepared in accordance with the Petroleum Resources Management  
Recoverable System (PRMS), an industry recognised standard. A Contingent Recoverable Resource is defined as discovered potentially   
Resources recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons where there is no current certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce  
 any portion of the contingent resources evaluated. Contingent Recoverable Resources are further divided into three status   
 groups: marginal, sub-marginal, and undetermined. IGas’ Contingent Recoverable Resources all fall into the undetermined
 group. Undetermined is the status group where it is considered premature to clearly define the ultimate chance  
 of commerciality.
 All amounts shown in this annual report have been compiled by statistical aggregation.

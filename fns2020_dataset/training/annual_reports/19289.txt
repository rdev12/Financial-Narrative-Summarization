KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
As a business operating in  
the heart of an industry going 
through unprecedented change, 
we are incredibly excited about 
what we are already doing to 
make payments simpler.
We are delighted with the results Paysafe has announced today. 2015 was 
another year of continued strong performance across the entire business. 
Reported revenue was $613.4m with $390.4m booked in the second half. 
This was a 75% increase half-on-half, reflecting the consolidation of Skrill’s 
results from 10 August 2015. On a pro-forma constant currency basis, FY 2015 
revenue increased 13% year-on-year. Adjusted FY 2015 EBITDA was $152.6m, 
compared with $86.1m in 2014. The integration of Skrill is progressing well 
with synergy savings of approximately $10m achieved in 2015.
Transformational year
The acquisition of digital wallet and online payments processor Skrill Group 
(“Skrill”), along with the successful integration of Meritus and GMA into our 
payment processing business, and the acquisition of mobile technology 
developer and integrator FANS Entertainment, has created a considerably 
more international and diversified payments business.
Dennis Jones,  
Chairman
Following the acquisition of Skrill, Paysafe continues to refine its key performance 
indicators. Paysafe considers that the following factors are currently relevant to help 
stakeholders measure the development, performance and position of the Group.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Delivering value
Our approach delivers value to our merchants and 
consumers and in turn creates value for shareholders.  
We made strong progress in 2015:
 - bolstering our position as a prepaid online payments 
provider and a leading player in the provision of digital 
wallets, and optimising our products and services  
for mobile;
 - improving our presence in existing markets and 
expanding into new geographies and sectors; and
 - positioning the Group for further growth.
In 2016, the entire Paysafe team is focused on building  
on the successes of our core operations across all the 
payment-related needs we serve with the ongoing 
objective of creating a substantial and profitable 
long-term business. We are well positioned for the 
opportunities to consolidate Paysafe’s position  
as a proven leader and trusted innovator in the  
payments industry.
Dividend
The Board is not recommending the payment  
of a dividend in respect of 2015.
Board and governance
Stephen Shaper stepped down as a Non-Executive 
Director on 3 August 2015. We would like to thank 
Stephen, who had been a Board member since 2012,  
for his significant contribution to the growth and success  
of our business. We wish him well for the future.
During the year we have increased financial transparency 
and investment in business resilience and security. This 
will continue. As part of our targeted investment in the 
business, the Group’s legal, regulatory, compliance and 
risk management teams grew during 2015, reflecting the 
importance of integrating policies across the different 
business divisions to establish a unified set of processes 
reflecting best practice in the payments industry.
An outstanding team
As Chairman I would like to thank President and Chief 
Executive Officer Joel Leonoff, Chief Financial Officer  
Brian McArthur-Muscroft, Chief Operating Officer Danny 
Chazonoff and our entire team for delivering the results 
we have achieved in 2015. The quality of our people and 
their undoubted ability to maintain and grow the client 
relationships we have remain fundamental to the  
Group’s success.
Dennis Jones 
Chairman
The Skrill acquisition, with an enterprise value of 
approximately €1.2bn ($1.3bn), effectively doubled our 
size, and helped propel us from the AIM market to the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange in the final 
weeks of 2015. The acquisition was a long-term goal for 
the Group – a transformational combination of two highly 
complementary payment specialists that has created a 
business with significant scale, a wider customer base  
and product offering, and a stronger financial profile. 
Importantly, we maintained a disciplined approach 
through the acquisition and other recently-executed 
transactions, and delivered overall Group growth.
A new corporate identity
Our evolution as a global player in the payments  
industry with nearly two decades of proven and extensive 
experience was formally unveiled with the transition to 
our new corporate identity – Paysafe – in November 2015. 
While our brand was redesigned, our purpose remains the 
same: to offer relevant, simple and secure solutions for 
payments everywhere.
As a business operating in the heart of an  
industry going through unprecedented change,  
we are incredibly excited about what we are already  
doing to make payments simpler – for the businesses  
and brands we work with and for consumers who can 
manage their money in innovative new ways to suit  
their evolving needs. Paysafe is bringing this revolution  
in digital commerce to markets and customers across  
the world as internet access becomes ubiquitous and 
mobile payments grow in popularity across developed 
and emerging markets. 
At Paysafe, we believe our combination of digital  
wallets, prepaid products and card services and  
payments processing will enable us to continue  
to capitalise on the growth in digital transactions.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT CONTINUED
We are well positioned for the 
opportunities to consolidate 
Paysafe’s position as a proven 
leader and trusted innovator  
in the payments industry.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Our vision  
to be the point of every payment
BUSINESS MODEL
Payment 
Processing
Prepaid
Digital 
Wallets
How we make money
 - Merchants pay a variable fee structure 
comprising a percentage of the value of  
every payment transaction processed and/or  
a fixed fee based on number of transactions. 
Merchants may also pay fixed fees for certain 
value-add services.
 - Merchants pay a percentage of amounts 
transferred to and from consumers’ wallets, 
which comprises the majority of Digital Wallets 
fees. We also charge fees for consumers on 
some withdrawals and deposits, peer to  
peer payments and foreign exchange. 
 - Merchants pay us a percentage of the 
transaction value of the paysafecard vouchers 
they redeem. We pass some of this fee on to 
our distribution partners. The end consumer 
doesn’t usually pay a fee to Paysafe to buy  
and use a paysafecard voucher. 
Our competitive advantage
 - Paysafe Payment Processing offers relevant, 
state-of-the-art solutions to meet our clients’ 
current and future needs – whether that’s to 
accept payments from other countries, offer 
e-instalment or pay-later options, white-
labelled products or accept in-app mobile 
payments. Merchants choose us for our deep 
sector experience and risk management 
expertise. While managing complex payment 
needs, we provide data, insight and value-add 
services to help merchants offer safe and 
secure payments. 
 - Through Paysafe Digital Wallets, merchants can 
access a wide range of relevant and innovative 
payment options through one integration. 
Indemnified, immediately-available funds make 
it easy for them to accept payments and move 
money to consumers in more than 200 countries 
and territories. Merchants benefit from access  
to users of our wallets. 
 - Our Skrill and NETELLER wallets offer consumers 
secure, real-time payments. This includes 
easy-to-use options such as stored cards, 
frictionless recurring payments, VIP and loyalty 
programmes, prepaid withdrawal cards, and 
mobile solutions to make it easy to manage 
wallets and payments on the go. We also enable 
our consumers to send money to other wallet 
users globally, using just an email address. 
 - paysafecard enables merchants to reach 
consumers that want to use cash to pay  
for goods and services online. We help our 
merchants generate incremental revenue and 
reduce their risk by guaranteeing payments. 
Our expertise in building distribution and cash 
collection networks allows us to expand with 
confidence into new geographies. 
Our competitive advantage
 - Paysafe has a unique, feature-rich, comprehensive and 
relevant product suite that we can tailor to deliver desired  
and meaningful solutions. We bring the reach and scale of  
a global, multi-billion-dollar organisation to our clients. 
 - Across all divisions our focus is on working closely  
with businesses to offer relevant, simple and secure  
payment solutions. 
 - By partnering with Paysafe, clients gain access to our expertise 
across the spectrum of digital payments, as well as our global 
risk and compliance teams to provide peace of mind.

11 Redefining the  
role of a payment 
provider...
We are incredibly pleased with these results.  
2015 was a tremendous year for our business.  
We operated at pace with focus, delivering growth 
in terms of our financial results and the increasing 
range of payment products and services we provide 
around the world. 
Our performance reflects ongoing successful 
execution, the effective integration and disciplined 
management of our recently acquired businesses, 
and the focus and ongoing commitment of  
our employees. 
A year of progress
Among the many highlights of the past year  
were the integration of Meritus and GMA, the 
acquisition of Skrill and FANS Entertainment,  
the transition to the Group’s new brand identity 
Paysafe and our elevation to the London Stock 
Exchange’s Main Market. These milestones, 
together with our inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index, 
are a testament to the significant progress  
made by the Group over the past 15 months. 
We also attained our first formal public credit 
ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, 
issued two full prospectuses – one for the rights 
issue to finance the acquisition of Skrill which 
completed in May 2015 and one for the Main 
Market move in December 2015 – and hosted  
the enlarged Group’s first Capital Markets Day  
in London. 
Skrill
The acquisition of Skrill completed in August 
2015. This transaction diversified the Group’s 
customer base, product offering and geographic 
exposure due to the highly complementary 
nature of the two businesses. 
The Skrill Group comprised the Skrill digital 
wallet, which also offers a prepaid MasterCard; 
paysafecard, which provides prepaid payment 
products; and payolution, which arranges  
the provision of point-of-sale financing, giving 
merchants the ability to offer credit to customers 
to pay later via invoice or instalments once goods 
have been received.
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
We operated at pace with 
focus, delivering growth in 
terms of our financial results 
and the increasing range  
of payment products and 
services we provide  
around the world.
Joel Leonoff,  
President and 
Chief Executive 
Officer
12
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Specifically, the two businesses shared 
the following key attributes:
 - Established providers of alternative 
payment processing and digital wallet 
solutions to merchants and consumers 
operating at a global scale with a 
presence in multiple markets;
 - High underlying gross profit margins 
and scalable business models;
 - Leading providers of digital wallet 
solutions to the online gambling  
and gaming industries; and
 - Generating revenue streams  
from merchant and consumer  
fees relating to fund movements  
on digital wallet platforms.
We financed the acquisition by a 
well-supported £463m ($702m) fully-
underwritten rights issue – the largest  
on AIM at the time – and the issue  
of shares to Skrill investors. The deal  
was underpinned by establishing debt 
facilities of €500m ($548m) in a way that 
improved our balance sheet efficiency 
and demonstrated the attractiveness  
of Paysafe to major financial institutions.
Another merit of the transaction  
was its ability to unlock substantial 
synergies arising from the combination  
of two businesses, given how well they 
complemented each other. When the 
deal was announced in March 2015 we 
forecast $40m per annum in ongoing  
cost saving synergies in the fiscal  
year ending 31 December 2016.  
We delivered approximately $10m  
in 2015. The integration of Skrill is on  
track to be substantially completed 
during the third quarter of 2016.
Strong financial performance
The acquisition of Skrill, a full year  
of contribution from Meritus and  
GMA (acquired in July 2014), as well  
as underlying Group-wide growth, 
contributed to a 68% increase in 2015 
reported revenue from $365.0m in  
2014 to $613.4m in 2015. FY 2015  
revenue rose 13% year-on-year on  
a pro-forma constant currency basis.
This progress, which was achieved  
in a relatively short period of time,  
has resulted in a considerably more 
diversified business. 
Market overview
Payments have been a feature of our lives in 
one form or another for centuries. But they 
have never changed as fast or as dramatically 
as they are changing today. Payments are 
moving online at a rapid pace, and across 
multiple devices. 
This trend is also driving new and alternative 
payment methods. Paysafe is benefiting from 
these trends, and is well placed with its unique, 
comprehensive and relevant suite of online and 
mobile-first payments solutions. We continue 
to believe that the Group is well positioned in 
markets and sectors that display high barriers 
to entry, owing to a complex network of 
participants and a requirement for robust 
technological infrastructure as well as 
regulatory licences and approvals, all  
of which are difficult to replicate.
At the heart of today’s payments business 
requirements is the need for robust services 
that are seamless and secure for merchants 
and their consumers. Merchants face a variety 
of challenges including the constant evolution 
of payment technologies, changing consumer 
behaviours, security and risk requirements, and 
a wide variety of currencies and languages.
Companies that provide relevant, simple  
and secure payments and are able to partner 
with businesses and consumers to make their 
lives easier when it comes to managing money 
on the move will be uniquely well placed to 
succeed in the global payments industry. 
Paysafe is among those companies – relevant 
at the point of every payment and a vital 
partner wherever and whenever a business or a 
consumer needs us, both now and in the future.

STRATEGIC REPORT
www.paysafe.com
13 Three divisions: Payment Processing,  
Digital Wallets and Prepaid
As part of the reorganisation of the Group following  
the acquisition of Skrill, our results are reported under 
three divisions: Payment Processing, Digital Wallets  
and Prepaid: 
 - Payment Processing comprises our core  
processing services as well as payolution,  
Acquiring and FANS Entertainment; 
 - Digital Wallets comprises the NETELLER and Skrill 
digital wallet services and Issuing (Card Solutions); and
 - Prepaid comprises paysafecard.
Payment Processing
Payment Processing provides a range of payment 
processing services to businesses, helping merchants 
accept a wide variety of traditional and alternative 
payment types. As well as working directly with merchants 
in niche verticals, we integrate software partners and 
value-added resellers who provide payment processing 
services to their own clients as well as third parties that 
resell our payment processing services. Throughout 2015, 
Payment Processing continued to improve its presence  
in existing and new markets. We work with our clients to 
manage their risks by using proprietary technology and 
sophisticated risk and fraud management tools to help 
merchants process payments securely across multiple 
currencies and languages.
Payment Processing is the largest of the three Group 
divisions by revenue contribution, generating $375.1m  
in reported revenue in 2015, a 37% increase on FY 2014’s 
$274.7m. On a pro-forma constant currency basis, revenue 
grew 16% year-on-year. The reported revenue uplift was 
supported by the July 2014 acquisition of California-based 
payment processor Meritus Payment Solutions and 
US-based online payment company GMA. The integration 
of these businesses was completed during 2015.
Payment Processing includes payolution, Acquiring  
and FANS Entertainment;
 - payolution, with operations in central Europe, enables 
merchants to provide their customers with the ability to 
buy online and then pay later after receipt of the goods 
or via a payment plan. It provides services to a growing 
portfolio of merchants.
 - Acquiring is a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) 
regulated business that launched at the end of 2014. 
Paysafe has principal membership of MasterCard 
Europe and Visa Europe for Acquiring. This allows  
the Group to provide merchants’ accounts directly.
 - FANS Entertainment, which Paysafe acquired in May 
2015, is a mobile e-commerce platform developer and 
integrator. Through this business, Paysafe is working  
to offer innovative value-added mobile services to its 
merchants and clients across the industries that the 
Group serves.
Digital Wallets
The Group’s Digital Wallets division enables consumers  
to make instant and secure guaranteed payments over 
the internet to businesses in a wide variety of sectors  
and to transfer money to family and friends. Our flagship 
NETELLER and Skrill digital wallets provide merchants 
with more than 100 payment options via one simple 
integration in more than 40 different currencies and 18 
languages. Our services include chargeback protection, 
VIP affiliate and loyalty programmes for merchants and 
marketing tools to help them attract, maintain and build 
their customer base. For consumers, Paysafe’s digital 
wallets enable them to send and receive money  
quickly, securely and easily in real time.
In 2015, Paysafe’s Digital Wallet business had reported 
revenue of $159.1m, 78% higher than 2014’s $89.6m, 
driven by the Skrill acquisition. On a pro-forma constant 
currency basis, Digital Wallets saw 17% year-on-year 
revenue growth.
New capabilities delivered in 2015 included: enabling new 
currency payments in Africa, Latin America and Eastern 
Europe; the acceptance of new payment options and 
alternative payment methods including Bitcoin; and 
enabling enhanced credit card transaction management, 
data insights, risk controls and chargeback services 
for merchants.
The Digital Wallets division includes Issuing  
(Card Solutions). Paysafe is a Principal Member of 
MasterCard and authorised by the FCA to issue e-money  
in the European Economic Area. Through this service, 
businesses can bring prepaid payment solutions to 
market more rapidly, efficiently and cost-effectively –  
whether it’s a white-label prepaid card programme  
or a turnkey solution. In February 2016, the Group 
announced a partnership with Payfriendz to provide 
payment processing, acquiring and card solutions  
for its own person-to-person social payments app, 
demonstrating the cross-sell opportunities between 
Paysafe’s Issuing and Payment Processing capabilities.
Prepaid
Paysafe Prepaid comprises the Group’s paysafecard 
business, which was acquired by Skrill in 2013. From  
its base in Austria, the provider of cash vouchers enables 
consumers to convert cash into digital currency and pay 
online quickly, easily and safely.
On 31 March 2015, and prior to the completion of the 
acquisition of Skrill by the Group, Skrill itself completed 
the acquisition of Ukash, an international UK-based 
provider of cash vouchers. Ukash provided a similar 
product offering to paysafecard and its largest market  
was the UK. Ukash was fully integrated within the 
paysafecard business during the year with the  
distribution of new Ukash vouchers and  
prepaid cards ending on 31 August 2015.
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Prepaid’s reported revenue in 2015 was $76.4m.  
On a pro-forma constant currency basis, Prepaid  
grew revenue by 5% year-on-year.
The number of paysafecard users has grown  
significantly to more than 2.5m active users per  
month. By the end of 2015, paysafecard was being used  
by consumers in 42 countries, across 24 languages and  
23 currencies. During the year, paysafecard expanded  
into new markets including New Zealand, Kuwait and 
Saudi Arabia. The product’s multi-market reach is 
underpinned by a distribution network that surpassed 
more than 500,000 outlets in 2015. This growing 
distribution network includes retailers, kiosks, petrol 
stations, post offices and convenience stores. 
Brands such as Spotify, Deutsche Telekom and Ubisoft 
provide paysafecard payment options while distribution

PlayStation®Store and PlayStation®4 games platform  
as a payment method, demonstrating the division’s 
continued channel development and diversification. 
Strategy
The scale and worldwide market presence of our  
enlarged Group enables us to capitalise on opportunities 
for cross-selling, with an ongoing emphasis on online 
payment products and an increasing focus on mobile-
centric payments services. Our strategy to realise our 
vision of being the point of every payment centres  
on a number of activities. 
 - Product development, both ensuring all our products 
and services are optimised for mobile and making it 
easier for our merchants to access all of our products 
and services. 
 - Investing in channel development, diversification into 
new verticals and geographic expansion to ensure our 
divisions can stay ahead of changing customer 
requirements and trends in their markets. 
 - Continuing to invest in building world-class technology, 
product, risk and compliance capabilities.
 - While our core businesses will be key drivers of  
the growth we are targeting, we continue to identify  
and pursue new opportunities that we believe provide  
the right fit for our payments business with attractive 
future growth potential, particularly in areas such  
as remittances, acquiring and e-invoicing  
and e-instalments.
Our key focus in 2016 is delivering on the opportunities 
arising from the integration of Skrill. Looking past the 
completion of that integration, we will continue to  
pursue accretive acquisitions that make strategic sense.
Awards
During the year, our team around the world was proud  
to have been recognised internationally for our ongoing 
innovations in pay-before, pay-now and pay-later 
products and services. During 2015 the Group’s 
awards included:
 - Deal of the Year at the UK Tech Awards.
 - Transaction of the Year at the UK AIM Awards.
 - Best Payments Company at the EGR North  
America Awards.

Payment Solution for its NETELLER and NETBANX 
services at the CNP Awards.
Post-year end developments
On 16 February 2016, we acquired substantially all  
of the assets of MeritCard Solutions LP for an initial  
cash consideration of $16m plus up to a further $4m  
cash consideration subject to the achievement of  
certain financial performance targets over two years.  
The acquisition of the Dallas-based business broadens 
and deepens our sales capabilities and partner 
relationships in payment processing in the US. 
The company specialises in building relationships with 
small to medium-sized independent sales organisations, 
sales and bank agents as well as third-party vendors. 
MeritCard also works as a wholesale independent sales 
operator and counts Wells Fargo Bank, Deutsche Bank 
and Merrick Bank among its leading partners alongside 
TSYS. MeritCard will continue to operate under the 
MeritCard brand within Paysafe’s Payment 
Processing division.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the positive momentum  
we’ve shown in delivering our results slightly ahead of 
expectations in FY 2015 has continued into the early part 
of this financial year. I am very excited about our prospects 
and opportunities in the year ahead.

STRATEGIC REPORT

15 Market overview
The payments industry is undergoing significant change 
and disruption, as the lines between online and offline 
payments continue to blur. As internet access becomes 
ubiquitous in developed and emerging markets due to  
the proliferation of smartphones and tablets and 3G and 
4G services, new and alternative forms of payments, 
including digital wallets, remittances and online credit, are 
rapidly emerging. This is taking place amid a continuing 
shift to e-commerce by consumers around the world. 
Retail e-commerce, for example, represented around  
7% of total sales worldwide in 2015, however this is 
forecast by eMarketer
1
 to expand to 12.8% by 2019. 
Merchants and consumers are demanding ever increasing 
security combined with products and solutions tailored  
to their evolving payment needs. As a result, to remain 
successful, companies must move from a ‘one size fits all’ 
approach to offering differentiated solutions and adapt to 
reflect the evolving needs of merchants and consumers. 
Such a dynamic requires a deep understanding of 
consumers and merchants in each segment, and  
the agility to develop and scale new services to take 
advantage of growth in various verticals. For example, 
until recently, remittances were dominated by a small 
number of players with corner shop franchise outlets.  
Now the industry is being transformed by digital payments 
and the ubiquity of mobile phones. As the World Bank 
referenced in its Migration and Remittances Factbook 
2016, remittances provide a lifeline for millions of 
households in developing countries, with international 
migrants estimated to have sent $601bn
2 
to their families 
in their home countries in 2015. Similarly, online gambling 
and associated payments potential continues to grow, 
with estimates ranging between 5 and 10% CAGR 
year-on-year growth for the segment.
Paysafe is well placed to take advantage of such trends, 
with deep sector expertise, relevant, comprehensive 
alternative and traditional online and mobile payment 
solutions, best-in-class technology, strong brands, and 
broad geographical reach. The Group has the insight, 
capability and scale to be the partner of choice for 
consumers and merchants worldwide. 
A shifting payments landscape
Amid rapid advances in online and mobile offerings,  
the payments industry also faces challenges. 
The threat of security and data breaches continues  
to increase in scope and scale. Only companies able  
to respond in an agile way to demands for enhanced 
security, compliance and fraud prevention will be able  
to reap the benefits of the sector’s growth. 
The speed and scope of regulatory change continues to 
increase, and this will influence the shape of the sector. 
For example, enhanced due diligence, anti-money 
laundering and other processes are now a pre-requisite. 
Payment providers need to differentiate through fraud 
and risk management tools, and compliance expertise.
Market dynamics also play a role. For example, a  
change in spending patterns of consumers in one  
market such as China may affect the payments  
industry in other geographies.
The broader industry remains highly fragmented in terms 
of product and geography, with the historical dominance 
of major banks and bank-owned networks reducing.
Paysafe actively invests to address such challenges,  
for example through a programme of continued 
technology investment alongside enhancing areas  
such as compliance and information security. In addition, 
following the acquisition of Skrill, Paysafe is now more 
global and diversified, reducing exposure to any one 
market or segment.

STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Building a quality 
global business
I am pleased to present the consolidated Group results for the year 
ended 31 December 2015, incorporating the results of Skrill from 
acquisition on 10 August 2015. As I set out in last year’s report, my 
focus has been and will continue to be on generating controlled, 
sustainable and profitable growth across the business. 
With the acquisition of Skrill, our move to the Main Market 
of the London Stock Exchange on 23 December 2015 and 
the announcement of our inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index, 
Paysafe is now a business of significant scale and product 
and service diversity.
Reflecting the acquisition of Skrill and associated  
costs we reported a statutory profit after tax of $7.4m 
(2014: $57.7m) and basic earnings per share of $0.02  
(2014: $0.21
1
).
Adjusted EBITDA
2
 increased 77% to $152.6m  
(2014: $86.1m).
Group revenue and gross profit
We are committed to providing the information  
investors and other stakeholders need in order to evaluate 
the performance of our Group. At our H1 2015 results, we 
significantly improved our cash flow and balance sheet 
disclosures, added organic growth by division disclosures 
and provided further half-on-half geographic information.
Building on this commitment, we have now enhanced  
our disclosures around transaction volume. In addition, 
we are disclosing pro-forma gambling and gaming-based 
revenue as a percentage of pro-forma fee revenue for H2 
2015. This is the first period in which we are disclosing this 
information. In addition, to provide a more transparent 
analysis of the ongoing performance of the Group 
following our acquisitions, we have included revenue 
commentary on a “pro-forma constant currency” basis. 
This measure is unaudited, and is stated on an adjusted 
basis as if we had owned all acquisitions throughout the 
comparative periods (“pro-forma”). It is also calculated by 
applying prior period foreign exchange rates to current 
period amounts (“constant currency”). 
During the year, reported revenue increased by  
68% to $613.4m (2014: $365.0m). H2 2015 reported 
revenue at $390.4m was 90% higher than the prior year  
(2014: $205.9m), and grew 75% half-on-half reflecting 
consolidation of Skrill’s results from 10 August 2015.
On a pro-forma constant currency basis, FY 2015 revenue 
increased 13% year-on-year (2014: 18%). We are pleased 
with performance in all divisions, despite the impact of 
capital controls in Greece and the expected reduction  
in revenue and volumes on a pro-forma basis in our 
acquired Ukash business. 
Group FY 2015 reported fee revenue
3
 by geography shows 
revenue from Asia and the rest of the world (outside of 
Europe and North America) reducing to 31% in FY 2015 
from 52% in FY 2014.
On a pro-forma basis, the Group earned 44% of its H2  
2015 fee revenue
3
 from online gambling verticals, and  
10% from online gaming. The rest of the Group’s fee 
revenue derives largely from other e-commerce  
verticals and consumer fees.

Financial highlights
The Group reports in US dollars. Following the acquisition 
of Skrill, approximately 30% of pro-forma H2 2015 fee 
revenue
3
 is denominated in Euros, approximately 40%  
in US dollars and approximately 5% in British pounds. 
Investment income of $2.8m in 2015 (2014: $0.7m) was 
derived from interest earned on cash held by the Group  
on behalf of merchants and members. The significant 
increase in 2015 relates to investment income from  
the Skrill wallet.
FY 2015 reported gross profit was $296.5m (2014: 
$177.7m
4
), while gross margin dropped by 40 basis  
points to 48.3% (2014: 48.7%). The decrease in gross 
margin reflects lower margins in the Payment Processing 
division driven by business mix. This is partially offset by 
the shift in revenue mix towards the higher margin Digital 
Wallets and Prepaid divisions on the acquisition of Skrill.
Divisional revenue and gross profit
Payment Processing
Our Payment Processing division performed strongly,  
with reported revenue increasing 37% from $274.7m in  
FY 2014 to $375.1m in FY 2015, driven by the impact of  
the Meritus and GMA acquisitions in H2 2014.
On a pro-forma constant currency basis, revenue  
grew 16% year-on-year. Excluding major merchant Asia 
Gateway revenue, Payment Processing revenue grew  
29% on a pro-forma constant currency basis.
Pro-forma US dollar volume for Payment Processing 
increased to $17.2bn (2014: $16.6bn). Volume represents 
all transactions including fee generating credits and 
chargebacks processed by the division. It excludes volume 
processed for other Group divisions. Pro-forma revenue 
represented 2.2% of volume (2014: 2.0%), the increase 
driven by net growth of higher fee businesses, and by a 
shift from lower fee gateway to higher fee bureau services. 
Reported divisional gross margins were 36.9% in FY 2015 
(2014: 40.9%), reflecting the reducing proportion of 
revenue from our largest merchant and the increased 
impact of our 2014 US acquisitions.
Digital Wallets
Reported Digital Wallets revenue increased 78% from 
$89.6m in FY 2014 to $159.1m in FY 2015, driven by  
the Skrill acquisition. 
On a pro-forma constant currency basis, the Digital 
Wallets division saw 17% year-on-year revenue growth. 
Digital Wallets pro-forma US dollar volume rose to $19.9bn 
(2014: $18.8bn). Wallets volume includes uploads and 
withdrawals to and from wallets, and member-merchant 
and member-member transactions. As with reported 
revenue, growth was impacted by US dollar strength 
compared to other trading currencies, especially the  
Euro. Pro-forma revenue divided by volume was stable  
at 1.2% (2014: 1.2%).
1. In accordance with IFRS, basic and diluted earnings per share for the comparative period 
have been re-presented to reflect the impact of the rights issue in May 2015.
2. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as results of operating activities before depreciation and 
amortisation and adjusted for exceptional non-recurring items which are defined as items 
of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence that, in the view of management, 
should be disclosed to explain the performance of the Group. See reconciliation table  
on page 20.
3. Investment income of $2.8m (2014: $0.7m) is not included in fee revenue.
4. Prior year cost of sales, gross profit and operating costs have been re-presented within  
the Digital Wallets division to align presentation of these costs following the acquisition  
of Skrill. There was no impact to adjusted EBITDA from this re-presentation.
STRATEGIC REPORT
www.paysafe.com
19 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Digital Wallets gross margin was 72.9% in FY 2015 (2014: 
72.0%). Following the acquisition of Skrill, accounting 
policies have been aligned, and cost of sales has been 
re-presented for the historic NETELLER business to 
include various direct costs, including costs of loyalty,  
VIP and commission programmes. Reported gross profit 
for Digital Wallets for FY 2014 was $64.5m (72.0% margin), 
re-presented from $76.0m (84.8% margin). 
Following the acquisition of Skrill, reported bad debt as  
a percentage of revenue has increased from 1.9% in FY 
2014 to 3.3% in FY 2015. Action is being taken to leverage 
NETELLER policies to reduce bad debt levels on the Skrill 
wallet going forward. Offsetting this effect, other variable 
costs of sales have decreased slightly to 23.8% of sales 
(2014: 26.0%).
Prepaid
The Prepaid division, comprising our paysafecard 
business which was acquired with Skrill, contributed 
$76.4m of reported revenue in FY 2015.
On a pro-forma constant currency basis, the Prepaid 
division grew revenue by 5% year-on-year driven by 
underlying growth in largely Euro-denominated volumes, 
partially offsetting the effect of the introduction of capital 
controls in Greece and the acquisition of Ukash and 
expected withdrawal from certain Ukash territories  
and services.
Prepaid volume on a pro-forma dollar basis was $2.7bn 
(2014: $2.9bn). Volume represents merchant transactions 
paid for with a prepaid voucher provided by the division. 
The US dollar decline in volume is partly driven by the 
dominant currency of the division being the Euro, which 
weakened c.16% compared to the US dollar in FY 2015. 
Pro-forma volume decline was also driven by the 
acquisition of Ukash which is discussed below. 
Prepaid pro-forma revenue in FY 2015 represented 7.5%  
of volume (2014: 7.7%). This higher percentage represents 
the division’s position as a channel for online merchant 
clients to new consumers who might not otherwise wish 
to, or be able to, transact online. 
As part of the acquisition of Skrill we acquired Ukash,  
a business which Skrill had purchased in March 2015.  
As part of the valuation of this business, we took into 
account our expected withdrawal from certain territories 
and services that were previously provided by Ukash. On a 
pro-forma basis, therefore, both volume and revenue have 
declined for the Ukash business. The Ukash business was 
fully and successfully integrated in H2 2015, and the  
brand was retired. 
Gross margin for the Prepaid division for the period 
following the acquisition of Skrill in August 2015 was 
51.3%. Pro-forma gross margins have remained steady 
year-on-year. Prepaid cost of sales primarily includes  
the costs of distribution of vouchers. 
Group adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA increased 77% to $152.6m (2014: $86.1m) 
reflecting the acquisition of Skrill, with the adjusted 
EBITDA margin increasing to 24.9% (2014: 23.6%) as  
the Group made a head start achieving synergy  
savings of approximately $10m in 2015.
A reconciliation of results from operating activities  
to adjusted EBITDA is shown below:
($ millions) 2015 2014
Results from operating activities 26.2 61.0
Foreign exchange loss 9.7 3.0
Acquisition, restructuring and other exceptional costs 37.7 11.6
Share-based payments 14.1 8.3
Fair value losses/(gains) on share consideration 
payable 13.6 (18.8)
Depreciation and amortisation 51.3 21.0
Adjusted EBITDA 152.6 86.1
Non-fee expenses
Operating expenses were $270.2m (2014
4
: $116.7m), the 
increase largely driven by the inclusion of the results of  
the Skrill business from 10 August 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA non-fee expenses
Excluding share-based payments and non-recurring 
items
5
, adjusted EBITDA operating expenses were 23%  
of sales, down from 25% of sales in FY 2014.
Salaries and employee expenses (excluding share-based 
payments) as a percentage of revenue were 12.3%,  
down from 12.7% in FY 2014, driven by the accelerated 
realisation of synergy benefits on the acquisition of Skrill.
We have a targeted investment programme in the 
business, in particular in relation to expansion into new 
territories and regulatory and security functions. During 
2015, this programme included investment in our global 
compliance and risk functions. Following the acquisition 
of Skrill, we continue to evolve our regulatory and security 
processes across the Group and expect to invest further  
in this area into 2016. 
We are continuing to invest in the Prepaid division’s 
expansion into new territories in FY 2016. For example,  
in H2 2015 the Prepaid division launched its core product 
in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
4.  Prior year cost of sales, gross profit and operating costs have been 
re-presented within the Digital Wallets division to align presentation  
of these costs following the acquisition of Skrill. There was no impact  
to adjusted EBITDA from this re-presentation. 
5. Non-recurring acquisition and restructuring costs, gains and losses  
on share consideration payable and forex.
20
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Share-based payments
Share-based payment expense grew 70% to $14.1m in  
FY 2015, 15.7% of total employee expenses (2014: 15.1%). 
This expense related to the Group’s L TIP and share options 
allocated to employees and management. Share-based 
payment awards for 2015 reflect a full year of impact  
from L TIPs awarded to senior management in H2 2014,  
as well as new L TIPs awarded in 2015 to support  
executive recruitment.
Exceptional expenses
A foreign exchange loss of $9.7m was incurred (2014: 
$3.0m), largely relating to currency fluctuations on the 
cash balances held by the Group. Balances in a number  
of currencies are held on deposit for members and 
merchants. These balances fluctuate due to members  
and merchants not always choosing to deposit and 
withdraw funds in the same source currency, and 
unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses also  
arise on translation of these amounts at reporting  
dates in entities with different functional currencies.
Acquisition costs of $29.4m (2014: $11.6m) and 
restructuring costs of $8.2m (2014: nil) related primarily to 
the acquisition and integration of Skrill. Skrill acquisition 
costs largely include professional fees, due diligence and 
assurance costs. Restructuring costs primarily relate to 
personnel and consultancy costs, including the cost  
of delivering headcount reductions. 
We also recognised an exceptional $13.6m net fair value 
loss on share consideration payable (2014: $18.8m gain) 
primarily due to the increase in share price over the year. 
This amount relates to the share consideration payable  
to the former owners of Meritus.
Depreciation, amortisation, net finance costs  
and tax
Depreciation and amortisation was $51.3m (2014: $21.0m) 
which included amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of $31.9m (2014: $9.2m). Amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets is excluded from our adjusted  
profit figures. 
Net finance costs were $14.4m (2014: $2.0m). This 
included $2.3m interest payable until August 2015 on  
debt raised in July 2014 to fund the acquisition of the  
US businesses. In August 2015, a new facility was drawn 
down in relation to the Skrill acquisition, which included  
a refinancing of the July 2014 debt facility. $7.8m of the  
FY 2015 charge relates to interest costs on the new debt 
facility. The remainder of the net finance charge includes 
amortisation of financing fees, fees on undrawn facilities 
and interest earned on cash held temporarily following 
the rights issue.
The tax charge for 2015 was $4.4m (2014: $1.3m), 
comprising a current tax charge of $6.8m offset by  
the unwinding of deferred tax liabilities of $2.4m. On an 
adjusted basis
6
, the tax charge was approximately $10.0m 
(2014: $4.2m), an adjusted tax rate of approximately 8.5% 
(2014: 5.8%).
Statutory profit after tax and other  
comprehensive income
Reflecting the impact of acquisition-related costs and 
foreign exchange, statutory profit after tax was $7.4m 
(2014: $57.7m). Adjusted profit after tax
6
 excluding the 
impact of one-off and acquisition-related items, was 
$108.7m (2014: $68.0m).
A debit of $1.4m (2014: credit of $0.9m) was recognised 
through other comprehensive income relating to 
translation differences on the results, assets and  
liabilities of non-US dollar denominated entities.
Earnings per share
Statutory basic earnings per share of $0.02 for FY 2015 
reflect the impact of acquisition, restructuring and 
exceptional charges (2014: $0.21). On a fully diluted basis, 
statutory earnings per share were $0.02 (2014: $0.19).
Due to the rights issue, recognised in May 2015, prior 
period basic and fully diluted earnings per share have 
been adjusted to take account of the bonus element  
of the rights issue.
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share were $0.26,  
18% higher than FY 2014. A reconciliation is shown  
in the table below.
The adjusted basic earnings per share is affected by the 
completion of the rights issue in May 2015, prior to the 
consolidation of the results of Skrill from 10 August 2015.

21 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED
Cash flow and cash position
Group cash and cash equivalents were $117.9m at  
31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: $109.9m).
In H1 2015, the reporting of cash and cash equivalents was 
adjusted to include two new line items on the balance 
sheet: settlement assets and cash held as reserves.  
The objective is to provide users of the accounts with  
a clearer view of the Group’s cash position and the  
impact of payments working capital cash flows. 
Free cash flow
7
 was $42.8m for FY 2015 (2014: $28.3m). 
Excluding payments working capital cash flows described 
more fully below, free cash flow was $84.7m (2014: 
$75.1m). Adjusted cash conversion before payments 
working capital as a percentage of adjusted EBIT  
was 92% in FY 2015, down from 102% in FY 2014.

Long term debt
The Group’s total long term debt position was $524.2m  
at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: $127.8m), 
including $0.4m of obligations under finance leases  
(31 December 2014: $0.8m). 
The long term debt position increased as at 10 August 
2015 to incorporate the credit facility of €500.0m secured 
to fund the acquisition of Skrill. As part of the debt raise, 
we received BB/BB+ company/instrument ratings. The 
Group’s original debt facility (of $150.0m) partially drawn 
down in H2 2014 to fund the US acquisitions was fully 
refinanced within this debt facility.
The new debt facility includes a €280m Term A loan which 
is repayable over five years, and bears interest at Euribor 
plus 3.00% margin reducing to 2.75% when adjusted 
leverage is less than or equal to 3.00:1. It also includes  
a €220m Term B loan bearing interest at Euribor plus 
4.00% margin reducing to 3.75% margin when adjusted 
leverage is less than or equal to 3.00:1. The Term B loan is 
repayable at the discretion of the Group without penalty 
before the maturity date of 10 August 2022. In November 
2015 the Group entered into an amortising interest rate 
swap for the whole of its Term A debt to hedge the risk  
of interest rates rising.
The first repayment of €14m on the Term A €280m credit 
facility was due and paid in February 2016.
The Group also has a revolving credit facility available  
of $85.0m. Letters of guarantee to the value of $8.7m are 
secured against this facility as fully described in note 13.
Covenants on the long term debt include net debt/EBITDA 
ratio and fixed charge cover. The Group was in full 
compliance with its debt covenants at 31 December 2015.
Net debt 
Reported net debt at 31 December 2015 was $431.3m.  
Net debt for the purposes of covenants is comparable  
to reported net debt. Reported net debt/pro-forma 
EBITDA was 2.1 times at 31 December 2015.
Goodwill
Goodwill of $974.8m and $3.4m was recognised on  
the acquisition of Skrill in August 2015 and FANS 
Entertainment Inc. in May 2015 respectively. No 
impairments were identified on these balances, or  
on the previously recognised goodwill largely relating  
to the acquisitions of Meritus and GMA in July 2014.
Intangible assets
The net book value of intangible assets at 31 December 
2015 was $369.9m (31 December 2014: $79.4m). During 
the year, $313.1m of additions related to intangibles 
acquired with Skrill and $7.7m related to intangible assets 
recognised on the acquisition of FANS. Management 
considered that the carrying value of these and historic 
acquired assets did not need to be impaired. 
7. Free cash flow is a non IFRS figure defined as operating cash flow after working capital 
movements, interest, tax and capital expenditure. In the consolidated statement of cash  
flows, working capital cash flow disclosure has been segmented to show movements relating  
to member and merchant cash which we refer to as payments working capital. Payments  
working capital represents cash flows that are not revenue or costs to the Group, constituted  
by movements in restricted cash balances, cash held as reserves, settlement assets and  
merchant processing liabilities.
8. Adjustment to exclude restructuring cost accrual movements from statutory working  
capital movement.
9. Adjusted cash conversion is measured as a percentage of adjusted EBIT . Adjusted free cash flow 
therefore excludes one-off items, interest costs, and tax.
10. Excludes deferred finance costs as set out in note 13.
22
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 During the period, the Group continued to incur 
development costs to add new functionality to the 
Group’s platforms, and capitalised $12.9m of internal 
costs excluding the impact of acquisitions. Capitalisation 
as a percentage of sales increased to 2.1% (2014: 1.5%), 
reflecting a higher percentage of re-investment in the 
combined Group.
Management has determined that no impairment is 
required in relation to capitalised development costs.
Current assets
Prepaid expenses and deposits increased to $14.6m  
at 31 December 2015 from $5.3m, and trade and other 
receivables were $31.2m (2014: $14.7m), largely driven  
by the acquisition of Skrill.
Acquisition-related liabilities
Share consideration payable in relation to the acquisition 
of Meritus decreased 2% to $56.0m as at 31 December 
2015, due to the payment of the first of four equal tranches 
in September 2015 partially offset by the impact of higher 
share prices and volatility on the year end fair value of the 
remaining liability. In addition, the total year end share 
consideration payable balance of $62.4m includes  
$6.4m payable in relation to the FANS acquisition.
Contingent consideration payable decreased to $2.1m 
from $5.0m at 31 December 2015. This reflected the cash 
payment of the entire $5.0m contingent consideration 
liability relating to the GMA acquisition, and the addition 
of a $2.1m share-based contingent consideration liability 
relating to the acquisition of FANS in May 2015.
In addition, deferred consideration of $3.3m relates  
to cash payable in relation to Skrill’s acquisition of  
Ukash in March 2015. 
Payments working capital items
Cash held as reserves represents the cash the Group is 
required to deposit with counterparties, which includes 
acquiring partners and card schemes, in order to transact 
with these institutions. 
Settlement assets represent gross transaction cash at 
third-party acquirers, banks and processors due to be  
paid to the Group en route to merchant clients or to  
fund digital wallets. 
Restricted cash balances are the excess of funds held in 
segregated accounts and certain liquid assets which the 
Group is required to maintain in respect of the e-money 
issued to members and merchants over the respective 
balances payable. 
Cash held as reserves, settlement assets and restricted 
cash balances have increased from 31 December 2014 
largely driven by the acquisition of Skrill.
Previously included in trade and other payables was  
a transient cash liability balance totalling $16.8m (2014: 
$30.6m). This item is now disclosed as a separate line on 
the balance sheet as merchant processing liabilities and 
represents gross transaction cash that has been received 
by the Group but not yet forwarded to the merchant. This 
amount reduced by 45% during the year, in part due to the 
right of offset becoming available for additional types of 
funds, which are now shown net of e-money within 
restricted cash.
Other liabilities
Trade and other payables increased to $88.2m from 
$39.1m largely related to the acquisition of Skrill.
During FY 2015, the income tax provision liability has 
increased from $4.8m to $11.1m, largely due to the 
recognition of the current tax charge. The opening  
and closing balances also include approximately  
$3.9m provided for an ongoing investigation in  
relation to Canadian withholding taxes, as more  
fully described in note 15.
Net deferred tax liabilities of $42.9m (2014: net asset of 
$0.8m) largely reflect deferred tax liabilities associated 
with intangible assets recognised on the acquisition  
of Skrill. 
Equity
Share capital and share premium increased during  
FY 2015 largely as a result of issuing 272,495,506 new 
Ordinary Shares by way of a rights issue and subsequent 
rump placing, raising approximately £436m ($660m)  
net proceeds to fund the Skrill acquisition in May 2015. 
See note 11 for further detail.
Ordinary shares were also issued during the  
year in relation to the Skrill and FANS acquisitions,  
deferred share-based consideration paid on the  
Meritus acquisition, and the exercise of various  
share-based long-term employee incentive options.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
Other than as disclosed in notes 13 and 26, as at  
31 December 2015 the Group had no other off-balance 
sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely  
to have, a current or future material effect on the 
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, 
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

23 RISK MANAGEMENT
Combining experience  
and expertise
Managing risk in our business 
Effective risk management is critical to achieving  
the Group’s objectives. The Directors have carried out  
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the  
Group and pulled them together into an Enterprise Risk 
Management framework which prioritises the risks and 
assigns responsibility to an executive for monitoring and 
risk mitigation. The Paysafe Group appointed Raymond 
Chabot Grant Thornton to help with that process.
The Group has a comprehensive system of controls  
in place to manage the risks comprising the Enterprise 
Risk Management framework through a combination of a 
“top down” approach (driven by the Audit Committee and 
the Board) and a “bottom up” process (originating from 
operations). Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton undertakes 
regular reviews across the Group’s operations to assess 
the controls that are in place to mitigate the risks we face. 
The Group’s Internal Audit function, which works under 
the direction of the Audit Committee, complements  
the audit work undertaken by Raymond Chabot  
Grant Thornton.
The Group also has a number of committees to help deal 
with the risks facing the Group. The Risk Management 
Committee comprises a number of senior executives 
including the Chief Operating Officer, the General Counsel 
and Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Risk Officer, 
and is tasked with evaluating ongoing issues which might 
constitute risks to the Group and ensuring that mitigating 
action is being taken where appropriate. The CyberCrime 
and Data Privacy Committee also comprises a number of 
senior executives, including the Chief Information Officer, 
the Chief Technology Officer and the Group Data Privacy 
Officer, and is tasked with evaluating the risks and 
overseeing the actions relating to the prevention  
of cybercrime and protection of data. 
Responsibility
The Board has oversight responsibility for the effective 
management of all major risks affecting the Group. In each 
area, the Board is supported by members of the executive 
management team and other managers with key 
functional responsibilities.
Appropriate policies and internal controls
A system of internal controls supports risk management 
across the Group and the application and consistency  
of these controls is reviewed by the Group’s Internal  
Audit function. Further details of this are included in  
the Report of the Audit Committee on pages 39 to 43.

How we rank our risks
The Group’s principal risks
1. Cyber security
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The IT environments of the Group may be subject to hacking, data theft or 
other cyber security threats which may harm customer relationships and 
the market perception of the effectiveness and resilience of the Group’s 
products and services. Such an attack may also have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial condition.
 - Ensuring the Group has the systems in place to  
defend against potential cyber security threats.
 - Building resilience within the network environment  
to mitigate the impact of an attack in the event of  
a successful penetration.
2. Data privacy
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group processes personal data, some of which may be sensitive. 
Failure to adhere to the terms of its privacy policy, customer expectations 
or the law may subject the Group to investigative or enforcement  
action by regulatory authorities which may cause legal claims and 
reputational damage and have a material adverse effect on the  
Group’s financial condition.
 - Ensuring that the Group has appropriate policies  
in place with regards to the treatment of sensitive 
personal information and that those policies are 
being adhered to.
STRATEGIC REPORT

25 RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
3. Outsourcing risk
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group relies on the services of an outsourced service provider to 
provide services to its largest merchant, which is licensed and located in 
Europe, in relation to its activities in China. If the service provider ceases to 
provide services to the Group for any reason, the Group may be adversely 
affected if the Directors were unable to find another service provider that 
was capable of replicating the services which the Group receives.
 - Building and maintaining a close relationship with  
the outsourced service provider.
 - Reducing dependency on largest merchant.
4. Loss of a major customer
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
Loss of one or more major customers of the Group could result in  
a material loss of revenue and profit for the Group. 
The Group derived 23% of its reported revenue in FY 2015 from  
one customer.
 - Developing a diversified customer portfolio,  
both geographically and by industry sector.
 - Building and maintaining close relationships with 
customers to determine and adapt to their current 
needs, providing the solutions and flexibility that  
they require.
 - Dedicated account management for major customers.
5. Security, fraud and money laundering
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group is focused on providing trusted services to consumers and 
merchants and ensuring that data and confidential information are 
transmitted and stored securely. Ensuring compliance with money 
laundering, proceeds of crime, customer data security and Payment Card 
Industry regulations requires significant capital expenditure and changes 
in those regulations may have a material impact on the way in which  
a product or service is made available to customers. Any such change  
may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition.
As an online business with little or no face-to-face contact with its 
customers, the Group faces the possibility of regulatory sanction and 
reputational damage if there was a serious case of a customer using the 
Group’s services to carry out money laundering or terrorist financing.
 - Operating a number of automated monitoring  
tools and response procedures to identify and  
react to threats.
 - Diversifying the range of services available to 
customers to mitigate the impact of any single 
regulatory change.
 - Attracting staff that have the relevant expertise to  
help the Group manage its regulatory obligations  
and evolving risks.
 - Continuing to invest in solutions that improve  
the Group’s ability to manage credit risk, fraud and 
prevent money laundering and terrorist financing  
and ensure compliance with regulations in the  
most cost-effective and appropriate manner.
6. Transaction processing
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group relies on the ongoing availability and uninterrupted operation 
of transaction processing systems and services within and outside of the 
Group. All operational systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption 
from targeted denial of service attacks, viruses, natural or man-made 
disasters and human or technological failures under a variety of scenarios.
 - Providing disaster recovery and business  
continuity capability to enable resumption of  
services to merchants and consumers as quickly  
and as conveniently as possible with minimal  
disruption and loss of business.
26
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 7. Product innovation
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, 
functionality and features of its products and services and the underlying 
network infrastructure. The internet and e-commerce industries are 
characterised by rapid technological change, changes in user 
requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service 
introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence  
of new industry standards and practices that could render our  
technology and systems obsolete.
 - Developing the Group’s capability to internally 
develop, acquire, partner or license leading 
technologies to enhance existing products  
and services and also to develop new  
products and services.
 - Continuing to address the increasingly sophisticated 
and varied needs of the Group’s merchants, and 
responding to technological advances and emerging 
industry standards and practices on a cost-effective 
and timely basis.
8. Relationships with financial institutions
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The nature of the Group’s business requires it to enter into numerous 
commercial and contractual relationships with banks, card schemes, 
issuers and other financial institutions. The Group depends on these 
relationships to operate on a day-to-day basis. If, for any reason, any 
banks, payment card schemes, issuers or financial institutions cease to 
supply the Group with the services it requires to conduct its business it 
could impact the Group’s ability to provide its digital payment services.
 - Maintaining strong relationships with  
financial institution partners.
 - Continuing to seek new financial institution  
partners to help build latency into the network.
9. Acquisitions and partnerships
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
Acquisitions and partnerships can play a key role in the Group’s strategy 
and the failure to integrate and operate acquired businesses and/or 
partnerships represents a commercial risk to the business.
 - Managing corporate activity through a  
structured acquisition and integration  
process using multifunctional teams  
and major programme specialists.
10. Attracting and retaining the best talent
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key 
management to drive the business’ development and respond to  
the challenges and opportunities it faces.
 - Developing the skills and capabilities of  
identified staff as part of talent management.
 - Creating opportunities within the Group for  
personal development and career enhancement.
STRATEGIC REPORT
www.paysafe.com
27 RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
11. Changes in online gambling regulation
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group relies on the continued supply of its services to merchants 
within the online gambling industry and has a material indirect 
dependency on the Chinese online gambling market.
Many countries have introduced licensing regimes which has led  
to greater regulatory oversight and scrutiny for many of the Group’s 
customers. In some cases, a lack of clarity in the regulations or conflicting 
legislative and regulatory developments mean that the Group’s customers 
may risk failing to obtain an appropriate licence, having existing licences 
adversely affected, or the Group or its customers may be subject to 
actions (criminal or civil) which could have a material adverse effect  
on the Group’s business and financial performance.
Changes in the applicable regulatory regime or the way in which a  
regime is enforced in an important jurisdiction could also have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance in that jurisdiction.
 - Understanding the specific risks related to operations 
and potential ways to mitigate those risks, while 
maintaining continuous monitoring to ensure that  
the Group remains aware of, and can react to, market 
developments which might impact its business.
 - Providing dedicated management (including legal 
and compliance) to monitor and comprehend 
emerging regulatory requirements and lead 
implementation of appropriate strategies.
 - Utilising external expertise to guide  
strategy formulation.
12. Failure of a major customer
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The business failure of a merchant of the Payment Processing division 
might result in chargebacks from the merchant being passed on to the 
Company which could have a materially adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial condition.
 - Ensuring that the Group holds the appropriate rolling 
reserves and collateral/security and insures against 
the risk in certain circumstances where appropriate 
and available.
 - Assessment of the financial risk before accepting  
the merchant as a customer and regular ongoing 
review of the merchant’s performance and general 
financial health.
 - Reacting quickly to any marked changes in behaviour 
including transaction patterns, cashflows and/or 
chargeback levels.
13. Changes in the online gambling industry
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group relies on the continued supply of its services to merchants 
within the online gambling industry. If such merchants are subject to 
heavier taxes, compliance costs, levies or licence fees or are forced to 
cease operating in a jurisdiction as a result of prohibitive legislation  
it may result in reduced demand for the services of the Group within  
the online gambling industry.
 - Ensuring that the Group builds on the international 
diversification of its merchant base to reduce the 
likelihood of changes in one jurisdiction having  
a material impact on the Group.
 - Increasing the supply of the Group’s services to 
merchants outside of the online gambling industry.
28
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group to continue in operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due. The assessment was undertaken taking into 
account the Group’s current financial position and the potential 
impact of the principal risks documented in the Strategic Report.
The Directors determined that an appropriate period of 
assessment should be the five years ending 31 December 2020, 
being the financial period over which the Group is scheduled to 
make all of the capital repayments on its €280m Term A loan.
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm that they have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2020.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a  
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The assessments carried out 
included a number of stress tests and a reverse stress test, to 
evaluate the impact of the most severe yet plausible adverse 
scenarios the Group could foreseeably experience. Of the 
assessments carried out, key scenarios included:
 - an assessment of the financial impact of an immediate  
and complete loss of all revenue from the Group’s largest 
merchant; and 
 - an assessment of the financial impact for the Group of  
a data breach in one of its three divisions.
The reverse stress test allowed the Directors to assess  
the scenarios and circumstances that would render the  
business model unviable, thereby identifying potential  
business vulnerabilities and ensuring the development  
of possible mitigating actions.
The Directors’ assessment placed particular emphasis on  
the Group’s ability to meet its interest and loan repayment 
obligations throughout the five-year period of assessment,  
after meeting all other liabilities falling due, while also meeting  
all covenants required by the Term Loans. Prudent assumptions 
regarding growth rates and ability to cut costs were applied to  
all tests performed. 
Although the Group’s €220m Term B loan falls due beyond the 
five-year period of assessment, the testing performed also gives 
the Directors a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to repay the loan when it falls due in full on 10 August 2022, 
or can reasonably expect to be able to refinance that borrowing.
14. Competitive environment
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group operates in rapidly evolving payments markets, where service 
provision is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological 
change. The Group faces competition from non-traditional participants  
as well as established payment processors.
Certain competitors have longer operating histories, greater financial, 
technical, marketing and other resources to bring to bear.
 - Investing in new products, markets and  
payment types.
 - Improving relationships with key merchants  
and consumers.
15. Daily fantasy sports
Description of risk: Examples of mitigating activities include: Change in level of risk
The Group provides services to daily fantasy sports (“DFS”) merchants in 
the US. With the uncertainty of the legal status of DFS in various US states 
it is possible that a US state or federal governmental authority might 
impose penalties or seek other recourse against the Group.
The daily fantasy sports vertical generates an immaterial portion of  
Group revenue.
 - Continuing to closely monitor industry related  
legal and legislative developments.
 - Limiting the extent of the Group’s operations  
with respect to DFS merchants where it is formally 
determined in court or by additional US state 
legislatures or regulatory agencies that DFS requires 
licensing or is otherwise considered unlawful.

29 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Underpinning our culture
At Paysafe Group, our approach to engaging with 
our customers, our employees, the industries we 
serve and the broader communities where we do 
business underpins our culture. 
We are undertaking a review of the Group’s 
Corporate Social Responsibility policies with a 
view to integrating those policies across the whole 
of the business and ensuring all of our stakeholder 
interests are taken into consideration. 
Customers 
The Group’s approach to its customers is a key strength  
of the business. In attracting customers, the aim is to win 
and retain their trust and loyalty. The Group is always 
aware of the risks associated with the transfer of money 
online and its policies and procedures are designed to 
minimise the risks to customers and to gain their trust. 
This approach is underpinned by a robust identity 
verification system and corresponding ability to “know 
your customer” . This applies to both merchants and 
consumers. Where appropriate, Group procedures 
validate an individual’s identity and thereafter determine 
what products or services are appropriate for that 
member. A similarly rigorous process applies to  
the acceptance of the Group’s merchants. 
Employees 
The Board is of the view that the Group’s continuing 
success, and in particular its ability to meet the frequent 
and varied challenges it faces, is supported by the quality 
and commitment of its workforce. The Group’s employee 
management priorities, including its remuneration 
strategies, are based on recruiting and retaining  
the best people in the industry and on encouraging  
working practices that improve productivity, reduce  
costs, develop talent and give job satisfaction. 
The Group is committed to developing ongoing 
communication with all of its employees. This is achieved 
through regular employee meetings, briefings and written 
news briefings which are distributed electronically.  
In addition, we regularly survey employee opinions  
on work-life satisfaction and have initiated a Paysafe 
Ambassadors programme in which a representative  
group of employees have been nominated to help 
promote the Group’s values to the rest of our staff.
The Directors’ remuneration policy on pages 47 to 59 
refers to the Group’s all-employee share plans which  
were set up to encourage share ownership amongst  
the Group’s employees.
Equality and diversity
The Group is committed to a policy of equal opportunity 
in matters relating to employment, training and career 
development of employees, and is opposed to any form 
of less favourable treatment based on age, disability, sex, 
marital status, sexual orientation, nationality, race or 
religion. The Group also has a Whistleblowing policy. 
The split of staff by gender as at 31 December 2015 was  
as shown below:

The Nomination Committee report on page 38 details  
the Board’s current actions to achieve gender diversity  
at a Director level.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment from disabled persons, having regard  
to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Appropriate 
arrangements are made for the continued employment 
and training, career development and promotion of 
disabled persons employed by the Group. If members  
of staff become disabled, the Group aims to continue  
their employment, either in the same, or an alternative, 
position, with appropriate retraining being given  
if necessary.
Human rights issues
While the Group has no specific policy in place regarding 
human rights, we have an equal opportunities and a  
Code of Ethics policy that governs how all employees, 
officers, consultants, contractors, volunteers, interns, 
casual workers and agency workers are treated. We 
remain mindful of the spirit of any regulation when 
conducting our business.
Trade organisations and industry awareness 
As a registered online payments service provider, 
facilitating global payments for our merchants and 
customers, our business is built on trust. That’s why  
we comply with the highest industry standards. 
As part of that compliance regime, the Paysafe Group  
is proud to be licensed or accredited by, or belong to,  
the following regulatory and industry organisations:

Environment and community
Whilst we are a low impact company compared to many 
corporations due to the online nature of our services, we 
are committed to minimising our environmental impact. 
We endeavour to do this in our offices by deploying 
high-efficiency servers and ensuring computer and 
electrical equipment is switched off when not in use. 
The Group’s Annual Report is printed on FSC certified 
paper. We encourage our shareholders to opt in for 
electronic communications, to avoid unnecessary  
printing and distribution, in particular for our Annual 
Report. Any shareholder wishing to help us in these efforts 
should visit our shareholder portal at www.paysafe.com/
investors-and-shareholder-services/shareholder-portal/ 
where they can express their preferences for  
mailing information. 
We did not measure our carbon dioxide emissions in  
2015 so have not included information on them in this 
Annual Report. We intend to report on our emissions in 
next year’s Annual Report following our first full year of 
listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
Empowering people and  
communities around the globe 
As an employer with offices in many countries, we seek  
to support communities in some of the places where we 
have operations by supporting local charities in those 
regions. We aim to match charitable fundraising by 
individual employees. 
 - During 2015, the Group contributed $92,882  
(2014: $105,842) to directly support charitable  
causes and continued to encourage employees  
to participate in charitable endeavours. 
 - The Group provides support to an Austrian start-up 
business “Medien und Generationen” (Media and 
Generations) which aims to help groups which are not 
familiar with the internet, smartphones and new media. 
The Group’s support includes the provision of advice on 
how to establish a new business, drawing from the 
experiences of building the paysafecard business.
 - The Group contributed £10,000 to Manx Miracles,  
the providers of a state-of-the-art sensory facility for 
children on the Isle of Man. The donations went towards 
additional equipment, training and providing help to 
families. The Group’s staff have also offered to give their 
time to help the charity and we are looking forward  
to working closely with Manx Miracles in the future.
 - In 2015, employees at Meritus continued their  
support of the Families Forward initiative which  
helps local families in crisis in Orange County with 
services that include career coaching, life skills 
education and food assistance. Meals were also 
donated to the organisation Stand Up for Kids,  
which helps homeless children to stabilise and  
improve their lives.

STRATEGIC REPORT
www.paysafe.com
31 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 
Committed to transparent 
and ethical business practice
Dear Shareholders,
The past year has been truly transformational for Paysafe.
 - We acquired the Skrill Group (“Skrill”) in August 2015.
 - We acquired FANS Entertainment Inc. in May 2015.
 - We raised £463 million in a rights issue completed  
in May 2015.
 - We moved from AIM to a Premium Listing on the London 
Stock Exchange in December 2015.
 - We produced two prospectuses and underwent two external 
reviews by our Auditor, acting as reporting accountant, in 
connection with the rights issue and the move to a Premium 
Listing respectively, which required a high level of scrutiny 
by the Company’s lawyers, banks and Auditor, as well as  
the Board.
In such an active year, good corporate governance  
has been particularly important. Whilst we only  
became subject to the UK Corporate Governance  
Code (the “Code”) on the completion of our Premium 
Listing, we had already voluntarily adopted many 
provisions of the Code prior to the start of the year.  
For example, during 2015:
1. the majority of our Board comprised Independent 
Non-Executive Directors;
2. our Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees were constituted solely of Independent 
Non-Executive Directors with, in the case of the 
Nomination Committee, me, the Non-Executive 
Chairman, as an additional member;
3. we put our 2014 Directors’ remuneration report to a 
shareholder vote at our Annual General Meeting; and
4. all Directors were subject to re-appointment by  
a shareholder vote at our Annual General Meeting.
This voluntary compliance reflects the importance  
and value that we place on good corporate governance.  
It provided the structure for, and helped guide, the Board in 
the many important decisions that we took during the year.
Our move to a Premium Listing has enabled us to build on 
this pre-existing commitment and bring the Company into 
full compliance with the Code. As part of the process, we:
1. revised and significantly expanded the terms  
of reference of each of our three standing Board 
Committees to comply with the latest best practice;
2. appointed Ian Jenks as our Senior  
Independent Director;
3. adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved  
to the Board, setting out the decisions only the  
Board can take; and
4. performed a full review of the Group’s key  
financial position and performance procedures.
Whilst this has brought us into full compliance with  
the Code, an important marker in the development  
of the Company’s governance, we see this as a process 
that is ongoing. We will continue to strive for further 
improvements during the coming year.

Chairman

One key way in which I expect ongoing improvements  
to be achieved in 2016 is the completion of our first  
formal evaluation of our Board and its Committees,  
which we intend to complete around the middle of the  
year. T aking account of the results of this Board evaluation 
in determining candidate profiles, we intend to appoint at 
least one additional independent Non-Executive Director 
during the year. I look forward to reporting on the results of 
this and on other developments in the Group’s governance 
in our Annual Report next year.
The Board considers that the Company is, and has been 
since its move to a Premium Listing, compliant with all the 
relevant recommendations of the Code. Readers who wish 
to review the Code in more detail can find it on the Financial 
Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
www.paysafe.com
35 REPORT OF THE BOARD
Our Board is the core decision making forum for 
the Group, managing its business and corporate 
affairs at the highest level, establishing and 
monitoring the implementation of its strategy  
and allocating and raising capital to achieve  
the Company’s overall aims. 
In carrying out its role, our Board, along with  
its Committees:
 - considers strategic issues and ensures the Group 
manages risks;
 - monitors and oversees the Group’s operations, ensuring 
they are appropriately planned and managed with 
proper procedures for the maintenance of adequate 
accounting, information security, and systems  
to monitor performance and internal controls;
 - ensures appropriate human, financial and physical 
resources are in place to achieve the Company’s 
strategy and maximise shareholder value over  
the long term; and
 - leads in a way that promotes the Group’s standards  
and values and sets the tone for our management, 
employees and other stakeholders across the Group.
Our Directors take collective responsibility for the Board’s 
performance and are fully committed to achieving the 
Group’s long-term objectives and strategy. All Directors 
ensure they devote sufficient time to the responsibilities 
required for their respective roles, as well as their general 
responsibilities as Directors. 
The Board has a formal written schedule of matters 
reserved for its decision and comprehensive written  
terms of reference have been established for each  
of the Board’s Committees.
Membership of the Board
Our Board currently has seven members:
 - Myself, Dennis Jones, as Non-Executive Chairman; 
 - Our two Executive Directors: Joel Leonoff  
(President and Chief Executive Officer) and Brian 
McArthur-Muscroft (Chief Financial Officer); and
 - Our four Independent Non-Executive Directors:  
Andrew Dark, Ian Francis, Brahm Gelfand and  
our Senior Independent Director, Ian Jenks. 
Andrew Dark, Ian Francis, Brahm Gelfand and Ian Jenks 
are all considered by the Board to be independent 
because they do not have any business or other 
relationship with the Group that could significantly affect 
the exercise of their judgement. I was also considered 
independent on appointment as Chairman (although  
am no longer counted as such under the Code following 
appointment). All of the Non-Executive Directors provide 
balanced judgement and constructive challenge to the 
Board’s deliberations, as well as a broad range of skills 
and experience to the Board as a whole.
Whilst our Directors bring a diverse range of profiles  
and backgrounds to the Board, we are looking forward  
to increasing the diversity of membership through the 
appointment of one or more women as Directors as 
further Board appointments are made. 
Further details of our Directors, including biographies,  
are on pages 34 and 35.
Meetings of the Board and its Committees
The Board held five principal scheduled meetings during 
the year, as well as other meetings when required. Details 
of the work of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees at their meetings during the year follow this 
report of the Board.
Details of Directors’ attendance at these meetings are 
shown on page 33.
Support to Directors
On appointment, Directors receive a full induction on the 
Company and its operations, facilitated by the Company 
Secretary, and have training available to them on an 
ongoing basis. All Directors have access to the advice  
of the Senior Independent Director and the Company 
Secretary. Directors are also able to take independent 
professional advice in relation to their duties as Directors 
of the Company, at the Company’s expense, should they 
wish to do so.
Managing the business  
at the highest level
36
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Some of the key matters the Board considered during the year were:

Relations with shareholders
The Company is strongly committed to good investor 
communications and seeks to build and maintain  
good relationships with both its institutional and private 
investors. The Company values the views of shareholders 
and recognises their interests in the Group’s strategy  
and performance. The President and CEO and the CFO, 
assisted by the Vice President of Investor Relations, meet 
with major institutional shareholders of the Company  
on a regular basis and make themselves available for  
calls as appropriate. They can be contacted through  
the Company’s Vice President Investor Relations.  
The Chairman and Senior Independent Director also  
make themselves available for calls and meetings  
with shareholders. They can be contacted through the 
Company Secretary. There have been regular dialogues 
with key shareholders during the year and the Company 
utilises various channels of communication appropriate 
for both institutional and private shareholders. 
The Company also holds briefings with institutional  
fund managers, analysts and other investors, primarily 
following the announcement of interim and final results 
and at various investor conferences, as well as at other 
times during the year as may be appropriate. 
The views of shareholders are communicated to the  
Board and its Committees with regular investor relations 
updates and otherwise as appropriate at their meetings.
Copies of the Company’s results presentations are 
available on the Company’s website. Care is taken to 
ensure that any price sensitive information is released  
to all shareholders at the same time, in accordance  
with FCA requirements.
Annual General Meetings
The Company also uses the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) as an opportunity to communicate with its 
shareholders and all shareholders are welcome to attend. 
All Directors attend the AGM and the Chairmen of the 
Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees  
are available to answer shareholders’ questions.
Notice of the 2016 AGM is included with this Annual  
Report to shareholders. Separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate matter will be proposed at the AGM. 
Proxy votes are collated by the Company’s registrars and 
the results of the votes on each resolution proposed at  
the AGM will be made available on the Company’s  
website after the meeting.

GOVERNANCE REPORT

37 REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee (the “Committee”) 
comprises myself as Chairman, Ian Francis and 
Dennis Jones.
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
reviewed the Board’s skillsets and, with a  
view to the evolution of the Board over time,  
desirable characteristics appropriate for  
future appointments to the Board. 
Having determined the appropriate profile for the 
candidates to be sought, the Committee commenced  
the process for recruitment of a new Independent 
Non-Executive Director and met initial candidates.  
During this process, as a result of the Company’s 
development, including its acquisition of Skrill and its 
move from AIM to a Premium Listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, the appropriate profile in terms of specification 
and experience for the candidates changed. Accordingly, 
the Board concluded that it was more appropriate to 
complete the process with the benefit of the Company’s 
expected membership of, and track record in, the FTSE 
250 to attract a full range of appropriate candidates. This 
will also allow the results of the Company’s first externally 
facilitated evaluation of the Board in the coming months 
to be taken into account in determining the appropriate 
candidate profile. 
One of the key considerations in the recruitment process 
will be diversity, both in terms of the balance of skills and 
experience of the Board and other considerations, such  
as gender. We will be actively considering women for 
appointment in the forthcoming recruitment process as 
part of our policy to achieve gender diversity on the Board. 
At each Annual General Meeting of the Company, all 
Directors retire and, if the Board considers appropriate, 
they may be offered for re-appointment, in accordance 
with the Code. In deciding whether to propose the 
re-appointment of each Director, the Board acts on the 
advice of the Nomination Committee. The Committee  
has confirmed that each of the Directors has devoted,  
and continues to devote, the necessary time to their roles 
in the Company through what has been a particularly 
busy year of corporate activity. It has also confirmed that 
each Director will keep under review their commitments 
outside the Company to ensure that they are able to 
continue to devote the necessary time to the Company 
following its transition from AIM to its Premium Listing. 
Following evaluation of the performance of the Directors, 
Dennis Jones, as Chairman of the Board, has confirmed 
that all our Non-Executive Directors continue to 
demonstrate commitment to their roles and  
their performance continues to be effective.
Performance reviews
In the coming year, evaluation of the Board as a whole, 
facilitated by an appropriate external organisation, will 
take place to assess the effectiveness of the Board and  
its Committees. The findings of the evaluation will be 
reported upon in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report. 
Whilst the Board is required under the Code to conduct  
an externally facilitated Board evaluation every three 
years, it considers undertaking such an evaluation in the 
first year of the Company’s Premium Listing appropriate 
as part of its commitment to achieving best practice  
in corporate governance. 
During the year, both formal and informal discussions 
took place between the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors, without the presence of the Executive Directors.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The integrity of the Group’s financial reporting and 
the effectiveness of its systems of risk management 
and internal control are of fundamental importance 
to the Board, as they are to shareholders. They  
are required to measure and monitor the Group’s 
performance and to ensure that success in its 
strategic objectives can be sustained over the long 
term. As the Audit Committee (the “Committee”),  
we assist the Board in its oversight of these areas, 
testing and challenging matters in conjunction with 
management and the internal and external auditors, 
where we believe appropriate. Further details of our 
responsibilities are detailed in the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference, which are published on the Company’s 
website at www.paysafe.com. The Terms of 
Reference are reviewed annually and are  
approved by the Board. 
Membership
My colleagues of the Audit Committee are Andrew Dark  
and Brahm Gelfand, each of whom are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, as am I, as Chairman of the 
Committee. My previous background is as a senior audit 
partner in a major accounting firm, providing me with the 
appropriate recent and relevant financial experience to 
chair the Committee. The experience of the other members 
of the Audit Committee is shown in their biographies on 
pages 34 to 35. Stephen Shaper was also a member of  
the Audit Committee until he stepped down from the  
Board in August 2015. 
The Group External Auditor, Group Chief Financial Officer, 
General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Operating 
Officer, Group Financial Controller, Group Internal Auditor 
and other senior staff from Compliance, Risk and 
Information Security attend Committee meetings by 
invitation to report on developments in their areas.
Committee activities in 2015
In the same way, and for many of the same reasons that 
this has been a busy year for the Board, so it has been a 
busy year for the Committee. We held a total of six meetings 
during 2015 and another in 2016 prior to finalisation of the 
2015 Annual Results.

39 Internal controls and risk management
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its  
responsibility to ensure the operation of effective  
systems of internal control and risk management 
appropriate to the Group’s business. Day-to-day  
operating and financial responsibility rests with  
senior management and performance is closely 
monitored throughout the year. 
Where significant issues and/or risks are identified,  
the Committee ensures management has taken 
appropriate actions to address them. This was of 
particular importance during 2015 in view of the  
degree of organisational change arising from the  
year’s acquisition activities. 
Risk management
The Committee keeps apprised of the state of internal 
control and risk management through regular reports 
from the Group governance functions including Risk, 
Compliance and Internal Audit. 
Minutes from the Group’s Risk Management Committee 
are also received and reviewed by the Audit Committee. 
Enterprise risk assessments are undertaken at least 
annually, with ownership and mitigation strategies 
assigned to the top-ranking risks. Senior management  
is responsible for ongoing monitoring of risks, facilitated 
by the Group governance functions. 
Updates on risk mitigation status, together with  
other changes in risk profile, including emerging risks,  
are reported to the Committee for consideration at each 
meeting. In addition, the Committee gains assurance on 
the effectiveness of risk management through control 
assessments performed as part of Internal Audit, 
compliance activities and third party reviews  
undertaken on business operations.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides a key source of 
independent assurance to the Committee on the state  
of the internal control environment. The Committee 
approves the Group Internal Audit Plan and required 
resource on an annual basis, with quarterly updates 
provided by the Group Internal Auditor on audit activities 
against plan, and significant issues and/or risks identified 
from work undertaken. The Group Internal Auditor also 
reports relevant matters to the boards of the Group’s 
regulated entities in line with the corporate governance 
established at business unit level.
The Committee meets privately with the Group Internal 
Auditor in the absence of management to review matters 
within their sphere of interest and responsibility.
During the year, the Audit Committee assessed  
the performance and effectiveness of the Internal  
Audit process, primarily through the use of an audit 
quality questionnaire, in which the primary management 
stakeholders involved in each audit throughout the  
year were invited to feed back on the audit process.  
The results of the overall assessment were presented  
to the Committee, and indicated that Internal Audit  
had been effective during the year. It also emphasised  
the need to further enhance the management action  
plan follow-up process to help ensure effective and  
timely implementation of critical recommendations.
Internal control
The table opposite outlines key elements of the  
Group’s system of internal control. The Group’s internal 
control environment is designed to identify, evaluate and 
manage the risks faced by the Group. Of course it cannot, 
and does not, eliminate all risks; instead it seeks to 
manage risk to a level within the Group’s aim of  
achieving its business objectives. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
40
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control
1.
Control environment 
 - Codes of conduct, supported by Executive-led Group values, guide a high standard of ethics and integrity at all levels of the 
organisation and in the Company’s dealings with external stakeholders.
 - Business unit level governance and organisation structure, supported by Group level corporate functions, ensures core service lines 
are adequately planned, delivered and monitored to achieve the Group’s overall objectives.
 - Cross-functional committees, chaired by Executive management, focus on core areas of risk, including cyber risk, privacy, credit risk 
and regulatory compliance.
 - Appropriate delegation of authority, coupled with clear escalation paths, achieves timely decision-making and response to  
critical issues.
2.
Identification and evaluation of risks and control objectives
 - The Company has an established Enterprise Risk Management framework, which identifies major risks, mitigation strategies and 
risk tolerance. Risks are identified and then assessed in terms of impact and likelihood. Risk tolerance and appetite is defined for 
the top-ranking risks.
 - Based on risk assessment, management responses are developed, resource is prioritised and agreed mitigations are implemented. 
 - Ongoing monitoring of the risk profile tracks changes in risk and ensures mitigation strategies are adjusted in response.
 - Risk assessments are carried out at least on an annual basis, and risk owners and associated risk mitigation strategies are 
reconfirmed following each assessment. Risk owners are briefed on their role and responsibilities.
 - Risk mitigations are validated through declarations from risk owners and independent assessment as part of internal audits.
3.
Information and communication
 - Business activity is closely tracked against operating plans, budgets and forecasts, with significant variances investigated promptly.
 - Key performance measures are defined and reported on monthly, covering financial performance, compliance, operational risk 
and operational activities, accompanied by narrative on associated issues and risks for awareness and further discussion 
where warranted.
 - Key performance measures are reviewed and challenged at executive management and Board Committee meetings.
4.
Control procedures are defined by the business, with input from the governance functions,  
and are designed to ensure:
 - complete and accurate accounting for transactions;
 - compliance with the laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;
 - employees are granted limits of authority appropriate to their role, competency and seniority;
 - reliability and integrity of the systems providing information that informs decision-making; and
 - appropriate oversight of business activities commensurate with their criticality and associated risk.
5.
Monitoring and corrective action
 - Each business unit supporting the Group’s service lines has established its own monitoring process appropriate to its operational 
activities, reporting progress against objectives to the business unit management and Group senior management. 
 - Business unit level management, supported by Group level finance and governance functions, provides oversight of business unit 
operations, advising and/or intervening as needed to ensure principal policies, processes and procedures are being followed in  
the achievement of business objectives.
 - The Internal Audit function carries out periodic reviews of business activities, adopting a risk-based approach in alignment with  
the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management framework. Where deficiencies are identified, management action plans are agreed and 
high priority actions tracked to completion, with progress reported on a regular basis to management and the Audit Committee.
 - The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, undertakes an annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems.
On the basis of the outcomes reported by the business management, the Group’s committees, Internal Audit and External Audit,  
the Committee and the Board consider the Group’s system of internal control to be effective.

41 Significant issues
The Audit Committee pays particular attention to matters it considers important by virtue of their impact on the Group’s results,  
or the level of complexity, judgement or estimation involved in their application on the consolidated financial statements. At each  
Audit Committee meeting management presents a paper on significant accounting policies and estimates. The Committee has  
considered all significant estimates and judgements as identified in Note 4 to the financial statements, however the main areas  
of focus during the year are set out below.
Significant issues the Committee has considered How the Committee addressed these issues
Business combinations
There were significant changes to the Group during the  
year as a result of the acquisitions, particularly that of Skrill.  
The acquisitions required an assessment of fair value of  
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of  
the consideration paid resulted in a significant increase  
in the Group’s goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
The valuations and accounting papers prepared by management  
were reviewed and considered by the Audit Committee, to confirm  
that the valuations and accounting treatments adopted were 
appropriate. This included:
i)  reviewing the assumptions used in the business valuations including 
cash flows and discount rates;
ii)  considering the key inputs used to determine the fair value of the 
intangible assets; and
iii)  reviewing the approach taken to identify acquired intangible assets 
and challenging the allocation to goodwill.
The Committee was satisfied that management exercised sound 
judgement in identifying and valuing assets. 
Additional information is included in Note 25 to the financial statements.
Impairment testing of long-lived assets
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had goodwill balances 
totalling approximately $1.2 billion and other intangible  
assets totalling approximately $370 million.
Impairment reviews have been performed by management on the Group’s 
cash-generating units to which these assets have been allocated. Cash 
flow forecasts used were based on analysis obtained during diligence on 
those businesses acquired during the year and vetted by management, 
along with budgets approved by the Board, applying assumed growth 
rates thereafter. The key assumptions applied to future growth rates and 
discount rates, along with sensitivity analysis regarding these assumptions 
were reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee was satisfied with management’s assessment that  
there was no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets as at 31 
December 2015. Please refer to Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements.
Restructuring and acquisition-related costs
Restructuring and acquisition-related costs amounted  
to $8.2 million and $29.4 million respectively during the  
year. These costs were incurred as a result of the business 
combinations and integration efforts and are excluded from  
the Group’s adjusted EBITDA (see Note 23) and are disclosed 
separately as exceptional items (see Notes 22 and 25).
The Committee has reviewed papers from management supporting the 
treatment of those costs that pertain to the acquisition and integration 
of Skrill and other significant acquisitions as exceptional items.
The Committee is satisfied that management has consistently applied 
its criteria in presenting these items in the year.
Cash and cash equivalents
As at 31 December 2015, the Group’s cash and cash  
equivalents amounted to approximately $117.9 million.  
This balance is exclusive of any additional balances of cash 
subject to regulatory requirements relating to segregated 
customer funds (restricted cash, see Note 9 to the financial 
statements) or amounts due to be settled to the Group  
from various sources (settlement assets). The Group  
has significant balances in its accounts as a result of the  
transaction processing activities in its operating divisions.  
The classification of cash and cash equivalents are at risk  
of being misstated as a result of the timing of transactions  
and settlement to the Group’s accounts.
The Committee had oversight over management’s process to enhance 
the transparency on reporting the Group’s cash and cash equivalents in 
the current year. Please refer to the change in presentation disclosure 
within Note 3 to the financial statements.
The Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s 
presentation and disclosure within the statements of financial position 
and cash flows and notes to financial statements respectively.
Furthermore, a review of procedures addressing the safeguarding 
requirements for segregated customer funds was included in the  
remit of Group Internal Audit, overseen by the Committee. 
This review was ongoing at the year end and work undertaken as  
of the date of this report has not identified material issues of concern.  
The Committee is satisfied that management has consistently applied 
its criteria in presenting and disclosing these items in the year.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
42
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Significant issues the Committee has considered How the Committee addressed these issues
Revenue recognition
The Group earns revenue from multiple streams of transaction type which  
are derived from several operating platforms, including those introduced  
in the current year as a result of the acquisitions described in Note 25 to  
the financial statements. Consequently, the risk that revenue recognised is 
misstated is heightened. The Group’s recognition of revenue is dependent  
on the integrity of its information technology environments which are used  
to process transactions and calculate revenue on each transaction type,  
along with the operating effectiveness of application and core finance 
processes and controls.
As described within the key elements of the Group’s 
system of internal control, the Committee has reviewed 
reporting from management, the Group Internal Auditor, 
and the External Auditor surrounding the operational 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control environment 
and system integrity throughout the year. 
The Committee is satisfied that the Group operates 
appropriate processes and controls in respect of its 
operating platforms which underpin revenue recognition. 
External Audit
Oversight of the External Audit process
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight of the External Audit 
process, the Audit Committee reviewed:
 - the terms, areas of responsibility, associated duties  
and scope of the audit as set out in the External 
Auditor’s engagement letter for the forthcoming year;
 - the External Auditor’s overall work plan for  
the forthcoming year;
 - the External Auditor’s fee proposal;
 - the major issues that arose during the course of  
the audit and their resolution;
 - key accounting and audit judgements and estimates; 
 - the levels of errors identified during the audit; and
 - recommendations made by the External Auditor  
in their management letters and the adequacy  
of management’s response.
The Audit Committee meets privately with the External 
Auditor in the absence of management to review matters 
within their sphere of interest and responsibility.
Independence of the External Auditor 
KPMG Audit LLC were appointed as the Group’s External 
Auditor in 2005. The current Audit Partner was appointed in 
2012. We are mindful of the changes and potential changes 
to the requirements for external auditor selection, in light of 
reviews by the Competition Commission and the EU. Whilst 
we do not currently consider it necessary to have a policy 
for rotation of external audit firms, we intend to place  
the audit out to tender within the next two years.
The External Auditor may be invited to provide services 
where their position as Auditor renders them best placed to 
undertake the work. The External Auditor is not permitted 
to provide services to the Group relating to Internal Audit  
or due diligence. The Group intends to comply with the  
new EU rules in relation to non-audit fees to the Auditor 
which are to come into force in 2016.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development of 
safeguards to avoid the possibility that the External Auditor’ s 
objectivity and independence could be compromised, 
including the implementation and monitoring of policies and 
procedures on the use of the External Auditor for non-audit 
services. These policies are kept under review to meet  
the objective of ensuring that the Group benefits in  
a cost-effective manner from the cumulative knowledge 
and experience of its Auditor, whilst also ensuring that the  
Auditor maintains the necessary degree of independence 
and objectivity. The Audit Committee is required to approve 
the provision of services by the External Auditor where the 
fees for non-audit work are estimated to exceed the greater  
of $100,000 or 10% of the total audit fee. 
During 2015, the fees for non-audit services provided by  
our External Auditor, as disclosed in Note 29 to the financial 
statements, exceeded the audit fees due to the significant 
amount of work, provided in their role as reporting 
accountant, required to file the prospectus in March, 
regarding the rights offering, and again in December, for  
the purpose of our move to a Premium Listing. The Audit 
Committee considered that these services were best 
undertaken by our External Auditor. Excluding the fees  
for these matters, the fees for non-audit services were 
approximately 28% of the audit fees, particularly due to tax 
advisory services relating to projects initiated by Skrill prior 
to the acquisition date which the Auditor was best placed  
to continue to provide. The non-audit services provided by 
the External Auditor during the year did not include any fees 
relating to due diligence for the acquisitions accomplished 
throughout the year. 
Performance of the External Auditor 
To assess the effectiveness of the External Auditor,  
the Committee reviewed:
 - the External Auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 
and variations from it;
 - reports highlighting the major issues that arose during 
the course of the audit; and
 - feedback from key management personnel evaluating 
the performance of each audit team.
Taking into account all matters reported to the 
Committee, and the activities in which the Committee  
has been involved during the reporting period, we believe 
the Company complied with the FRC’s ‘Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’ , published in 2014, throughout  
the period up to the date on which these financial  
statements were approved.

43 STATEMENT FROM THE REMUNERATION 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
Company transformation –  
the role of remuneration
2015 was a transformational year for Paysafe, covering the 
period in which the Company acquired Skrill and moved 
to a Premium Listing on the Main Market of the London 
Stock Exchange. As set out more fully in the Chairman’s 
and the President and CEO’s statements at the beginning 
of the Annual Report, our operating and financial 
performance remained strong and provides  
a good platform for future growth. 
At the same time as these significant and value-enhancing 
developments were being delivered for our shareholders, 
the Remuneration Committee, taking on board clear 
feedback from our shareholders delivered in the lead-up 
to the 2015 AGM, took steps which we regarded as both 
appropriate and necessary to regularise pay arrangements 
for the most senior Executives within Paysafe. 
In doing this we have sought to:
 - re-establish confidence in remuneration processes  
at Paysafe;
 - move away from a prior Board practice of paying a 
consciously under-market package to our President  
and CEO, which practice unfortunately led to an ad  
hoc approach, rather than a policy driven approach,  
to salary and Long-Term Incentive (“L TIP”) awards.  
This ad hoc approach then required “one off” , large 
equity awards to re-establish a position of “fairness” . 
Because of the lack of coherent policies, these past 
practices were properly criticised by a number of  
our shareholders;
 - have a new policy, as enunciated in this report, with a 
clear and robust process for the establishment of new 
salary levels and incentive programmes;
 - have clear and robust processes for target  
setting (and ongoing measurement) for all  
new incentive awards; and
 - win support from our shareholders  
through transparency, clear disclosures  
and open engagement.
The improved position on pay which we have sought  
to establish does require detailed understanding from  
our shareholders, but we believe that it should be 
appropriate for our shareholders to give their support 
to an appropriately re-positioned package for our 
President & CEO.
 - Base salary has been increased to a level that reflects 
both the Company’s UK market cap and comparable  
UK technology company data.
 - New incentive levels have been established, reflective  
of practices in similarly sized UK technology companies 
and also, taking account of the President and CEO’s 
North American outlook, with a strong weighting to 
long-term equity (maximum annual bonus 200% of 
base salary; annual L TIP award at 300% of base salary).
REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Introduction
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee 
(the “Committee”) and Board, I am pleased to 
present the first Directors’ Remuneration Report 
which Paysafe has prepared since its Premium 
Listing on the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange in December 2015. As a Committee, our 
key roles are to determine the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and consider recommendations 
from the CEO in relation to the remuneration of 
senior management. We view these as key to 
incentivising achievement of the Group’s  
strategic aims and therefore short and  
long-term business success. 
All members of the Committee during 2015 have  
been Independent Non-Executive Directors. They are 
currently Andrew Dark and Brahm Gelfand along with 
myself as Chairman. In our role we are advised by FIT 
Remuneration Consultants LLP (“FIT”). FIT were appointed 
as the Committee’s advisors during the year following a 
thorough selection process which I led. They solely advise 
the Committee and provide assistance in implementation 
of its decisions and have no other role with the Group  
or management. 
  Our role is key to incentivising 
achievement of the Group’s strategic 
aims and therefore short and  
long-term business success.
Ian Jenks,  
Remuneration  
Committee Chairman
44
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015  - All financial measures for Paysafe incentive plans will, 
going forwards, be appropriately reviewed against 
consensus market forecasts. Market forecasts will  
be used to validate “target” outcomes – maximum 
performance will require performance to exceed  
our investors’ expectations.
 - Where appropriate, best practice features have been 
added to our incentive plans, including holding periods 
for our L TIP and malus/clawback features.
 - Where common pay design features have not been 
added, for example mandatory deferral of bonus into 
shares, this has been a conscious decision reflecting the 
reality of the position at Paysafe, where our President 
and CEO already holds shares worth over forty-times  
his current annual base salary (including a c.£2 million 
investment from his own funds in the 2015 rights issue).
Looked at holistically, the pay arrangements at Paysafe 
are, we believe, appropriate and in the best interests of 
the Company as a whole, balancing the interests of our 
shareholders and the senior management team. What  
we have established is:
 - appropriately retentive to keep the management  
team who have already delivered outstanding  
returns to shareholders;
 - appropriately incentivising for our management team 
to continue to deliver strong growth and the synergies 
of the Skrill acquisition; and
 - appropriate in terms of potential quantum, for whilst 
high quantums may be achievable for maximum 
performance, this will require exceptional and  
market expectation-beating delivery.
It is a very important context for the new remuneration 
policy to consider what the current management team 
has achieved to date. The graph above compares the 
Company’s TSR to that of the FTSE 250 (exc. Investment 
Trusts) over the period from 1 August 2011 to 31 December 
2015. This period has been chosen for this illustration  
as Joel Leonoff became the sole President and Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company in August 2011. 
This shows an over 1200% return by the Company 
in this period.
In terms of other actions which the Company undertook  
in 2015, there are two which I would wish to draw 
particularly to shareholders’ attention:
 - Firstly, the share awards which were an agreed part  
of the recruitment package for CFO Brian McArthur–
Muscroft were made in May 2015. The Remuneration 
Committee regarded these awards as necessary  
and appropriate to ensure Brian’s recruitment. On a 
technical point, these awards would have been made 
on his starting work in January 2015 but were delayed 
due to ongoing close period restrictions. Since coming 
into post in January 2015, Brian has played a crucial 
role in delivering a significant transformation for our 
shareholders with a significant debt and equity raise, 
completion of the Skrill transaction and our move  
to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
 - Secondly, all existing share awards were adjusted  
in line with the standard formula for such adjustments 
on rights issues which is widely accepted by auditors 
and regulators. These adjustments, which were 
formulaic, were made in May 2015 following  
the Company’s rights issue.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
www.paysafe.com
45 Introduction
This report contains the material required to be 
set out as the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the purposes of Part 4 of The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013,  
which amended The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (“the DRR regulations”).  
The Company intends to comply with the DRR 
regulations as a matter of good practice although 
as a non-UK incorporated quoted company it is 
not strictly required to do so and is not subject to 
the technical consequences of non-compliance 
with the DRR regulations. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report also describes how  
the Board has complied with the provisions  
set out in the UK Corporate Governance  
Code relating to remuneration matters.
Part A represents the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.  
This policy will take effect, subject to the approval of 
 the shareholders, immediately after the 2016 AGM.
Part B constitutes the implementation sections of  
the Remuneration report (“Implementation Report”). 
Format of the Report and matters to  
be approved at our AGM
The regulations governing the Directors’ remuneration 
reports of listed companies require that we split our  
report into two sections: the policy section sets out the 
Company’s forward-looking Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy and the separate Implementation Report gives 
details of the payments made to Directors in 2015,  
as well as other required disclosures.
At our 2016 AGM there will be three resolutions  
on remuneration matters: 
 - to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy as  
set out in Part A of this Remuneration Report; 
 - to approve the remaining implementation sections  
of this Directors’ Remuneration Report (excluding  
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy); and
 - to approve the renewal of our existing L TIP .
As Paysafe is a non-UK incorporated company both of  
the first two votes will technically be advisory in nature. 
REPORT OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
The vote to renew the existing L TIP is being proposed for 
consistency of approach with the new policy. At the same 
time as renewing the L TIP authority for a further 10 years in 
2016, best practice features are being introduced (such as 
holding periods and malus/clawback) and certain flexibilities 
more appropriate to AIM practice (ability for awards to 
vest in tranches before three years) are being removed.
Importantly, the Company will regard the policy to  
be approved at the 2016 AGM to be “binding” for the  
next three years – it is acknowledged that significant 
changes have been made to remuneration which are  
in line with the Company’s move to the FTSE 250, but 
there is currently no reasonable expectation of needing 
any further material changes for the three-year life of  
the new policy.
The Committee is confident that the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy is the correct one for Paysafe  
in its next stage of development as a FTSE 250 listed 
company, and the Committee hopes that it can  
rely on the support of shareholders for all of the  
remuneration-related resolutions at the 2016 AGM.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Part A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy as set out in this section of the Remuneration Report will take effect for all payments made to Directors 
from the date of the AGM, which is expected to be held on 25 May 2016.
Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Base salary
This is the core element of  
pay and reflects the individual’s  
role and position within the 
Group with some adjustment 
to reflect their capability  
and contribution.
Base salaries are periodically reviewed 
against companies of similar size and 
complexity and the Committee references 
both pan-sector companies of a similar 
market capitalisation and companies  
within the financial technology sector. 
The Committee does not strictly follow data 
but uses it as a reference point in considering, 
in its judgement, the appropriate level of 
salary having regard to other relevant factors 
including its assessment of sector differences, 
corporate and individual performance and 
any changes in an individual’s role and 
responsibilities. Base salary is paid  
monthly in cash.
While base salaries may be reviewed 
annually, the Committee will not 
automatically award an increase  
to reflect salary in-year inflation and  
may freeze salaries with consequently 
larger increases as and when an  
increase is awarded. 
Given the need for a formal cap under  
the DRR regulations, the Committee has 
further limited the maximum salary which 
it may award to an Executive Director to 
110% of the median level of base salaries 
for that role in comparable companies.
N/A
Implementation of  
Policy in 2016
For information and  
not part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy
Base salaries from 1 January 2016 are as follows: 
 - Joel Leonoff, £580,000 p.a.
 - Brian McArthur-Muscroft, £390,000 p.a.
Benefits
To provide benefits valued 
by recipients.
The Executive Directors are entitled to 
participate in similar benefits to those 
available to employees including health 
insurance. In addition, given the nature of  
the President and CEO’s role, the Company 
meets the cost of certain expenses related to 
travel to the Company’s offices (and related 
accommodation costs) which, while 
necessary to the performance of duties,  
can technically be classed as a benefit.
The Committee reserves discretion to 
introduce new benefits where it concludes 
that it is appropriate to do so, having regard 
to the particular circumstances and to  
market practice. 
Where appropriate, the Company will  
meet certain costs relating to Executive 
Director relocations.
It is not possible to prescribe the likely 
change in the cost of insured benefits or 
the cost of some of the other reported

of benefits will operate within an annual

Annual bonus plan 
To motivate Executives  
and incentivise delivery of 
performance over a one-year 
operating cycle, focusing on 
the short- to medium-term 
elements of our strategic aims.
Annual bonus levels and the appropriateness 
of measures are reviewed annually at the 
commencement of each financial year to 
ensure they continue to support our strategy.
Annual bonus outcomes are paid in cash 
following the determination of achievement 
against performance measures and targets. 
However, the Remuneration Committee 
reserves the ability to introduce deferral of  
up to one-third of bonus outcomes during  
the period of this Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy should individuals no longer comply 
with Share Ownership Guidelines. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply to  
the annual bonus plan as explained in  
more detail in the notes to this table.
The maximum level of annual bonus 
outcome for any financial year is 200%  
of base salary p.a. for the duration of  
this policy.
The performance measures 
applied may be financial or 
non-financial and corporate, 
divisional or individual and  
in such proportions as the 
Committee considers 
appropriate.
However, the annual  
bonus plan remains a 
discretionary arrangement 
and the Committee retains  
a standard power to apply  
its judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the plan for  
any performance measure 
(from zero to any cap)  
should it consider that  
to be appropriate.
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unchanged 
for the year, except to 
reflect events such as 
corporate acquisitions or 
other major transactions 
where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary  
in its opinion to make 
appropriate adjustments.
Implementation of  
Policy in 2016

Long-term incentives
To motivate and  
incentivise delivery of 
sustained performance over 
the long term, and to promote 
alignment with shareholders’ 
interests, the Group operates 
the L TIP . 
Shareholders’ approval for the 
renewal of the L TIP is being  
sought at the 2016 AGM.
Awards under the L TIP may be granted  
as nil-cost or conditional awards of share 
options which vest to the extent performance 
conditions are satisfied over a performance 
period of at least three financial years. Under 
the L TIP plan rules, vested awards may also 
be settled in cash.
The L TIP rules allow that the number of  
shares subject to vested L TIP awards may be 
increased to reflect the value of dividends  
that would have been paid in respect of  
any dates falling between the grant of  
awards and the vesting of awards. 
Awards for Executive Directors will not 
normally vest before the announcement  
of annual results for the final year of the 
performance period (always at least three 
financial years), with a further post-vesting 
holding period applying to 50% of shares 
from vested awards (25% subject to an 
additional one-year period and 25% to  
an additional two-year period, subject  
to sales for tax where necessary).
Malus and clawback provisions apply to  
L TIP awards and are explained in more  
detail in the notes to this table. 
The Company will honour the vesting  
of all share-based long-term incentive  
awards granted under previous policies in 
accordance with the terms of such awards.
The L TIP allows for awards over shares 
with a maximum value of 300% of base 
salary per financial year. Where awards 
are not made in a financial year due to 
regulatory constraints, this limit will be 
carried forward.
The Committee expressly reserves 
discretion to make such awards as 
it considers appropriate within 
these limits.
The performance measures 
applied to L TIP awards may  
be financial or non-financial 
and corporate, divisional  
or individual and in such 
proportions as the Committee 
considers appropriate.
Once set, performance 
measures and targets will 
generally remain unaltered 
unless events occur which,  
in the Committee’s opinion, 
make it appropriate to alter 
the performance conditions  
in such manner as the 
Committee thinks fit.
Performance periods may  
be over such periods as the 
Committee selects at grant, 
which will in all cases be at 
least three financial years, 
commencing with the 
financial year in which  
L TIP awards are made.
Implementation of 
Policy in 2016 
For information and  
not part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy 
The proposed annual award levels under the L TIP in 2016 will be awards over shares with a value (as at the time of award) 
of 300% of base salary for Joel Leonoff and 200% of base salary for Brian McArthur-Muscroft. 
The Company is seeking renewal of its authority to operate the L TIP at the 2016 AGM.
More details regarding the performance measures and targets for the proposed 2016 L TIP awards are set out in the notes  
to this table.
Share Ownership 
Guidelines 
To further align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those  
of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to retain  
all of the ordinary shares vesting under the 
L TIP , after any disposals for the payment of 
applicable taxes, until they have achieved  
the required level of shareholding. 
200% of base salary for all  
Executive Directors.
The Committee reserves the power  
to amend (but not reduce) these  
levels in future years.
N/A
All-employee share plans
To encourage share ownership 
by employees, thereby 
allowing them to share in the 
long-term success of the Group 
and align their interests with 
those of the shareholders.
In 2016 it is intended to launch a Company 
operated Sharesave.
This is an all-employee share plan established 
under the UK HMRC tax-advantaged regime 
and follows the usual form for such plans. 
When offered outside the UK the plans  
are varied to reflect local legal and 
tax requirements.
Executive Directors are able to participate  
in all-employee share plans on the same 
terms as other Group employees.
Sharesave allows the award of share 
options to employees with savings of up 
to £500 pcm and with the option price set 
at up to a 20% discount to market value 
when the option is granted.
Consistent with normal 
practice, awards under 
Sharesave are not subject  
to performance conditions.

Element and purpose Policy and operation Maximum Performance measures
Chairman’s and  
Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees
To enable the Company to 
recruit and retain a Chairman 
and Non-Executive Directors  
of the highest calibre, at the 
appropriate cost.
The Company has no fixed position regarding 
the benchmarking of Non-Executive Directors’ 
and the Chairman’s fees but will have regard 
to equivalent benchmarks to those for 
Executive Directors. 
The Company structures Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees to reflect the additional time 
commitments of chairing and being members 
of Board Committees, and serving on the 
boards of subsidiary companies which  
are regulated entities. 
Where Non-Executive Directors serve on 
Board Committees which are project-driven 
(including due diligence and integration 
committees) and/or carry out other 
additional work, the Company will  
pay the individuals further fees at  
an appropriate daily rate.
Whilst there is no current intention to do so, 
the Company reserves the right to pay some 
or all of the Chairman’s or Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees in the Company’s shares.  
Also, whilst at present there is no intention  
for the Chairman or Non-Executive Directors 
to participate in any benefits-in-kind, the 
Company reserves the right to permit this 
should it become necessary and appropriate 
in the view of the Committee (the Board 
excluding the Non-Executive Directors in the 
case of benefits for Non-Executive Directors).
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
The aggregate fees (and any benefits)  
of the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors will not exceed the limit  
from time to time prescribed within  
the Company’s Articles of Association  
for such fees (currently £2 million p.a. 
in aggregate).
Any increases actually made will  
be appropriately disclosed.
N/A
Implementation  
of Policy in 2016 
For information and  
not part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy 
The fees of the Chairman and of the Non-Executive Directors in 2016 can be summarised as follows:
Chairman’s Fee £250,000
Base Fee for Non-Executive Directors £65,000
Fee for acting as Senior Independent Director £10,000
Committee Chairman’s Fee 
(Audit, Remuneration, Nomination) £12,000
Committee Member’s Fee  
(Audit, Remuneration, Nomination) £4,000
Where Non-Executive Directors serve on Board Committees which are project-driven (including Due Diligence and 
Integration Committees), the Company will pay the individuals further fees at a daily rate of £2,000 for the additional work 
undertaken. However, the Due Diligence Committee established in relation to the Skrill acquisition ceased meeting during 
2015 and no additional fees will be paid in relation to the Integration Committee following the meeting of that committee 
in January 2016. Where Non-Executive Directors serve on the board of Group subsidiary companies, including entities 
which are regulated by the FCA, an additional directorship fee of £30,000 per position may be paid. In 2016 this will  
apply to Ian Jenks (in respect of two subsidiary boards) and Ian Francis (in respect of one subsidiary board).
Following a benchmarking exercise during 2015, the Chairman’s fee was increased from £130,000 p.a. to the level  
shown above.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Notes to the policy table
1. Annual bonus performance measures to apply 
in the 2016 financial year (for information and  
not part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy)
The proposed performance measures and targets for  
the annual bonus plan for the 2016 financial year will  
be based on adjusted EBITDA for 80% and on specific 
corporate and non-financial measures for 20%.
The Committee selected adjusted EBITDA as the  
financial performance measure for the annual bonus as  
it is regarded as a key performance indicator for the Group 
and focuses on the underlying operating profitability of 
the business by removing non-recurring items.
The corporate and non-financial measures for the  
2016 annual bonus will be aligned to reflect the Group’s 
strategic priorities and will include a specific measure 
relating to cash management.
Given the competitive nature of the Group’s sector the 
specific performance targets for the annual bonus for  
2016 are considered to be commercially sensitive and 
accordingly are not disclosed. Following the conclusion  
of the current financial year, the Committee intends to 
disclose these performance targets on a retrospective 
basis, other than where the corporate and non-financial 
targets are commercially sensitive.
2. Performance conditions for L TIP awards  
in 2016 (for information and not part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy)
The 2016 awards under the L TIP are to be made shortly 
following the 2016 AGM, subject to the proposed renewal 
of the current L TIP by the Company’s shareholders at  
that meeting.
The performance measures and targets for the L TIP 
awards to be made in 2016 will be based on a 50:50 mix  
of Adjusted EPS growth and relative TSR performance 
which will both be measured over a period of three 
financial years to 31 December 2018. 
The relative TSR measure is calculated against the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment 
Trusts), with vesting commencing at median (25% of this 
part of the award) and with full vesting at upper quartile 
levels. The performance targets for Adjusted EPS growth 
measure will be set by the Committee shortly before the 
L TIP Awards are made following the 2016 AGM (assuming 
that shareholder approval for the renewal of the L TIP is 
given at the 2016 AGM). The Company will disclose the 
performance targets for the Adjusted EPS growth measure 
for 2016’s L TIP awards in the RNS announcement when 
the awards are made and also in next year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The TSR measurements will be based on the three  
month average TSRs before the start and at the end  
of the measurement period. The definition of Adjusted 
EPS is adjusted fully diluted EPS on a consistent basis with  
that reported in the Company’s accounts (and assuming 
no material changes in the Company’s effective corporate 
tax rate). 
The Committee selected these performance metrics  
as they provide a balance between delivery of earnings 
and external market performance, both of which are  
key measures of success for the Company. 
3. Malus and clawback
Malus (being the forfeiture of unvested awards) and 
clawback (being the ability of the Company to claim 
repayment of paid amounts as a debt) provisions apply  
to the annual bonus and L TIP if, in the opinion of the 
Committee, any of the following has occurred: 
 - there has been a material misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results which has led to an overpayment;
 - the assessment of performance targets is based on  
an error or inaccurate or misleading information or 
assumptions; or
 - circumstances warranting summary dismissal.
Amounts in respect of awards under both plans may be 
subject to clawback for up to three years post payment  
or vesting as appropriate. 
4. Stating maximum amounts for  
the Remuneration Policy
The DRR regulations and related investor guidance 
encourage companies to disclose a cap within which  
each element of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will 
operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of 
remuneration have been set within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, these will operate simply  
as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration.
5. Travel and hospitality
While the Committee does not consider it to form part  
of benefits in the normal usage of that term, corporate 
hospitality (whether paid for by the Company or another) 
and business travel for Directors (and exceptionally their 
families) may technically come within the applicable rules 
and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for  
the Committee to authorise such activities within its 
agreed policies.
GOVERNANCE REPORT
www.paysafe.com
51 6. Differences between the policy on remuneration 
for Directors from the policy on remuneration of 
other employees  
Where Paysafe’s pay policy for Directors differs to its pay 
policies for other employees this reflects the appropriate 
market rate position for the relevant roles. The Company 
takes into account pay levels, bonus opportunity and 
share awards applied across the Group as a whole  
when setting the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
7. Discretions reserved in operating incentive 
plans under our policy  
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan  
and L TIP according to their respective rules and the above 
policy table. The Committee retains discretion, consistent 
with market practice, in a number of respects in relation  
to the operation and administration of these plans.  
These discretions include:
 - the determination of performance against targets  
and resultant vesting/bonus pay-outs;
 - discretion required when dealing with a change  
of control or restructuring of the Group;
 - determination of the treatment of individuals who  
leave employment (“leavers”) based on the rules  
of the plan; and
 - adjustments required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. rights issues, corporate restructurings or 
special dividends).
Recruitment remuneration policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims  
to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the 
appointment and promotion of high-calibre Executives  
to strengthen the management team and secure the  
skill sets to deliver our strategic aims. 
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new Executive 
Director, the starting point for the Committee will be to apply the general 
policy for Executive Directors as set out above and structure a package 
in accordance with that policy. Consistent with the DRR regulations,  
the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new 
recruits, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding these 
caps in practice.
The annual bonus plan and L TIP will operate (including the maximum 
award levels) as detailed in the general policy in relation to any newly 
appointed Executive Director. In the year of appointment, the 
Committee may vary the terms of that year’s annual bonus and  
the performance measures to reflect the part year worked. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of the prior role may either continue on its original terms  
or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may  
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses  
as it considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make additional  
awards in connection with the recruitment to buy out awards  
forfeited by the individual on leaving a previous employer. 
For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out awards are not subject to a formal 
cap. Any recruitment-related awards which are not buy-outs will be 
subject to the limits for the annual bonus plan and L TIP as stated in  
the general policy. Details of any recruitment-related awards will be 
appropriately disclosed.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in the view of 
the Committee, necessary and will in all cases seek, in the first instance, 
to deliver any such awards under the terms of the existing annual bonus 
plan and L TIP . It may, however, be necessary in some cases to make 
buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than the existing 
annual bonus plan and L TIP . 
All buy-outs, whether under the annual bonus plan, L TIP or otherwise,  
will take account of the service obligations and performance requirements 
for any remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving a previous 
employer. The Committee will as far as practicable seek to make buy-outs 
subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable requirements in respect 
of service and performance.
A new Non-Executive Director would be recruited on the terms explained 
above in respect of the main policy for such Directors.

Additionally, the Company has the right to terminate the 
service agreement with immediate effect at its sole and 
absolute discretion by making a suitable payment equivalent 
to all salary and benefits for the notice period (or the 
remainder of such period where notice has been served).
Non-Executive Directors
Each Non-Executive Director is engaged pursuant  
to a letter of appointment, the terms of which are 
summarised below. 
The Non-Executive Directors are not entitled  
to any compensation upon the termination  
of their appointment.
Termination policy summary
It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatment 
on a termination having regard to all of the relevant facts 
and circumstances available at that time. This policy 
applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods 
on a termination and any treatments that the Committee 
may choose to apply under the discretions available to  
it under the terms of the annual bonus and L TIP plans. 
The potential treatments on termination under these 
plans are summarised below. 
The Company has power to enter into settlement 
agreements with executives and to pay compensation  
to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent 
with market practice, in the event of termination of an 
Executive Director, the Company may pay a contribution 
towards the individual’ s legal fees and fees for outplacement 
services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees 
would be disclosed as part of the detail of termination 
arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy 
does not include an explicit cap on the cost of  
termination payments.
Incentives
If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’; 
for example, leaving through death or  
otherwise at the discretion of the Committee
If a leaver is deemed to be a ‘bad leaver’;

Single Figure Table
1. Benefits for Joel Leonoff in 2015 were family healthcare insurance with coverage appropriate for Joel Leonoff’s international role (£47,924) and  
the provision of accommodation benefits related to inter-office travel (£31,616). Benefits for Brian McArthur-Muscroft in 2015 were health insurance 
(£4,952) and car allowance (£16,000). 
2. Details of the performance measures and targets applicable to the 2015 annual bonus plan are set out below this table.
3. The 2015 value for long-term incentives for Joel Leonoff is prepared in accordance with the DRR regulations. The value is an estimate of the vesting 
values for L TIP awards where the applicable performance measures were tested in 2015 although actual vesting is following the end of the 2015 year. 
The relevant awards are the 2014 L TIP award (EBITDA performance measured to 31 December 2015) and the second tranche of the 2014 one-off award 
(share price performance measured to 30 September 2015). The performance vesting levels for both of these awards is 100%. This performance vesting 
level is then applied to the average share price between 1 October 2015 and 31 December 2015 (348.36p) to produce the estimated long-term incentives 
figure shown for 2015 in the above table. These assumptions will be trued up in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2016 for share prices on the 
actual dates of vesting. Details of the performance measures and targets applicable to the 2014 L TIP and the 2014 one-off award are set out on page 56.
4. The 2015 value for long-term incentives for Brian McArthur-Muscroft is prepared in accordance with the DRR regulations. The value relates to the L TIP 
awards which were granted on 28 May 2015 in connection with commitments made on his recruitment. Two-thirds of the award (344,563 shares) was 
immediately vested and accordingly the value of this element is included in the above figure at the 28 May 2015 share price (280.50p). The remaining 
one-third of the award (172,281 shares) vested on 1 January 2016 and accordingly the value of this element is included in the above figure at the share 
price on that date (371.75p). 
5. The 2014 value for long-term incentives for Joel Leonoff is prepared in accordance with the DRR regulations. The value is the vesting values for L TIP 
awards where the applicable performance measures were tested in 2014 although actual vesting is following the end of the 2014 year. The relevant 
awards are the 2013 L TIP award (EBITDA performance measured to 31 December 2014) and the first tranche of the 2014 one-off award (share price 
performance measured to 30 September 2014). The performance vesting level for both of these awards was 100%. This performance vesting level  
is then applied to (1) the share price on the actual date of vesting for the 2013 L TIP award (18 January 2015: 369.25p) and (2) the average share  
price between 1 October 2014 and 31 December 2014 (405.42p) for the first tranche of the 2014 one-off award (actual vesting on 1 October 2016).
6. Pension contributions comprise a 20% of base salary cash supplement payment to Brian McArthur-Muscroft. Joel Leonoff does not receive  
a pension contribution.
7. Brian McArthur-Muscroft was appointed on 1 January 2015 and accordingly does not have a comparative figure for 2014.
8. Until August 2015, Joel Leonoff’s salary was paid in US dollars and his annual bonus accrual was recognised in US dollars. The US dollar amounts for 
Joel Leonoff for 2015 have been shown in the above table in UK pounds sterling and applying an average exchange rate for 2015 (1 USD:£0.654232).
Annual bonus for 2015
For the 2015 performance year, adjusted EBITDA measures 
for the legacy Optimal Payments business were set for  
the Executive Directors’ annual bonus plan. These targets 
were exceeded beyond the specified maximum levels. 
However, the performance targets are regarded as 
commercially sensitive by the Board and are accordingly 
not disclosed, particularly as reporting on a legacy 
entity-by-entity basis for 2015 would be inconsistent  
with the Group’s combined reporting, and would require 
cost allocations within the merged entity which are not 
otherwise reported in the Group accounts. During the 
2015 financial year, management also undertook material 
actions to deliver value for shareholders, specifically the 
acquisition of the Skrill businesses, and accordingly the 
Committee was content to allow the outcomes from the 
2015 annual bonus plan to apply at the maximum levels.
The Committee recognises that whilst the Company was 
an AIM quoted business throughout the majority of 2015, 
it has now moved to the Main Market and accordingly,  
in line with the expectations of investors and leading  
proxy advisory services, the Company intends to make  
a detailed retrospective disclosure of the annual bonus 
targets which apply for the 2016 performance year in  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 2016.
During 2015, the Committee instituted the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy as more fully set out in the Policy 
section of this Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
accordingly the amounts of bonuses earned for 2015 
reflect a split-year treatment. For the first three months  
of the year, salaries and bonus maxima reflected the 
Company’s former remuneration policy and for nine 
months of the year, the position reflected the revised 
remuneration policy. Joel Leonoff’s maximum bonus 
opportunity increased to 200% of base salary and  
Brian McArthur-Muscroft’s maximum bonus opportunity 
increased to 160% of base salary for the nine month period 
as a result of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy.

55 L TIP awards vesting in 2015
The 2014 L TIP award granted to Joel Leonoff vested 
by reference to 2015 year end Group adjusted 
EBITDA performance.
The initial target for maximum vesting was set at the date 
of award (28 March 2014) and during 2014 was increased 
to reflect additional 2015 EBITDA contributions 
anticipated from Meritus.
The final target was $106.2m. In 2015 this was not further 
adjusted for contributions from Skrill from August 2015. 
The target was exceeded on the basis of the performance 
of the pre-Skrill merger businesses in the year. 
In addition, the second tranche of the one-off award  
made to Joel Leonoff in July 2014 vested by reference  
to the three month average share price to 30 September 
2015. This three month average share price in this  
period was £2.81 which exceeded the target of £2.03.  
For completeness, the final tranche of this one-off 
award is capable of vesting by reference to the three 
month average share price to 30 September 2016  
(target £2.32).
During the year these share price targets were  
adjusted to reflect the impact of the May 2015 rights  
issue in accordance with the standard formula used by 
auditors and regulatory authorities for such adjustments. 
The pre-adjustment targets were £3.50 (tranche 2)  
and £4.00 (tranche 3).

1. The Rights issue adjustment applied to Joel Leonoff’s interests in L TIP options granted prior to 2015 was in accordance with the normal formula  
for such adjustments. 
2. Face values for the L TIP awards made in 2015 have been calculated using the grant price in accordance with the plan rules.
 - For the options granted on 28 May 2015, the grant share price was 282.58p which is the average share price over three dealing days immediately 
preceding the grant date. 
 - For the options granted on 29 June 2015, the grant share price was 254.67p which is the average share price over three dealing days immediately 
preceding the grant date. 
3. Details of the performance measures for the L TIP awards granted on 29 June 2015 can be found on the next page. The awards granted to  
Brian McArthur-Muscroft on 28 May 2015 were granted as part of his recruitment arrangements and are not subject to additional performance  
vesting conditions. 
4. The aggregate gain from the share awards that were exercised during 2015 was £1,781,861 (655,096 share awards). This has been calculated  
using the share price on 10 June 2015, which was 272p. 
5. The minimum share price in 2015 was 219p and the maximum share price in 2015 was 572p (before the adjustment for the rights issue).  
The closing share price on 31 December 2015 was 371.75p.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Performance conditions for L TIP awards granted in 2015
The performance measures and targets for the L TIP awards made on 29 June 2015 were based on a 50:50 mix of 
adjusted EPS growth and relative TSR performance which will both be measured over a period of three financial  
years to 31 December 2017 and can be summarised as follows.
EPS – Financial year 2017
% of one half of an award capable of vesting (i.e. expressed as a percentage of one-half  
of the total number of shares originally subject to the award)
37 cents or more 100%
Between 32 cents and 37 cents Pro-rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
32 cents 25%
Less than 32 cents 0%
Company’s TSR ranking relative to constituents of the FTSE 250 index (excluding 
investment trusts) in the period of three years to 31 December 2017

of the total number of shares originally subject to the award)
Upper quartile or more 100%
Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100%
Median 25%
Less than median 0%
The TSR measurements will be based on the three month average TSRs before the start and at the end of the 
measurement period. The EPS measure is based on adjusted fully diluted EPS (and assuming no material changes  
in the Company’s effective corporate tax rate).

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Ian Jenks.  
The other members are Andrew Dark and Brahm Gelfand. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
require the Committee to meet at least three times a year. 
Its responsibilities include:
a) determining the remuneration policy of the Executive 
Directors and senior management;
b) determining the Company’s policy on the duration  
of contracts with Executive Directors and other  
terms including notice and termination payments;
c) determining the total individual remuneration 
packages of the Chairman of the Board, each  
Executive Director, the Company Secretary and  
senior management, including bonuses, incentive 
payments, share awards and pension arrangements, 
within the terms of an agreed framework; and
d) administering and reviewing all aspects of any share 
option scheme operated by or to be established by  
the Company.
Joel Leonoff is invited to attend meetings of the 
Committee, except when his own remuneration is  
being discussed, and the Chief Financial Officer and  
other Executives attend meetings as required.
The Committee has formal terms of reference which can 
be viewed on the Company’s website: www.paysafe.com. 
Advisors
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (“FIT”), signatories to 
the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct, 
were appointed by the Committee following a competitive 
tender process. FIT provides advice to the Committee  
on all matters relating to remuneration, including best 
practice. FIT provided no other services to the Group and 
accordingly the Committee was satisfied that the advice 
provided by FIT was objective and independent. FIT’s fees 
in respect of 2015 were £106,955 (ex VAT). FIT’s fees were 
charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms of 
business for advice provided.
Relative importance of spend on pay
As a growing technology company, Paysafe does not 
currently distribute profits to shareholders by way of 
dividend, but instead reinvests profits in the business to 
aid continued growth. Overall, expenditure on employee 
costs in 2015 was $89.8 million (including the costs of 
Skrill from August 2015), and in 2014 was $54.8 million.
Comparative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
The DRR regulations require a line graph showing the TSR 
on a holding of shares in the Company since admission to 
the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market to the financial 
year end following such admission, as well as the TSR for  
a hypothetical holding of shares in a broad equity market 
index for the same period. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY CONTINUED
58
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 President and Chief Executive Officer’s relative pay
As noted above, during 2015 the Company completed  
the acquisition of Skrill. Accordingly, this produced a 
significant change in the worldwide employee population 
during 2015. It is therefore proposed to provide a 
comparison of changes in the President and CEO’s 
remuneration and that of all employees in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2016 after the Company has 
been on the Main Market for a full year so as to allow 
appropriate comparison against a consistent data set. 
AGM voting results
As the Company has only recently been admitted to  
the Main Market, there has not yet been an AGM where  
a resolution has been put forward to pass a Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy and Directors’ Remuneration Report 
prepared in accordance with the DRR regulations. In next 
year’s Annual Report this section will have the voting 
breakdown of these two resolutions from 2016’s AGM, 
together with a breakdown of voting on the resolution  
to renew the Company’s authority to operate its L TIP . 
At the 2015 AGM the Company held a vote on its 2014 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which, as an AIM listed 
company, was a voluntary matter. Whilst this resolution 
was approved by shareholders, a significant number  
of shareholders cast their votes against the resolution.
The Company considered the reasons communicated  
by shareholders for this voting pattern. The principal 
reasons given were opposition to the large one-off L TIP 
award granted to Joel Leonoff in July 2014, the ability  
for L TIP awards to vest after two years and the lack of 
transparency in disclosure regarding performance  
targets for L TIP awards in the Company’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2014. The steps taken by  
the Company to address these issues raised include:
 - the review of remuneration undertaken in 2015 as  
more fully described in the Remuneration Committee 
Chairman’s letter at the beginning of this report; and
 - the disclosures regarding all outstanding  
L TIP performance targets within this report.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board 
on 15 March 2016 and signed on its behalf by order  
of the Board.
Ian Jenks 
Remuneration Committee Chairman
As Paysafe was only admitted to the London Stock 
Exchange’s Main Market on 23 December 2015, it is  
not practical to produce this graph for 2015. Next year’s 
Annual Report will include this graph over the period  
from 23 December 2015 to 31 December 2016.
The DRR regulations also require a table setting out 
selected details of the remuneration of the Chief Executive 
Officer over the same period as shown for the TSR graph. 
As detailed above, Paysafe was admitted to the Main 
Market on 23 December 2015, and accordingly we have 
included the details required by the DRR regulations for 
the 2015 financial year as shown in the table below.

59 REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR, KPMG AUDIT LLC,  
TO THE MEMBERS OF PAYSAFE GROUP PLC ONLY
1. Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
We have audited the financial statements of Paysafe 
Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2015.  
In our opinion the financial statements:
 - give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 
and of the Group’s profit and the Parent Company’s  
loss for the year then ended;
 - have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards,  
as adopted by the European Union; and
 - have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Isle of Man Companies  
Acts 1931 to 2004.
2. Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements, the risks of material misstatement that  
had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
Revenue recognition ($613.4m)
Refer to pages 39 to 43 (Report of the Audit Committee) 
and to note 4 to the financial statements (Significant 
accounting policies).
The risk: 
The recognition of revenue by the Group as a result  
of processing payment transactions conducted on its 
various operating platforms may be misstated. Revenue is 
recognised on completion of each transaction. The Group 
earns revenue from multiple streams of transaction type 
from contractual relationships with members and 
merchants. The appropriate recognition of revenue is 
dependent on the integrity of the overall information 
technology environments calculating revenue on each 
transaction type correctly, the operating effectiveness  
of application and core finance processes and controls  
of the Group’s operating divisions.
Our response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
 - involving our information risk management specialists 
to understand, through inquiry, and test the operating 
effectiveness of the information technology general 
controls environment;
 - testing the operating effectiveness of key automated 
application controls over revenue, such as user fees, 
incentives, foreign exchange fees and exceptions; and
 - agreeing, on a sample basis, the rate inputs for revenue 
transactions to source relationship contracts.
Business combination accounting
Refer to pages 39 to 43 (Report of the Audit Committee) 
and notes 4 and 25 to the financial statements (Significant 
accounting policies and Business acquisition).
The risk:
During the year the Group has made a significant business 
acquisition, acquiring the Skrill business for a total 
enterprise value of approximately $1.3 billion (€1.2 billion). 
As a result of the nature of operations of this business  
and the premium paid over net assets acquired, material 
intangible assets and goodwill have been recognised.  
The recognition of intangible assets is subject to specific 
accounting standards requirements under IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations and IAS 38 Intangible Assets, and requires 
significant judgement on the part of management, such 
as estimating the future benefits and ability to use the 
assets acquired. In addition, management is required  
to apply cut-off procedures and estimations to ensure 
proper recording of pre- and post-acquisition trading  
and opening statement of financial position. 
Our response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
 - using our own valuation expertise within the 
engagement team in assessing and challenging the 
assumptions and criteria utilised by management  
and their specialists in the recognition and valuation  
of intangible assets from the business combination; 
 - inspecting previous periods’ external audit files of Skrill 
and considering external specialist valuation reports 
obtained by management in respect of the recognition 
and valuation of intangible assets following the recent 
previous business combination of Skrill to support the 
fair values used in the current purchase price allocation; 
 - assessing the acquisition-date balance sheet of Skrill, 
including agreeing cash to bank records and inspection 
of reconciliations and procedures performed by 
management regarding the mid-month cut off  
for pre and post-acquisition reserves; and
 - considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
related to business combinations.
Impairment of intangibles ($369.9m) and 
goodwill ($1,178.3m)
Refer to pages 39 to 43 (Report of the Audit Committee) 
and notes 4, 5 and 6 to the financial statements 
(Significant accounting policies, Goodwill and  
Intangible assets).
The risk: 
The Group has material balances of intangible assets  
and goodwill resulting from business acquisitions.  
The evaluation of recoverability of the carrying value  
at the year end is dependent on the current and future 
performance of the cash-generating units of the Group. As 
such, this requires significant judgement by management 
in forecasting future performance and evaluating whether 
the assets recognised are impaired. Key estimates include 
the rate of growth and discount factor. 
60
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Our response: 
Our audit procedures included, among others:
 - understanding the Group’s budgeting procedures,  
upon which the forecasts are based, through inquiry 
and testing the mathematical integrity of the Group’s 
discounted cash flow model; 
 - critically assessing the key assumptions used in  
the discounted cash flow model against current and 
expected performance trends. Comparing assumptions 
to externally derived data, where appropriate, and  
to our own assessments of certain key inputs; 
 - involving our own valuation specialists to assist us  
in evaluating the discount rate used; and 
 - assessing whether the Group’s disclosures about  
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment of intangible assets and goodwill to 
changes in key assumptions appropriately  
reflected the inherent risks.
Cash and cash equivalents ($117.9m)
Refer to pages 39 to 43 (Report of the Audit Committee) 
and note 4 to the financial statements (Significant 
accounting policies).
The risk: 
The classification of cash and cash equivalents may  
be misstated as a result of the timing of transactions.  
The Group is subject to regulatory requirements in respect 
of segregated customer balances. The Group performs  
a significant volume and value of transactions as a  
result of processing payments conducted on its various 
operating platforms. The appropriate recording of these 
transactions is dependent on the integrity of the overall 
information technology environments and operating 
effectiveness of application controls of the Group’s 
operating divisions. The Group is exposed to the risk of 
fraudulent activity in respect of payments processed 
which could result in credit exposure for the Group. 
Our response:
Our audit procedures included, among others: 
 - involving our information risk management specialists 
to test the operating effectiveness of the information 
technology general controls environment;
 - testing the operating effectiveness of key automated 
application controls over payments and receipts;
 - testing the classification of cash and cash 
equivalents with near cash items (i.e. settlement  
assets / transactions in transit) and segregated 
customer balances; and
 - testing bank reconciliation controls and obtaining  
and comparing external confirmation of specific  
cash balances direct from financial institutions to  
bank reconciliations prepared by management.
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements  
as a whole was set at $2.5 million, with reference to 
benchmark of Group profit before tax adjusted for 
non-recurring transaction costs, of which it  
represents approximately 3.8%.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected  
or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
$125,000, in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s six reporting components in United  
States of America (USA), Canada, Austria and the United 
Kingdom we subjected all six to audits for Group reporting 
purposes. The effect of this approach covered 100% of 
Group revenue, Group profit before tax, and Group assets.
The Group operates two shared service centres in 
Bulgaria, the outputs of which are included in the financial 
reporting components they service and therefore they  
are not separate reporting components. Each of the 
service centres is subject to testing of revenue transaction 
processing, testing of information technology general 
controls and procedures relating to payroll. Additional 
audit procedures are performed at certain reporting 
components to address the audit risks not covered  
by the work performed by the shared service centres. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors  
as to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and information to be 
reported back. The Group audit team set the component 
materialities, having regard to the mix of size and risk 
profile of the Group across the components. These 
materiality levels were set to the materiality level  
specified above or lower. The work on four of the  
six components was performed by component  
auditors and the remaining by the Group audit team. 
The Group audit team visits component jurisdictions  
on a cyclical basis having regard to the mix of size and  
risk of the Group across the components. The Group  
audit team visited the component location in Austria in  
the current year, including to assess the audit risk and 
strategy. Regular telephone conference meetings were 
held with all locations that were not physically visited.  
At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to  
the Group audit team were discussed in more detail,  
and any further work required by the Group audit team 
was then performed by the component auditor.

TO THE MEMBERS OF PAYSAFE GROUP PLC ONLY CONTINUED
4. We have nothing to report on the disclosures 
of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to  
in relation to:
 - the Directors’ Strategic report on pages 8 to 31,

misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 - we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole is  
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 - the Report of the Audit Committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated  
by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 - the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 29 and 108, 
in relation to longer term viability and going concern; and
 - the part of the Governance report and Report of the 
Audit Committee relating to the Company’s compliance 
with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
Under the Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 - proper books of account have not been kept by the 
Parent Company and proper returns adequate for  
our audit have not been received from branches  
not visited by us; or 
 - the Parent Company’s balance sheet and income 
statement are not in agreement with the books  
of account and returns; or 
 - certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration  
specified by law are not made; or
 - we have not received all the information  
and explanations we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the  
above responsibilities.
Respective responsibilities of Directors 
and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 108, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of financial statements 
that give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, 
and express an opinion on, the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of an audit of financial statements 
performed in accordance with ISAs  
(UK and Ireland)
An audit in accordance with ISAs (UK and Ireland) involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing  
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
62
Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 The risks of material misstatement detailed in the section 
of our report titled “Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement” are those risks that we have deemed, in 
our professional judgement, had the greatest effect on: 
the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in 
our audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement 
team. Our audit procedures relating to these risks were 
designed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole. Our opinion on the financial 
statements is not modified with respect to any of  
these risks, and we do not express an opinion on  
these individual risks.
Materiality is a term used to describe the acceptable 
level of precision in financial statements. We identify  
a monetary amount of ‘materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole’ based on our judgement as  
to the quantitative amount of a misstatement or an 
omission that could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial statements. The concept of materiality is applied 
both in planning and performing the audit, and in 
evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on  
the audit and of uncorrected misstatements, if any,  
on the financial statements and in forming the  
opinion in our report. 
When planning and performing the audit, materiality is 
used in evaluating the risk of material misstatement for 
each financial statement caption, and therefore the extent 
and persuasiveness of audit evidence required by us. In 
turn, materiality will also define the level of precision 
applied to individual audit procedures.
Materiality is also used in the calculation of the 
quantitative level below which individual misstatements 
are considered to be clearly trivial and do not need to be 
reported to those charged with governance or corrected. 
If, in the specific circumstances of the entity, there is  
one or more particular classes of transaction, account 
balances or disclosures for which misstatements of lesser 
amounts than materiality for the financial statements as  
a whole could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
financial statements, we also determine the materiality 
level or levels to be applied to those particular classes  
of transaction, account balances or disclosures. 
When evaluating the effect of identified misstatements  
on the audit, and of uncorrected misstatements on the 
financial statements, we request that misstatements  
are corrected and then apply judgement in identifying 
whether an uncorrected misstatement or omission is 
material. To do so we make reference to the monetary 
amount of ‘materiality for the financial statements as  
a whole’ determined when planning the audit. The 
materiality determined when planning the audit does  
not necessarily establish an amount below which 
uncorrected misstatements, individually or in the 
aggregate, will always be evaluated as immaterial.  
We also consider the impact of misstatements on 
individual account balances or classes of transaction. 
Furthermore, the qualitative circumstances related to 
some misstatements may cause us to evaluate them as 
material even if they are below the relevant quantitative 
materiality level. Similarly, the circumstance related  
to some misstatements (for instance those relating to 
classification or presentation) may cause us to evaluate 
them as not material to the financial statements as a 
whole even if they are above the relevant quantitative 
materiality level.
Whilst an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK 
and Ireland) is designed to provide reasonable assurance 
of identifying material misstatements or omissions it is not 
guaranteed to do so. Rather the auditor plans the audit to 
determine the extent of testing needed to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate 
of uncorrected and undetected misstatements does not 
exceed materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
This testing requires us to conduct significant audit  
work on a broad range of assets, liabilities, income  
and expense as well as devoting significant time of  
the most experienced members of the audit team, in 
particular the engagement partner responsible for the 
audit, to subjective areas of accounting and reporting.
The purpose of our audit work and to whom  
we owe our responsibilities.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 15 of the Companies 
Act 1982. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members  
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.

3. BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable IOM law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU. 
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 15 March 2016.
Statement of going concern
These consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared on the going concern basis, as the Board of Directors has  
a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making  
this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future 
projections of profitability, cash flows and capital resources. 
The Group borrowed €500,000,000 ($548,200,000) in August 2015 to finance the acquisition of the Skrill Group (“Skrill”), one of Europe’s 
leading digital payments businesses. The acquisition is expected to enhance earnings for the Group and expand its international market 
share, and the Directors have considered this new debt requirement as part of the going concern assessment.
The Group’s principal activities, business and operating models, strategic direction and key and emerging risks are described in the President 
and Chief Executive Officer’s statement, Business model and Risk management sections. A financial summary, including a review of the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position, is provided in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s review section. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, liquidity and market risk along with the  
Group’s approach to capital management and allocation are described in Note 26 of the financial statements. 
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, contingencies and the accompanying disclosures at the date of the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. By their 
nature, these estimates and judgements are subject to estimation uncertainty and the effect on the Group’s financial statements of  
changes in estimates in future periods could be significant.
Significant estimates and judgements in the Group’s financial statements include impairment testing of long-lived assets, share-based 
payments, and business combinations.
Impairment testing of long-lived assets requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the assets have been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating 
unit and a suitable discount rate in order to determine present value.
The fair value of share consideration payable is determined by using valuation techniques that take into consideration market inputs such  
as share price and volatility.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 3. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
Business combinations require an estimation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed. The fair value of intangible 
assets is estimated using the future cash flows expected to arise from the acquired business and a suitable discount rate in order to 
determine present value.
Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in United States (US) dollars, which is the functional currency of the Group.
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and financial 
liabilities, which have been measured at fair value as described in Note 4. 
Change in presentation 
Presentation of certain items in the consolidated financial statements have been changed in order to provide more reliable and relevant 
information, and the prior period presentation has been changed accordingly.
The Digital Wallets fee expenses have been restated to include certain promotional costs which had previously been included as non fee 
expenses, but have been reclassed to cost of sales as they vary directly with the fee revenue.
Cash and cash equivalents have been adjusted to include two new items, settlement assets and cash held as reserves, which are now 
separately disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position to provide a more accurate representation of the cash immediately 
available to the business. Cash held as reserves also includes processor and card scheme deposits that were previously disclosed in prepaid 
expenses and other. The definitions of the new items of settlement assets and cash held as reserves have been included below in Note 4. 
Trade and other payables have been adjusted to include the Digital Wallets loyalty program liability and provision for merchant losses which 
were previously disclosed as separate items in the consolidated statements of financial position. In addition, merchant processing liabilities 
which were previously included in trade and other payables are now presented as a separate item. The definition of this new item has been 
included below in Note 4.
Computer software previously presented as part of property, plant and equipment has been reclassified to intangible assets as this better 
represents the nature of the assets.
In addition, presentation of the fair value on share consideration payable in the Company statements of financial position was previously 
reported as a reduction of the amount due to the subsidiary which contributed to financing the related acquisition. The balance has been 
reclassified and presented separately, resulting in an increase in both total assets and total liabilities of $18,800,000 for the year ending  
31 December 2014.
None of the changes detailed above had any impact on comprehensive income, earnings per share or net assets. 
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, 
and have been applied consistently by Group entities. The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the  
Company (and its subsidiaries) as at the year end. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed or has rights to variable returns  
from its involvement with the enterprise and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The consolidated 
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its principal wholly owned subsidiaries as identified in Note 27.  
All inter-company transactions and balances between Group enterprises are eliminated on consolidation.
In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost.
Foreign exchange
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
entity are expressed in US dollars, which is the functional currency of Paysafe Group Plc, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency  
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at 
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.paysafe.com
73 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary  
items carried at fair value are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the period, except for differences  
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations (including 
comparatives) are expressed in US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items (including 
comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as other 
comprehensive income and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in the  
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which  
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Settlement assets 
Settlement assets result from timing differences in the Group’s settlement process. These timing differences arise primarily as a result  
of settlement amounts due from financial institutions and other payment processors. These amounts are typically funded to the Group 
within days of the transaction processing date.
Cash held as reserves 
The Group has agreements with various financial institutions for the settlement of payment transactions. Under the terms of these 
agreements, the Group is required to maintain certain amounts as reserves, which may be applied against any amounts for which  
the financial institutions would be entitled for reimbursement. 
Restricted cash 
The Group maintains bank accounts with the Group’s principal bankers which are segregated from operating funds and which contain  
funds held on behalf of merchants, representing pooled merchant funds. In addition, in compliance with the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) rules and regulations, the Group holds qualifying liquid assets at least equal to the amounts owing to members. These amounts are 
maintained in accounts which are segregated from operating funds.
Balances in the segregated accounts are maintained at a sufficient level to fully offset amounts owing to the Group’s merchants and 
members. As a legal right to offset exists between the balances owing and the cash balances segregated in the member and merchant 
accounts, only the net balance of surplus cash is disclosed on the consolidated statement of financial position as restricted cash.
Intangible assets 
Intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life which is assessed to be three  
to five years. 
Website and platform development costs are recorded at cost and amortised over their estimated useful life using the declining-balance 
method at 20%. 
Computer software is recorded at cost and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life which is assessed to be one  
to two years. 
Other intangible assets, including customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements that are acquired by the Group  
and have finite useful lives are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date (“cost”) and amortised using the straight-line method  
over the expected life of the intangible asset, which is three to fourteen years.
Intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Property, plant & equipment 
Land is not depreciated. Property, plant & equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using  
the declining-balance method, on the following basis: 
 Communication equipment  20% 
 Furniture and equipment  15% 
 Computer equipment  20%

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: 
 Building & Leasehold Improvements 4% and over the term of the lease, respectively
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication  
of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that  
have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the Group performs impairment tests at least annually at 31 December  
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated 
recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use,  
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested 
individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU. Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill 
impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is  
performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated  
to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is 
allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognised in respect  
of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce  
the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there  
has been a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does  
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had  
been recognised.
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least 
annually and in the event of impairment indicators arising. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included  
in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from synergies  
of the related business combination. The group of CGUs that benefit from the synergies correspond to the Group’s operating segments. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables, including receivables from merchants, are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses and 
doubtful accounts.
Financial instruments 
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, or as loans and receivables and other financial 
liabilities measured at amortised cost depending on the purpose for which the financial assets and liabilities were acquired or incurred. 
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition. 
All financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through profit or loss are measured at their fair values and gains and losses related 
to periodic revaluations are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. All financial assets designated as loans and 
receivables, as well as financial liabilities designated as other financial liabilities, are initially measured at their fair values and subsequently 
at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.paysafe.com
75 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as reserves, trade receivables, 
merchant processing liabilities, trade and other payables, long-term debt, contingent consideration, share consideration payable and 
derivative financial liabilities. All financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss except for trade receivables,  
trade and other payables and long-term debt which are classified as loans and receivables and other financial liabilities.
Long-term debt is recognised initially at fair value, net of financing fees incurred which are comprised primarily of legal, accounting and  
other costs directly attributable to the issuance of the long-term debt. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any difference 
between the proceeds (net of financing fees) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income over the term of the long-term debt using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals  
basis and charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method.
Share consideration payable meets the definition of a financial liability under IAS 32 and is therefore classified as such. The fair value  
of share consideration payable is determined through single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model at the reporting date. Any fair value  
gains and losses at the reporting date are recognised as a net fair value gain or loss on share consideration payable in the consolidated  
statement of comprehensive income. 
Trade and other payables and long-term debt are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities.
Financial assets will be derecognised if the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred  
and the transfer qualifies for derecognition. The transfer qualifies for derecognition if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
of the financial asset are transferred.
Fair value measurements are categorised in accordance with the following levels:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, but that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Income tax 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group uses the balance sheet liability method of accounting for income taxes. Temporary differences arising from the difference 
between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount on the balance sheet are used to calculate deferred tax assets or 
liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using tax rates anticipated to exist in the periods that the temporary differences  
are expected to reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate  
to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current  
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable  
that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and  
are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Segment reporting 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, 
including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
Revenue recognition 
The Group is involved in transaction processing services through three main lines of business.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Payment processing services are offered through the Netbanx and Payolution products. Netbanx merchant revenue is earned either  
as a fee calculated as a percentage of funds processed or as a charge per transaction, pursuant to the respective merchant agreements.  
The fee revenue is recognised at the time the transactions are fulfilled.
Payolution arranges the provision of point-of-sale financing to customers of e-commerce merchants offered as a white-label solution,  
and earns revenue by charging fees to merchants that accept the service. The revenue is recognised at the time the transactions are fulfilled.
Digital wallets services are offered through the NETELLER, Net+ and Skrill products. Member and merchant revenue is earned either as a fee 
calculated as a percentage of funds processed or as a charge per transaction, pursuant to the respective member and merchant agreements, 
as well as fees from inter-currency transactions. The fee revenue is recognised at the time the transactions are fulfilled.
Prepaid services are offered through the paysafecard prepaid payment vouchers and my paysafecard online payment accounts. Prepaid 
revenue is earned from fees charged to merchants accepting payments made using the paysafecard product. A portion of the fees paid by 
merchants is used by paysafecard to pay commissions to sales outlets that stock and sell paysafecard vouchers, with the balance being 
retained by paysafecard. The fee revenue is recognised upon delivery or transfer of risk to the customer, net of rebates and discounts. 
Interest income is accrued on a monthly basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
The Company renders services to various subsidiaries within the Group including Franchise Rights and Platform Service Fees. Revenue  
from rendering of services is recognised in the Company statement of comprehensive income at the time the services are rendered.
Leases 
(i) Leased assets 
Assets held by the Group under leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. On initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value  
of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy 
applicable to that asset. 
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
(ii) Lease payments 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability.
Related party transactions 
Monetary related party transactions in the normal course of operations are recorded at fair value, and transactions between related parties, 
not in the normal course of operations, are recorded at the carrying value as recorded by the transferor.
Research and development 
Research expenditure is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is recorded in the same way unless management is satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial  
viability of the individual projects generating future economic benefits, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete 
development and to use or sell the asset. In this situation, the expenditure is capitalised at cost, less a provision for any impairment in value, 
and is amortised on the commencement of use over the period in which benefits are expected to be received by the Group. The expenditure 
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its 
intended use.
Share-based payments 
The Company issues share options to certain employees, including Directors. Equity-settled share options are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant. In valuing equity-settled share options, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price 
of the shares of the Company (market conditions). 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share option is expensed over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which  
the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled share 
options at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number  
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest (or in the case of a market condition, be treated as vesting). The movement in cumulative 
expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.paysafe.com
77 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market vesting 
condition or a non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the condition is satisfied, provided that  
all other non-market vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been 
modified. An additional expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of the modification, 
based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date 
of the modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in  
the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or 
settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where shares of the Company have been provided as consideration in business combinations, the fair value of the shares is determined 
using appropriate valuation methods applicable to the transaction.
Offsetting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the 
Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle  
the liability simultaneously.
Gross settlement is equivalent to net settlement if, and only if, the gross settlement mechanism has features that eliminate or result  
in insignificant credit and liquidity risk and processes receivables and payables in a single settlement cycle.
The balances owing to the members and merchants and the related cash balances segregated in the members and merchant’s accounts are 
presented net in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group considers these gross settlement as equivalent to net settlement 
in accordance with IAS 32.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted by the accounting standards, or for gains and losses arising from  
a group of similar transactions such as in the Group’s trading activity.
Employee benefits 
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid  
if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
Digital Wallets loyalty program 
The Group launched the NETELLER Reward Points Program (the “Program”) in February 2012. The Program allows members to earn points on 
their transactions in the NETELLER eWallets accounts. Members can redeem these points for merchandise, cash exchange, and other NETELLER 
provided services. 
When points are earned by members, the Group establishes a liability for future redemptions by multiplying the number of points issued by 
the estimated cost per point. The actual cost of merchandise redemptions is applied against this liability. The expense has been included in 
cost of sales.
The estimated cost per point is determined based on many factors, primarily related to expected future redemption patterns and associated 
costs. The Group monitors, on an ongoing basis, trends in redemption rates and net cost per point redeemed. Adjustments to the estimated 
cost per point are made based upon expected future Program activities.
Any variance in the cost per point is recognised in cost of sales in the Group’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The liability 
account is adjusted based on the outstanding balance of points issued on a monthly basis. The Group continues to evaluate and revise 
certain assumptions used to calculate the Program liability, based on redemption experience and expected future activities.
Provision for merchant losses 
In certain cases, transactions may be charged back to merchants, which means the transaction amount is refunded to the consumer and,  
in certain instances, charged to the merchant. If the merchant has insufficient funds, the Group must bear the credit risk for the full amount  
of the transaction. Management evaluates the risk for such transactions and estimates the loss for the disputed transactions based primarily 
on historical experience and other relevant factors. A provision is maintained for merchant losses in order to absorb charge backs and other 
losses for merchant transactions that have been previously processed and on which revenue has been recorded. Management analyses and 
regularly reviews the adequacy of its provision for merchant losses. The provision for merchant losses comprises specifically identifiable 
provisions for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated based on historical experience. The net charge for the provision  
for merchant losses is included under the caption Payment Processing expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Earnings per share 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit  
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the 
period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares, which comprise convertible shareholder loans and share options granted to employees.
Application of new and revised accounting policies 
In the current period, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and a new Interpretation issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2015.  
The application of these amendments has had no material impact on the disclosures in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

IFRS 2 has been amended to clarify the definition of ‘vesting condition’ by separately defining ‘performance condition’ and ‘service 
condition.’ For a condition to be a performance condition, it needs to meet both of the following criteria:
 - the counterparty has to complete a specified period of service – i.e. a service condition, which can be either explicit or implicit; and
 - the specified performance target(s) has to be met while the counterparty is rendering services. The period for achieving the 
performance target(s) cannot extend beyond the end of the service period, but it may start before the service period – provided that 
the commencement date of the performance target is not substantially before the commencement of the service period. As such, 
performance targets achieved after the requisite service period would not be accounted for as a performance condition, but would 
instead be accounted for as a non-vesting condition.
A performance target needs to be defined with reference to the entity’s own operations or activities, or with reference to the price or value  
of the entity’s equity instruments. In this context, ‘entity’ includes entities in the same group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
These amendments clarify the classification and measurement of contingent consideration in a business combination. Changes are 
summarised below:
 - When contingent consideration is a financial instrument, its classification as a liability or equity is determined by reference to IAS 32 
Financial Instruments: Presentation, rather than to any other IFRSs.
 - Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is always subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss.
Consequential amendments are also made to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
to prohibit contingent consideration from subsequently being measured at amortised cost. In addition, IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets is amended to exclude provisions related to contingent consideration.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
IFRS 8 has been amended to explicitly require the disclosure of judgements made by management in applying the aggregation criteria.  
The disclosures were made as part of Note 18 and include:
 - a brief description of the operating segments that have been aggregated; and 
 - the economic indicators that have been assessed in determining that the operating segments share similar economic characteristics.
In addition, this amendment clarifies that a reconciliation of the total of the reportable segments’ assets to the entity’s assets is required only 
if this information is regularly provided to the entity’s chief operating decision maker. This change aligns the disclosure requirements with 
those for segment liabilities.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The IASB has clarified that, in issuing IFRS 13 and making consequential amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 9, it did not intend to prevent 
entities from measuring short-term receivables and payables that have no stated interest rate at their invoiced amounts without discounting, 
if the effect of not discounting is immaterial.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures 
The definition of a ‘related party’ is extended to include a management entity that provides key management personnel (‘KMP’) services to  
the reporting entity, either directly or through a group entity.

79 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
For related party transactions that arise when KMP services are provided to a reporting entity, the reporting entity is required to separately 
disclose the amounts that it has recognised as an expense for those services that are provided by a management entity; however, it is not 
required to ‘look through’ the management entity and disclose compensation paid by the management entity to the individuals providing 
the KMP services. The reporting entity will also need to disclose other transactions with the management entity under the existing disclosure 
requirements of IAS 24 – e.g. loans.
Future changes to accounting standards 
The Group has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
The IASB issued IFRS 9 in November 2009, introducing new requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 
was subsequently amended in October 2010 to include requirements for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities and for 
derecognition, and in November 2013 to include the new requirements for general hedge accounting. Another revised version of IFRS 9 was 
issued in July 2014 mainly to include a) impairment requirements for financial assets and b) limited amendments to the classification and 
measurement requirements by introducing a ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ (FVTOCI) measurement category for certain 
simple debt instruments. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 9 until the Group undertakes a detailed review.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
In May 2014, IFRS 15 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers. IFRS 15 will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and the related Interpretations when it becomes effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The core 
principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an  
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Specifically,  
the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition: 
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction price
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation
Extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 15. The Directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of IFRS 15 in the future will 
have a material impact on the amounts reported and disclosures made in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. However, it is  
not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 15 until the Group performs a detailed review.
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations 
The amendments to IFRS 11 provide guidance on how to account for the acquisition of a joint operation that constitutes a business  
as defined in IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Specifically, the amendments state that the relevant principles on accounting for business 
combinations in IFRS 3 and other standards (e.g. IAS 36 Impairment of Assets regarding impairment testing of a cash generating unit to  
which goodwill on acquisition of a joint operation has been allocated) should be applied. The same requirements should be applied to the 
formation of a joint operation if and only if an existing business is contributed to the joint operation by one of the parties that participate in 
the joint operation.
A joint operator is also required to disclose the relevant information required by IFRS 3 and other standards for business combinations.
The amendments to IFRS 11 apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. The Directors of the Group do not 
anticipate that the application of these amendments to IFRS 11 will have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
The amendments to IAS 16 prohibit entities from using a revenue-based depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. 
The amendments to IAS 38 introduce a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate basis for amortisation of an intangible 
asset. The amendments apply prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Currently, the Group uses the declining 
balance method for depreciation for its property, plant and equipment, and declining balance and straight line methods for amortisation for 
its intangible assets. The Directors of the Group believe that these are the most appropriate methods to reflect the consumption of economic 
benefits inherent in the respective assets and, accordingly, the Directors of the Group do not anticipate that the application of these 
amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 will have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
IFRS 16 Leases 
In January 2016, IFRS 16 was issued which will replace IAS 17 as the standard for recognising, measuring, presenting and disclosing leases. 
The standard provides a single lessee accounting model requiring the recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease  
term is 12 months or less or if the underlying asset has a low value. The standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2019. It is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of IFRS 16 until the Group performs a detailed review.

The Group performs goodwill asset impairment tests at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value of goodwill for a CGU might not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to  
sell and value in use.
Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts are discount rates and EBITDA growth rates. The values assigned to the key 
assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the e-commerce industry impacting the payment processing business 
and are based on both external and internal sources (historical data). The key assumptions were as follows: 
Payment Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid
As at 31 December 2015
Discount rate 16% 16% 16%
Terminal value growth rate 1.35% 1.35% 1.35%
Budgeted EBITDA growth rate (5 years) 5% 5% 5%
Payment Processing Digital Wallets Prepaid
As at 31 December 2014
Discount rate 5% – –
Terminal value growth rate 1.35% – –
Budgeted EBITDA growth rate (5 years) 5% – –
The discount rate is an estimate based on past experience and the expected average weighted average cost of capital. The increase in the 
discount rate reflects the changes in the structure of the Group subsequent to the acquisitions that took place during the year (Note 25) and 
the associated financing.
Five years of cash flows were included in the discounted cash flow model. A long-term growth rate into perpetuity was determined based on 
management’s estimate of the terminal value growth rate in EBITDA, which management believed was consistent with the assumption that  
a market participant would make. Budgeted EBITDA was based on expectation of future outcomes taking into account past experiences.
No impairment indicators were identified during the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Company raised total gross proceeds of approximately £463,000,000 (approximately £436,000,000 net of expenses of the Rights Issue) 
(approximately $702,000,000 and $660,000,000 respectively) through the issue of 272,495,506 New Ordinary Shares by way of the Rights Issue 
and the subsequent Rump Placing. 
Pursuant to the Rights Issue, 263,685,643 New Ordinary Shares were issued by way of rights to Qualifying Shareholders (other than, subject  
to certain exceptions, to Excluded Shareholders) to subscribe for New Ordinary Shares at an Offer Price of 166 pence per New Ordinary Share 
payable in full on acceptance by no later than 11.00 a.m. on 1 May 2015. The Offer Price represents: 
 - a 34 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of an Existing Ordinary Share, when calculated by reference to the volume  
weighted average price of 398 pence per Existing Ordinary Share during the five day period between 16 March 2015 and 20 March 2015 
(being the last practicable Business Day before the announcement of the Rights Issue);
 - a 36 per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of an Existing Ordinary Share, when calculated by reference to the Closing Price  
of 419 pence per Existing Ordinary Share on 20 March 2015; and
 - a 60 per cent discount to the Closing Price of 419 pence per Existing Ordinary Share on 20 March 2015.
The Rights Issue was made on the basis of five New Ordinary Shares at 166 pence per New Ordinary Share for every three Existing Ordinary 
Shares held by and registered in the name of each Qualifying Shareholder at 5.00 p.m. on the Record Date, and in proportion to any other 
number of Existing Ordinary Shares each Qualifying Shareholder then holds. 
An additional 8,809,863 New Ordinary Shares were issued at a price of 290 pence per New Ordinary Share by way of a Rump Placing to 
subscribers for shares not validly taken up in the Rights Issue.

1. The Group’s credit facility of $150,000,000 provided by Bank of Montreal was fully refinanced on 10 August 2015. Prior to refinancing, the credit facility consisted of a $100,000,000 
term facility and a $50,000,000 revolving facility. The term facility bore interest at US prime rate plus a premium varying from 0.25% to 1.50% or at a LIBO rate plus a premium 
varying from 1.75% to 3.00%, and was repayable in quarterly instalments of $5,000,000 starting in September 2014 up to the original maturity date of 23 July 2017. The revolving 
facility had no specified terms of repayment and it bore interest and matured on the same basis as the term facility. Amounts of $100,000,000 and $41,000,000 were drawn down 
from the term facility and revolving facility, respectively, on 23 July 2014 in order to fund the Meritus and GMA acquisitions (Note 25 iii)). For the year ended 31 December 2015, 
principal repayments amounted to $90,000,000 and $37,000,000 on the term facility and revolving facility, respectively (31 December 2014 – $10,000,000 and $4,000,000 
respectively). 
2. On 23 March 2015, the Group entered into certain forward exchange contracts to hedge its cash flow exposure with respect to currency fluctuations between the cash raised 
through the Rights Offering in Great British Pound (“GBP”) vs the principal repayable on the credit facility for the anticipated business acquisition (Note 25 i)). The forward 
exchange contracts entered into included commitments to buy $82,000,000 in exchange for GBP at varying rates ranging from 1.47947 to 1.47344 (GBP:USD) between the  
period of 11 May 2015 and 23 September 2015. The contracts included a variable timing settlement feature to allow for the then unknown completion date of the transaction, 
which was 10 August 2015 as disclosed above. The contracts were contingent upon completion of the acquisition and would otherwise expire at no cost to the Group in the  
event the transaction had not completed.
3. The Group’s new credit facility provided by BMO Capital Markets, Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. consists of a €280,000,000 Term A and €220,000,000  
Term B facility, as well as an $85,000,000 revolving facility. The Term A facility bears interest at a EURIBOR rate plus a margin varying from 2.75% to 3%, and is repayable in bi-annual 
instalments starting in February 2016 up to the maturity date of 10 August 2020. The Term B facility bears interest at a EURIBOR rate plus a margin varying from 3.75% to 4%, and is 
repayable at the discretion of the Group before the maturity date of 10 August 2022. The Group has classified the entire Term B balance as long-term as it is not anticipating making 
any repayments in the following twelve months. The revolving facility is interest bearing at a LIBOR rate plus a margin varying from 1.75% to 2.75% and has no specified terms of 
repayment. An arrangement fee of $1,488,000 was paid for the revolving facility and a ticking fee of 35% of the applicable margin is applied to the unutilised revolver amount on 
an ongoing basis. The Group has not drawn down on the revolving facility since it was made available but has utilised part of the facility to issue letters of credit in the ordinary 
course of business. Amounts of €280,000,000 and €220,000,000 were drawn down from the Term A and Term B facilities respectively on 10 August 2015, less financing fees of 
€11,931,000 ($13,012,000) and €9,492,000 ($10,352,000) respectively, to fund the Skrill acquisition (Note 25 i)). 
 The credit facility is secured by virtually all of the assets of the Group, with the exception of restricted cash (Note 9). The security includes share pledges and guarantees  
from certain subsidiaries within the Group.
 As at 31 December 2015, the Group has approximately $8,720,000 outstanding in issued letters of guarantee in relation to various performance bonds drawn from the 
revolving facility.

87 13. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
Under the terms of the loan agreement, the Group must satisfy certain restrictive covenants including minimum financial ratios. These 
restrictions are composed of ratios of funded debt to EBITDA, funded debt to capitalisation and fixed charge coverage ratio. EBITDA, a 
non-IFRS measure, is defined in the credit facility on a consolidated basis, as total comprehensive profit attributable to the owners of  
the Group before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation, gains or losses from asset dispositions, gains or losses from 
extraordinary items and non-recurring transaction costs related to the acquisition of Meritus and GMA, non-cash share option expenses  
and gains or losses relative to foreign exchange or derivative instruments, plus (or minus) the historical EBITDA of any businesses acquired 
(or sold) during the reporting period. The Group’s first covenant compliance certificate is due by 30 May 2016 and will report on covenant 
compliance at 31 December 2015 and 31 March 2016.
Principal repayments on the credit facilities over the forthcoming years, excluding financing fees of $21,630,000, are as follows:

A total liability of approximately $3,900,000 remains outstanding as at 31 December 2015 in relation to an ongoing investigation by the 
Canadian Revenue Agency (“CRA”) regarding Canadian withholding taxes which are deemed to have arisen on the relocation of assets to  
the Isle of Man from Canada in the 2004 and 2005 taxation years. This liability represents management’s estimate of the maximum amount 
the Group is likely to be required to pay in respect of such withholding taxes and interest.

17. MERCHANT PROCESSING LIABILITIES
The merchant processing liabilities arise from the operations of the Payment Processing division totalling $16,758,000  
(31 December 2014: $30,591,000). In addition, an equivalent transient amount relating to merchant transactions processed via  
the Payment Processing operations is included in cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets. The operations do not fall within  
the EU definition of “e-money” nor does a legal right to offset exist between this cash and the corresponding merchant processing liabilities. 
18. OPERATING SEGMENTS
Following the acquisition of Skrill (Note 25 i)), the Group has revised its operating segments as disclosed below which are based on  
the Group’s main revenue generating activities. For each of the segments, the Group’s CEO reviews internal management reports to  
a gross margin level on a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. 
Payment Processing: fees are generated through the Paysafe and Paysafe Asia straight-through processing platforms where customers  
send money directly to merchants, as well as Payolution’s online payment services, and the FANS white label technology solutions and 
consulting services. 
Digital Wallets: fees are generated on transactions between members and merchants using the NETELLER service and Net+ prepaid cards, 
and the Skrill Wallet and Skrill prepaid cards.
Prepaid: fees are generated from merchants accepting payments made using paysafecard prepaid vouchers.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below:

market prices for the period during which the options were outstanding.
The conversion of shareholder loans relates to two shareholders, Aurum Nominees Ltd and IIU Nominees Ltd, who gave notice to the Company 
in January 2014 that they each wished to convert their shareholder loans amounting to $9,525,814 (including accrued interest) into ordinary 
shares pursuant to the loan agreement. As a result, in January 2014, the Company issued 4,348,503 and 4,330,406 Ordinary Shares to Aurum 
Nominees Ltd. and IIU Nominees Ltd. respectively.
21. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company adopted the unapproved equity-settled share option plan (“ESOS”) pursuant to a resolution passed on 7 April 2004  
and amended by the Board on 15 September 2008. The 2008 amendment included the addition of a new ‘approved’ plan for UK based 
employees. Under the ‘approved’ and ‘unapproved’ plans, the Board of Directors of the Company may grant share options to eligible 
employees including Directors of Group companies to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company. The ESOS options granted vest  
on the third anniversary of the date of grant and lapse a further six months after vesting.
No consideration is payable on the grant of an option. Options may generally be exercised to the extent that they have vested. Options  
vest according to the relevant schedule over the grant period following the date of grant. The exercise price is determined by the Board of 
Directors of the Company, and shall not be less than the average quoted market price of the Company shares on the three days prior to the 
date of grant. Subject to the discretion of the Board share options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
The Company also adopted the Long Term Incentive Plan (“L TIP”) which took effect from 1 January 2010 to eligible employees including 
Directors of Group companies to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company. These L TIP options vest in one tranche based on future 
performance related to EBITDA targets determined each year and subject to continued employment over the remaining vesting period. 
Vested options lapse on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. On 9 July 2014, the Board granted 3,000,000 “special” L TIP options  
which vest in three tranches based on future performance related to share price targets.
No consideration is payable on the grant of an option. Options may generally be exercised to the extent that they have vested.  
Options vest according to the relevant schedule over the grant period following the date of grant. The exercise price is determined  
by the Board of Directors of the Company. Subject to the discretion of the Board share options are forfeited if the employee leaves  
the Group before the options vest.

Assumptions used in ESOS and L TIP options pricing model

The fair value of the “special” options granted under the L TIP was determined using a bespoke Monte Carlo pricing model that takes into 
account the market-based performance conditions specific to this plan. 
The following table shows the principal assumptions used in the valuation:
Year ended  
31 December 
 2015
Year ended  
31 December  
2014
Weighted average exercise price £0.00 £0.00

Expected life 2.72 years 2.31 years
Risk free interest rate 0.89% 1.20%
Dividend yield 0% 0%
Weighted average fair value per option granted £2.75 £3.49
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price from the time of issue to the date  
of grant.
Due to the nominal exercise price of the L TIP options and that option holders are entitled to receive a benefit by reference to the value of 
dividends that would have been paid on vested shares during the vesting period, the regular options granted under the 2014 L TIP were 
valued based on the share price at the date of grant. 
22. RESTRUCTURING COSTS
The Group incurred certain restructuring costs relating to the reorganisation of its cost structure. Severance was paid to employees as a result 
of operational changes to the Group’s business in order to streamline operations and remain competitive in challenging markets. Additional 
restructuring costs were incurred in the year for specific persons hired to reorganise the business and various professional fees relating to  
the acquisitions described in Note 25.
The Group incurred the following costs:

23. ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as results of operating activities before depreciation and amortisation, non-operational items and exceptional 
non-recurring items which are defined as items of income and expense of such size, nature or incidence that in the view of management 
their disclosure is relevant to explain the performance of the Group for the year.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The presentation on these financial 
measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to the differences in the ways the measures 
are calculated.

25. BUSINESS ACQUISITION
i) Skrill Group 
On August 10, 2015, the Group acquired all of the interest of the Skrill Group (“Skrill”) from Sentinel Group Holdings S.A., ultimately owned by 
funds managed and advised by subsidiaries of CVC Capital Partners SICAV-FIS S.A., Investcorp Technology Partners, and other shareholders. 
Skrill was one of Europe’s leading digital payments businesses providing digital wallet solutions and online payment processing capabilities 
and one of the largest pre-paid online voucher providers in Europe with its paysafecard brand. A subsidiary of the Group, Netinvest Limited, 
acquired the entire issued share capital of Skrill in exchange for €720,000,000 ($799,823,000) cash and 37,493,053 New Ordinary Shares. 
Following completion, Sentinel Group Holdings S.A. or its shareholders owned approximately 7.9% of the enlarged Share Capital of the 
enlarged Group. The cash consideration was financed through a combination of available cash, new debt facilities (Note 13) and a fully 
underwritten Rights Issue (Note 11). The value of the equity consideration for Skrill was €153,570,000 ($168,374,000), based on the fair value 
of the shares on their date of issuance, which together with the cash consideration and the net debt of Skrill of €307,839,000 ($337,515,000) 
gives an enterprise valuation of Skrill of approximately €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion). 
On 23 March 2015, the Group entered into certain forward exchange contracts to hedge its cash flow exposure with respect to currency 
fluctuations between the cash raised through the Rights Offering in Great British Pound (“GBP”) vs the cash consideration payable for the 
anticipated business acquisition in EURO (“EUR”). The forward exchange contracts entered into included commitments to buy €515,000,000 
in exchange for GBP at varying rates ranging from 1.36308 to 1.35239 (GBP:EURO) between the period of 11 May 2015 and 23 September 
2015. The contracts included a variable timing settlement feature to allow for the then unknown completion date of the transaction, which 
was 10 August 2015 as disclosed above. The contracts were contingent upon completion of the acquisition and would otherwise expire at  
no cost to the Group in the event the transaction had not completed. The contracts were settled on 10 August 2015 and the realised foreign 
exchange loss has been reflected in the value of the cash consideration. During the same period, the Group recognised a foreign exchange 
gain on the cash position raised from the Rights Offering and held in GBP in anticipation of the settlement of the forward exchange contracts 
described above. This foreign exchange gain has also been reflected in the value of the cash consideration.
The acquisition will be transformational and value enhancing for the Group and will create a leading payment and digital wallet provider 
with significant international scale and reach that is well positioned to capitalise on the substantial and growing payment processing and 
digital wallet markets, particularly within the rapidly expanding online gambling sector. The acquisition will further diversify the Group’s 
merchant portfolio and geographic reach, and provides the Group with a strong financial rationale and substantial potential synergies.

1. The trade and other receivables includes trade receivables with a fair value of $3,685,000 which approximates the gross amount due under the contracts less an impairment 
allowance of $3,465,000.
2. Prior to acquiring Skrill, a company within the Group made an interest-bearing loan in the amount of $2,193,000 to Skrill in support of its operating working capital requirements. 
Following the acquisition, the amounts were eliminated upon consolidation.
3. At the date of acquisition, Skrill had amounts receivable from its U.S. division that was not part of the acquisition by Paysafe. As such these have been presented as receivables  
from a related party.
4. The Group made a repayment of $337,152,000 on the acquired long-term debt assumed in the business acquisition.
5. At the acquisition date Skrill had an outstanding payable to a vendor from an acquisition that had been closed in March 2015. The payable is due in three instalments over the next 
two years. The Group assumed this liability as part of the acquisition and has presented it in the consolidated statements of financial position as deferred consideration payable.
Skrill revenues of $137,718,000 and net loss incurred of $11,848,000 are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the date of acquisition. The Group’s consolidated revenues and net loss incurred for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have 
included $342,478,000 and $38,954,000, respectively, had the Skrill acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $28,831,000 during the year ended 31 December 2015, which were expensed 
in the period relating to this transaction.
ii) FANS Entertainment Inc. 
On 22 May 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of FANS Entertainment Inc. (“FANS”), a Montreal-based mobile platform developer 
founded in 2011, for a consideration of CAD$16,000,000 (approximately $13,000,000), payable to the vendors by issuing shares in a subsidiary 
of Paysafe Group PLC (the “Consideration Shares”) which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of the Company over the next 
three years, a portion of which are subject to the satisfaction of certain financial performance criteria. The total number of Consideration 
Shares issued to the vendors was 3,163,633.
The FANS Platform is a fully-integrated solution which helps venues and content providers engage their fans while monetising these services. 
It is a white-label, multi-level mobile wallet system including a management software and analytics suite, as well as operational and public 
apps. It can identify users based on mobile behaviour, providing invaluable consumption metrics.

FANS provides the Group with a proven technology platform and an experienced management team that will remain in place. FANS  
has leading clients in the sports and entertainment sectors in Canada and other high-profile venues and events. The acquisition further 
strengthens Paysafe’s position in the mobile sector of the online payments industry and also provides an entry point into the events market.

1. At closing date, the number of Paysafe Group PLC shares equal to CAD $16,000,000 was determined to be 3,163,633 shares, of which 790,098 are contingent upon the satisfaction  
of certain financial performance criteria. The estimated fair value of this deferred and contingent consideration at the acquisition date was determined using liquidity discounts 
reflecting the lack of marketability during the lockup period. During the year ended 31 December 2015, 611,663 shares of the deferred consideration were issued for a value of 
$2,232,000 (Note 14). 
2. Prior to acquiring FANS, a company within the Group made an interest-bearing loan in the amount of $1,112,000 to FANS in support of its operating working capital requirements. 
Following the acquisition, the amounts were eliminated upon consolidation.
FANS revenues of $230,000 and net loss incurred of $839,000 are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the 
date of acquisition. The Group’s consolidated revenues and net loss for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have included $375,000 and 
$1,369,000, respectively, had the FANS acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $327,000 during the year ended 31 December 2015, which were expensed  
in the period relating to this transaction.
iii) Meritus and GMA
On 23 July 2014, Paysafe Group, through its subsidiaries Paysafe Services (US) Corp and Paysafe Services (US) LLC (formerly NBX Services 
Corp and NetBX Services LLC respectively), acquired all of the partnership interests of Paysafe Partners L.P . (formerly TK Global Partners L.P ., 
doing business as Meritus Payment Solutions or “Meritus”), a California based payment processing entity. The total consideration agreed 
upon of $210,000,000 on the closing date consisted of $150,000,000 in cash and $60,000,000 of Paysafe Group PLC shares and/or cash to be 
issued in equal tranches over four years commencing on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to customary closing adjustments 
(“Share consideration payable”). Concurrent with the execution of the Meritus purchase agreement, Paysafe Services (US) Corp. (“the Buyer”) 
bought all the outstanding limited and general partnership interest of Meritus (“the Seller”) in Global Merchant Advisors, Inc. (“GMA”), a US 
based online payments company.
At closing date, the number of Paysafe Group shares equal to $60,000,000 was determined to be 8,954,621 shares, and the estimated  
fair value of this share consideration payable determined through single-factor Monte Carlo valuation model was $76,090,000.
On the same date, Paysafe Services (US) LLC acquired the trade and assets of GMA for $15,000,000 in cash, $10,000,000 of which was paid  
at closing date and the balance of $5,000,000 to be paid based on future performance of the business (“Contingent consideration”). As the 
minimum performance targets were met during the year ended 31 December 2015, the contingent consideration was paid for the full 
amount of $5,000,000.

i) Fair values
The Group estimates the fair value of its financial instruments based on current interest rates, market value and pricing of financial 
instruments with comparable terms.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as reserves, trade receivables, contingent 
consideration, merchant processing liabilities, and trade and other payables approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature  
of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt also approximates its fair value as there has been no significant movement  
in counterparty credit risk and market interest rates for debts and leases with similar maturity dates and terms.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 26. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
ii) Credit risk and concentrations
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a member or merchant counter party to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash, cash held as 
reserves and trade receivables. The cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash and cash held as reserves are deposited 
with major financial institutions which the Group’s management believes to be financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risks  
exist with respect to these assets. 
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that its members and merchants may charge back credit card purchases. The Group 
manages the exposure to credit risk by employing various online identification verification techniques, enacted transaction limits and  
having a significant number of members and merchants. As these members are geographically widespread and the merchants are active  
in various industries, the exposure to credit risk and concentration is mitigated. 
As at the reporting date, the maximum credit exposure of the Group’s financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following:
Neither past  
due or impaired 
$
Past due: 
1-30 days 
$
Past due:

Impairment loss recognised during the year 7,743

Balance at 31 December 2015 13,502
iii) Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that investment revenue earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash,  
and interest expense incurred on long-term debt are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited 
as investments are held in liquid and short-term funds. In addition, an interest rate swap has been entered into in order to mitigate the risk of 
interest rates rising on the Term A facility, for which a loss of $299,000 was recorded during the year. The Group is also investigating hedging 
strategies to further reduce the risk from interest rate volatility in future years. A sensitivity analysis has been performed whereby a 1% increase  
in interest rates offered would result in a $1,344,000 (31 December 2014: $2,613,000) unfavourable impact on net earnings while a 1% decrease 
would result in a $2,318,000 (31 December 2014: $688,000) favourable impact on net earnings.

iv) Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk due to financial assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, 
primarily the Great British Pound (“GBP”), the EURO (“EUR”), the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”), and the Hong Kong Dollar (“HKD”). The Group 
manages the exposure to currency risk by commercially transacting in US Dollars and by limiting the use of other currencies for operating 
expenses, wherever possible, thereby minimising the realised and unrealised foreign exchange gain/(loss). The Group also enters into foreign 
currency forward exchange contracts in order to mitigate the risk on certain smaller currencies. As at 31 December 2015 the Group had the 
following exchange contracts outstanding;
Forward exchange contracts Nominal Value

constant, the net assets of the Group would have been decreased in both profit and equity by US $4,413,000 (31 December 2014: $471,000).  
A weakening of the US Dollar by 1% against the above currencies would have had an equal and opposite effect.

v) Market segment risk 
Market segment risk may arise due to adverse changes in legislation relating to internet, payment processing or on-line gambling. The Group 
is exposed to market segment risk to the extent that legislation impacts operational presence and related revenue streams, which may be 
significant. The Group manages this exposure through geographical diversification and participation in non gambling sources of revenue. 
The Group closely monitors local legislation in key markets (new or existing) and does not have economic reliance on any one country.
vi) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Management controls and monitors 
the Group’s cash flow on a regular basis, including forecasting future cash flows. The Group’s objective to managing liquidity is to ensure  
that, as far as possible, it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet the liabilities when they become due.

The Group holds cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets of $169,743,000 (2014: $139,741,000) as well as trade and other receivable of 
$31,198,000 (2014: $14,712,000). The Group also has available $85,000,000 from its revolving credit facility (2014: $4,000,000). Given the Group’s 
available liquid resources as compared to the timing of the payments of liabilities, management assesses the Group’s liquidity risk to be low.
vii) Risk management assets and liabilities 
Risks are identified, evaluated and mitigated through a combination of a “top down” approach driven by both the Audit Committee and the 
Board of Directors. These are aggregated into a Risk Management framework where the risks are prioritised and assigned to the executive for 
monitoring and risk mitigation. The Group Internal Audit function undertakes regular reviews of the controls that are in place to mitigate risk. 
The Group enters into financial instruments through forward currency contracts that fix the net asset or liability position for significant 
currencies held on the statement of financial position.
viii) Capital disclosure
The Group’s capital structure is comprised of shareholders’ equity, deferred and contingent consideration as well as secured credit  
facilities as required to fund business and asset acquisitions. The Group’s objective when managing its capital structure is to finance 
internally generated growth and maintain financial flexibility including access to capital markets. To manage its capital structure the  
Group may adjust capital spending, issue new shares, or acquire short-term financing.
ix) Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern, while maximising  
the return to stakeholders through optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which 
includes the borrowings as disclosed in Note 13, and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising reserves and retained earnings 
as disclosed. The Board reviews the capital structure and, as part of this review, considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with 
each class of capital. In addition the Board of Directors considers the liquidity and solvency of the Group on an ongoing basis. The primary 
measure used by the Group to monitor its financial leverage is its ratio of net debt to equity, where net debt includes long-term debt and 
contingent consideration reduced by cash and cash equivalents, settlement assets, restricted cash and cash held as reserves, and equity 
includes the share consideration payable in accordance with the terms of the Group’s credit facility (Note 13).

From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of the claims and 
actions and no provision or disclosure is made where the Directors feel, based on that advice, the action is unlikely to result in a material loss or  
a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
As at 31 December 2015, NetBanx Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, has net current liabilities. Paysafe Group PLC will continue to provide 
financial support to enable NetBanx Limited to meet its existing and future liabilities and continue as a going concern.

In February 2016, a subsidiary of the Group, Paysafe Services (US) Corp, purchased certain assets of MeritCard Solutions LP (‘MeritCard’), 
in exchange for cash consideration of $15,951,000 and an additional $4,050,000 cash consideration subject to the achievement of certain 
financial performance targets. MeritCard is a Dallas-based payments business that specialises in building relationships with small to 
medium-sized independent sales organisations, sales and bank agents as well as third party vendors. The deal is expected to help the  
Group continue to expand its customer base while further diversifying its risk portfolio in the Payment Processing division. The fair value 
assessment of the acquired assets had not yet been finalised as of the issue of these financial statements and has therefore not  
been disclosed. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
www.paysafe.com
105 The Directors present their Annual Report on the 
affairs of the Company and the Group, together 
with the audited Group financial statements and 
Independent Auditor’s report for the year ended  
31 December 2015.
This Directors’ report covers regulatory, statutory and 
other information and incorporates the Strategic report 
and the Governance report, which are set out earlier in 
this Annual Report, by reference. 
Strategic report and Governance report
A review of the current and future development of  
the Group’s business is given in the Strategic report on 
pages 8 to 31. The Group’s financial and risk management 
objectives and policies are discussed in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s review and Risk management section starting on 
page 18. Information on key performance indicators is  
set out on pages 8 to 9. The Group’s policies on employee 
matters, health and safety, environmental and community 
issues and business ethics, are discussed in the Corporate 
social responsibility section on pages 30 to 31. 
The Governance report, including the Report of the 
Remuneration Committee, on pages 32 to 59 summarises 
the Company’s governance arrangements and 
remuneration arrangements for Directors. 
All this information forms part of, and by reference  
is incorporated within, this Directors’ report.
Research and development
The Company continues to invest in the development of 
new technologies to further advance its systems. Where 
management is satisfied that a project will generate future 
economic benefits, and the Group intends to, and has 
sufficient resources to, complete development and to  
use or sell the asset, the expenditure is capitalised at cost. 
Further details are in Note 4 to the financial statements. 
Change of control
In the event of a takeover, a scheme of arrangement  
(other than a scheme of arrangement for the purposes of 
creating a new holding company) or certain other events, 
unvested Executive Director and employee share awards 
may, in certain circumstances, become exercisable. Such 
circumstances may, although do not necessarily, depend 
on the achievement of performance conditions or the 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The Company 
does not have any agreements with any Director or officer 
that would provide compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover. 
The Group has facility agreements with its bank lenders 
which contain provisions giving those lenders certain 
rights on a change of control of the Company. In addition, 
certain of the Group’s agreements with acquiring banks 
permit the acquiring bank to terminate the agreement 
upon a change of control of the Company.
Save as otherwise disclosed above, there are no other 
significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control following a takeover bid.
Employment of disabled persons
The Corporate social responsibility section  
on pages 30 to 31 sets out the Company’s policy  
regarding the employment of disabled persons.
Employee consultation
Details on employee consultation are included in the 
Corporate social responsibility section on pages 30 to 31.
Suppliers policy
It is the Group’s policy for each of its contracting  
entities to agree appropriate terms and conditions  
for its transactions with suppliers by means ranging from 
standard written terms to individually negotiated contracts. 
The Group seeks to ensure that payments are always made 
in accordance with such written terms and conditions.

Dennis Jones (Chairman) 
Joel Leonoff (President and CEO)  
Brian McArthur-Muscroft (CFO)  
Andrew Dark  
Ian Francis  
Brahm Gelfand  
Ian Jenks  
Stephen Shaper (resigned 3 August 2015)
Certain key matters in relation to the Directors 
are shown below.
 - The business of the Company is managed by its 
Directors, who may exercise all powers of the Company 
subject to the Company’s Articles of Association and  
Isle of Man legislation. The Directors of the Company  
are appointed either by the Board or by shareholders 
under the Company’s Articles of Association and may 
resign or be removed in a similar manner.
 - Biographical details of the current Directors are set out on

 - No member of the Board had a material interest in  
any contract of significance with the Company or any  
of its subsidiaries at any time during the year, except for 
their interests in shares and in share awards and under 
their service agreements and letters of appointment 
disclosed in the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee, commencing on page 44.
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Paysafe Group plc | Annual Report 2015 Charitable and political donations
A note of the charitable donations made by the  
Company during the year is included in the Corporate 
social responsibility section on page 31. No political 
donations were made by the Company during the year.
Financial instruments
The Group’s overall risk strategy and framework is  
detailed in the Strategic report on pages 8 to 31. The risk 
management policies of the Group regarding credit risk, 
interest rate risk, currency risk, market segment risk, 
capital risk and liquidity risk are set out in Note 26  
to the financial statements.
Results for the year and dividends
The audited financial statements of the Company  
and the Group for 2015 are set out on pages 64 to 105. 
An overview of the development of the business of the 
Group during 2015 is provided in the Strategic report

served by reinvesting the Group’s cash to generate growth

remains under regular review.

Details of significant events affecting the Company since the 
year end are reported in Note 30 to the Financial statements.

their holder is precluded from exercising voting rights  
by the FCA’s Listing Rules or the City Code on  
T akeovers and Mergers.
 - Holders of the deferred shares are not entitled to vote

ordinary share held by them and shall have no  
other right to participate in assets of the Company.
 - The Group operates employee share plans as set out in 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

107 Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Isle of Man company law 
requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial period. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), 
as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements are required by Isle of Man  
law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Company and the Group, and of the profit or loss  
of the Company and the Group for that period. Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that  
this is the case. In preparing the financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
 - select suitable accounting policies and apply  
them consistently;
 - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 - state whether applicable IFRS, as adopted by the 
European Union, have been followed, subject to  
any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the financial statements; and
 - prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper 
accounting records that disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to  
ensure that the financial statements comply with  
the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They  
have general responsibility for taking such steps as  
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets  
of the Company and the Group and to prevent and  
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance  
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from one jurisdiction to another.
Each of the Directors in office at the date of approval of 
this report confirms that to the best of their knowledge:
 - the Annual Report , including the Strategic report, 
Governance report, financial statements and this 
Directors’ report, taken as a whole, is considered  
to be fair, balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s and the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
 - the Company’s financial statements and the Group 
financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Company and the Group.
 - the Strategic report and Governance report, along with 
the Directors’ report, together include a true and fair 
review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group together with  
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
Disclosure of information to the 
Company’s Auditor
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no  
relevant audit information of which the Company’s 
Auditor is unaware. Each Director has taken all the  
steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order  
to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of  
that information.
Going concern
The Directors have made appropriate enquiries and 
reviewed the Group’s cash flow projections, liquidity 
position, business activities and the financial resources 
the Group has available, including borrowing facilities,  
as set out in Note 13 to the financial statements, and the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 
24 to 29. Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable

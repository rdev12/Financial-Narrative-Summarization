04 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
OVERVIEW
The year has seen significant strategic change in the Group with 
the focus on a number of key projects which have positioned 
the Group for further growth against a backdrop of increased
operating efficiencies.
On 6th July 2004 the Group’s 5% shareholding in Premier Direct
Group plc (“Premier”), held since 24th July 2003 and received 
as part of the consideration for the sale of DMG, was sold for 
£1.2 million cash – a profit of £0.9 million. The Group has now
received a total of £4.9 million in cash from the disposal of DMG, 
an increase against the £4.1 million referred to at the time of the
announcement of the disposal. 
The relocation of Kleeneze UK from its historic site to its new
modern distribution centre was completed over Easter 2004. This
move provides Kleeneze UK with the capacity to increase its sales
significantly at the same time as improving operating efficiencies.
The total investment of £2.8 million was fully funded from the 
£4.0 million cash proceeds from the disposal of the previous site.
Following the move to the new site, Kleeneze UK now has the
capacity and the improved systems to fulfil orders outside the UK
and Ireland. Hence, at the Annual Conference on 5th June 2004,
the initial expansion into continental Europe was announced with
the launch of Kleeneze UK’s Dutch operation, an initiative that has 
been explored over many months and is now in a position to be
effectively implemented. The recruitment of Dutch distributors
started on 5th July 2004 with sales commencing in early
September to take advantage of Christmas trading.
Taking account of the strategic changes being undertaken at
Kleeneze UK and its importance to the Group, William Rollason 
has taken over direct management responsibility for Kleeneze UK,
heading up the established management team.
At Farepak the medium term decline in hamper sales continues and
more focus is being directed on reducing fixed overheads to take
account of the change in mix from hampers to shopping vouchers.
Overall, the year has been one of consolidation and laying the
foundations for future growth both from existing operations and
new initiatives. The Group is now in a much stronger position, 
both financially and operationally, and we look to the future 
with confidence. 05 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
Turnover on continuing operations decreased by 3.2% year on year,
in part reflecting the disruption experienced in service and delivery
levels during the period of transition to the new distribution facility 
at Kleeneze UK. Despite this slight decrease in sales, operating
profit on continuing operations has increased by 1% during the year
to £7.9 million (2003: £7.8 million). This reflects improvements in 
the operating profit margins in both businesses as cost efficiencies
start to be realised. 
Profit before tax on continuing operations before exceptional items
remains unchanged since last year at £8.2 million. Exceptional and
non operating items resulted in a loss before tax of £2.0 million in
the year (2003: £36.0 million). These costs include £6.8 million loss
on disposal of DMG. Discontinued operations contributed further
pre-exceptional losses of £2.0 million in the year, significantly
reduced from the pre-exceptional loss after tax of £8.7 million
recorded for DMG in 2003. Normalised basic earnings per share,
calculated on the profits from continuing operations before
exceptional items, increased to 12.8 pence (2003: 12.7 pence).
Basic loss per share was 5.8 pence, a significant improvement 
on the loss per share of 74.7 pence reported in 2003.
The Group’s continuing operations generated net cash from
operating activities in the year of £8.4 million (2003: £12.7 million).
This reduction in cash generation in part reflects the exceptional
costs associated with the transfer of Kleeneze UK to its new
distribution centre.
Net debt decreased to £11.2 million at the year end
(2003: £16.0 million). At 30th April 2004, the Group had net
liabilities of £12.8 million (2003: £8.7 million).
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 2 pence per share
(2003: nil), which together with the interim dividend of 1 pence per
share (2003: nil) will result in a total dividend of 3 pence per share
(2003: nil) for the year. The reinstatement of dividends in the year
reflects the improvement in overall results and stability of the Group
following completion of the disposal of DMG.
The dividend is payable on 6th October 2004 to shareholders who
were on the register on 16th July 2004.
STRATEGY
As we set out to last year, we have completed the disposal of 
DMG and re-located Kleeneze UK to its new distribution centre. 
We have also re-instated the dividend and launched Kleeneze UK 
in continental Europe. We will continue our strategy of growing
Kleeneze UK both organically, through increased product ranges
and increased geographic penetration, and by acquisition. At
Farepak, our strategy of increasing its cash generation and
managing the decline of the hamper business, by focussing on the
opportunities in the shopping voucher market and reducing fixed
overheads, will continue.
THE BOARD
George Pollock resigned from the Board and left the Group on
17th December 2003. He worked for the Group for 28 years and
we would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his long
service and dedication.
Chris Hulland and I are standing for re-election by rotation, together
with Stephen Roberts, who has indicated that he will be stepping
down at the Annual General Meeting to be held in September 2005.
PEOPLE
We appreciate that our principal asset is our people and I would 
like to record my thanks to all of them for their continued support
and hard work during the last year. In particular, the re-location of
Kleeneze UK to their new distribution centre was only achieved
through the dedication of everyone who works there.
PROSPECTS
Kleeneze UK’s return to growth should be driven by improved
retention of distributors supported by increased productivity of the
new Main Book. The recent introduction of higher value products
such as Cabouchon jewellery and new branded ranges such as
Norfolk Lavender toiletry products should also drive growth. The
launch into continental Europe should further support the growth
and lay new foundations for the future.
At Farepak the cost base remains the key area of attention as we
continue to focus on operating efficiencies to offset the decline in
hamper volumes.
The Group is highly cash generative and a number of acquisition
opportunities are being reviewed which should further enhance
growth through using our existing infrastructure.
Overall we remain confident about achieving our expectations for
the current year as a strong performance from Kleeneze UK should
more than offset the decline in Farepak.
SIR CLIVE THOMPSON
CHAIRMAN
13TH AUGUST 2004 06 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
KLEENEZE UK PROVIDES GOOD VALUE, EVERYDAY PRODUCTS 
THROUGH CATALOGUES DELIVERED DIRECT TO THE HOME BY 
SELF-EMPLOYED DISTRIBUTORS CURRENTLY COVERING THE UK 
AND THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND.
Turnover at Kleeneze UK fell by 4% to £82.6 million
(2003: £86.3 million) and operating profit before exceptional 
items was stable at £6.6 million (2003: £6.6 million), an increased
operating margin of 8.0% (2003: 7.6%).
The fall in turnover resulted from a reduction in the average number
of active distributors from 16,900 last year to 14,900 this year
together with the short disruption to service levels during the move
to the new distribution centre. We continue to recruit nearly 2,000
distributors each month, but the activation and then retention rates
of distributors year on year has fallen. We believe that this fall in
distributor numbers has been driven mainly by the macro-economic
environment where there is a ready availability of cheap credit.
However, the recent rises in interest rates and the predicted future
rises should help to reverse this effect.
We are changing the way in which we support our distributors by
strengthening the network support roles to ensure that we can
react more quickly to issues that affect both activation and retention.
The retention rate amongst the top 5,000 distributors remains high
as our compensation plan is considered one of the best in the 
UK market place. Our new distribution centre has a modern training
facility and we are increasing both the number and quality of
training programmes offered to our distributors. Over 200 team
leaders are trained every month.
The fall in active distributors has, in part, been offset by a 20%
increase in average sales rate (“ASR”) which is defined as the
average period sales per ordering distributor. ASR has increased
from £510 to £610 since last year. This has partly been driven 
by the continual review of the product range undertaken by the
management team at Kleeneze UK. The Health & Beauty
catalogue, launched in May 2004, incorporates a selection of
Cabouchon branded jewellery for the first time. In June 2004,
Kleeneze UK also launched a range of products from Norfolk
Lavender which have further enhanced the offering.
Kleeneze UK has taken steps to increase the speed to market for 
a number of popular products through the introduction of ‘flyers’ 
to be used by the network. Our most successful flyer this year
featured a range of shredders, which built on the public concern
over personal confidentiality of domestic bills and papers. We 
were able to strengthen this message by utilising our association
with the National Neighbourhood Watch Association (“NNWA”),
who lent their endorsement to this initiative.
Our association with the NNWA is now in its sixth year and has
considerable mutual benefits. Our distributors swiftly and effectively
distributed key seasonal messages on behalf of the NNWA and in
addition Kleeneze UK publishes factsheets for NNWA members 
to use at their local meetings. Kleeneze UK distributors are provided
with best practice photo identification cards, which give added
reassurance on the doorstep. The relationship with NNWA also
provides us with the platform to develop our sponsorship of
Britain’s Best Neighbour Award.
The move to our new distribution centre in Bristol, successfully
completed in April 2004, has enabled us to introduce bar coding
across the product range which has improved both the efficiency
and the accuracy of our order fulfilment. This is driving operational
savings, both in terms of people and stock, and some of the
benefits have already been realised, which has contributed to the
increase in our operating margins from 7.6% to 8.0%. The full
benefits will be seen in the current year.
At the annual Kleeneze UK conference in June 2004, we announced
our first expansion into continental Europe with the launch of our
Dutch operation. Recruitment of Dutch distributors started in early
July and our first orders will be delivered in September 2004. We
are excited by the potential in Holland as there are 6.9 million
households in Holland compared to 24.5 million households in the
UK and 1.3 million in Ireland. Network marketing is a well established
concept in Holland and our extensive research has shown that our
product range should be well received. We anticipate having over
1,000 distributors in place in Holland by September 2004 and see
this as our first step into continental Europe.
To reflect the strategic changes that are being undertaken at
Kleeneze UK, I have taken responsibility for the business. As 
a result Ian Doherty, the Managing Director of Kleeneze UK, left in
July 2004. I would like to thank Ian for his valuable contribution 
to the growth of Kleeneze UK since he joined in August 2001 and
wish him well for the future.
Kleeneze UK is a dynamic business, which has the potential to
grow significantly in the UK in addition to the huge market that
continental Europe offers. The increased capacity of our new
distribution centre provides us with a solid operational base to
support this significant growth potential and we look to the future
with confidence.

FAREPAK OPERATES UNDER TWO BRANDS, FAREPAK FOOD & GIFTS AND

Turnover at Farepak fell 2% to £76.3 million (2003: £77.9 million),
however, operating profit was up to £1.3 million (2003: £1.2 million),
an increased operating margin of 1.6% (2003: 1.3%).
Our agent numbers fell to 59,000 (2003: 63,000) reflecting lower
recruitment of new agents in a very competitive environment.
Encouragingly our retention rate of existing agents remained steady
at 71%. We are pleased to have held the retention rates of our long
established agents steady in what was a very aggressive year for
the recruitment of both new and existing agents.
The medium term decline in hampers continues and shopping
vouchers now represent 76% of our total sales (2003: 74%). This 
is likely to increase in the coming years as our customers prefer 
the flexibility that vouchers provide. We are, therefore, focusing 
on vouchers and investing in a new range which we will be
launching later this year for Christmas 2005. These vouchers will 
be targeted at a younger audience and marketed separately from
the main catalogue.
Our reliance on voucher dispatches, of some £60 million per annum,
both for our own business, and our other clients, has seen us
invest in a new voucher dispatch room. This facility is being
marketed to support a number of third party clients in the areas 
of incentives and salary replacement schemes.
Farepak supplies several blue chip companies, including Marks &
Spencer, Littlewoods and Provident. These contracts are secure 
for 2004 and we are seeking to build on this excellent base.
We have undertaken a review of our product range and have
concluded that it is too wide and we have too many individual
components. We have, therefore, reduced the number of individual
line items by over 10% year on year and we are seeking to reduce
this by a further 10% next year. This has not affected the overall
range of hampers that we offer but has enabled us to reduce our
supplier base accordingly.
To reduce our hamper production costs further and to improve service
to our customers we streamlined our management structure to
produce a single logistics team combining three teams into one
which should lead to greater efficiencies.
Operating margins increased to 1.6% (2003: 1.3%) as we
continued to focus on becoming more efficient. We have continued
to encourage our agents to use the internet as a means of
communication as this improves both the accuracy and efficiency 
of the order process. 30% of all communication from agents is now
received via the internet, up from 18% a year ago.
Our cost base has been reduced slightly year on year and we are
currently undertaking a fundamental review of the way in which we
operate to reduce this further. As our higher margin hamper
business continues to decline, we will be converting more of our
fixed costs to variable costs.
Farepak selected Macmillan Cancer Relief as its chosen charity.
Macmillan nationally support cancer care nurses across the country,
each of whom cost £100,000 over 3 years. Our long term aim is to
raise £50,000 through staff ‘fun days’ and agent promotions. Funds
raised by staff will benefit local Swindon Macmillan causes.
Focus on staff training to retain and develop our core staff has
resulted in us obtaining 37 NVQs and other advanced qualifications
in the last two years. For our staff size, of just under 100 permanent
people, we are pleased with this significant enhancement to our
people skills. Government funding has also been obtained, making
the overall cost neutral. We continue to focus on our staff with
practical hands on training in our warehouse, new modern
production management methods and development of our IT 
and customer service skills.
Farepak is a cash generative business operating in a market where
growth is driven by low margin voucher sales. We are re-engineering
the way in which we operate to reflect the changing market place
and offset the medium term decline.

Operating profit before exceptional operating items
Turnover for continuing operations for the year was down 3% at
£158.9m (2003: £164.1m). For the last quarter of the year Kleeneze
UK’s sales were adversely affected by £2.0m due to short term
disruption to service and delivery levels caused by the move to the
new distribution centre. These issues have been resolved since the
year end and service levels are continuing to improve.
Operating profit on continuing operations before exceptional items
was up 1% at £7.9m (2003: £7.8m) – an increased operating margin
of 5.0% (2003: 4.7%) principally reflecting the initial benefits from 
Kleeneze UK’s move to its new distribution centre.
SHARE OF ASSOCIATE
Operating profits from the Group’s associate, Home Farm Hampers
Limited (“Home Farm”), reduced slightly to £0.6m (2003: £0.7m).
INTEREST
The net interest charge was £0.3m in 2004 (2003: £0.3m). Interest
income relating to the Group’s associate was £0.3m in 2004
(2003: £0.3m).
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations reflect the results for DMG. Operating 
losses at DMG were £2.6m (2003: £10.8m).

Profit before tax for continuing operations before exceptional items
was unchanged at £8.2m.

£1.1m relates to the costs incurred during the transfer of operations
in Kleeneze UK to the new warehouse and fulfilment centre in Bristol.
The new site was fully operational at Easter 2004.
NON OPERATING EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
During the year, Kleeneze UK disposed of freehold premises for cash
proceeds of £4.0m. The net book value of fixed assets disposed 
of was £2.5m and the costs of disposal were £0.3m.
The loss on disposal of discontinued operations of £6.8m related 
to DMG. The total cash consideration received for the business 
was £3.7m. In addition, 190,763 Ordinary shares in Premier were
received. These shares have been included in the balance sheet 
at 30th April 2004 at the market value on the date of acquisition 
of £0.3m. 
TAX
An analysis of the taxation charge is set out in note 8. The total
taxation charge as a percentage of the loss before tax was 31%. 
The tax charge for continuing operations in 2004 represents 27% 
of profits before tax and exceptional items.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Normalised basic earnings per share were up 1% to 12.8 pence
(2003: 12.7 pence).
Basic loss per share was significantly reduced to 5.8 pence 
(2003: loss of 74.7 pence).

INITIATIVE No.5 INITIATIVE No.5 INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest income is earned on cash deposits with UK high street
banks at variable interest rates and balances due from Kleeneze 
UK distributors. 
Interest is payable on the Group’s borrowings at a variable rate
based on the Bank of Scotland’s base rate. The loan notes bear
interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
Kleeneze UK purchases around 50% of its product range from
overseas suppliers who usually invoice in US dollars. Forward
currency contracts are negotiated in order to limit currency
exposure over a rolling six month period and the effect of these
contracts at 30th April 2004 is given in note 25.
Both of the Group’s principal businesses trade in the United
Kingdom. Kleeneze UK also trades in the Republic of Ireland where
income is denominated in Euros; although the majority of operating
costs are denominated in sterling. Exchange differences arise on
currency balances held in Euros.

DIVIDENDS
The Group declared an interim dividend of 1p per share in 
December 2003 (2003: nil), a final dividend of 2p per share is
proposed (2003: nil).
CASH AND BORROWINGS
The Group had net debt of £11.2m as at 30th April 2004
(2003: £16.0m). Proceeds from the sale of the previous Kleeneze 
UK premises (£4.0m) and the disposal of DMG (£3.7m) were in part
offset by the capital spend on the new distribution centre (£2.8m)
and the costs of disposal of DMG (£2.7m).
The Group’s committed borrowing facilities of £40.0m expire on
31st October 2006 and are more than sufficient to provide for its
financial requirements for the foreseeable future. At 30th April 2004,
the overdraft with Bank of Scotland, drawn under these facilities
was £11.6m (2003: £17.4m).
Bank of Scotland has rights to offset cash balances against
overdrafts within all subsidiaries. At the year end, the Group had
£nil on short term deposits with Bank of Scotland (2003: US$6.9m)
and this has been offset against sterling overdrafts shown in the
consolidated balance sheet.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
The shareholders’ deficit at 30th April 2004 is £12.8m (2003: £8.7m).
In particular the increase in deficit year on year reflects the £6.8m
non operating loss on disposal of DMG together with trading losses
on discontinued operations of £2.6m.
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives,
comprise preference shares, bank overdrafts, loans and cash. There
are also various other operating financial instruments, such as trade
debtors and trade creditors.
The Group enters into derivative transactions (principally forward
currency contracts) in order to manage the currency risks that arise
from trading. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Major risks associated with the Group’s financial instruments arise
from interest rate and foreign currency movements. The Board’s
policies in respect of these risks are summarised below and are
unchanged from last year. Movements in the market values of
financial instruments during the year are shown in note 25.
The directors regularly review cash, loan and overdraft balances 
to ensure that facilities are sufficient to cover the Group’s 
financing requirements.

CORPORATE SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
People form the heart of our business – not just our customers and
employees, but also our distributors, agents, shareholders, suppliers,
and the local communities in which we operate. As stakeholders in
our business, they expect us to operate our business in an ethical
and socially responsible manner. Our dedication to this principle
remains as strong as ever and this past year we made further
progress in ensuring that we continue to conduct our business as
good corporate citizens.
ENVIRONMENT
We believe that businesses can thrive whilst sustaining the
environment in which they operate. Most of the activities involved in
running a business will have some impact on our environment and
so we are committed to taking active steps to minimise this impact.
Our Environmental Policy crystallises our commitment to maintaining
and promoting sound environmental practices. We intend to:
Comply with, and where possible perform better than, all
relevant environmental laws and regulations.
Consider the environment in all strategic business decisions.
Establish key environmental objectives that will allow us to
minimise our impact on the environment.
Set targets to meet our key environmental objectives and
measure our performance against these targets year on year.
Report to our stakeholders on our environmental performance.
Our principal environmental objectives are to:
Minimise our consumption of energy in the day-to-day
operations of our business.
Reduce our creation of waste via recycling initiatives.
Maximise our usage of recycled materials for packaging.
Avoid environmental pollution.
Encourage our suppliers to adopt similar environmental standards
in order to help improve their own environmental performance.
This year we took further positive action to advance our
commitment to the environment. The construction of our new
offices and distribution centre was carried out with full consideration
given to environmental impact. This included the installation of
environmentally efficient heating and lighting systems, designed to
minimise energy consumption, and the development of a “green
travel plan” designed to promote the adoption amongst our staff 
of environmentally friendly modes of transport to and from work.
PEOPLE
The key differentiator in our business is our people. We, therefore,
seek to create a positive working environment that allows them to
grow and develop as individuals. Training is an important part of this
development and we encourage employees to take advantage of
internal and external training opportunities. As part of this process,
our appraisal programme identifies staff training requirements and
provides them with appropriate training to further their development.
We have also introduced a whistle blowing policy which provides 
all members of staff with a secure avenue of recourse should they
have concerns regarding the ethical conduct of the Group or any 
of its representatives.
COMMUNITY
We have a long history of community involvement including:
A close relationship with the National Neighbourhood Watch
Association (“NNWA”) actively promoting its principles through
our network of distributors in an effort to reduce the levels of
crime on our streets. We are the only direct retailer endorsed
by the NNWA.
The sponsorship and organisation of Britain’s Best Neighbour
Award in conjunction with the NNWA. This award, now in its
tenth year, is designed to highlight the positive actions of
individuals in their communities.
Over the course of the year we raised £13,000 for Farepak’s
selected partner charity, Macmillan Cancer Relief.
INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT
We believe in encouraging other businesses in our industry to adopt
and abide by similarly high standards of corporate practice. We,
therefore, actively participate in the development and evolution of
industry policy via our involvement with trade and industry bodies
such as the Direct Selling Association (“DSA”) and the Hamper
Industry Trade Association. We are Founding Members of both
these associations and most recently we organised and hosted 
the 2004 DSA Conference.
ETHICAL TRADING
We endeavour to apply the principles of fair and ethical trading in all
our business areas. An ethical trading policy has been incorporated
into our standard terms and conditions for suppliers. As much of
our product is sourced abroad, we have made efforts to increase
the numbers of suppliers that we deal with directly as this allows us
further control in ensuring that they abide by our ethical standards.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH APRIL 2004
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
The Board has delegated responsibility for establishing remuneration policy and the remuneration of the executive directors to the
Remuneration Committee. The members of the Remuneration Committee were:
Sir Clive Thompson (Chairman)
Neil Gillis (appointed 13th August 2003)
Paul Munn
Stephen Roberts
The Remuneration Committee has not taken specific advice relating to directors’ remuneration directly from external advisors but has used
the committee members’ wide knowledge of current good practice. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
In framing its policy, the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to the Combined Code. The remuneration policy is designed,
by reference to listed public companies of similar size and financial record, to attract, retain and motivate the executive directors. The policy
is intended to provide both a fixed salary and short term and long term benefits through inclusion of performance-related bonuses and 
share options. 
The policy in relation to subsequent years will be kept under review to ensure that it reflects changing circumstances. The Chairman and
executive directors consider fees in respect of the non-executive directors. The Chairman’s fees are considered by Board members
excluding the Chairman. In addition the Committee reviews the salaries of senior management. The remuneration policy remains unchanged
for the financial year ending 30th April 2005 but performance criteria are designed to be flexible and allow for specific targets to be set in
the light of new developments. 
Emoluments consist of annual salary, fees, pension and other non-cash benefits, which include health insurance and car benefits.
Fees and salaries are reviewed annually and are not directly related to performance. The level of fees and remuneration for each director 
is designed to provide a competitive remuneration package to attract and retain quality individuals.
The Remuneration Committee is sensitive to the wider scene, including pay and conditions throughout the Group, especially when
determining annual salary increases.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUS
On 1st July 2004, the Remuneration Committee determined specific performance bonuses related to the successful disposal of DMG to
the executive directors in respect of the financial year ended 30th April 2004 as follows:
£
William Rollason 75,000
Chris Hulland 20,000
Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson 7,500
102,500
There were no bonuses in respect of the financial year ended 30th April 2003.
Bonus payments do not form part of pensionable emoluments.
For the financial year ending 30th April 2005, bonus arrangements in respect of William Rollason, Chris Hulland and Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson
are dependent upon growth in normalised earnings per share. The maximum bonuses are:
Percentage of salary
William Rollason 75
Chris Hulland 40
Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson 30
OTHER BENEFITS
William Rollason and Chris Hulland are entitled to death in service benefit of four times salary and to permanent health insurance cover
which applies after six months’ continuous absence due to illness. Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson is entitled to death in service benefit of 
three times salary.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
Executive directors have service contracts with the Company. These are rolling contracts which continue unless terminated in accordance
with the terms of the contract. These agreements are summarised as follows:
Compensation on termination by the 
Name Date of agreement Notice periods Company without notice or cause
William Rollason 8th January 2003 6 months from the director; 150% of basic annual salary 
12 months from the Company at the date of termination
Chris Hulland 13th November 2002 6 months from the director; 150% of basic annual salary 
12 months from the Company at the date of termination
Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson 4th March 2002 3 months from either side 3 months’ salary at date of termination 17 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / REMUNERATION REPORT
Sir Clive Thompson has a rolling service contract, dated 5th April 2003, which provides for a notice period of 12 months from either
Sir Clive Thompson or the Company.
The terms of the directors’ service contracts have been set to reflect market practice and provide contractual protection for the
directors that is fair and in the interests of shareholders. Compensation payments on termination of directors’ contracts will only be
made where the circumstances surrounding the departure of the relevant director justify such payments. Compensation will not apply
where the director’s departure is due to poor performance.
Neil Gillis and Paul Munn have letters of appointment dated 8th August 2003 and 26th September 2002 respectively, which do not allow
for any notice period. Stephen Roberts does not have a letter of appointment.
There are no pre-determined special provisions for non-executive directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.
All non-executive directors are subject to triennial re-election at the Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee considers
nominations in respect of Board appointments.
SHARE OPTIONS
Share options granted to directors are set out later in this report. It is the Board’s intention that share options, other than those issued in
relation to the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, will be issued subject to performance criteria to be determined at the time of issue.
The performance criteria for options that have been granted to directors are set out later in this report.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that share price improvement should be a priority for the Chief Executive and his
remuneration package has been appropriately structured. The Committee considers that a continuing improvement in the share price
is important to all shareholders and is one of the best measures to assess the performance of the Chief Executive.
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
The following graph shows the Company’s performance between 1st May 1999 and 30th April 2004, measured by total shareholder 
return, assuming that dividends are re-invested on the ex-dividend date, compared with the performance of the FTSE Small Cap index,
also measured by total shareholder return. The FTSE Small Cap Index has been selected for this comparison as the directors believe that
this is the most appropriate benchmark.

The Company operates share option schemes for executive directors and other senior management. Options are normally exercisable
between three and ten years after the date of grant. There are a limited set of circumstances such as leaving employment due to injury,

Share options awarded by the Remuneration Committee may be conditional on the Company’s future performance.
(1)
Options issued under the Kleeneze 1996 Discretionary Share Option Scheme, exercisable in the event that the increase in earnings per

equal to the market price on the date of the grant, may only be exercised if the share price at the time of exercise exceeds the target price

of office with the exception of George Pollock who did not attend the meetings held on 24th July 2003, 17th September 2003, 
15th October 2003, 19th November 2003 and 10th December 2003 due to ill health. The Audit Committee met on 10th December 2003
and 1st July 2004, the Remuneration Committee met on 26th May 2004 and the Nomination Committee met on 30th July 2003. 
All committee members attended every meeting during their term of office.
BOARD COMMITTEES
There are currently three sub-committees of the Board: the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination
Committee. During committee meetings, the non-executive directors have the opportunity to meet without the presence of the executive
directors. The role and function of the committees is as follows:
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include the approval of interim and final financial statements, review of accounting policies
and the monitoring of the Group’s internal controls. The committee’s terms of reference also include keeping under review the scope
and results of the audit and its cost effectiveness, the auditors’ independence and objectivity and reviewing the nature and extent of
non-audit services provided by the auditors (seeking always to balance the maintenance of objectivity and value for money).
The executive directors and the Group’s external auditors attend by invitation. This committee comprises Paul Munn (Chairman), 
Sir Clive Thompson, Neil Gillis (appointed 13th August 2003) and Stephen Roberts.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Director’s Remuneration Report is set out on pages 16 to 19. It is the role of the Remuneration Committee to set the 
remuneration levels and performance related incentives for the executive directors and various senior managers in the Group and
oversees the Group’s share option schemes. The members of this committee are Sir Clive Thompson (Chairman), Neil Gillis (appointed
13th August 2003), Paul Munn and Stephen Roberts.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
This committee is responsible for recommending Board appointments. The members of this committee are Sir Clive Thompson
(Chairman), William Rollason, Neil Gillis (appointed 13th August 2003), Paul Munn, and Stephen Roberts
INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors are responsible for the Group’s systems of internal control, which are designed to safeguard shareholders’ investment and
the assets of the Group. The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the system of controls and reports its findings to the Board.
These control systems cover the safeguarding of assets, maintenance of proper accounting records and reliability of financial information
used by the business. Such procedures can only be relied upon to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material errors, losses or frauds. These procedures have been in
place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this report. 
The key procedures that the directors have established are regularly reviewed and are designed to provide effective control within the
Group and accord with the Internal Control Guidance on the Combined Code issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales. 
The major aspects of the Group’s internal control systems are summarised below:
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
The Group consists of two operating subsidiaries, each with its own management and control procedures. The executive directors are
actively involved in the management of both Group businesses and the implementation of their internal controls. Meetings are regularly
held with operational management during which trading results are reviewed, business risks are assessed and procedures are set in
place to minimise or control those risks. Formal reviews are carried out monthly. 
Procedures exist to ensure the approval of significant financial commitments and expenses by appropriate executive personnel. 
RISK ASSESSMENT
There is a re-assessment of business risks on an annual basis. This is carried out by the operational management and reviewed by the
Board. The Audit Committee reviews the way in which the assessment has been carried out and reviewed to ensure that the procedure
will allow for the identification of all major risks. These reports cover the key risks which impact upon the trading performance of each
business. Additional internal reports are prepared as required by the operational management and are reviewed by the executive
directors and senior executives. 
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
An annual budget is prepared by the operational management before the start of each financial year. This is reviewed by the Board to
ensure that it adheres to the Group’s overall strategy and that it is robust in its preparation. Detailed monthly accounts are compared
against budget and forecast results with projections for the financial year being made quarterly or more frequently if necessary. Major
variances from the forecast are analysed promptly and remedial action taken where appropriate. 
22 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS 23 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
Analyses of sales and cash movements are reviewed weekly by the executive directors.
Key performance indicators are produced monthly by each operating unit and are used to assess the achievement of business objectives.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE OF BEST PRACTICE
In the following respects the Company has not, throughout the whole of the financial year ended 30th April 2004, complied with section 1
of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance:
There is no letter of appointment for Stephen Roberts for his services as a director.
The Remuneration Committee comprised Sir Clive Thompson, Neil Gillis, Paul Munn and Stephen Roberts who, under the provisions
of the Code, may not be treated as an independent director. The committee composition is under review.
The Audit Committee is not comprised of a majority of independent non-executive directors as Stephen Roberts is not considered to
be independent for the purposes of the Combined Code.
As set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, directors’ fees and salaries are not directly related to performance (as required by
Section B.1.4 of the Combined Code). The level of fees and remuneration for each director is designed to provide a competitive
remuneration package to attract and retain quality individuals. 
Further, as also set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee has not taken specific advice relating to
directors’ remuneration directly from external advisers, but has used the committee members’ wide knowledge of current good practice.
The Company has not appointed a senior independent director.
GOING CONCERN
After making suitable enquiries, the directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of £3,800 (2003: nil).
EMPLOYEES
It is the policy of the Company to provide employment equality to all employees irrespective of race, ethnic origin, nationality, gender,
marital or family status, disability, religious belief, political opinion or sexual orientation. The Group keeps employees informed of matters
which affect them.
ALLOTMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES
A resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to replace the existing authority of the directors to exercise the powers of the
Company to allot relevant securities with authority to do the same for a period of one year and to extend for a further year the authority of
the directors to allot equity securities for cash other than strictly in accordance with the statutory pre-emption provisions.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
The Company agrees terms of payment with suppliers prior to the supply of goods or services. The Company’s policy is to observe all
contracted commitments including terms of payment. At 30th April 2004, the Company did not have any trade creditors (2003: nil).
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 29th September 2004 at the Butchers’ Hall, 87 Bartholomew Close, London
EC1A 7EB commencing at 12.00 noon. Further details are contained in the notice of the Annual General Meeting sent to shareholders.
AUDITORS
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditor will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.

13TH AUGUST 2004 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH APRIL 2004
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the Group at the end of that financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing
those financial statements the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial
position of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
24 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 25 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF KLEENEZE plc
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO 
THE MEMBERS OF KLEENEZE plc
We have audited the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30th April 2004 which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss
Account, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Consolidated Statement of Total
Recognised Gains and Losses, Reconciliation of Movement on Shareholders’ Funds and the related notes 1 to 29. These financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements which are required to be prepared in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards as set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in
relation to the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Report of the Directors is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law or the Listing Rules regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises the Report of the Directors, the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, Chairman’s
Statement, Chief Executive’s Review, Operating and Financial Review and Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 30th April 2004 and of the
loss of the Group for the year then ended; and
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH APRIL 2004
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain freehold land
and buildings and certain investments in subsidiary undertakings, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
For the purpose of the preparation of the Group accounts, references made to Group subsidiary companies and the associated company
relate to subsidiary undertakings and the associated undertaking of the Group respectively, as defined by the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Kleeneze plc and all its subsidiary companies made up to 30th April 2004
together with its associated company made up to 31st March 2004.
GOODWILL
Goodwill on consolidation arises under acquisition accounting and represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over
the fair value of the underlying net assets of subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 30th April 1998 was transferred to reserves in the year in which it arose. Upon the implementation
of FRS10 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill previously eliminated against reserves was not re-instated but will be charged to the
profit and loss account if the businesses to which it relates were to be disposed of. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1st May 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight
line basis over its economical life up to a maximum of 20 years. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year
following acquisition and in other periods if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
ASSOCIATED COMPANY
A company is treated as an associated company when the Group:
holds a participating interest in it for the long term; and
exercises a significant influence over its operating and financial policy decisions.
The Group’s share of the results of its associated company is included in the consolidated profit and loss account. The investment in the
associated company included in the consolidated balance sheet is based on the Group’s share of the net assets of that company.
TURNOVER
Group turnover represents sales to external customers at invoiced amounts less value-added tax. Sales by the associated company are
not included.
DEPRECIATION 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of all tangible fixed assets over their expected
useful lives on a straight-line basis. Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated at the following rates: 
Freehold buildings – 2% per annum 
Leasehold land and buildings – Depreciated over the remaining life of the leases 
Plant and equipment – 10%-25% per annum 
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum 
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable.
OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES
Costs and expenses grouped under Other Operating Expenses include marketing expenditure, depreciation and property costs.
STOCKS
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes direct expenditure and a proportion of overhead expenses
where applicable.
PENSIONS
Pension costs for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of
pensions over the employees’ estimated working lives with the Group.
Contributions payable in respect of the Group’s defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account during the
accounting period to which they relate. 32 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less, or receive a refund
with the following exceptions:
Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (or similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of
fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding
agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the
balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only
where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
LEASING COMMITMENTS
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Foreign currency transactions are recorded at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at year-end exchange rates and resulting exchange differences are dealt with through the
profit and loss account.
The profit and loss account of Kleeneze Ireland, the Group’s only significant overseas subsidiary company, is translated at the average
exchange rate for the year. The balance sheet is translated at the exchange rate ruling at the year end date. The exchange difference
arising on re-translation is taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates. The Group considers its derivative
instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met. 
The criteria for forward foreign currency contracts are:
the instrument must be related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified;
it must involve the same currency as the hedged item; and
it must reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Group’s operations.
The rates under such contracts are used to record the hedged item. As a result, gains and losses are offset against the foreign exchange
gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities, or where the instrument is used to hedge a committed, or probable, future
transaction are deferred until the transaction occurs.

With the exception of £4.5m (2003: £6.0m) which was generated within the Republic of Ireland, all turnover originated within the United
Kingdom. Turnover by destination was not materially different from turnover by source.
Group turnover excludes the Group’s share of the turnover of its associated company, Home Farm. The Group’s share of the turnover of
Home Farm for the year ended 31st March 2004 was £15.0m (2003: £15.4m). Turnover of the Group including Home Farm was £177.2m
(2003: £213.6m).
The net liabilities figure of £12.8m (2003: net liabilities of £8.7m) includes net debt of £11.2m (2003: £16.0m) and tax receivable of 
£nil (2003: £0.9m receivable). Group net liabilities at 30th April 2004 reflect a bank overdraft of £11.6m together with intercompany loan
balances associated with Display Marketing Group Limited (“DMG”). 34 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

a) Included within the segmental results for Kleeneze UK is an exceptional charge of £1.1m. During the year, Kleeneze UK transferred its
warehouse and fulfilment operations to a new site in Bristol. A number of incremental expenses were incurred as part of this relocation
which included a review of operations and internal restructuring. These costs are analysed below:
£0.3m restructuring costs primarily associated with the reorganisation of administrative services and training following the
introduction of new technology in the warehouse;
£0.5m operating costs incurred as a result of the requirement to run operations from two sites during the period of transfer; and
£0.3m in other expenses including the additional storage costs incurred prior to completion of the new location.
£0.5m of the total exceptional charge is included within cost of sales and £0.6m is included within other operating expenses.
b)The exceptional operating expense of £0.9m recorded within the Group reflects the costs associated with the early termination of
George Pollock’s employment contract on 17th December 2003. This charge incorporates his contractual employment costs from
1st May 2003 to 17th December 2003 as well as the costs associated with the early termination of his contract. The exceptional
expense of £0.9m has been included within other operating expenses.
c) The carrying value of the goodwill that arose on the acquisition of DMG was written off in 2003. This resulted in a charge to the profit
and loss account of £33.4m in that year. The exceptional expense of £33.4m has been charged against other operating expenses.

EXCEPTIONAL TAX CREDIT
As stated in the Operating and Financial Review, certain items have been treated as exceptional items within the accounts. This has
created an overall tax credit of £0.9m (2003: £1.1m).
The tax effect in the Profit and Loss Account relating to the exceptional items recognised above operating profit is:

Based on capital expenditure plans, the Group expects that the depreciation charge will exceed available capital allowances in future years.
The Group has not recognised a deferred asset on losses carried forward, which are unavailable, because the losses have arisen within
a subsidiary that is no longer trading and from which the ongoing business has been sold (see note 20).

The Group has adopted the transitional provisions contained within FRS15 – Tangible Fixed Assets. Revalued properties will continue to be
stated at their valuation, which has not been updated.
The Group’s freehold and long leasehold land and buildings (excluding those acquired since 1997) were valued by Gerald Eve, Chartered
Surveyors as at 30th April 1997 at £7.3m on the basis of their existing use value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. This compared with a book value of £7.3m inclusive of the previous valuation, in the accounts
at that date. 40 KLEENEZE plc ANNUAL REPORT 2004 / NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On 7th June 2002, the Group entered into an agreement which gives the Group the right to sell the freehold investment property at an
agreed price of £1.0m on or after 7th June 2005. Rent is receivable until the sale takes place. In the opinion of the directors, the sale will
not take place within the next financial year and, accordingly, the property is being treated as a fixed asset. The property is not being
depreciated as its net book value is equal to fair value.

Performance related options are exercisable in the event that the increase in earnings per share during the period from the date of grant
of options to the date of exercise exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum. The Group believes that the growth
in earnings per share as a performance measure provides a transparent and accessible method of gauging the performance of the
Group. The Group calculates performance against these performance measures by reference to the earnings per share figure appearing
in the Group’s audited accounts.
* Performance related options granted to William Rollason. Details of the performance criteria are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
During the year, 4,322 Ordinary shares were issued for cash of £4,000 through the exercise of options under the Executive Share
Option Scheme.

An explanation of the Group’s objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and other financial instruments, is given in the
Operating and Financial Review. The disclosure below excludes short term debtors and creditors, except where liabilities are denominated
in foreign currencies.
INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

The overdraft bears interest at a floating rate based on the Bank of Scotland base rate. The loan notes bear interest at a rate based 
on LIBOR. The sterling fixed rate liability is interest free and repayable in equal quarterly instalments by June 2007.
Cash deposits denominated in foreign currencies of £0.03m (2003: £4.3m) have been set off in arriving at the net cash shown in note 17
and the net bank overdraft shown in note 18 as the bank has a right of offset between these accounts.

CURRENCY EXPOSURES
With the exception of Kleeneze Ireland Limited where the functional currency is the Euro, all of the other Group companies operate in
Sterling. The principal differences on exchange which are taken to the profit and loss account arise where purchases are made by Group
companies in a currency different to their reporting currency. At 30th April 2004, Kleeneze Ireland Limited did not hold any assets or
liabilities not denominated in Euros.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposure, being the monetary assets of the Group that are not denominated in the operating
currency of the relevant operating unit as at 30th April:

In addition, there were outstanding forward foreign currency contracts with a book value of nil and fair value of £0.2m (2003: (£0.1m)).
HEDGES
The Group’s policy is to only hedge transactional currency exposures on future purchases denominated in a currency other than Sterling.
Gains and losses on hedging instruments are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised. Unrecognised
gains and losses on hedges were as follows:

26. PENSIONS
The Group operates two pension schemes for employees. One is a funded defined benefit scheme, which is now closed to new entrants,
the other is a Group Personal Pension plan.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a) below are in accordance
with that standard. FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, was issued in November 2000 but is not yet mandatory for the Group. The transitional
disclosures, where these differ from or are not included in the disclosures under SSAP 24, are given in b) below.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME
a) The defined benefit scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of this scheme are held separately from those
of the Company, in the form of an insurance policy invested in a unit linked managed fund with Equitable Life Assurance Society. The most
recent valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 29th April 2001 using the projected unit method.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments
and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions. It was assumed that the investment returns would be 7% per annum, that salary increases
would be 5.85% per annum and that accrued pensions would increase at the rate of 2.75% per annum. 
The actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the scheme’s assets was £1.9m and the actuarial value of those assets represented
74% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. The agreed contribution rate for
future years is 31.2% of gross salaries. The directors believe that this will be sufficient to cover future liabilities of the scheme and to take
into account the fact that the scheme is now closed to new members and the age profile of the active membership is rising.
b) The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are set out below. The valuation carried out at 30th April 2001 has been updated to
30th April 2004 by a qualified independent actuary. The major assumptions used by the actuary were:

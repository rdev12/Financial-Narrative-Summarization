Strategic Report
Business model
Charles Taylor has a long established business 
model which generates revenue through the delivery of 
professional services to insurers, their clients and advisers 
on a worldwide basis, predominantly through the charging 
of fees. We also create value through the consolidation 
and efficient management of insurers in run-off. 
We are optimistic about the potential for long-term growth for professional services in the global insurance 
market and aim to increase revenue and profit both through organic growth and targeted strategic 
M&A opportunities.
Well-regarded professional services
We deliver professional services of a proven quality to our clients 
across the global insurance market. The Group offers services 
across the whole insurance value chain and operates through 
three Professional Services businesses: Management, Adjusting 
and Insurance Support Services. We also own and provide 
professional services to insurance companies which are closed to 
new business.
Deep technical skills
Our services are specialist and highly technical in nature and we 
differentiate ourselves through the quality of our people, their 
technical expertise and their commitment to service excellence. 
Many of our professional staff are graduates or hold professional 
qualifications. Our senior employees have developed superior 
technical knowledge gained through many years of market and 
practical experience.
Breadth of locations
Insurance is a global business and we have offices strategically 
located around the world in order to be near our clients and to 
provide our services locally wherever they are required by our 
clients. We have around 1,000 staff in 50 offices spread across 25 
countries in North and Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the 
Middle East.
Extensive growth opportunities
We aim to increase revenue and profit from our professional 
services, principally through organic growth and targeted strategic 
M&A opportunities. We are optimistic about the potential for 
long-term growth for professional services in the global insurance 
market. Global trade flows continue to grow, driving an increasing 
demand for insurance and the services that support insurers, 
insureds and their advisers. We believe that Charles Taylor is 
embedded within the fabric of the international insurance market 
and is well positioned to benefit from these trends.
How we create value
Strong client relationships
Charles Taylor is a people business and our clients 
are at the heart of everything we do. We always aim 
to deliver the highest level of professional service 
to our clients and to act in their best interests. Our 
commitment to quality is reflected in the strength of 
our client relationships, many of which have been in 
place for many years. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Business strategy
Our business strategy for growth, introduced in 
December 2011, is to deliver growth in revenue, profit and 
shareholder value by focusing on professional services. 
Our approach is to seek organic growth by: capitalising on our areas of strength by offering related  
services to our clients, building our niche businesses to leadership positions; and by realising the significant 
potential for cross referral and joint working across the Group. We are well positioned to generate this 
growth and believe the demand for the professional services we offer is substantial. We also remain open  
to the idea of growing by entering new business lines or through targeted M&A activity. 
Optimise business 
operations: strengthen the 
Group’s core capabilities 
and support services to 
underpin growth.
Explore medium-term 
strategic options: develop 
new professional services 
business lines through joint 
ventures or M&A opportunities. 
Any initiative of this nature 
needs to be a good fit 
strategically, culturally  
and financially.
In 2013 our work to optimise 
business operations made further 
progress. We have refinanced the 
Group’s debt, reviewed the structure 
of our professional services 
businesses to align better headcount 
with the areas of strong growth, 
developed new IT systems, 
developed a new adjusting 
management structure, reduced our 
facilities costs and recruited a 
Vietnam IT team. 
In 2013 we delivered an increase in 
revenue across the business. We 
introduced many initiatives to create 
growth in our core businesses with 
new products and services launched 
and new offices opened and teams 
established around the world. 
In 2013 we acquired the business 
and assets of KnowledgeCenter, a 
leading provider of tailored business 
solutions to the insurance industry.
See Group CEO’s Review 
for 2013 highlights.
Create growth in the

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Results
Revenue increased to £113.6m (2012: 
£108.2m). Group adjusted profit before tax 
rose to £10.0m (2012: £9.1m
1
), while Group 
statutory profit before tax increased to 
£6.9m (2012: £6.6m
1
). Adjusted earnings 
per share rose to 20.05p (2012: 18.33p
1
). 
Statutory earnings per share fell to 14.22p 
(2012: 15.14p
1
).
Our professional services businesses 
generated increased revenue and operating 
segment profit driven by a solid 
performance in Management Services and 
strong growth in Adjusting Services where 
we are reaping the benefits of the continued 
investment in new offices and people. 
Insurance Support Services continues to 
face challenges, mainly due to the loss of 
some larger legacy contracts which have 
only been partly compensated by new 
business. Our Insurers in Run-off  
business performed as expected with 
operating segment profit attributable to  
shareholders down. 
See Group CFO’s Report page 15.
Dividend
It is proposed that a final dividend of 6.75p 
per share (2012: 6.75p) be paid on 23 May 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 
11 April 2014. When added to the interim 
dividend of 3.25p per share (2012: 3.25p), 
this results in the total dividend per share 
for the year being maintained at 10.00p 
(2012: 10.00p).
Balance sheet
Net debt increased at the year end to 
£32.4m (2012: £29.5m) and free cash flow 
decreased to £5.5m (2012: £12.4m). This 
was largely as a result of acquisitions made 
during the year, an increase in working 
capital in Adjusting Services, and 
restructuring costs. We continue to focus 
on managing our debt while investing  
for growth. 
We completed the refinancing of the 
Group’s senior term debt and revolving 
credit facilities for a term of five years.  
Net pension liabilities fell compared to the 
prior year end as a result of improving 
market conditions. 
See Group CFO’s Report page 15.
Board
Julian Avery retired from the Board and as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
at the end of December 2013. I would like 
to thank Julian for his significant and 
valuable contribution to Charles Taylor over 
the last five years. 
I am very pleased to welcome Edward 
Creasy to the Board as a non-executive 
director from 1 January 2014, following 
Julian’s retirement. Edward has had a long 
career in the London Market insurance 
industry and will bring extensive 
knowledge and experience to 
our deliberations. 
I am also pleased to report that Gill Rider 
has taken on the role of chairing the 
Remuneration Committee.
As reported at the Half Year, Alistair Groom 
retired from the Board and from Charles 
Taylor at the end of February 2014. I would 
like to thank Alistair for his long and 
distinguished service to Charles Taylor and 
the Standard Club over the last 36 years. 
I am delighted to report that he will be 
remaining on the board of Standard 
Club Europe.
Corporate governance
Our Board has a broad, diverse range of 
skills and specialised knowledge, which 
enables us to achieve high standards of 
corporate governance. We provide 
leadership for the Group in setting strategy, 
monitoring performance and ensuring that 
the appropriate resources are in place to 
meet our corporate objectives. 
See Corporate Governance Report page 27.
Current trading and outlook
Overall trading has started steadily.
Our result has been achieved thanks to 
commitment of our highly professional 
team and I would like to thank all our staff 
for their hard work throughout the year.

steady as the underlying mutual insurance companies we 
manage continue to grow.
 – The Adjusting Services business performed very well with 
encouraging levels of claims work across all business lines.

to find trading conditions challenging and its performance 
was disappointing.

Management Services
The Management Services business 
provides end‑to‑end management services 
to insurance companies and associations. 
We deliver a complete outsourced 
management and operational service to 
our insurance company clients, reporting 
directly to their independent boards of 
directors. Our services cover every aspect 
of those companies’ operations from 
underwriting, claims management and 
delivery of safety services to regulatory, 
accounting and administrative operations, 
investment management, customer 
service, corporate governance and 
company secretarial services. We primarily 
manage three mutual insurance companies 
– the Standard Club, Signal and SCALA – 
and provide administration services to the 
Offshore Pollution Liability Association.
We are remunerated by fees from our 
mutual insurance company and association 
clients. Where we provide a full 
management service, growth in the size of 
the mutuals, the number and extent of 
services we deliver and the volume of work 
involved generally leads to growth in 
management activities and ultimately the 
level of management fees. The performance 
of the managed mutual insurance 
companies is strong – providing a positive 
long-term indicator of the Management 
Services business. The business also seeks 
to grow through the identification and 
implementation of opportunities to develop 
new insurance ventures and by tendering 
for the management contracts of  
existing mutual insurance companies  
and other associations.
Management Services –  
UK & International
  Standard Club: our work for the 
Standard Club delivered a solid result 
for the club and Charles Taylor 
secured an increased management 
fee for the year. The club provides 
protection and indemnity (P&I) 
insurance to approximately 10% of 
world shipping. Ship operators are 
attracted by the club’s financial 
strength, high quality membership 
and reputation for service.
 Insured tonnage increased by 4.6% 
over the year and stood at 137m gt at 
31 December 2013. This growth was 
the result of increased entries in the 
club by existing members and the 
addition of some new members. Total 
calls and premiums for the 2012–13 
policy year were US$294m. The club 
had a satisfactory 2014–15 renewal in 
February 2014, with a slight fall in 
insured tonnage and an overall 
increase of 10% in premiums.
 New client
 Offshore Pollution Liability 
Association (OPOL): In 2013, we 
successfully tendered to provide 
administrative and financial services to 
OPOL following a competitive tender. 
All offshore operators currently active in 
exploration and production on the 
United Kingdom Continental Shelf 
are party to a voluntary oil pollution 
compensation scheme known as 
OPOL. It applies to all offshore facilities 
from which there is a risk of a discharge 
of oil causing pollution damage. The 
Association exists to ensure that, in the 
event of a spillage or escape of oil, third 
party claims for pollution damage are 
met and the cost of remedial measures 
reimbursed under the terms of the 
OPOL Agreement.
 New products and services
 The Standard Club Hull facility 
operated by Charles Taylor was 
launched in April 2013 met with 
positive interest from both ship owners 
and brokers. Over 600 vessels are 
now insured under the facility.
  Charles Taylor launched a new 
Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance 
product for ship owners at the end of 
2013. We believe this product will be 
attractive to ship owners familiar with 
the quality and reputation of the 
Standard Club and Charles Taylor.
Case study
Creating an effective workers’ 
compensation claims adjusting service
If an employee is injured in the course of 
their work on the waterfront in the USA, 
their wages and medical benefits are met 
by workers’ compensation insurance. In 
late 2013 we launched a new claims 
adjusting service to assist ports and 
terminals operators with their workers’ 
compensation claims, which met with 
immediate success. It is already 
established as one of the network of five 
trusted third-party claims administrators 
that handle the workers’ compensation 
claims on behalf of Signal Mutual. At any 
time Signal is typically handling around 
5,000 workers’ compensation claims.
The new service was launched to adjust 
claims for a leading global ports and 
terminals operator. Charles Taylor was 
appointed to adjust claims for eight North 
American container terminals. In less than 
30 days, we assembled a team of 
experienced adjusters and coordinated  
the transfer of nearly 600 workers’ 
compensation claims. 
The Signal member experienced seamless 
implementation of Charles Taylor’s 
workers’ compensation adjusting services 
and has continued to benefit from effective 
advocacy by experienced adjusters and 
noted a continuation of high quality 
performance under this new delivery 
model. We are now seeing interest  
from other North American operators 
to use our claims adjusting service 
alongside Signal Mutual’s other claims 
adjusting partners.

Management Services – Americas
The Management Services Americas 
business had a successful 2013.
Signal Mutual: Charles Taylor has been 
the manager of Signal Mutual, the largest 
provider of longshore workers’ 
compensation insurance to the US maritime 
industry, since it was founded in 1983.
 Our work for Signal Mutual delivered 
a positive result for the Association. 
Eighteen new member companies 
joined Signal for the 2012/13 
membership year. 98% of existing 
members renewed their workers’ 
compensation insurance with the 
mutual and total membership has now 
reached 235 companies. The total 
payroll of the member companies, on 
which calls are calculated, reached 
US$3.34 billion, an increase of 11.7% 
and a record for the Association. Total 
calls for the year will be around 
US$218.2m, up by 6.4% over the 
previous year. Signal continued to 
deliver an outstanding safety record with 
both the number of total claims reported 
and lost time incidents per 200,000 man 
hours reducing by over 20% in the year. 
A new three-year management fee 
agreement with the mutual, 
commenced on 1 October 2013. 
SCALA provides workers compensation to 
the majority of Canada’s ship owners. The 
mutual delivered a steady performance 
during 2013. Total calls for the year were 
Canadian $5.7m.
 New services
 2013 was an important year for the 
development of services in 
Management Services Americas:
 – We launched a new claims 
adjusting service to assist ports 
and terminals operators in the 
management of their workers’ 
compensation claims and have 
already secured a major contract.
 – Our Safety Management Service, 
launched in 2012, secured nine 
new clients during the year.
 – We established Charles Taylor 
General Agency to market Charles 
Taylor developed insurance covers 
to clients in the USA such as Hull 
and Machinery, D&O and other 
insurance covers. It is currently in 
the process of being licensed in 
over 40 states.
 – We created a new Marine Claims 
Auditing service, combining skills 
from Charles Taylor Technical 
Services and other claims 
professionals across the Group, 
which secured its first client.
Group Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
Adjusting Services
The Adjusting Services business 
provides loss adjusting services across 
the aviation, energy, marine, property 
& casualty and special risks sectors. 
It also provides average adjusting 
services for ship owners. The business 
primarily focuses on larger and more 
complex claims arising from major 
insurance losses.
The business performed well over the year 
with all adjusting business lines delivering 
strong performance. In particular, we 
benefited from a steady volume of larger 
and more complex claims to adjust over 
the whole year rather than being requested 
to work on a small number of exceptionally 
large claims. 
Aviation performed well with continued 
growth in claims in Asia. We were 
appointed to adjust a number of large 
energy claims around the world, including 
in Canada, Argentina and Africa. Our 
Marine team benefited from a steady flow 
of work. Our Property & Casualty and 
Special Risks team performed well. In 
particular, we were instructed on significant 
business following the Calgary and Toronto 
floods. We also secured a greater volume 
of work in the professional and financial 
risk classes and delivered strong growth 
from property & casualty claims 
in Indonesia.
In 2013 we continued to invest in new 
people, offices and systems:
 We developed our office network 
further, as we believe our strong 
international network gives us a 
competitive advantage. Market 
feedback indicates we secured a 
number of claims during the year as 
a direct result of having offices and 
staff available in the right locations. 
Our new offices in Colombia and San 
Francisco are now fully established. 
We have also registered a business in 
Brazil working in close co-operation 
with the Management Services 
business; we anticipate that the  
office will be fully established and 
operational in 2014, providing both 
loss adjusting services and  
P&I services. Charles Taylor plc

 We completed the acquisition of a 
majority stake in Noble Inspection and 
Loss Adjustment Company (NILACO), 
a licensed loss adjuster based in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The 
acquisition provided us with offices in 
Riyadh and Jeddah and the ability to 
deliver loss adjusting services across 
Saudi Arabia. It builds on the Group’s 
existing capabilities in the Middle East 
with offices already in United Arab 
Emirates and Qatar.
 Our initiatives to recruit new senior 
adjusting staff who can win additional 
business and strengthen our 
relationships with markets continued. 
As indicated at the half year, we saw 
some staff movement and stepped up 
our programme of identifying highly 
qualified senior adjusting specialists to 
join our teams. As a result, new senior 
appointments have been successfully 
made in our energy business line.
 We continued to focus on managing 
the working capital requirements of 
the Adjusting Services business and 
collected a record amount of cash, 
£60.7m, in 2013. Collections, 
measured in debtor months were 
unfortunately slightly slower than the 
prior year. Debtor months rose to 4.9 
(2012: 4.3 months) and work in 
progress increased slightly to 5.2 
months (2012: 5.1 months). We 
achieved record revenue in 2013 as a 
result of the positive growth in claims 
volume and workload which increased 
the business’s working capital.
 We made good progress on a major 
project to develop and roll out our new 
loss adjusting claims management 
system. Initial trials have been 
successfully completed. We expect that 
the new system will increase efficiency, 
reduce the administrative burden for 
our loss adjusters and support our drive 
to reduce working capital.
 
 We are developing an enhanced 
management structure in Adjusting 
Services which is being rolled out 
during 2014. This is designed to 
support the continued strong growth 
in the business. It will also allow us to 
capitalise more fully on the 
combination of our business line 
expertise and regional strength.
Case study
Building a P&C adjusting business  
in Indonesia
Less than three years after recruiting our 
first Property & Casualty adjusters in 
Indonesia, we have built a business with 
nearly 30 staff, expertise across multiple 
sectors and substantial revenues.
The business was originally established to 
handle heavy equipment insurance claims. 
We have now extended our expertise 
across multiple sectors, including the 
telecommunications and power 
generation sectors.
Our growing reputation as a Property 
& Casualty adjusting business was 
underlined at the start of 2014 when we 
were appointed to handle multiple flood 
claims in Manado, the capital city of the 
North Sulawesi province of Indonesia.  
The city was inundated with massive 
floods which reached up to 3m in height, 
with around 70% of the city underwater  
at the height of the flooding. 
Our team reacted rapidly to the crisis. 
Adjusters were immediately despatched  
to Manado to handle claims with a 
temporary Charles Taylor Adjusting office 
established in the city. Multiple 
assignments were received, many  
involving sizeable commercial losses,  
and good progress has been made in 
resolving those matters.

The Insurance Support Services 
business, the smallest of our 
Professional Services businesses, 
provides technical services to clients 
in the Lloyd’s, London and international 
insurance markets. For example, it 
provides services to around 80% of 
Lloyd’s managing agents. It also delivers 
life and non-life run-off servicing services 
from London, Dublin and the Isle of Man. 
The business is a leading provider of 
third party life insurance administration 
on the Isle of Man and also includes 
our investment management, captive 
management, risk consulting and 
specialty risks business lines. Finally, the 
Insurance Support Services business 
acts as the Group’s business incubator 
where we can develop and test new 
business initiatives.
Insurance Support Services – Non-life
We appointed a new head of non-life ISS 
in the second half of the year to give a 
stronger identity and clear vision to the 
non-life Insurance Support Services (ISS) 
businesses. His initial focus is on 
developing existing and new service 
offerings to clients along with identifying 
synergies and opportunities for joint 
working across the Group.
Charles Taylor Insurance Services 
(CTIS): CTIS is the largest of the non-life 
Insurance Support Services business lines. 
It provides outsourced back office 
insurance services to the Lloyd’s, London 
and international insurance markets. As 
reported at the half year, market demand 
for some services reduced, leading to the 
loss of a few larger legacy contracts. While 
action was taken to cut costs, this still 
impacted the full year performance. The 
new services we launched in the year have 
taken longer than expected to gain traction 
and hence were not sufficient to counter-
balance the fall off of existing legacy 
contracts. There are now some signs that 
new business performance is improving:
 We were appointed to develop 
and manage a new Third Party 
Administrators Central Database 
by the Lloyd’s Market Association 
following a competitive tender.
 Our Taylored Claims Management 
services, which enable Lloyd’s 
managing agents to achieve faster 
claims settlement was purchased by 
three major managing agents.
 We were appointed by two Managing 
General Agencies to provide 
administrative services.
 There is an ongoing move in the 
Lloyd’s market to offer greater choice 
of outsourcing partners to Lloyd’s 
market participants. We believe we are 
well positioned to capitalise on this 
trend and have invested in a senior 
team to develop new elective claims 
services for Lloyd’s Managing Agents.
Charles Taylor KnowledgeCenter: 
 In the last months of 2013 we acquired 
the business and assets of 
KnowledgeCenter, a leading provider 
of tailored business solutions to the 
insurance industry. The acquisition 
gives us a competitive advantage on 
key technology products and 
processes, which we can combine 
with our other insurance support 
services. While initial sales have been 
slower than expected, it is still early 
days and the integration of the 
business is progressing.
Other non-life Insurance 
Support Services: 
 Our Captive Management business 
continues to perform steadily and 
we have won contracts to manage 
a number of additional captive 
insurance cells. 
 Our speciality risks business, which 
provides tailored insurance products to 
meet the specific insurance needs of 
niche sectors, has worked closely with 
the Management Services business to 
develop new insurance covers for the 
international marine market.
Other Insurance Support Services
The UK offshore life run-off servicing 
business performed in line with the 
expected run-off profile. We also 
strengthened the business development, 
legal and administration teams in our 
investment management business, which 
continues to deliver a steady performance.

Case study
Transforming the management of third 
party claims administrators for Lloyd’s
There are over 700 TPAs supporting Lloyd’s 
managing agents with claims settlement, 
but in the past there had been no central 
database to gather and automate TPA 
information. In late 2013, Charles Taylor was 
appointed to transform the management of 
third party claims administrators in Lloyd’s. 
We won a tender from the Lloyd’s Market 
Association to develop and manage a new 
Third Party Administrator (TPA) database 
for the market.
Our strong working relationships with the 
Lloyd’s market coupled with our proven 
ability to deliver effective market-facing 
solutions were instrumental in our 
appointment. Planning kicked off 
immediately so the development of the 
new database is already well underway. 
The database will enhance the Market’s 
governance of outsourcing arrangements 
and increase the efficiency of the claims 
settlement process. It will also enable third 
party administrators appointed by Lloyd’s 
managing agents to benefit from reduced 
work duplication and streamlined audits.

UK Offshore Life Run-off
We completed the integration of the Global 
Life Assurance business, acquired in 2012, 
into our Isle of Man run-off life business in 
the second half of the year, generating a 
small cash release. In line with our 
business strategy, we continue to seek 
further UK offshore life insurance 
acquisitions, which meet our criteria. 
These also benefit our Insurance Support 
Services business through increased 
run-off servicing contracts.
Non-life Run-off
The Group’s three non-life insurance 
companies are running off satisfactorily, 
with claims experience improving 
compared to the prior year. We continue to 
explore our options in the non-life market 
following our decision not to acquire any 
further non-life run-off businesses.
 We established IT teams in Vietnam to 
help develop a new system for 
Management Services and the new 
loss adjusting management system for 
Adjusting Services. This takes 
advantage of the high levels of IT 
literacy, lower operating costs and 
operational scalability in Vietnam.
 Our facilities team successfully 
renegotiated charges for business 
rates, property insurance, and 
service charges delivering a material 
cost saving.
 Our finance team renegotiated the 
Group’s senior finance facilities on 
favourable terms and delivered 
significant cost savings on external 
audit fees.
See Group CFO’s Report page 15. 
Business restructuring
During the year we also took steps to 
improve operational efficiency. We 
reviewed the structure of our professional 
services businesses to better align 
headcount with the areas of strong growth. 
Overall headcount increased by 5.5%, 
when including new offices openings and 
the acquisitions made during the year. In 
some areas we have been able to achieve 
significant long-term staff cost savings. 
See Group CFO’s Report page 15.
Other business 
strategy initiatives 
In addition to the initiatives to optimise 
business operations already highlighted 
in this report, we also took a number 
steps to further strengthen and increase 
the efficiency of our shared services 
teams. Notable developments include 
the following:
See Business strategy page 5.
2013 was an important year of 
development and progress at Charles 
Taylor. We have made considerable efforts 
to ensure that our business has good, 
varied and reliable sources of profitable 
income, and, as a result we are well 
positioned to make further progress in our 
endeavour to grow our business profitably 
in the years to come.

How we measure 
performance
 
Our key performance indicators show an improvement in adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share. The 
Professional Services businesses increased revenue and operating segment profit driven by a solid performance in Management 
Services and strong growth in Adjusting Services, although the performance of Insurance Support Services was disappointing. 
Net debt rose, due to working capital increase in Adjusting Services driven by strong organic growth and new office openings 
during the year, restructuring costs and the cash considerations paid for acquisitions during the year.

, with higher 
profit in Professional Services offsetting a lower contribution from 
Insurers in Run-off. Within Professional Services, Adjusting Services 
performed strongly, more than compensating for the weaker 
performance in Insurance Support Services, while Management 
Services delivered consistent results. Insurers in Run-off achieved a 
positive result at operating segment profit level, but adjusted profit 
before tax was down after non-controlling interests. This is due to 
lower profits in the Offshore Life Run-off business which in 2012 had 
benefited from the sizeable transfer of the Alico Isle of Man business. 
This was not repeated in 2013 despite the transfer of the smaller 
Global Life Assurance business. The Non-life Run-off companies 
Cardrow Insurance Limited and Bestpark International Limited 
showed an improved claims experience, although this had limited 
impact on the adjusted profit before tax due to the large non-
controlling interests in these companies.
Statutory profit before tax was up at £6.9m (2012: £6.6m
1
). 
Statutory EPS was down at 14.22p (2012: 15.14p
1
) as a result of 
the reduced impact of non-controlling interests and the higher 
number of shares in issue during the year.

Strategic Report
Net debt, cash flow and financing
Net debt increased by £2.9m over the  
year to £32.4m (2012: £29.5m), while free 
cash flow decreased to £5.5m (2012: 
£12.4m). The reduction in free cash flow 
results mainly from lower distributions  
from Offshore Life Run-off, the working  
capital increase in Adjusting Services  
due to the strong growth and new office 
openings during the year, and the 
restructuring cost. Net debt also reflects 
the cash considerations paid for the two 
acquisitions made during the year. We are 
continuing to focus on managing our debt 
while investing for growth.
 
The Group’s senior banking facilities 
were renewed on 7 November 2013 for 
a five-year term. They now comprise an 
amortising senior term loan of £10.0m and 
a £30.0m revolving credit facility. In 
addition, the Group has £5.0m committed 
overdraft facilities in the UK and £6.1m 
overseas facilities. Total headroom on 
committed facilities at year-end was 
£15.6m (including surplus cash). Interest 
rates are mostly linked to 3m Libor plus 
margins of 2.25–2.75%. The senior term 
loan and revolving credit facility are 
available until 7 November 2018. The other 
facilities are renewed on an annual basis. 
Restructuring and operational 
efficiency
We remain focused on improving 
operational efficiency and are taking action 
to remove costs from our businesses. 
These include targeting savings in general 
expenses, introducing a central 
procurement capability, reducing third 
party professional fees and renegotiating 
property and IT infrastructure costs. We 
reviewed the structure of our professional 
services businesses to better align 
headcount with the areas of strong growth. 
Overall headcount increased by 5.5%, 
when including new offices openings and 
the acquisitions made during the year. 
Charges associated with staff restructuring 
of £1.4m have been excluded in the 
calculation of adjusted profit before tax 
and earnings per share figures. 
Retirement benefit schemes
The retirement benefit obligation in the 
Group balance sheet at 31 December 
2013 was £26.7m, compared to £31.6m at 
the previous year end. The reduction in net 
obligation has been driven by change in 
market conditions, employer contributions, 
investment gains, and reduced provisions 
for possible Normal Retirement Date 
liabilities. There are multi-year programmes 
in place to recover pension scheme deficits 
fully on a regulatory funding basis and 
funding costs are reflected in management 
fees charged by the Group where 
appropriate. Employer contributions in the 
year were £3.7m (2012: £3.6m). 
Dividends
The proposed final dividend for 2013 is 
6.75p (2012: 6.75p) making the total 
dividend for the year 10.00p, unchanged 
from the prior year. 
Foreign exchange
The Group manages its exposure to 
foreign currency fluctuations by use of 
forward foreign exchange contracts and 
options to sell currency in the future. The 
contracts open during the year and at the 
year-end were to protect the Group’s 
exposure to movements between £sterling 
and the US$, the Singapore$ and the 
Canadian$. The US$ profits of the Group 
were translated at 1.57 in 2013 (2012: 1.59). 
The sensitivity of the Group’s results to 
movements in exchange rates is explained 
in note 25 to the Financial Statements. 
Results were not materially affected by 
movements in exchange rates between 
2012 and 2013.
Group Chief Financial Officer’s Report continued
Taxation
During 2013, the effective tax rate on 
statutory profit was 19.8% compared to 
25.7%
1
 in 2012. The underlying tax rate, 
which is calculated on adjusted profit and 
excludes prior year adjustments and the 
recognition of new deferred tax assets, 
was 16.1% (2012: 20.9%
1
). The statutory 
and underlying tax rates are lower because 
a larger proportion of profits were 
generated in lower tax countries.

How we manage risk
The Group’s risk management systems are 
designed to manage the risk of failing to 
achieve our business objectives. We have 
an embedded and continuing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the 
principal risks which the Group faces.
Our systems of internal control which 
include the risk management, compliance 
and internal audit functions, report to the 
Board through the Audit Committee.
The Board, senior management and the 
Group’s businesses review the risks and 
controls in the Group’s risk register on a 
regular basis. The Board requires risk 
mitigation actions to be completed 
appropriately and in a timely manner. The 
internal audit function undertakes regular 
reviews of the risks highlighted in the risk 
register and inspects systems, processes 
and practices across the Group’s offices 
on an ongoing basis. A full explanation of 
our risk management and internal control 
processes is set out on page 30.
The Group’s risks reflect the fact that our 
activities are based around providing 
professional services to clients in the global 
insurance market. We do not underwrite 
new insurance risks on our own account 
and the risks we take in relation to run-off 
insurance are where possible mitigated 
by use of deferred consideration 
mechanisms, reinsurance and other 
risk management measures. 
The material risks identified by the Group 
fall into the three categories of business, 
financial, and regulatory compliance risks.
1. Business risks
Type of risk Risk description Management action
Business concentration A high proportion of Group revenues 
are derived from the management of the 
Standard Clubs and Signal Mutual.
Growth and diversification of the Group may 
divert resources away from key clients.
Where a small number of key clients 
purchase an increasing number of services, 
the risk of conflicts of interest arising, and 
the impact of those conflicts may be higher. 
We invest significant senior time and resource in client 
relationship management to ensure that we maintain 
the standards of service that our clients expect. Senior 
management takes responsibility for ensuring that high 
standards of service can be set for new clients and 
ventures, without impacting existing commitments.
Mutual management involves a long term relationship with 
deep connections between the manager and the mutual, 
which provides opportunities to identify and address 
satisfactorily any potential issues whether of service, 
conflict or otherwise, at an early stage.
Our strategy to grow and diversify our businesses 
across the global insurance market will dilute revenue 
concentration over time. 
Material errors As a Professional Services business our 
reputation and the potential for repeat 
business is dependent on the continued 
delivery of a high quality work product. 
Staff may make errors in the course of their 
work, some of which may not be covered 
by insurance. 
Where relevant circumstances arise, 
the potential consequences need to be 
identified in order that the risk can be 
mitigated, and to ensure that insurance 
cover is not invalidated inter alia by 
late notification. 
We embed procedures and conduct training to reduce the 
risk of failure to provide services to a high standard.
Service levels are monitored and control processes are 
regularly reviewed, including procedures for supervision 
and peer review of work. 
Where possible, the Group’s standard terms are used as the 
basis for contracting; these include contractual protections. 
The Group purchases professional indemnity insurance to 
mitigate the financial impact of claims that may arise. The 
Board is involved in this purchase. 
The Group has a central database to log incidents which 
occur, and incidents which may give rise to a claim are 
managed by the Group legal function.  Charles Taylor plc

Staff issues including  
loss of key teams 
or motivation
All of our businesses depend on recruiting 
and retaining experienced and well-qualified 
professionals to deliver our services.
Loss of business could result from 
individuals or teams leaving for competitors. 
We ensure that remuneration and benefits, career 
opportunities, working conditions and staff recruitment 
processes are carefully reviewed and implemented to ensure 
that suitable personnel are attracted to work in the Group 
and are retained. 
Training programmes are in place to give staff the 
opportunity to develop.
Management is required to consider medium and long- 
term succession planning in accordance with anticipated 
client demand. 
Failure to provide 
committed service
The Group has a large number of business 
units, business lines and widespread 
office locations. 
There is a risk that we could fail to 
provide the service product that we are 
committed to provide, to properly and 
consistently manage all parts of the 
business, or fail to identify a breakdown 
in management reporting.
Other business-critical risks may adversely 
affect the whole or a significant part 
of the Group. Occurrences such as 
pandemic, cyber-attack, and IT failure 
could result in staff being unable to meet 
business commitments. 
Organisation structures are planned to ensure that control 
is maintained and that business units are managed by 
personnel of suitable quality and experience.
The Board maintains contact with all businesses, both 
through the business management structure and directly. 
We have established clear budgetary and other financial 
control processes within the management of business units. 
BCP and crisis management teams have been established. 
PI insurance is maintained, and limits are reviewed annually. 
High fixed cost base/
operational leverage
In the event of a material fall in revenues, 
there is a risk that such fall is not matched 
by an immediate, proportionate reduction 
in costs with a consequent impact 
on earnings.
Senior management is focused on reducing costs without 
impacting adversely either the delivery of services, 
or participation in opportunities for growth.
The Group considers outsourcing and offshoring, and 
manages a detailed budgeting process, tracking revenues 
and expenses on a monthly basis. 
The Group increasingly offers variable remuneration to  
new joiners, and the financial forecasting function has 
been improved.

2. Financial risks
Type of risk Risk description Management action
Banking covenant 
breaches, cash cover  
and liquidity issues
CT maintains banking facilities. These may 
contain financial covenants and restrictions 
on conduct.
Banking facilities might be withdrawn or 
not renewed. 
Refinancing may not be secured for 
amounts outstanding when a facility expires. 
Cash inflow may be insufficient to cover 
outgoings, or outgoings may be planned at 
an unaffordable level. 
Facility headroom may be insufficient.
We carefully manage working capital and monitor 
relevant performance indicators in order to identify and 
take appropriate management steps to mitigate the risk. 
Covenant compliance is reported to and considered by the 
Board. Cash flow is budgeted and reforecast regularly. 
A five-year term was agreed during the most recent 
refinancing, with greater flexibility and facilities.
There are regular cash flow forecasts to project the future 
funding position and to monitor expected headroom 
against banking facilities and covenants.
The Group maintains an open and regular dialogue with 
a small number of relationship banks. 
Further information on management of liquidity and foreign 
exchange risks is given in note 1 to the accounts.
Significant increase in 
liability to fund defined 
benefit pension schemes
The Group operates four defined benefit 
pension schemes. 
We face the risk that the outstanding 
pension scheme deficits may need to be 
funded within a short timescale.
The condition of the Group’s defined benefit pension 
schemes is regularly monitored. 
There is regular dialogue between the Group and the 
schemes’ trustees covering investment policy and 
an assessment of asset and liability risks.
All the defined benefit pension schemes are closed 
to new members. The largest scheme has been closed 
to future accruals. 
Pensionable salary increases are capped by reference 
to inflation.
Trustees and employer negotiate funding formally every 
three years.
3. Compliance and regulatory risks
Type of risk Risk description Management action
Material breach of legal 
and regulatory obligations
The Group’s services are subject to legal 
and regulatory control in many different 
jurisdictions worldwide.
Failure to meet regulatory requirements 
could lead to fines or legal action against 
individuals and the Group.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees the risk 
management and compliance functions. This includes 
challenge and recommendation where appropriate.
The Group’s Compliance and Risk Committee monitors 
the Group’s compliance and risk activities. This includes 
ensuring that the Group’s regulated subsidiaries 
and functions performed on behalf of clients which 
are regulated entities continue to meet the relevant 
regulatory requirements. 
The Group regularly reviews its policies and procedures 
in relation to regulatory matters and to ensure appropriate 
training is conducted. Charles Taylor plc

Strategic Report
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
initiatives are an important part of 
our business activities. The Group is 
committed to conducting its business 
affairs in a fair, proper and ethical manner 
and in compliance with all applicable 
laws, regulations and relevant 
professional standards.
Core values
The Group has adopted a set of corporate 
values, which have been communicated to 
all employees. We recognise the need for 
commitment to all our stakeholders, be 
it our employees, our clients, our 
shareholders, our banks, our service 
providers, and local communities.
Environmental policy
Damian Ely is the executive director 
responsible for the Group’s environmental 
policy. While the Group’s operations as 
a service provider do not affect the 
environment to the same extent as some 
other companies, the Group seeks to 
minimise the environmental impact of its 
business operations and aims to follow 
best practice in areas in which it does 
have an environmental impact.
The Group is committed to reducing its 
carbon footprint and strives to minimise 
its energy consumption through its energy 
management policy and by encouraging 
staff to be aware of the environment and to 
use energy thoughtfully. Where possible 
the Group uses energy-efficient business 
appliances and computers, thereby giving 
rise to energy savings and a reduction in 
emissions. Details of the Group’s 
Greenhouse Gas emissions are set out 
in the Directors’ Report on page 25.
Corporate Social Responsibility and Diversity
The Group’s head office incorporates a 
number of design and other initiatives to 
reduce that office’s environmental impact 
and carbon footprint. Electronic document 
management systems have been 
implemented in most business units to 
reduce paper usage. In order to reduce 
travel-related emissions the Group 
encourages the use of video-conferencing 
technology in its offices. As part of its 
environmental policy the Group operates 
various recycling programmes.
The company publishes its UK policies on 
energy management, environment and 
sustainability on the Company intranet,  
CT Connect.
Employees
Our employees play a vital role in 
accomplishing the Group’s goals. David 
Marock is the executive director responsible 
for employees. At 31 December 2013, the 
Group had 980 employees compared to 
929 at 31 December 2012.
The Group is committed to providing an 
environment in which individual talents can 
flourish and for there to be fair and equal 
employment opportunities for all persons. 
The Group is an equal opportunities 
employer and bases all decisions on 
individual ability without regard to race, 
religion, beliefs, political opinions, creed, 
colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, nationality,

Appropriate training and career 
development are available at all levels and 
the Group is committed to helping 
employees to realise their potential by 
gaining relevant skills and experience.
The Group seeks to ensure the health, 
safety and welfare of all its employees and 
to meet all its obligations under the relevant 
legislation. Employees are expected to 
co-operate with management to create a 
safe and healthy working environment for 
themselves and others and to take 
reasonable care for their own health, 
welfare and safety at work. The Group’s 
health and safety responsibilities are 
accorded equal priority with the Group’s 
other statutory duties and objectives.
The Group gives full and fair consideration 
to applications for employment made by 
disabled persons and will make reasonable 
adjustments to remove substantial 
disadvantages faced by disabled persons, 
whether as employees, candidates for 
promotion or job applicants. If an employee 
were to become disabled whilst employed, 
the Group would endeavour to make 
arrangements, wherever possible, to 
continue their employment with the Group.
We recognise the importance of 
communication with our employees; we 
encourage two-way communications through 
the management hierarchy. Employees are 
kept informed of developments in our 
business through internal communications, 
including the Company intranet, CT Connect 
and annual Town Hall meetings with the 
Group Chief Executive Officer.
Employees are encouraged to become 
shareholders in the Company. This is 
primarily through the operation of the 
Company’s sharesave scheme, details of 
which are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 50. Senior

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Governance
The Directors’ Report should be read in conjunction with the 
Strategic Report on pages 1 to 21 and the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 27 to 31, both of which form part of this 
Directors’ Report.
Strategic Report
Pursuant to sections 414A–D Companies Act 2006, the Business 
Review has been replaced with a Strategic Report, which can be 
found on pages 1 to 21. This report sets out the development and 
performance of the Company’s business during the financial year, 
the position of the Company at the end of the year, a commentary 
on likely future developments and a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Company.
Principal risks
In addition to the description of the principal risks facing the 
Company and the processes by which they are managed in the 
Strategic Report, financial risks and uncertainties are explained in 
note 25 to the financial statements.
Going concern 
The directors have acknowledged the latest guidance on going 
concern. Whilst the continuing weak global economic background 
has created general uncertainty, the Company has a number of 
long-term client contracts and well-established trading relationships 
with many customers across several different geographical 
locations and business lines. The Company also has considerable 
financial flexibility and access to additional sources of finance. The 
Company’s Banking facilities were re-negotiated during the year and 
a new Senior Facilities Agreement was put in place until October 
2018, details of which are in note 25. Under current forecasts the 
Group has sufficient headroom on working capital and banking 
covenants. The directors have identified and considered the 
anticipated main areas of business risk which are set out on pages 
17 and 18. As a consequence, the directors consider that the 
Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully 
despite the continuing uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, 
at the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, the directors continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Dividends
An interim dividend for the year to 31 December 2013 of 3.25p 
(2012: 3.25p) per share was paid on 29 November 2013. The 
directors recommend a final dividend of 6.75p (2012: 6.75p) per 
share. If approved by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), the final dividend will be paid on 23 May 2014 to 
those shareholders whose names are on the register on 11 April 
2014. The Company operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This 
Directors’ Report 
for the year to 31 December 2013
gives shareholders the opportunity to use their cash dividends to 
buy additional shares through a special dealing arrangement with 
the Company’s Registrars.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of the 
movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the year 
are shown in note 22. The Company has one class of ordinary 
shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
As at 31 December 2013 the issued share capital of the Company 
was 41,542,943 ordinary shares and the average monthly trading 
volume was 1,198,408 ordinary shares (2012: 1,334,402 
ordinary shares).
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on 
the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. 
The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Group’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights.
Options over 181,491 ordinary shares under Part A of the Charles 
Taylor Sharesave Scheme were granted on 11 October 2013 to 
eligible employees of the Group. These options entitle the 
participants to acquire ordinary shares between 1 December 2016 
and 31 May 2017 at a price of 168p per share. Options over 31,175 
ordinary shares under Part B of the Charles Taylor Sharesave 
Scheme were granted on 11 October 2013 to eligible employees of 
the Group. These options entitle the participants to acquire 
ordinary shares between 1 December 2016 and 31 May 2017 at a 
price of 168p per share. Options over 35,885 ordinary shares 
under Part C of the Charles Taylor Sharesave Scheme were 
granted on 11 October 2013 to eligible employees of the Group. 
These options entitle the participants to acquire ordinary shares on 
9 January 2016 at a price of 178.5p per share.
Awards over 270,000 and 150,000 ordinary shares under the 
Charles Taylor Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 (LTIP) were granted 
on 22 April 2013 and 16 January 2013 to the executive directors. 
Full details of the awards are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on page 47.
As at 31 December 2013, the Charles Taylor Employees’ Share 
Ownership Plan (ESOP) held 620,771 shares. On 7 October 2011, 
the ESOP Trustees entered into a share supply agreement with the 
Company, whereby awards made under the LTIP can be settled 
from shares held in the ESOP.
Full details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 54 and

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholder,
The directors, whose names and details are set out on pages 22 
and 23, are responsible for the corporate governance of the 
Group. They are committed to ensuring that from the top 
downwards the highest standards of corporate governance are 
maintained. They support the principles of good corporate 
governance and the code of best practice laid down in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2012 (the Code), which is publicly available 
at www.frc.org.uk. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2013 
the Board believes it has complied with the principles and 
provisions recommended by the Code. The manner in which the 
Company has applied the principles of good governance set out in 
the Code is outlined in this report.
For the first time since the Company’s flotation, we have 
undertaken an external audit tender exercise. As a result of this 
tender exercise, the Board agreed to retain the services of Deloitte 
LLP as the Company’s external auditor. 
We have again undertaken a formal, internal evaluation of the 
Board’s effectiveness. The results of this exercise are summarised 
on page 29. The Nomination Committee reviewed the 
appropriateness of each of the directors putting themselves 
forward for election or re-election at the forthcoming AGM. I am 
pleased to report that I am satisfied that the Board and each of the 
directors are operating effectively. I am therefore happy to 
recommend that each of the directors should be elected or 
re-elected as appropriate at the 2014 AGM.
Corporate Governance Report 
During 2013, we have maintained our engagement with our 
shareholders. In addition to the continuing rounds of dialogue with 
many of our shareholders at the time of interim and final results, I 
have contacted our largest shareholders, constituting around two 
thirds of our register. The majority of these have responded to this 
exercise and I have been able to have useful and constructive 
conversations and meetings with such shareholders. We intend to 
continue this engagement with shareholders in the coming year to 
ensure that the Board stays abreast of the development of 
shareholder views on governance and other key issues.

Governance
Board composition and balance
The Board comprises the Chairman, four independent non-
executive directors and four executive directors and is collectively 
responsible for the long-term success of the Company. It does this 
by providing entrepreneurial leadership, whilst ensuring effective 
controls are established that enable the proper assessment and 
management of risk. The Board is ultimately responsible for the 
Company’s strategic aims and the long-term prosperity of the 
Company, an objective achieved by ensuring that the right financial 
and human resources are in place.
The Company has a set of formal governance policies, which 
are reviewed annually and define the formal matters reserved for 
the Board.
The Board carries out its role by:
• monitoring the Company’s operations worldwide;
• providing input into and approval of management’s 
development of corporate strategy and performance objectives;
• approving budgets and monitoring progress against 
those budgets;
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal systems of control;
• reviewing and ratifying the Company’s system of governance, 
compliance, risk management and internal audit; and
• appointing and removing, where appropriate, the senior 
executives of the Company.
The Board reviews all aspects of the Company regularly, including 
major commercial decisions, client relationships, operations, 
financial performance and position, employee matters, company 
policies, compliance, risks, risk management and internal audit. 
This ensures that the Board is able to direct the management of 
the Company to the best of its ability and identify, address and 
resolve matters of importance in a timely manner.
The Board has delegated to management responsibility for:
• managing the Company’s day-to-day operations;
• developing the Company’s annual budget and recommending it 
to the Board for approval;
• managing the day-to-day operations within the budget;
• the development and maintenance of client relationships; and
• implementing corporate strategy and making recommendations 
on significant corporate strategic initiatives.
There is a clear division of responsibilities on the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for running the Board and the executive 
directors are responsible for running the Company. The non-
executive directors are responsible for exercising independent and 
objective judgement by constructively challenging proposals and 
recommendations in helping the Board to reach its decisions.
As Chairman, Rupert Robson is responsible for:
• leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness on all 
aspects of the Board’s role;
• setting the Board agenda and ensuring that the directors 
receive accurate, timely and clear information;
• oversight of the Company’s affairs and its strategy; 
• facilitating openness and debate between the executive and 
non-executive directors;
• ensuring effective communication between the Company and 
its shareholders; and
• succession planning and the composition of the Board.
David Marock, as the Group Chief Executive Officer, 
is responsible for:
• the day-to-day management of the Company;
• development and implementation of Company strategy; and 
• specific responsibility for major client relationships. 
Julian Cazalet is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
who acts as a sounding board for the Chairman and an intermediary 
for the other directors, where necessary. He is also an additional 
point of contact for shareholders, if they have reason for concern 
and where contact through the normal channel of the Chairman has 
failed to resolve the concern or for which contact is inappropriate. 
The Nomination Committee regularly evaluates and considers the 
mix of skills, experience and diversity on the Board and is satisfied 
that these are appropriate to achieve the Company’s stated 
strategy and objectives.
All directors, whether executive or non-executive, have unrestricted 
access to the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel and 
executives within the Group on any matter of concern to them, in 
respect of their duties. In addition, new directors are given an 
induction and/or appropriate training on appointment to the Board. 
Appropriate time was set aside during the year for training on 
relevant topics concerning the operation and function of the Board 
and the obligations of directors. The Company has undertaken to 
reimburse legal fees to the directors, if circumstances should arise 
in which it is necessary for them to seek separate, independent 
legal advice in the furtherance of their duties.
At no time during the year did any director hold a material interest 
in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings other than a third-party indemnity 
provision between each director and the Company and service 
contracts between each executive director and the Company. The 
Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year 
Directors and Officers liability insurance. Details of directors’ 
remuneration, service agreements and interests in the shares of 
the Company are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 34 to 54.
The non-executive directors, Julian Cazalet, Edward Creasy, 
Gill Rider and David Watson are considered by the Board to be 
independent of the management and free from any business or 
other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their material judgement, notwithstanding their shareholdings 
held during the year, which are considered by the Board to be 
not significant.
Corporate Governance Report continued Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Chairman, Rupert Robson, was considered independent 
upon his appointment in 2007, but is not considered to be 
independent by virtue of his appointment as Chairman. The letters 
of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
business hours and at the AGM.
The Board has maintained procedures whereby potential conflicts 
of interest are reviewed regularly. The Board has considered the 
other appointments held by directors, details of which are 
contained in their biographies on page 22 and 23, and on the 
Company’s website and considers that the Chairman and each of 
the directors are able to devote sufficient time to fulfil the duties 
required of them under the terms of their service agreements or 
letters of appointment.
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination 
Committee, which report back to the Board and are further 
described below. The Terms of Reference of each Committee are 
available in the Investors section of the Company’s website.
Directors’ attendance at the Board and committee meetings

There are three management committees: the Executive 
Committee, the Finance Committee and the Group Compliance 
and Risk Committee, formed of executive directors and/or 
executives from the businesses, which meet on a regular basis to 
consider operational issues and commercial matters.
Board performance and evaluation
The performance of individual directors, the Board, its committees, 
and the Chairman are reviewed annually.
These performance reviews took into consideration whether or not 
the Board and its committees respectively had discharged their 
duties, as set out in their terms of reference and whether their 
terms of reference in each case required updating or amendment. 
In order to evaluate the performance of the Board, each member 
of the Board was asked to complete a detailed questionnaire, as 
well as having a one to one review meeting with the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. The responses to the 
questionnaires and the findings of these meetings were reviewed 
by the Chairman, who summarised the findings and shared and 
discussed the findings with the whole Board. Topics covered in the 
review of the Board included strategy, performance measurement, 
relationships with key stakeholders, risk management and the 
conduct and effectiveness of board meetings. In summary, the 
Board had made progress in a number of areas and the directors 
concluded that the Board had effectively discharged its duties 
during the year.
The Nomination Committee considered the contribution of each of 
the executive directors and the Chairman considered the 
contribution of each of the non-executive directors. The non-
executive directors, excluding the Chairman, considered the 
contribution of the Chairman. The non-executive directors have 
met together without the executive directors as required by 
the Code.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one-third of the 
Directors offer themselves for re-election every year. 
Notwithstanding that as a small company, i.e. below the FTSE 
350, the Code does not require all the directors to stand for annual 
re-election, the Board decided that all directors should be subject 
to annual re-election unless a director has been appointed since 
the previous AGM and is, therefore, subject to election by 
the shareholders. 
Nomination Committee
Rupert Robson chairs the Nomination Committee, on which the 
non-executive directors, Julian Cazalet, Edward Creasy, Gill Rider 
and David Watson also sit. In 2013 there were four meetings of 
the Committee. 
The Group has formal policies to promote equality of opportunity 
across the Company and considers that diversity includes (but is 
not limited to) personal attributes and characteristics, gender, 
ethnicity, age, disability and religious belief. The aim is to promote 
equality, respect and understanding, and to avoid discrimination. 
All Board appointments are subject to recommendation from the 
Nomination Committee, which takes into consideration, amongst 
other things, the make-up of the Board and its balance of skills 
and experience. The Board believes that appointments to the 
Board should be based on merit and overall suitability for the role.  Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Governance
The Nomination Committee usually engages a recruitment 
consultant to assist with identifying suitable candidates to join 
the Board.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the make-up, knowledge, 
diversity, balance of skills and independence of the Board. The 
Committee engaged a recruitment consultant to help identify a 
new non-executive director to replace Julian Avery, who had 
indicated his desire to retire from the Board during the year, and 
recommended the appointment of Edward Creasy to the Board. 
The Committee also considered Board and senior management 
succession in the Company, governance issues, reviewed and 
revised its Terms of Reference and made various 
recommendations to the Board.
The external search consultancy retained by the Nomination 
Committee in respect of Edward Creasy’s appointment was 
Ravenshurst Partners. The final selection of Ravenshurst Partners 
was the result of a competitive process undertaken by Julian 
Cazalet and Gill Rider from a short-list of potential consultants. 
The Company does not have any connection with 
Ravenshurst Partners.
Remuneration Committee
Gill Rider chairs the Remuneration Committee, having replaced 
Julian Avery on his retirement at the end of the year. The non-
executive directors, Julian Cazalet, Edward Creasy, David Watson 
and Rupert Robson are members of the Committee. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 34 to 54. 
Audit Committee
David Watson chairs the Audit Committee. The non-executive 
directors, Julian Cazalet, Edward Creasy and Gill Rider are 
members of the Committee. David Watson and Julian Cazalet are 
considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Audit Committee Report is set out on pages 32 
and 33.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
In relation to compliance with the Code, the Board has given 
consideration as to whether or not the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and concluded that it is. A statement to this effect is included in 
the directors responsibilities statement on page 55. The 
preparation of this document is co-ordinated by the Finance and 
Company Secretariat teams with group-wide support and input 
from other areas of the business. Comprehensive reviews have 
been undertaken at regular intervals throughout the process by 
senior management and other contributing personnel within 
the Company.
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the financial statements 
and supporting assumptions that the Company is a going concern 
are set out on pages 55 and 24 respectively. 
Risk management and internal control
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks the Company faces. These risks 
include strategic, operational, legal, regulatory, reputation and 
financial risks. The Company’s risk management processes are 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of the 
Company failing to achieve its business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Company’s risk management systems are subject to continual 
review and development. The controls and processes are 
overseen by the Group Chief Operating Officer and the Group 
Compliance and Risk Officer in conjunction with the Group 
Compliance and Risk Committee. The Company’s compliance and 
risk management processes and systems are designed to ensure 
that management and the Company’s various business units 
regularly review the risks and controls in their risk registers and 
that the tracking and monitoring of outstanding risk mitigation 
actions or controls are actioned in a timely manner and properly 
followed up. The Group Compliance and Risk Committee reports 
on its work to the Audit Committee.
The principal risks facing the Company and the risk mitigation 
actions, controls and processes by which they are managed are 
explained in the report on the management of risks on pages 17 to 
19. The Audit Committee and the Board monitor and review the 
Company’s principal risks regularly along with the risk mitigation 
actions, controls and processes in place to manage those risks 
recorded in the risk register to ensure they are up to-date and 
remain appropriate taking into account the changing 
circumstances in which the Company operates.
Further information on financial risks is given in note 25.
The Company’s offices worldwide have in place plans to deal with 
a range of eventualities, which could cause serious disruption to 
the Company’s businesses such as a fire, a natural disaster or 
flooding. These plans are also designed to cope with situations 
such as an outbreak of a pandemic. Business continuity planning 
arrangements, especially in respect to IT, have been developed 
and are regularly tested to enable key offices around the world to 
have a business continuity capability. 
The Board is responsible for the Company’s system of internal 
control, which consists of internal audit, compliance and risk 
management teams along with various control systems and 
procedures in each of the Company’s business units. The Board 
regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s system of 
internal control in accordance with the Code.
The Board continues to take steps to further embed internal 
control, compliance and risk management into the operations of 
the Company and monitor and review matters which come to 
management’s and the Board’s attention.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
An internal audit team operates within the Company. The team is 
managed and led by a senior manager who reports directly to the 
Group Chief Operating Officer and to the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Committee and the Board receive four reports each year 
summarising the findings of their audits together with a schedule 
of the outstanding audit issues and progress against their internal 
audit timetable.
The internal audit team is responsible for auditing the Company’s 
businesses worldwide. An audit timetable is approved by the Audit 
Committee at the beginning of the year and is subject to review 
throughout the year. The audit programme is focused around the 
Company’s principal risks and will also take into consideration 
amongst other things the operational, financial and administrative 
aspects of the Company’s businesses, taking as their points of 
reference those businesses’ controls and procedures, the controls 
recorded in the risk register and any reported incidents. Some 
audits are occasionally carried out by external consultants or by 
staff from outside the internal audit team. The internal audit team’s 
effectiveness is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee.
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary have 
been taken or are being taken to remedy such failings and 
weaknesses which it has determined to be significant from its 
review of the systems of internal control. This has involved 
considering the matters reported to it and developing plans and 
programmes that it considers are reasonable in the circumstances.
The external auditor’s reports to the Audit Committee includes 
their views as to the principal risks facing the Group from an audit 
perspective and how their audit approach seeks to address them 
and their findings.
The Company’s compliance obligations are overseen by the Group 
Compliance and Risk Officer and the Group Compliance and Risk 
Committee, which reports to the Group Chief Operating Officer. 
The Group Compliance and Risk Officer submits a report to the 
Audit Committee four times a year, which includes details of any 
material incidents reported by management where controls have 
either failed or nearly failed. The Company’s systems and controls 
are regularly reviewed and enhancements made where 
appropriate, in light of reported incidents.
The UK regulated activities of the Company are primarily carried 
out through two principal subsidiaries, Charles Taylor Services 
Limited, which is regulated in the UK as an insurance intermediary, 
and by Charles Taylor Investment Management Company Limited 
which is regulated as an investment manager, by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA), in accordance with the requirements of 
the Financial Services Act 2012.
Certain subsidiary companies operate in overseas markets 
and are regulated by the relevant regulators in compliance with 
local regulation.
Relationship with shareholders
The Company values dialogue with its shareholders. Any meetings 
with shareholders are reported on at Board meetings and the 
non-executive directors may attend such meetings if they wish to 
do so. The Company has an “Investor” section on its website.
The Company communicates with shareholders through the 
annual report, the half year report and the AGM. The Company 
also meets with major shareholders when required. The Company 
has taken advantage of the provisions within the Companies Act 
2006 which allows communication with shareholders to be made 
electronically where shareholders have not requested hard copy 
documentation. The AGM is held in a central London location and 
the Notice and any related papers are issued to shareholders at 
least 20 working days before the date of the AGM to ensure that 
shareholders have sufficient time in which to consider the items of 
business. The AGM provides the Board with an opportunity to 
meet informally and communicate directly with private investors. 
Separate resolutions are proposed for each item of business and 
the “for”, “against” and “withheld” proxy votes cast in respect of 
each resolution are counted and announced after the shareholders 
present have voted on each resolution. Voting at the AGM is 
conducted by way of a show of hands, unless a poll is demanded, 
in order to encourage questions from and interaction with private 
investors. Proxy votes lodged on each AGM resolution are also 
announced to the London Stock Exchange and published on the 
Company’s website. All the directors attended the AGM in 2013 
and all directors are due to attend the AGM to be held on 
8 May 2014. Charles Taylor plc

integrity of the Company’s financial reporting and statements. 
It also plays an important role in monitoring and managing the 
internal and external risks faced by the Company, by reviewing

External auditor
• noted recent European developments relating to auditor 
independence and rotation;

• reviewed the performance and effectiveness of the services 
provided by the external auditor, and considered opportunities

Significant financial judgements
The Committee considered the following significant issues 
regarding the financial statements:
• whether the attribution of the Company’s business operations 
to Cash Generating Unit’s (CGU) was appropriate, supported 
by management and financial reporting structures and whether 
the carrying value of Goodwill and Intangibles was supported 
by appraised values in use under a range of future 
operating conditions;
• the determination of revenue for the year and in particular the 
determination and age profile of debtors and the valuation of 
work-in-progress;
• the carrying value of deferred tax balances in the light of 
the expected geographic distribution of the Company’s 
taxable profits;
• the funding position of the Company’s defined benefit pension 
schemes, in comparison with comparable schemes, and the 
primary assumptions on which the valuations were based; and
• the availability and term of the Company’s financing 
arrangements together with its future cash flow projections and 
sensitivity of the same to different economic and operating 
conditions and assessed whether the going concern basis 
of accounting was appropriate for the Company’s 
financial statements.
Auditor re-appointment
The Company’s audit services have been provided by Deloitte LLP 
since the Company’s floatation in 1996 with regular audit partner 
rotations. The lead audit partner was last changed by rotation in 
2010. The Committee undertook an external tender for Group 
audit during 2013 and received submitted tenders from three audit 
firms; the current auditor, Deloitte LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP and KPMG LLP. After a thorough review process, the 
Committee agreed to recommend to the Board that Deloitte LLP 
be retained as the Company’s external auditor, with which the 
Board concurred. Resolutions will put to shareholders at the AGM 
over the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP and the setting of its fees.
Non-audit services
The Committee reviews regularly the amount and nature of 
non-audit work performed by the external auditor. The Committee 
accepts in principle that certain work of a non-audit nature is best 
undertaken by the external auditor. The Company’s policy on 
non-audit services provides clear guidance on the categories of 
non-audit work which may be undertaken by the external auditor, 
as well as setting out categories of work that may not be 
undertaken by the external auditor. The policy also sets out 
the circumstances when consent from the Committee is 
required where work falls into neither the pre-approved nor 
prohibited categories. 
Committee effectiveness
The Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness taking both 
direct feedback and also considering the findings of the Board review 
conducted by the Senior Independent Director. The review concluded 
that the Committee had received sufficient, reliable and timely 
information from management to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities 
and that the Committee had performed a valuable role in debating the 
Company’s risk assessment and in holding management to account 
in relation to the effectiveness of the Company’s control environment 
and associated assurance processes.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN –  
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Remuneration 
Report for the year to 31 December 2013. There are a number of 
new requirements this year in relation to the content of the 
Remuneration Report following changes made to the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the layout of this report 
reflects the new regulations and contains:
• the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in relation to future 
payments to the directors and former directors; and
• the Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out payments 
made in the financial year ending 31 December 2013.
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) takes responsibility 
for setting and reviewing the remuneration of executive directors. 
At Charles Taylor, we believe that the interests of shareholders and 
executive directors should be aligned as much as possible. The 
Committee seeks to achieve this by incentivising executive 
directors to deliver success over time through sustainable and 
profitable growth.
The Committee continues to apply restraint to executive directors’ 
remuneration. The executive directors received a base salary 
increase of 3% each at the 1 January 2014 review date, which is 
their first increase for four years. 
We follow a rigorous process to set objectives and measure 
performance. Annual bonus awards have been made in respect of 
the 2013 performance year to all executive directors. Taking 
account of overall performance the Committee has awarded 
bonuses at the on-target level. The Group Chief Executive Officer, 
David Marock was awarded a cash bonus payment for 2013 
performance of £320,000 (100% of base salary; 66.6% of 
maximum bonus). The other executive directors were awarded 
bonuses in respect of performance in 2013 of not more than 67% 
of base salary; 66.6% of maximum bonus. These bonuses are 
primarily a reflection of excellent financial performance with 
year-on-year growth in Group adjusted PBT (+9.2%), Group 
adjusted EPS (+9.4%) and the Professional Services Operating 
profit (+11.9%). They also reflect significant achievements by the 
executive directors when measured against their agreed set of 
personal objectives, their contribution to the success and 
development of the Company in the year and the Company’s 
overall performance. 
Of the existing Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards, the 2010 
LTIP awards for which the TSR performance period was 
completed and that were due to vest in April 2013 did not meet the 
TSR performance condition and therefore lapsed in full. The 
Committee made LTIP grants in 2013 subject to our stretching 
TSR and EPS performance targets; these are due to vest in 2016 
provided the performance conditions are met. Full details of how 
the Committee will operate the policy in 2014 are set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policy for 
executive directors is: clear and simple, emphasises pay-for-
performance over time; and is closely aligned to the business 
strategy and the interests of shareholders. I commend to you our 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the 
remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The policy has been developed taking into account 
the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and the 
views of major investors and describes the policy to be applied 
from 2014 onwards. The Director’s Remuneration Policy will be put 
to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and the policy will 
take formal effect as an approved policy for the purposes of 
section 226D(6)(b) of the Companies Act 2006 from that date.
Policy overview
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, 
motivate and retain directors and senior management of high 
calibre. The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee” hereafter) 
believes that the interests of shareholders and executive directors 
should be aligned as far as possible. It seeks to achieve this by 
incentivising executive directors to deliver success over time 
through sustainable and profitable growth. This includes the use of 
annual bonus awards linked to clear personal and departmental 
objectives and to the overall performance of the Company, and 
awards under the LTIP linked to longer-term, sustained 
company performance. 
The Committee undertakes periodic external comparisons to 
examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles 
in similar companies taking into account their size, business 
complexity, international scope and relative performance.
How the views of shareholders are taken into account
The Company values dialogue with its shareholders. The 
Committee considers investor feedback and the voting results 
received in relation to relevant AGM resolutions, each year. This is 
considered alongside any additional feedback on remuneration 
received from shareholders and/or shareholder representatives 
from time to time. If the Committee contemplates making any 
material changes to the remuneration policy outlined in this 
section, we will consult with major shareholders and/or their 
representative bodies before putting changes to the remuneration 
policy to shareholders. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last 
year’s remuneration report are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Company
The pay and employment conditions of Charles Taylor employees 
are taken into account when setting executive remuneration policy. 
The Company does not formally consult with employees in respect 
of the design of the executive directors’ remuneration policy. 
Remuneration policy for directors
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for 
executive directors:
1. Fixed pay, comprising base salary, pension scheme 
contributions and other benefits.
2. Annual performance-related remuneration, including deferral 
into shares.
3. Long-term performance-related remuneration in the form of 
share awards.
The table on the following page provides a summary of the key 
aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors: Charles Taylor plc

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Executive directors’ remuneration policy
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Base salary To provide a core level 
of reward sufficient to 
attract, motivate and retain 
directors of high calibre, able 
to develop and execute the 
Company’s strategy.
Executive directors’ base salaries 
are reviewed at the end of each 
financial year and are determined 
by the Committee taking account 
of base salaries and base salary 
increases in the Company as a 
whole, the individual’s experience 
and performance, and current 
market rates.
Periodic reference is also 
made to median levels amongst 
relevant FTSE and industry 
comparators of similar size 
and scope.
The Committee considers the 
impact of any basic salary 
increase on the total 
remuneration package. 
Directors’ salaries (and other 
elements of the remuneration 
package) may be paid in different 
currencies as appropriate to 
reflect their geographic location.
The Committee is guided by 
the general increase for the 
broader employee population, 
but on occasions may need to 
recognise, for example, 
development in role, change 
in position or responsibility, 
and market levels. For this 
reason the Committee does 
not feel it is appropriate to set 
a maximum salary as this 
would limit its ability to 
respond to market conditions 
and could set expectations of 
salary levels for future 
appointments. 
Salary levels may be changed 
from time to time by the 
Committee within this policy. 
Current salaries are set out 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Benefits To provide cost-effective and 
market-competitive benefits to 
support the well-being 
of directors.
Executive directors receive 
certain benefits-in-kind such as 
a car or car allowance, private 
medical insurance and other 
insurance benefits. 
Other ancillary benefits may be 
provided, including relocation 
assistance (as required).
Benefits constitute only a 
small percentage of total 
remuneration and the value is 
not subject to a specific cap. 
The benefits provided may be 
subject to minor amendment 
from time to time by the 
Committee within this policy.
Pension To provide directors with a 
market competitive pension/
long-term savings option to 
assist with recruitment 
and retention.
A defined contribution to a 
money purchase pension 
scheme is provided, or an 
equivalent cash allowance. 
Any employer contribution is 
limited to maximum of 15% of 
base salary.
This is reviewed periodically 
by the Committee and may be 
subject to minor change 
within the policy. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Annual bonus To tie a proportion of 
remuneration to the 
Company’s annual 
performance.
Compulsory partial deferral 
serves further to align the 
executive directors’ interests 
with those of shareholders.
Each executive’s annual bonus is 
determined based on group, 
divisional/functional and personal 
financial and non-financial goals. 
The main emphasis is on financial 
objectives. 
Where a bonus award is above a 
certain size, a proportion will be 
delivered in deferred Company 
shares which will be released in 
three equal tranches after one, 
two and three years.
For awards in respect of 2014, 
where a bonus award exceeds 
the on-target level, the portion 
above the on-target level will be 
deferred as described above.
Annual bonus awards are 
non-pensionable.
With effect from the 2014 bonus 
award year and onwards, there is 
a claw-back provision in place. 
This allows the Committee to 
seek to recoup paid and deferred 
bonus in exceptional 
circumstances.
Summary details of the 
performance targets set for the 
year under review and 
performance against them is 
provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration to the degree 
these are not commercially 
sensitive. 
The policy maximum is 150% 
of base salary for excellent 
performance, although the 
Committee may set individual 
limits on bonus that are below 
this policy maximum taking 
account of individuals’ roles.
For on-target performance the 
bonus opportunity is usually 
limited to no more than 
two-thirds of the maximum.
Participants may be eligible to 
receive a payment in either 
cash or shares, following 
vesting, representing the 
dividends that have accrued 
during the vesting period. Charles Taylor plc

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Long-term incentive plan 
2007 (LTIP)
To tie a proportion of 
remuneration to the Company’s 
longer-term performance to 
further align the executive 
directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders.
Annual awards of performance 
shares or nil-cost options are 
made. These awards are subject 
to a three-year service and 
performance period.
The Committee sets performance 
conditions taking account of the 
business strategy. From 2013 
onwards LTIP grants are currently 
subject to two performance 
metrics, to give a more rounded 
view of Company performance:
Half of the award is currently 
subject to Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) relative to the 
constituents of a relevant 
comparator index or peer group 
and the other half of the award is 
currently subject to Earnings Per 
Share (EPS) growth. The 
Committee has authority to 
change the metrics for future 
awards, which will be subject to 
consultation in advance with major 
shareholders for material changes.
The Committee has the discretion 
to make a downward adjustment 
(including to zero if appropriate) to 
the vesting outcome under the 
performance metrics, if it 
considers that this is necessary to 
take account of its broader 
assessment of the performance of 
the Company.
With effect from awards in respect 
of the 2014 financial year and 
onwards, there is a claw-back 
provision in place. This allows the 
Committee to seek to recoup LTIP 
awards in exceptional 
circumstances.
The normal maximum annual 
award size (in face value) under 
the LTIP is 75% of base salary. 
The plan rules permit higher 
awards in exceptional 
circumstances. The Committee 
does not expect that any 
individual award would exceed 
125% of base salary.
For threshold performance, 25% 
of the award will vest, increasing 
on a straight line basis up to 
100% of the award for maximum 
performance.
Participants in the LTIP may be 
eligible to receive a payment in 
either cash or shares, following 
vesting representing the 
dividends that they would have 
accrued on the vested shares in 
the vesting period.
All employee share schemes To encourage employee share 
participation.
The Company may from time to 
time operate tax-approved share 
plans (such as HMRC-approved 
Save As You Earn scheme) for 
which executive directors could 
be eligible.
The schemes are subject to the 
limits set by tax authorities. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Minimum shareholding 
requirement (MSR)
To further align executive 
directors’ interests with 
shareholders.
Each executive director will be 
required to build up and maintain a 
holding of Company shares 
equivalent to a multiple of base 
salary, as determined by the 
Committee.
Until an executive director has built 
up such a shareholding, they are 
required to retain 100% of any LTIP 
shares that vest, net of tax, and 
invest at least 25% of the value of 
any cash bonus in shares, net 
of tax.
N/A
Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
In operating the annual bonus plan and LTIP, the Committee will adhere to the respective plan rules and the Listing Rules where relevant. 
There are several areas with regards to the operation and administration of these plans for which the Committee will retain discretion. 
Consistent with market practice, these include (but are not limited to) the following:
• Selecting the participants;
• The timing of grant and/or payment;
• The size of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• The extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance;
• Determination of a good leaver and where relevant the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans;
• Treatment in exceptional circumstances such as a change of control, in which the Committee would act in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders;
• Making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of 
capital and special dividends); 
• Cash settling awards; and
• The annual review of performance measures, weightings and setting targets for the annual bonus and discretionary share plans from 
year to year.
Any performance conditions may be amended or substituted if one or more events occur which cause the Committee to reasonably 
consider that the performance conditions would not without alteration achieve its original purpose. Any varied performance condition 
would not be materially less difficult to satisfy.
Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting
The performance metrics that are used for our annual bonus and long-term incentive plans are chosen to reflect the Group’s key 
performance indicators and strategic aims. Performance objectives are designed to encourage continuous improvement and incentivise 
the delivery of stretch performance. A small percentage of the total opportunity is available for delivering threshold performance levels 
with maximum outcomes requiring exceptional performance.
Annual bonus
In determining any bonus award, the Committee takes into account the performance of each executive director against his objectives, his 
contribution to the success and development of the Company in the year and the Company’s overall performance. The measures and 
criteria set may vary from year to year as appropriate to reflect the changing needs of the business.
LTIP 
The LTIP is currently based on EPS and TSR performance. Growth in EPS is a measure of the Company’s overall financial success and 
closely aligns the executives’ interests with those of our shareholders. TSR provides an external assessment of the Company’s 
performance and captures the total return created for shareholders. Charles Taylor plc
40
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Governance
A sliding scale of targets is set for each measure that take account of corporate plans and external market expectations for the Company. 
The Committee will review the appropriateness of the performance targets prior to each LTIP grant. The Committee reserves the 
discretion within this policy to set different measures and targets for future awards, providing that, in the opinion of the Committee, the 
new targets are no less challenging and are appropriate to the strategy in light of the circumstances at the time than those used 
previously. Should there be a material change in the Company’s performance conditions (e.g. introducing an additional or alternative 
performance metric) appropriate consultation with the Company’s major shareholders would take place in advance along with a full 
explanation in the Annual Report on Remuneration to support any such change. The measures and targets for awards granted under this 
remuneration policy are set out for shareholder approval in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
All-employee schemes
No performance targets are set for awards under tax-approved share plans as these are non-discretionary plans designed for all 
employees. Any such plans are designed to encourage employees across the Group to purchase Company shares and applying 
performance targets to these awards would materially reduce the effect in this regard.
Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors compared to other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive directors is designed having regard to the pay and employment conditions of other employees 
in the Company and its subsidiaries. 
There are some differences in the structure of the remuneration policy for the executive directors (as set out above) compared to that for 
other employees within the organisation, which the Committee believes are necessary to reflect the differing levels of seniority and 
responsibility. The remuneration policy for the executive directors places a greater weight on performance-based variable pay through the 
long-term incentive scheme. This ensures the remuneration of the executives is aligned with both the long-term performance of the 
Company and therefore the interests of shareholders.
External non-executive director positions
Executive directors may be required to serve as directors on a number of external organisations directly related to the Group’s business 
activities; they receive no fees or additional remuneration for these appointments. 
To further develop their skills and experience, executive directors are permitted, subject to approval of the Board, to have normally no 
more than one external non-executive directorship, unrelated to Charles Taylor, and are allowed to retain the fees earned in relation 
to this.
Details of external directorships held by the executive directors and any fees that they received are provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Approach to new executive director appointments
The remuneration package for a new executive director will be set in accordance with the Company’s approved remuneration policy as 
set out in this report, subject to the points below.
The base salary level of a newly appointed executive will be set taking into account the individual’s experience and the nature of the role 
being offered. Dependent on the previous experience of the individual appointed, base salary may be initially positioned below the 
relevant market rate for the role and increased as the individual gains in relevant experience subject to their individual performance.
In the case of an external hire, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in 
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, to compensate for remuneration foregone by the individual in order to take up the 
role. This includes the use of awards made under 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules. Such awards would take account of the form (cash or shares) 
and time horizons attaching to remuneration foregone and the impact of any performance conditions.
For an internal appointment, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to 
its terms of grant and the appointee will become subject to the minimum shareholding requirements policy on their appointment as an 
executive director.
Service contracts and payments for loss of office
All the executive directors have entered into service agreements with the Company, requiring notice of termination to be given by either 
party. It is the Company’s policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months.
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued Charles Taylor plc
41
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
A director’s service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums 
accrued up to the date of termination, in the event of gross misconduct. If the Company terminates the employment of an executive 
director in other circumstances, compensation is limited to base salary due for any unexpired notice period, plus an amount in respect of 
contractual benefits and pension which would have been received during the unexpired notice period. In the event of a change of control 
of the Company there is no enhancement to contractual terms. 
Directors’ contracts of service and letters of appointment, which include details of their remuneration, are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company during normal business hours and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

In addition, any statutory entitlements in connection with the termination would be paid

Remuneration entitlements An annual bonus may also become payable subject to performance, for the period of active 
service only. Outstanding share awards will vest in accordance with the provisions of the 
various scheme rules – see below.
In all cases, performance targets would apply to annual bonus and/or LTIP awards.
Change of control There are no enhanced terms in the contracts in relation to termination following a change 
of control. However, under the relevant plan rules, there is scope for accelerated vesting of 
any share awards.
*  Alistair Groom stepped down from the Board on 28 February 2014.
If an executive director leaves employment, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. 
Normally, any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However if an executive director ceases employment with the 
Group as a ‘good leaver’ as defined in the various scheme rules or in the event of a takeover, any outstanding share awards will vest in 
accordance with those rules. In the case of the LTIP awards, vesting is normally subject to a performance condition, with a pro-rata 
reduction in the size of the award to reflect the period of time that the award has been held. Any remainder of the awards will lapse.
Under the bonus plan, the deferred shares for a good leaver will immediately vest in full and if the award is in the form of an option, there 
is a 12-month window in which the award can be exercised.
In determining whether an executive should be treated as a good leaver or not, the Committee will take into account the performance of 
the individual and the reasons for their departure.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with 
current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) that have been disclosed to 
shareholders in previous Directors’ Remuneration Reports. This includes, for example, the recruitment awards made to both David 
Marock and Tito Soso.
Reward scenarios
Under the Company’s remuneration policy, a significant portion of the remuneration received by executive directors is dependent on 
Company performance. The chart below illustrates how the total pay opportunities for the executive directors vary under three different 
performance scenarios: fixed pay only (minimum), on-target performance and maximum performance. The chart is only indicative, as the 
effect of share price movements and dividend accrual have been excluded. All the assumptions used are noted below the chart.  Charles Taylor plc

Assumptions: 
• Fixed pay = salary + benefits + pension contribution
• Target = 67% of the annual bonus and 25% of the LTIP awards vesting
• Maximum = 100% of the annual bonus and LTIP awards vesting 
Base salary levels are based on those to applying on 1 January 2014. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost of supplying 
those benefits (as disclosed) for the year ending 31 December 2013. The remuneration of Joe Roach has been converted from US dollars 
into pounds using the 2013 year average exchange rate of 0.637165. 
The on-target bonus potential used for David Marock, Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach is 100%, 67%, 35% and 27.5% of base salary 
respectively. The maximum bonus potential used for David Marock, Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach is 150%, 100%, 52.5% and 
41.25% of base salary respectively. The LTIP awards used for David Marock is 75% of base salary. Whilst under this policy awards can be 
higher, the customary award sizes used for Tito Soso, Damian Ely and Joe Roach are 50%, 50% and 31% of base salary respectively. 
The executive directors may participate in all-employee share schemes on the same basis as other employees. The value that may be 
received under these schemes is subject to tax approved limits. For simplicity, the value that may be received from participating in these 
schemes has been excluded from the above charts. 
Non-executive directors

Non-executive directors’ fees policy
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Non-executive director fees To attract and retain a high- 
calibre chairman and non-
executive directors by offering 
market competitive fee levels. 
The Chairman is paid a single  
fee for all his responsibilities.  
The Non-executives are paid a 
basic fee. The Chairmen of the 
Board Committees and the  
Senior Independent Director are 
paid an additional fee to reflect 
their extra responsibilities.
The level of these fees is  
reviewed periodically by the 
Committee and Chief Executive 
for the Chairman and by the 
Chairman and Executive  
Directors for the Non-executive 
Directors, with reference to  
market levels in comparably  
sized FTSE companies, and a 
recommendation is then made  
to the Board. The Non-executive 
Directors have the option to 
forego their fees in exchange for 
shares in the Company. 
Non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the 
Company’s annual bonus or  
share plans and are not eligible  
for any pension entitlements  
from the Company.
The Committee is guided in 
considering any increase in fees 
by reference to current market 
levels but on occasions may need 
to recognise, for example, 
changes in responsibility and/or 
time commitments.
For the appointment of a new chairman or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company and are subject to annual re-election at the AGM. The 
appointment letters for the Chairman and non-executive directors provide that no compensation is payable on termination, other than 
accrued fees and expenses. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The figures in the single figure table are derived from the following:
Total salary and fees The amount of salary fees received in the year.
Taxable benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the year. These are car allowance, private medical 
insurance, life assurance, permanent health insurance and subscriptions.
Annual bonus Annual bonus that was earned in the year and can be split between cash and shares. Shares 
awarded will be released in three equal tranches after one, two and three years. This includes 
£18,000, £24,000 and £34,000 of the bonuses received by Damian Ely, Alistair Groom and Joe 
Roach for 2012.
Long-term incentives The value of LTIP awards that vest in respect of a performance period that is completed by the end 
of the relevant financial year. For 2013 this includes the 2010 LTIP award under which none has 
vested. For 2012 this includes the 2009 LTIP award under which none has vested.
Pension related benefits The pension figure represents the cash value of pension contributions received by the executive 
directors. 
Other Other includes the value of SAYE options vesting in the financial year.
Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2013 UK
At the start of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the bonus opportunity for the year and reviews and challenges the 
performance objectives for each executive director. They are predominately financial as exemplified below but also include some specific 
operational, people and client related objectives which are personal to the executives. The Committee challenges to ensure they are 
consistent with the strategy, budget and sufficiently stretching. The Group Chief Executive Officer and individual directors agree the 
objectives and all the objectives are shared in the executive team to ensure the team works collectively.
For 2013, the bonus opportunities for the executive directors were as follows:
On-target  
% of salary
Maximum  
% of salary
David Marock 100% 150%
Damian Ely 25% 37.5%
Alistair Groom 30% 45%
Joe Roach 25% 37.5%
Tito Soso 67% 100%
At the end of the year, the Group Chief Executive Officer and individual directors review the performance against the objectives. 
Quantifiable measures are used wherever possible. The Committee assesses the performance of the Company, each business and 
support service team and the individual and determines the performance level achieved. On-target performance is considered to be the 
achievement of objectives and in particular key financial objectives. Exceptional business performance would be required to achieve 
maximum performance. 
Given overall Group adjusted profits are 9.2% ahead of the prior year (which is slightly ahead of budget), the starting point for our 
discussions was on-target bonuses, with adjustments up or down depending on progress on other objectives. Charles Taylor plc

Examples of the personal objectives which relate to business, people and clients include: 
• Strive to deliver strong financial performance for mutual clients while maintaining client servicing and satisfaction levels.
• Create new business products and services to generate specified amounts of revenue and profit. 
• Ensure top team firmly established and operating effectively and that succession planning is well underway for key senior staff across 
the Group.
• Attract, retain and develop top talent within each business.
• Develop and gain buy-in for a co-ordinated group-wide marketing, public relations, business development and sales approach 
and culture.
• Ensure restructuring plans are agreed and drive delivery within the agreed timeframes of cost cutting targets.
• Drive down debt ratios through improved working capital and active management of the insurers in run-off business. 
Performance for some of these criteria was well ahead of target. However, looking at performance overall, the executive directors were 
judged to have achieved on-target performance.

Vesting of LTIP awards
The LTIP awards granted on 29 April 2010 were based on performance to 28 April 2013 to vest 29 April 2013. As disclosed in previous 
annual reports, the performance condition for these awards measured the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to the 
constituent companies of the FTSE Small Cap Index in accordance with the following table:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator 
Group by reference to TSR Percentage of shares which may vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
For this 2010 award, Charles Taylor’s rank was below the median rank and accordingly no awards vested.

LTIP awards made in 2013
LTIP awards totalling 270,000 shares were made on 23 April 2013 at a share price of £1.69 (the middle market quotation share price prior 
to the gate of grant). As reported last year, on 16 January 2013, the Committee awarded Tito Soso an initial grant under the LTIP of 
150,000 shares and a one-off award of 100,000 shares under Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2) of the FCA Handbook, both at a share price 
of £1.725. 
Details of these awards are set out in the table below. The maximum award level permitted under the LTIP is 75% of base salary per 
annum, however, the Plan Rules permit an award above the normal 75% of base salary limit in exceptional circumstances (although the 
Committee does not expect that any individual award would exceed 125% of base salary).

1 The Tito Soso LTIP award is subject to the LTIP Rules and the TSR performance condition, and vests three years from the date of grant. This grant took into account any grant 
of a LTIP award Tito Soso would have been eligible for in the normal 2013 LTIP grant round.
2 The Recruitment Award was granted on similar terms to the LTIP, save that the LTIP performance condition does not apply to the Recruitment Award.
The April awards are subject to a three-year performance period ending 31 December 2015 and are due to vest on 23 April 2016. The 
proportion of shares which may be transferred under the LTIP will be determined by two performance metrics. Half of the award will be 
subject to the Company’s TSR relative to the constituent companies of the FTSE Small Cap Index in accordance with the following table:
Ranking of the Company against the comparator 
Group by reference to TSR Percentage of shares which may vest
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile 100%
The other half of the award will be subject to Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth relative to UK RPI (Retail Price Index) inflation. There will be 
zero vesting of this element if performance is below RPI+3 percentage points per annum, 25% vesting for RPI+3 percentage points per 
annum, and 100% vesting for RPI+9 percentage points per annum (linear interpolation between threshold and maximum). 
The Committee also has the discretion to make a downward adjustment (including to zero if appropriate) to the vesting outcome under 
either performance metric, if it considers that this is necessary to take account of its broader assessment of the performance of 
the Company. Charles Taylor plc

Directors’ interests and Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)
There is a MSR for the executive directors. Each executive director is required to build up and maintain a holding of Charles Taylor plc 
shares equivalent in value to 1x base salary. Until they have achieved this shareholding, they are required to retain 100% of any LTIP 
shares that vest, net of tax, and invest 25% of the value of any cash bonus in shares, net of tax.
The beneficial interests of directors in the ordinary share capital of the Company at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 were

Executive share options (ESOS)
No options were granted during the 2013 financial year, and none have been granted since 2006. Previous grants of options became 
exercisable only if the total earnings per ordinary share increased by at least the rate of increase of the Retail Price Index plus 6 
percentage points per annum, over the three-year vesting period and may be exercised up to ten years after the date of the award. 
The executive directors are no longer permitted to participate in the ESOS.
Save As You Earn (SAYE)
The Company also operates SAYE share option schemes for eligible employees, under which options may be granted at a discount of 
up to 20% of market value. The value of options over shares that participants can be granted is capped, and is based on a monthly 
contribution to a savings account of a maximum of £250 per participant. The executive directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE 
share option scheme.
The Company’s shares were trading at £2.52 at the year-end (2012: £1.69) and traded in the range £1.65 to £2.6825 throughout the year.
Pension and other arrangements
With effect from 1 July 2011, defined benefit pension accrual for future service ceased for any of the executive directors. All of the 
executive directors are now in receipt of either a defined contribution to a money purchase pension scheme, or an equivalent cash 
allowance. The table below details the defined contribution and cash allowance arrangements for each executive director.

There was no increase in the accrued pension values under the defined benefits scheme during the year. The following table sets out the

The decreases in transfer values in 2013 were principally due to the impact of the rise in yields on gilts and bonds. The normal retirement

UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration principles
The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and executive directors should be aligned, as far as possible. It seeks to 
achieve this by incentivising executive directors to deliver success over time through sustainable and profitable growth. 
Remuneration Committee
The Company’s Remuneration Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. The members of the Committee during the year were Julian Avery (Chairman), Julian Cazalet, Gill Rider and David Watson, all 
independent non-executive directors, and Rupert Robson who is the Non-Executive Group Chairman. Gill Rider took over as Chairman of 
the Committee on the retirement of Julian Avery on 31 December 2013. Edward Creasy joined the Committee on his appointment as a 
director on 1 January 2014. None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of 
interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. 
The Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for the executive directors and senior management, for determining 
specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, and recommending to the Board changes to the fees of the Non-
Executive Group Chairman. The Group Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings by invitation. The Committee met six times during 
2013. No executive director plays a part in any discussion or decision about his or her own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website at www.ctplc.com under the Investor section – 
Corporate Governance or from the Company Secretariat department.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness taking both direct feedback and also the findings of the Board review conducted 
by the Senior Independent Director. The review concluded that the Committee had received sufficient, reliable and timely information to 
enable it to fulfil its responsibilities.
Advisers
New Bridge Street, (NBS), a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, is retained as the adviser to the Remuneration Committee. NBS was 
appointed by the Committee to provide advice and information and is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct 
which requires that its advice be objective and impartial. NBS has not provided other services to the Company during the financial year.
New Bridge Street’s fees for providing advice and information related to remuneration and employee share plans to the Committee 
amounted to £49,397.
In addition to New Bridge Street, the following people provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year:
David Marock Group Chief Executive Officer

External appointments
As detailed in the Remuneration Policy, to further develop their skills and experience, executive directors are permitted, subject to 
approval of the Board, to have up to one external non-executive directorship, unrelated to Charles Taylor, and are allowed to retain the 
fees earned in relation to this. No executive directors had an external directorship unrelated to Charles Taylor during the year under 
review, other than Tito Soso who was a director of Ceme SpA on his appointment, but resigned on 3 July 2013.
Dilution
The ABI guidelines permit the Company to issue options and awards of shares of up to 10% of the issued share capital on a ten-year 
rolling basis, of which 5% can be applied against discretionary schemes (LTIP and ESOS). As at 31 December 2013, there were 1,422,258

Annual bonus awards
Under the annual bonus arrangement for 2014, the Committee has approved the opportunities and a set of individual performance 
objectives for each executive director as part of the Company’s performance management process. These objectives are tailored to the 
roles of each executive and consist of both financial and non-financial goals. They are predominately financial but also include some 
specific operational, people and client related objectives which are personal to the executives. The Committee believes these objectives 
to be commercially sensitive and has chosen not to disclose them in advance. Retrospective disclosure will be provided in next year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and 
have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial 
statements under IFRS as adopted by the European Union. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of Charles Taylor plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income 
statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated and parent company statements of financial position, 
the consolidated and parent company cash flow statements, the 
consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity 
and the related notes 1 to 34. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the group financial statements, in 
addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as 
issued by the IASB.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ 
statement that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate; and we have not identified any material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below  
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team: Charles Taylor plc

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of pension scheme obligations 
The Group’s net pension liability as at 31 December 2013 is 
£26.7million.
The valuation of this liability involves actuarial modelling and is 
dependent on judgemental assumptions. The key judgments 
include those around the discount rate, price inflation and long 
term life expectancy.
We obtained the valuations report prepared by the Group’s external 
pension actuary. As part of our review of the pension scheme 
disclosure in note 29 we have:
• utilised our internal actuarial specialists in challenging the 
valuation of pension schemes by assessing the assumptions 
made in calculating the accounting liabilities for consistency with 
prior periods and pension scheme benchmarks;
• tested the valuation of assets in the Group’s schemes by agreeing 
these to external confirmation; and
• held discussions with management and reviewed legal 
correspondence, in order to determine whether any further 
liabilities needed to be recognised.
Valuation of goodwill 
The Group balance sheet includes £41.5m of goodwill as at  
31 December 2013 resulting from past acquisitions.
The Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill is a 
judgemental process which requires estimates concerning the 
future cash flows and associated discount rates and growth rates 
based on management’s view of future business prospects at the 
time of the assessment.
We reviewed management’s goodwill analysis and impairment 
review. In order to test the valuation of goodwill we have:
• performed a detailed review of management’s forecasts and 
considered the accuracy of historic forecasting;
• challenged the discount rates applied to the expected cash flows 
with focus on the sensitivity analysis to assess the level of 
headroom that exists at a cash generating unit level; and
• reviewed the structure and allocation of goodwill to cash 
generating units to ensure this complied with accounting 
standards.
Valuation of intangibles 
The Group has recognised £11.2m of internally generated 
intangible assets as at 31 December 2013.
Intangible assets are recognised based upon management’s 
models which rely upon judgements including actuarial 
assumptions, estimated useful lives and discount rates.
We reviewed management’s analysis of the treatment of intangibles. 
In order to test the valuation of these assets we have:
• substantively tested that the recognition of capitalised expenses 
was in line with appropriate accounting standards;
• challenged management’s assumptions underlying their valuation 
and performed stress testing to assess whether these assets 
may be impaired; 
• tested that the amortisation of intangibles was in line with 
management’s policy and prior year treatment; and
• performed analytical review tests to compare the amortisation 
expense against our expectation.
Recoverability of WIP and debtors 
The Group has £22.8m of trade debtors and of £23.3m accrued 
income recognised as at 31 December 2013. 
Due to the nature of the adjusting business the final settlement of 
revenue often takes place significantly after work has been 
performed. Valuation of WIP and debtors is therefore judgemental 
as a result of management’s estimates of the recoverability of 
WIP and debtor amounts and the discounting assumptions 
applied to the recoverable amounts. 
We obtained the client’s model valuing WIP and debtors. As part of 
our testing of these numbers we:
• utilised our IT specialists to perform testing on the key systems 
and controls employed in the recording of loss adjusters time, 
which is the basis for WIP;
• reviewed the ageing of debtors and WIP at a group level to 
identify those balances that are static for long periods and 
therefore may be impaired; and 
• tested whether the discounting of WIP and debtors was 
appropriate and in line with Charles Taylor’s experience of 
recovering these balances.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on 
page 32.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. 
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with 
respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not 
express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £600,000, which is 
below 7.5% of adjusted profit for the year, and below 1% of equity. 
Adjusted profit for the year is used by the Group for reporting 
adjusted earnings per share and we determined this to be the 
underlying profit that is of most interest to investors and the entity. 
This excludes amortisation of customer intangibles and one-off 
restructuring costs.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £12,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when 
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope 
primarily on the audit work at eleven locations. Three of these 
locations were subject to a full scope audit, whilst the remaining 
eight were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent 
of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s 
operations at those locations. 
These eleven locations account for 89% of the Group’s net assets, 
85% of the Group’s revenue and 89% of the Group’s profit before 
tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the eleven 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each 
individual entity which were lower than group materiality. All 
engagements that support our group opinion are conducted by 
Deloitte member firms whom report directly into the group 
engagement partner.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process 
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
The group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that a senior member of the 
group audit team visits each of the locations where the group audit 
scope requires a full audit to be completed. Additionally we have 
held meetings with all component auditors to ensure our 
involvement in their planning considerations and risk assessment 
and to discuss their findings upon completion.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in 
our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of 
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired 
during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not 
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all  
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

The capital reserve and merger reserve arose on formation of the Group and are non-distributable capital reserves.
Own shares comprise 258,453 (2012: 238,920) shares held by the Charles Taylor Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust (ESOP).  
The market value of these shares was £651,302 (2012: £402,580) at the balance sheet date.
The trustee of the ESOP is the Codan Trust Company Limited, an independent professional trust company registered in Bermuda.  
The ESOP is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees of the Group and provides a source of shares to distribute to the Group’s 
employees (including executive directors and officers) under the Group’s various bonus and incentivisation schemes, at the discretion  
of the trustee acting on the recommendation of a committee of the Board.
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements. 
There are no significant restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent in the form of cash dividends or to repay 
loans or advances other than company law requirements dealing with distributable profits, and in the case of the insurance companies 
regulatory permissions and solvency limits.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial 
instruments that are measured at revalued amounts at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting 
policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal 
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Structure of accounting policies
The accounting policies below are structured as follows:
(a) Adoption of new and revised IFRSs
(b) Basis of consolidation.
(c) Group-wide policies.
(d) Accounting for insurance contracts and investment contracts business
(i) Non-life business.
(ii) Life business.
The most material estimates and judgements management have made in applying the accounting policies are described in note 2.
(a) Adoption of new and revised IFRSs 
(i) Standards and Interpretations adopted which impact the financial statements
In the current financial year, the Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income”, 
IAS 19R “Employee Benefits” and IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”.
The amendments to IAS 1 require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped by those items that will be reclassified 
subsequently to profit or loss and those that will never be reclassified, together with their associated income tax. The amendments have 
been applied retrospectively, and hence the presentation of items of comprehensive income have been restated to reflect the change. 
The effect of these changes is evident from the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
IAS 19R and the related consequential amendments have impacted the accounting for the Group’s defined benefit scheme,
by replacing the interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability. For the year 
to 31 December 2012 the restated profit is £447,000 lower and other comprehensive income £447,000 higher than it would have
been prior to the adoption of IAS 19R. As the Group has always recognised actuarial gains and losses immediately there has been no 
effect on the prior year defined benefit obligation. 
IFRS 13 impacts the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities, as well as introducing new disclosures, however the 
directors do not consider the impact of these changes on the financial statements to be material. 
(ii) Standards and Interpretations adopted with no effect on financial statements
The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRSs (2010). These amendments have had no impact on the Group.
Amendment to IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures”
The amendments increase the disclosure requirements for transactions involving the 
transfer of financial assets in order to provide greater transparency around risk 
exposures when financial assets are transferred. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
(iii) Standards and Interpretations in issue not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 7 (amended)    Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Annual Improvements to IFRSs   (2009 – 2011) Cycle
IFRS 9     Financial Instruments
IFRS 10     Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 13     Fair Value Measurement
IAS 1 (amended)    Presentation of financial statements
IAS 19 (revised)    Employee Benefits 
IAS 27 (revised)    Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised)    Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS 32 (amended)    Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods. 
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of control listed above.
The Group owns a number of insurance companies. The assets of the insurance companies are held for the benefit of the policyholders 
in the first instance and the Group’s interest is restricted to income from managing these businesses and a share in any surplus after 
deferred consideration payments to the former owners. Consequently, although fully consolidated, the assets and liabilities relating to 
insurance companies are separately identified in these financial statements. 
Similarly, the income and expense items relating to insurance contracts are grouped together in the consolidated income statement 
because most are related, for example claims and related insurance recoveries, and to distinguish them from the Group’s main activities.
The analysis between current and non-current assets and liabilities is not useful for insurance companies. The assets and liabilities of the 
insurance companies have been classified as current rather than non-current for practical purposes and to conform with the presentation 
used in these financial statements, although in practice an element is expected to be settled in more than one year.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control 
of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with the 
Group’s accounting policies.
All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are 
eliminated on consolidation. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may be 
initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured 
at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to 
non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The 
carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in 
the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the difference 
between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous 
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the 
related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/
permitted by applicable IFRS). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is 
regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement” or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity. 
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report on page 24.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the 
Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, 
except that:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 “Income taxes” and IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” respectively; and
• assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations” are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and is included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement 
period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are 
adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the “measurement period” (which cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Charles Taylor plc
71
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period 
adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not 
re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration  
that is classified as an asset or a liability is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, or IAS 37 “Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair 
value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit and loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. These provisional amounts are adjusted during 
the measurement period (see above), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected that amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. The Group’s 
policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is described below.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control over these policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, 
except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 “Non-current Assets 
held for Sale and Discontinued Operations”.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost 
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate. When the 
Group’s share of losses or an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in 
substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. 
Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate but the Group continues to use the equity method, the Group reclassifies 
to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that 
reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.
Where a group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are 
recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group. Charles Taylor plc

(c) Group-wide policies
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is reduced for estimated 
customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Rendering of services
Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Revenue from time 
contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct expenses incurred. 
Dividend and interest revenue
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established (provided that 
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably). 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet 
as a finance lease obligation. 
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs. 
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. 
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each 
group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they arise except for:
• exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/
hedge accounting); and
• exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised 
initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Charles Taylor plc
73
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are 
used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to 
non-controlling interests as appropriate).
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e., a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of 
control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign 
operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange differences 
in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. 
In addition, in relation to a partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not result in the Group losing control 
over the subsidiary, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are 
not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint arrangements that do not result in 
the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to 
profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the 
date of transition to IFRSs as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of results of associates and joint ventures but before 
investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling 
them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution 
retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Re-measurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the 
effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance 
sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recorded in 
the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognised in the period of the scheme amendment. Net 
interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three 
categories:
• current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
• net interest expense or income; and
• re-measurement.
The Group presents all components of defined benefit costs within administrative expenses in its consolidated income statement. 
Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined 
benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form 
of refunds from the schemes or reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Charles Taylor plc

Share-based payments 
The Group operates three share-based payment schemes: an executive scheme, a long-term incentive scheme (LTIP) for senior 
employees and a share-save (SAYE) scheme open to all qualifying employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the 
determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are as follows:
• Fair values for the executive scheme and the SAYE scheme are measured by use of the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. The 
expected option life used in the model is based on management’s best estimates, taking behavioural considerations into account.
• Fair values for the LTIP are determined using a stochastic (Monte Carlo simulation) pricing model which calculates the fair value of the 
market related element of the LTIP awards by comparing the Company’s TSR performance against a comparator group of companies. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the 
revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in 
accelerated recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability. 
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any 
changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Further information on the Group’s schemes is provided in note 24 and in the Director’s Remuneration Report.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is 
included in the accounting for the business combination.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences 
associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable 
profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in 
the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than freehold land and properties under construction) less 
their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Buildings   2.5%
Fixtures and equipment 20%–25%
Aircraft   10%
Leasehold buildings Over the lease term
Computers  25%
Motor vehicles  25%
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of 
any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between 
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Internally-generated intangible assets
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s expenditure on IT system development is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met:
• an asset is created that can be identified (such as software and new processes);
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
The value of customer relationships is measured and recorded as an intangible asset when businesses are acquired.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally-generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Charles Taylor plc

Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and 
consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are 
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset 
may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, 
unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are 
added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as “loans and receivables”. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
Held to maturity investments
Debt securities that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity (held-to-maturity debt securities) are classified as 
held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less 
any impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. 
Investments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
Investments classified as FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the 
“other gains and losses” line item in the income statement. 
Available for sale (AFS) investments
Investments classified as AFS are stated at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised directly 
in profit and loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised 
in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

Impairment
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For listed and unlisted equity instruments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its 
cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance lease receivables, objective evidence of 
impairment could include:
• significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
• default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
• it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in 
addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the 
Group’s past experience of collective payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit 
period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credit against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period. 
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does 
not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss. Any 
increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the 
heading of investments revaluation reserve. In respect of AFS debt securities, impairment losses are subsequently reversed through profit 
or loss in an increase in the fair value of the investment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the 
impairment loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, bank overdrafts and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Amounts of this nature 
held in insurance companies have been shown within assets in insurance businesses and are not generally available for use by the Group.
Client funds under group control outside the insurance companies are included in the balance sheet under cash and cash equivalents 
with a corresponding liability recognised and are also not generally available for use by the Group.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement. Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013

Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points 
paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value. They are not interest-bearing.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recognised as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, 
including foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in 
note 25.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign 
currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges).
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge 
relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management 
objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item.
Note 25 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in 
the “other gains and losses” line. 
 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item. However, 
when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and 
losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Charles Taylor plc
79
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that 
time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time 
value of money is material). 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is 
recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, 
which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.
Onerous contracts
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to 
exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it.
(d) Accounting for insurance contracts and investment contracts businesses
(i) Non-life business
Revenue from insurance contracts
Revenue from insurance contracts represents premiums earned. Premiums are earned pro rata on a time apportioned basis. Unearned 
premiums, representing unexpired periods of indemnity, are deferred and included in the balance sheet as a liability under insurance 
technical balances. The treatment of associated acquisition costs and reinsurance premiums follows that of the underlying premium. If it 
is likely that the unearned premium will not be sufficient to cover future losses, then further provision is made.
Claims
Claims incurred comprise claims and related expenses paid in the year and changes in the provision for outstanding claims. The 
treatment of associated reinsurance recoveries follows that of the underlying claim. 
Insurance technical provisions
These include outstanding claim provisions and unearned premium as liabilities and their associated reinsurance recoveries as assets, as 
well as any deferred acquisition costs.
Outstanding claims provisions
Provision is made at the year end for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the cost of 
claims incurred but not yet reported to the Group. The estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a 
deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. The Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate 
information regarding its claims exposures. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims provisions, it is likely that the final 
outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.
The estimation of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of 
claims already notified to the Group.  Charles Taylor plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
In calculating the estimated cost of unpaid claims the Group uses a variety of estimation techniques, generally based upon statistical 
analyses of historical experience, which assumes that the development pattern of the current claims will be consistent with past 
experience. Allowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which 
might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including: 
• changes in company processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and/or recording of paid or incurred claims 
compared with the statistics from previous periods;
• changes in the legal environment;
• the effects of inflation;
• changes in the mix of business;
• the impact of large losses; and
• movements in industry benchmarks.
Large claims impacting each relevant business class are generally assessed separately, being measured on a case-by-case basis or 
projected separately in order to allow for the possible distorting effect of the development and incidence of these large claims. 
Provisions are calculated gross of any reinsurance recoveries. Potential reinsurance recoveries are calculated as a function of claims, and 
shown separately in the balance sheet as “amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts”.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a quarterly basis. If there is objective evidence that the reinsurance asset is 
impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount of the reinsurance asset to its recoverable amount and recognises that impairment loss 
in the income statement for the period. 
Receivables and payables related to insurance contracts
Receivables and payables are recognised when due. These include amounts due to and from agents, brokers and insurance 
contract holders. 
If there is objective evidence that the insurance receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount of the insurance receivable 
accordingly and recognises that impairment loss in the income statement for the period. 
Non-life run-off provision for future non-operating losses
At the date of acquisition a provision is made for the expected operating losses to be incurred over the run-off period. This provision is 
released to the income statement over the expected life of the run-off.
Discount on reserves
At the date of acquisition the expected value of the claims are discounted to their present value and an asset is recognised reflecting this 
discount. This asset is amortised through the income statement over the expected life of the run-off.
 
(ii) Life business
Insurance and investment contracts – classification
The policy holders own contracts with the Group that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both.
Insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. Such contracts may also transfer financial risk. As a 
general guideline, the Group defines as significant insurance risk the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured 
event that are at least 10% more than the benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. The majority of the insurance risk arises on 
contracts where optional insurance benefits were applied for at the outset by the insured. The group practice is to treat the insurance 
element as a separate unbundled contract.
Investment contracts are those contracts that transfer financial risk with no significant insurance risk.
Further contract distinctions are “Unit Linked” and “Discretionary Participation Features” (DPF). Unit-linked contracts are those linked to 
specific assets, such that the value of contracts moves in line with the value of assets. DPF contracts are those where the policy holders 
may receive a bonus, generally based on investment performance. Unit and non-unit linked policies may or may not have DPF.
Revenue recognition
For investment contracts, amounts collected as “premiums” are not included in the income statement. They are reported as deposits in 
the balance sheet (under investment contract assets).
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Charles Taylor plc
81
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
Insurance premiums on insurance policies and fees charged on investment contracts are included as revenue in the income statement 
and are recognised as services are provided.
Claims
Claims under insurance contracts are recognised when payments are due. Claims costs include claims handling costs.
“Claims” under investment contracts are not reflected in the income statement. They are deducted from investment contract liabilities in 
the balance sheet.
Provisions for liabilities
The provisions for insurance contract liabilities are established using methods and assumptions approved by management based on 
advice from actuaries. This is based initially on the reserves required for regulatory purposes and adjusted to eliminate undistributed 
surplus income and various regulatory or contingency reserves. This basis is commonly referred to as the “modified statutory solvency 
basis”. Provisions are shown gross of reinsurance recoveries.
Investment contracts consist mainly of unit-linked contracts. Unit-linked liabilities are determined by reference to the value of the 
underlying matched assets.
Value of business acquired
On acquisition of a portfolio of contracts, either directly from another insurer or through the acquisition of a subsidiary, the Group 
recognises an intangible asset representing the value of business acquired (VOBA). VOBA represents the present value of future profits 
embedded in acquired contracts. The Group amortises VOBA over the effective life of the acquired contracts.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical areas of management judgement and estimation
The following are the critical judgements and estimates that the directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements. 
Revenue recognition in the adjusting businesses
Revenue is recognised when there is a contractual right to be paid in relation to past performance of contractual obligations. In practice, 
the Group maintains time recording systems to capture time chargeable to clients and specified hourly rates are ascribed to the hours 
recorded by the case handlers. Hourly rates are usually agreed in advance in the form of pre-engagement contractual terms or are based 
on standard hourly rates applicable to the type of work and country in which the work is performed.
Regular periodic reviews are performed by case handlers, and by management, to ensure the carrying value of work on unfinished cases 
reflects management’s view of its ultimate realisable value. Provisions against irrecoverable work-in progress (accrued income) and 
outstanding fees are made where the realisable value is expected to be lower than the carrying value and conversely upwards revaluations of 
work-in-progress are made where management considers the carrying value is lower than the amount ultimately recoverable.
Accrued income and fee receivables are shown in these accounts at their fair value. Because of the time taken between the initial 
recording of accrued income and its ultimate billing and the time taken to collect outstanding fee receivables, a discount is applied to the 
amounts shown to reflect the time value of money. The discount rate used is a significant judgement. Charles Taylor plc

2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Fair valuation of acquisitions
The Group has included the assets and liabilities of the entities acquired during the period in its consolidated balance sheet at the date of 
acquisition at their fair values. The fair values of assets and liabilities acquired are different in a number of instances from the values 
shown in the entities’ own financial statements. This is due to the application of different accounting policies in these financial statements 
or the application of fair valuation principles to assets and liabilities recorded by the entities under other bases such as historical cost (for 
instance due to discounting requirements of acquisition accounting). Bargain purchase gains have arisen where the fair value of net 
assets acquired exceeds the purchase consideration. Bargain purchase gains are recognised in profit and loss at the date of acquisition.
Impairment of goodwill and intangibles
Goodwill and intangibles have arisen in relation to the Group’s acquisitions of subsidiaries and are represented by the difference between 
the estimated cost of the acquisitions and the fair value of the net assets acquired in those acquisitions. The Company is required to 
assess annually, or more often if there is an indication of impairment, the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles. It does this by 
assessing the future cash flows generated by the business units to which the goodwill and intangibles have been allocated and by 
discounting those cash flows to assess whether the discounted value is higher or lower than the carrying value of the related goodwill and 
intangibles. Management judgement is applied, in particular, in the initial allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units, in assessing 
future cash flows and in determining appropriate discount rates.
Insurance reserves
Insurance reserves are set to reflect management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling claims incurred under insurance policies 
previously written by the insurance companies acquired. A number of actuarial estimation techniques have been used in arriving at the 
insurance reserves recorded in these financial statements. Further details are given in the accounting policies section.
Pensions
The Group sponsors a number of defined benefit retirement schemes for employees. The scheme assets and the obligation to provide 
future benefits are included in the group balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits to employees is reflected as a charge in the Group 
Income Statement. The respective scheme actuaries are engaged by the Company to assist management in determining the amounts to 
be recorded in these financial statements. In this regard, management is responsible for determining the assumptions to be used in the 
actuarial calculations such as the expected return on plan assets, salary growth and inflation. Further details of the assumptions used are 
given in note 29.
Taxation 
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group’s total 
tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement until tax returns have been filed and agreed. Payments in respect of tax 
liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which they 
can be utilised. Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax 
group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
3. Segmental information
Identification of segments
For management and internal reporting purposes the Group is currently organised into four operating businesses whose principal 
activities are as follows:
• Management Services business – mutual management service.
• Adjusting Services business – energy, aviation, non marine and marine (including average) adjusting.
• Insurance Support Services business – non-life and life insurance support services, including captive management, investment 
management and risk management.
• Insurers in Run-off business – non-life and life insurance companies closed to new business.
Management information about these businesses is regularly provided to the Group’s chief operating decision maker to assess their 
performance and to make decisions about the allocation of resources. Accordingly, these businesses correspond with the Group’s 
operating segments under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. Businesses forming part of each business which might otherwise qualify as 
reportable operating segments have been aggregated where they share similar economic characteristics and meet the other aggregation 
criteria in IFRS 8.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
3. Segmental information continued
In the Management Services business, a higher proportion of revenue arises in the second half of the financial year. There is no significant  
seasonality or cyclicality in the other businesses.
Measurement of segmental results and assets
Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on the basis of the contractual arrangements in place for the provision of 
goods or services between segments and in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Reportable segment results and assets are 
also measured on a basis consistent with the Group’s accounting policies. Operating segment profit includes an allocation of central costs 
across the four businesses and excludes non-recurring adjusting costs. The prior year operating segment profits and assets have been 
adjusted to conform to the current year’s presentation. Reconciliations of segmental results to the group profit before tax are set out below.
Information about major customers
The Group derived revenue of £29.8m (31 December 2012: £28.7m) from one external customer which accounts for more than 10% of 
group revenue, and is included within the Management Services business.

Noble Inspection and Loss Adjustment Company 
On 29 August 2013, the Group acquired 60% of the issued share capital of Noble Inspection and Loss Adjustment Company (renamed 
Charles Taylor Adjusting (Saudi Arabia) Limited) and the Group is entitled to 70% of the profits. The business offers loss adjusting services 
in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, building on the Group’s existing capabilities in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 
The business contributed £0.4m revenue and £0.1m loss before tax to the Group since the acquisition date. 
 
KnowledgeCenter
On 5 September 2013, the Group acquired the business and assets from KnowledgeCenter Limited. KnowledgeCenter is a provider of 
tailored business solutions to the insurance industry based on its business process management and document management software 
applications. The business provides the Group with a competitive advantage on key technology products and processes which it can 
combine with its own service provision, and will trade as Charles Taylor KnowledgeCenter Limited. 
 
The business contributed £0.6m revenue and £0.4m loss before tax to the Group since the acquisition date. 
If the acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year the combined revenue for the Group and statutory profit 
before tax would have been £115.1m and £6.5m respectively. The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below:

The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually and for new acquisitions in the year of acquisition, or more frequently if there are 
indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations, where the key assumptions relate to 
discount rates, revenue growth and cost growth. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money. The discount rate used in the latest impairment review was based on 5.5% for those cash-
generating units that are not subject to tax and 7.0% for those cash-generating units that are subject to tax. 
The revenue and cost growth rates used are based on reasonable management expectations for the 2014 budget and the following four 
years, with an extrapolation using a steady growth. Revenue and cost growth rates for the five year forecast period and the subsequent 
extrapolation fall within the range of 2%–5% pa. In addition, for the Run-off cash-generating units, an assessment is also made of the 
anticipated profitability arising from the ability to acquire and extract value from future run-off businesses.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the carrying value of each CGU. The value-in-use calculations were re-performed for a 
range of scenarios based upon changes in assumptions for discount rates, revenue growth and cost growth. Based on this review, the 
Group has concluded that there is sufficient headroom in these assumptions to indicate that no impairment has arisen.

potential deferred tax asset of £0.5m relating to unused capital allowances, has not been recognised as it is not considered probable that 
there will be future taxable profits available. The losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

and returns of capital above that amount. Of the £22.5m, £13.0 was paid up in the prior year.
Bestpark International Limited
The non-controlling shareholder is entitled to 49.99% of all future distributions and returns of capital.
24. Share-based awards
Share option schemes
The Company operates an executive share option scheme for eligible employees, in which options are exercisable if earnings per ordinary 
share increase by the Retail Price Index plus 6% over a three-year period and personal targets are attained. The options expire after 
ten years from the date of grant and if the employee leaves they lapse unless exercised within six months of leaving.
The Company also operates a SAYE share option scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up 
to 20% of market value. Savings contracts may run over two, three, five or seven years. The options lapse immediately if the employee 
leaves within three years of the option grant and lapse within six months of leaving if the employee leaves after three years of option grant.

The inputs into the Black-Scholes-Merton model for options granted during the year are as follows:

Expected life 2–3 years 2–3 years
Risk-free rate 0.62%–0.90% 0.33%–0.43%
Expected dividend yield 4.3% 6.0%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price since flotation in 1996. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Company recognised a total charge of £44,000 (2012: £37,000) relating to share option scheme transactions in 2013.
Long-term incentive scheme
Awards totalling 420,000 shares (2012: 280,000) were made under the LTIP during the year. These awards are subject to a three-year 
performance period. The Company recognised a total charge of £369,000 in relation to the LTIP scheme. Further information on this

Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s central treasury function secures and controls debt financing, coordinates efficient cash management within the business 
and monitors and manages financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. Treasury’s objective is to deploy financial resources 
around the Group in the most efficient manner possible, ensuring that cash is available in the right place and currency at the right time to 
pay liabilities as they fall due. Long-term, annual, monthly, weekly and daily forecasts form the basis for treasury decisions.
Financial risks comprise market risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risks and are influenced by fluctuating 
changes in market prices, as well as credit and liquidity risks.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of 
financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which establish principles on currency risk, 
interest rate risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with these policies is reviewed 
by the Group’s internal auditors. 
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. Fair 
values are determined directly by reference to published price quotations in an active market. 
The treasury function reports regularly to the Group’s Finance Committee. 
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
• For those financial assets and liabilities that are cash or short-term trade receivables or payables, carrying amount is a reasonable 
approximation of fair value.
• Retirement benefit obligations are valued by independent actuaries in accordance with IFRS.
• The Group’s remaining financial assets and liabilities are measured, subsequent to initial recognition, at fair value, and they can be 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: 
 – Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
 – Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 – Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

and the zero-coupon yield curve. Charles Taylor plc

25. Financial instruments continued
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities included in the Level 3 category above have been determined in accordance with 
generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash flow analysis with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that 
reflects substantially the same terms and characteristics including the credit quality of the instrument:
• Trade debtors are reduced by a discount to reflect the time value of money at a discount rate of 2.75% (2012: 2.65%) that reflects the 
Group’s debt funding rate over the relevant maturities.
• Accrued income is uplifted by 6.5% for anticipated unrecorded income, which is based on average over-recovery of unrecorded 
income during 2013, and then discounted for the time value of money at 2.75% (2012: 2.65%) that reflects the Group’s debt funding 
rate over the relevant maturities.
• Deferred consideration is reduced by a discount to reflect the time value of money at a discount rate of 4.63% (2012: 4.50%) that 
reflects the Group’s debt funding rate over the relevant maturities.
The sensitivity of the fair values of trade debtors and accrued income to changes in the discount rate is negligible, irrespective of the 
change in discount rate. The sensitivity of the fair value of deferred consideration to reasonably likely changes in the discount rate 
is immaterial. 
Currency risk
The Group has significant overseas subsidiaries which operate mainly in North America, Bermuda and the Asia Pacific region and whose 
revenues and expenses are denominated mainly in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange 
rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange and options contacts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s monetary assets and liabilities, held by entities with a functional currency other than GBP, at the 
reporting date are as follows:

The Group issues invoices denominated in US$, and Canadian$ to customers within the Adjusting business with typical payment periods 
of five months. The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange rate risk arising on the 
future cash receipts relating to these invoices, which are designated as cash flow hedges.

The average strike price rates achieved for the above trades are US$ 1.5080, Singapore$ 1.9060 and Canadian$ 1.5714.
As at 31 December 2013, the aggregate amount of losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the cash flow hedging 
reserve relating to the exposure on these anticipated future cash flows is £26,000 (2012: gains of £356,000). Upon maturity of the 
contracts and the realisation of the anticipated cash flows, the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit or loss. The 
anticipated future cash flows relating to the forward foreign exchange contracts held at 31 December 2013 are expected to be realised 
throughout the first three months of 2014.
 
The amount reclassified to profit and loss in the year to 31 December 2013 relating to matured forward foreign exchange contracts 
designated as cash flow hedge instruments is £46,000 gain (2012: £26,000 loss). As at 31 December 2013, no ineffectiveness has been 
recognised in profit or loss arising from hedging the anticipated future cash flows.
The policy of the Group permits the use of foreign currency option contracts for a proportion of its foreign currency liquidity risk to protect 
against a weakening of the US$ against £sterling. There were no options open at 31 December 2013 or at 31 December 2012.
Currency sensitivity
As the Group is mainly exposed to the US$, the following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase in the value of £sterling 
against the US$. 10% represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates, although this 
cannot be predicted with certainty. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and 
adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in US$ rates. A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit or equity 
where the US$ weakens 10% against £sterling. For a 10% strengthening of the US$ against £sterling, there would be an equal and 
opposite impact on profit and equity, and the signs below would be reversed. Charles Taylor plc

The Group’s interest rate swap contracts, which expire in February 2014, were taken out in 2009 to hedge interest rate risk on the term 
loans of the Group’s previous senior facilities agreement. Following the negotiation of a new senior facilities agreement on 7 November 
2013, these contracts are no longer required as interest rate hedging instruments.

Interest rate sensitivity
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding 
for the whole year and is net of the notional value of the interest rate cap. An increase in interest rates by a factor of 10% is used and 
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates, although this cannot be predicted with certainty.
If interest rates had been increased by a factor of 10% and all other variables had been held constant, the Group’s profit for the year to 
31 December 2013 would have decreased by £40,000 (2012: £48,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest 
rates on its variable rate borrowings, after taking into account the Group’s interest rate swap.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits 
for other stakeholders;
• to maximise the return to shareholders commensurate with a level of risk in each of its various businesses that management considers 
acceptable; and
• to ensure the Group’s regulated businesses comply with requirements set by regulators in the various jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Charles Taylor plc
104
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Financial Statements
25. Financial instruments continued
The Group takes account of risk when considering decisions involving the allocation of capital. Changes are made to the capital structure  
as economic conditions and the perception of risk changes. Changes may be made by way of altering the amount of dividends payable 
to shareholders, issuing shares or altering the level of the Group’s indebtedness e.g. by taking out or refinancing loan facilities. The Group 
monitors capital by reference to the level of net debt relative to equity. 
The Group has a number of insurance company and investment management subsidiaries subject to capital requirements imposed by 
their respective regulatory authorities. Management and boards of regulated companies have processes in place to ensure that minimum 
capital requirements are properly calculated, regularly monitored and maintained at an appropriate level. The Group complied with 
externally imposed capital requirements during the year. Bestpark International Limited has a lower level of capital than would normally be 
required by the regulator concerned, however, the Group is under no obligation to contribute additional capital and does not intend to do so.
Other price risk
Changes in equity prices affect the financial assets of the Group’s life insurance companies, but have no material economic impact on the 
Group, as explained in note 27. The Group has no material exposures to commodity price risk, prepayment risk or residual value risk.
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is regarded as acceptable because the counterparties are banks with 
high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. However, the Group has kept its counterparties under close review 
because of recent solvency and liquidity problems in the banking sector and remains alert to potential risks.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk relating to its clients. Credit policies, processes and management resources are 
designed to address and limit risk. It is not possible to measure when trade debtors in the Adjusting Services business become past due 
because of the role played by insurance brokers in collecting fees and the subscription nature of much of the market. Credit periods are 
monitored for each office in the Adjusting Services business and debtor ageing is monitored for each client and individual invoice. There 
are no material trade debtors outside the Adjusting Services business. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is best represented by the 
value of trade and other receivables disclosed in note 18. No collateral is held as security for amounts due and no other credit 
enhancements are in place. The credit quality of trade and other receivables is overall believed to be good and commensurate with the 
normal commercial risks of business-to-business trading.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet current and future payment obligations either as they fall due or in the full amount due. 
The funding risk arises when the necessary liquidity cannot be obtained on the expected terms when required.
The ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, which monitors the Group’s short, medium and 
long-term funding and liquidity requirements. The relevant procedures are implemented by the treasury function.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking facilities, subject to covenant compliance and reserve borrowing 
facilities, by monitoring forecast cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

27. Insurance company disclosures
The directors believe the Group’s exposure to material adverse risk from the valuation of the assets or liabilities of the Group’s insurance 
companies is limited. This is because the acquisition cost in each case comprised of either a nominal or refundable upfront payment 
followed by deferred consideration based on future cash distributions by the insurance companies, or the former owners being entitled to 
the majority of such distributions by the way of non-controlling interests in the companies’ shares. The Group’s net investment in 
insurance companies is summarised on page 109. 
There is no material risk to the Group arising from the investment portfolios held by the life insurance business as the majority of 
policyholder liabilities are directly linked to the value of investments held.
Although there is some uncertainty over the ability of the non-life insurance company, Bestpark International Limited, to pay all its future 
liabilities, and consequently a possibility that the company may become insolvent, the directors believe that there would be no material 
disadvantage to the Group in that event. The Group is under no obligation to contribute further capital and does not intend to do so. 
A prospective reduction in net assets will only have a limited effect on the Group for the reason set out above and also because the 
Group has reduced its shareholding in the company from 100% to 50.01% since it was acquired.
The directors believe that there is no material risk to the Group due to variations in the timing or value of insurance claims, or the 
reinsurance protection thereon, concentration of risk, interest rate risk, currency risk or credit risk arising out of the acquired insurance 
companies for the reasons stated above. Insolvency of any of the owned insurance companies may impact future service revenue and 
may result in an impairment of goodwill. 
Further details of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s insurance companies are 
disclosed below to assist readers in understanding their impact on the consolidated income statement and balance sheet.

Investments held by group insurance companies
Other than £25.5m of investments included within unit trusts, investments at fair value through income and available for sale investments 
are categorised as Level 1 within the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy because their values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. 
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair values are described in note 25.

29. Retirement benefit schemes
Certain employees of the Group are members of one of the four defined benefit schemes operated by the Group, details of which are set 
out below. The assets of all these pension schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The defined benefit pension 
schemes are subject to triennial valuations by independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.  
The results of the last review for each scheme are as follows:
 
Charles Taylor  
& Co. Limited 
Retirement Benefits 
Scheme 
Wm. Elmslie 
& Sons 1972 
Pension & Life 
Assurance Fund
 
E R Lindley  
& Co. Limited 
Pension Plan
 
Richards Hogg Pension 
& Life 
Assurance Scheme
The last valuation was carried out as at 1 July 2010 1 Jan 2009 1 July 2011 1 May 2009
Market value of scheme assets at last valuation was £39,339,000 £3,422,000 £3,797,800 £12,611,000
Percentage coverage of actuarial value to benefits accrued to members 71% 171% 120% 64%
The following actuarial assumptions were applied: Investment returns
– Post-retirement (male; female) 5.4% 5.4% 6.5%; 6.0%
1
5.8%
– Pre-retirement 5.4% 5.4% 4.0% 6.8%
Salary growth 3.1% 5.1% 3.0% 3.0%
Employer ongoing contribution rates for 2011 as percentage of  
pensionable earnings (excluding deficit funding contributions) 21.0% Nil 18.0% 18.7%
1  4.0% for current pensioners paid from the fund.
The employer’s contribution rates over the average remaining service lives of the members of each scheme take account of the surplus/
deficit disclosed by the above valuations. The total expense recognised in the income statement during the year in respect of the above 
defined benefit schemes amounted to £1,902,000 (2012 restated: £1,885,000).
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes amounted to £5.6m (2012: £5.5m).
The defined benefit schemes are all closed to new entrants, but existing members continue to accrue benefits in all schemes except the 
Charles Taylor & Co scheme, which was closed to future accrual from 1 July 2011. The service cost in respect of existing members 
(expressed as an annual percentage of pensionable payroll) may therefore be expected to increase in successive years as a result of the 
schemes’ ageing membership.
IAS 19R “Employee Benefits”
The calculations used for IAS 19R disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by the Group’s 
actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19R in order to assess the liabilities of the Pension Plans at 31 December 2013. 
Plan assets for the four schemes are stated at their market value at 31 December 2013. 2012 figures have been restated for IAS 19R, see 
note 1 to the Financial Statements.
Similar financial assumptions have been used for each of the four schemes to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19R, as below. Note 
that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation has been applied where the rules of the schemes permit.

The plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the 
Group. For the Charles Taylor & Co Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Richards Hogg Pension & Life Assurance Scheme, the 
expected return reflects the long-term asset allocation of the Trustees. For the Charles Taylor & Co Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme, 
the composite expected return is derived from FTSE-Actuaries Gilt indices and from indices published by Merrill Lynch as at the 
measurement date. For the Richards Hogg Pension & Life Assurance Scheme, the Trustees’ investment consultants have provided a 
best-estimate return assumption based on market conditions as at the measurement date. The ER Lindley & Co Ltd Pension Plan and the 
Wm. Elmslie & Sons 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Fund are both invested in insurance contracts. The expected return assumption is 
based on the asset mix underlying the insurance contracts and market conditions as at the measurement date.

Mortality assumptions
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s defined benefit schemes.
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality 
rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:
2013  
years
2012  
years
2011  
years
Retiring today:
 Males 22.2 22.1 22.0
 Females 24.4 24.4 24.3
Retiring in 20 years:
 Males 23.4 23.3 23.2
 Females 25.5 25.5 25.4
Sensitivity analysis 
The key assumptions used in the IAS 19R valuation are detailed above. The sensitivities regarding these assumptions are shown below.
Assumption Change in assumption Indicative effect on the scheme’s liabilities
Discount rate Increase/decrease by 0.25% Decrease/increase by 4%
Longevity Increase by one year Increase by 3%
Inflation rate Increase/decrease by 0.25% Increase/decrease by 2%
The Group expects to contribute approximately £3.8m to its defined benefit plans in 2014.

32. Non-recurring costs
As noted at the half year, the directors have focused on improving operational efficiency and as such, have taken action to remove certain 
costs from the business. A restructuring cost of £1.4m was therefore incurred in reducing the headcount in certain business segments. 
Additionally the Group incurred £0.3m of costs associated with the accelerated unwind of certain capitalised fees and hedging costs 
relating to the previous senior facilities agreement. The directors consider both of these costs to be of a non-recurring nature. 
33. Capital commitments
There were no capital commitments at 31 December 2013 (2012: none).

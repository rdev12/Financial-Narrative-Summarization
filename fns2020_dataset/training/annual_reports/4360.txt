business
l ast year i spoke of my father’s decision 
to diversify the g roup’s assets and how, 
in the current context, that decision 
proved to have been inspired. the 
diversity of our global b2b assets has 
given dmgt a stability that may have 
been missing from other uK consumer 
media businesses. it is thanks to that 
support and stability that our uK 
consumer media assets have been able 
to consolidate their focus, innovate  
and bounce back, rebalancing the 
g roup’s operating profit* such that the 
percentage derived from b2b was down 
from 71% to 66% this year. 
but i make a further point. t he content 
driven from our national newspaper 
brands, thanks to continued investment 
and attention to their editorial quality, 
has attracted global audiences at an 
accelerating rate, particularly through 
mail o nline. a focus of the g roup will be 
on deriving increasing revenues from 
these young and affluent viewers, many 
of whom have no obvious affiliation 
with the uK and little or no exposure to 
the mail brand, but who are drawn to us 
because they like what they read, and 
who are joined daily by others from 
countries as diverse as the us and i ndia. 
that is why i believe we are adding 
increasing value to our b2C assets, even 
as we deal with the remaining legacy 
issues at our regional newspapers. 
strong re Covery for dmgt 
debt is falling quickly, cash flows are 
strong, our operating profit* grew by 
17% in the year to 3rd o ctober, and 
earnings per share were a record.  
i cannot tell you what lies ahead, but at 
dmgt we are steadily building value 
– including in our national newspaper 
business – and the spirit among my 
colleagues is one of determination to 
meet any challenges, coupled with an 
even stronger determination to grow 
sustainable revenues and profits.
Chairman’s statement
We’ve emerged from an economic recession 
in the UK, a world financial crisis, the most 
profound and continuing changes in the 
media industry, and your company is in very 
good health.

people
it has always been a belief of mine that 
media businesses are only as good as 
the people in them. at dmgt we have 
a remarkably strong team across the 
g roup at every level of the Company.  
i am glad to see martin morgan, our 
Chief executive, executing the talent 
agenda to assess the qualities of the 
future management of all the 
businesses. i am also pleased that we 
have established a new investment  
and f inance Committee, and a new 
l eadership team that focuses on 
longer-term strategy. We have 
continued running the l eadership 
course that was launched last year.  
i am excited to see internal promotions 
as well as new entrepreneurial talent 
from outside. as a result, we have a 
more cohesive and deeper level of 
management talent than i think we 
have ever had.
talent is the cornerstone of dmgt ; as 
martin so aptly says, superior business 
performance can only be achieved by 
superior people. l ast year we displayed 
exceptional business performance 
within constrained economic conditions. 
teChnology 
in the last year we have seen stunning 
technological advancements from 
augmented reality to 3d cinema, but 
the ones most relevant to us are, of 
course, the tablets and e-readers. the 
potential to revolutionise the way our 
consumer interacts with our brands is 
significant. the physical interaction 
involved in their use could transform our 
advertising model and encourage 
more inter-brand synergy than ever 
before. We are very interested in their 
potential and convinced that the 
innovative teams across the g roup, in 
both our b2b and b 2C companies, will 
find entrepreneurial ways of exploiting 
this new technology. 
metro was one of the first print 
publications to release an ipad 
application and the mail is soon to 
follow. all of our b2b businesses are 
actively exploring similar launches.  
all feel they offer more opportunities 
than challenges.
b oard
it is with regret that we will say goodbye 
in march to peter Williams, our f inance 
director since 1991. peter has been with 
dmgt since 1982. h e has combined all 
the best qualities that you look for in a 
f inance director: he is reliable, shrewd, 
has good judgement and is both 
respected and admired throughout  
the Company. he will be missed greatly, 
not only for his diligence, hard work  
and loyalty over so many years, but  
also as a friend and colleague whose 
personal values embody all that is best 
about dmgt .
i take this opportunity to welcome in 
advance stephen daintith, who will join 
us in January and take over from peter 
after his retirement in march. stephen 
comes to us with excellent credentials 
at dow Jones and n ews international 
and i believe he will add much to the 
central management team.
l oo King for Ward
i said at the end of our investor day 
earlier this year that i had never felt 
more excited to be Chairman of this 
Company; this remains unchanged 
today. there has never been a  
greater sense of team or a better 
understanding of the values that drive 
us. tough times have tested us and, 
during the last year, i have witnessed 
such determination and focus, such 
commitment and diligence that i have 
been deeply gratified. o n your behalf 
and mine, i thank all our colleagues at 
our businesses across the world who 
have done so much to bring us  
through such change, and who look 
forward to the opportunities and 
challenges ahead.

this Chief executive’s r eview will start by 
setting out the nature, objectives and 
strategy of the g roup. a business review 
of the development and performance 
of each of our operating divisions will 
follow on pages 17 to 28. a f inancial 
and treasury r eview is given on pages 
29 to 33 and the principal risks and 
uncertainties the g roup faces are  
set out on pages 38 and 39 of the  
directors’ r eport.
dmgt ’s philosophy
dmgt is a multi-media and information 
company providing essential news, 
entertainment and information services 
in both the business to business (b2b) and 
consumer sectors. We operate in many 
different markets, in many countries, 
each with its own competitive and 
regulatory requirements. 
it has been dmgt ’s philosophy for many 
years to take advantage of its 
shareholding structure and to invest 
with a long-term perspective to 
generate value. o ur particular 
ownership structure, with control 
maintained by the founding family, has 
proved itself throughout our long history 
to be a successful business model in the 
media and information industry. it is this 
ownership structure that affords us a 
longer-term perspective and that is at 
the heart of our philosophy. 
introdu Ction
this business r eview is addressed to the 
members of the Company. its purpose is 
to help them assess how the directors 
have performed in their duty to 
promote the success of the Company.  
it is framed by the principles and 
guidelines for o perating and f inancial 
r eviews published by the uK 
accounting standards board in 2006.  
it outlines the main operational and 
financial factors underpinning the 
development, performance and 
position of the g roup as well as those 
likely to affect performance over the 
coming year, illustrating this with key 
performance indicators.

We are committed to remaining 
diversified across both the b2b and 
consumer media sectors in order to give 
us a breadth of opportunities and to 
spread risk. o ur b2b arm is made up of 
r isk management solutions (rms ), dmg 
information (dmgi), dmg events (which 
changed its name from dmg world 
media in april) and euromoney 
institutional investor. o ur consumer 
media division, a&n media comprises 
mail n ewspapers, our digital only 
businesses (formerly associated 
n orthcliffe digital), our free newspaper 
division, principally metro, and 
n orthcliffe media. We also own 50%  
of dmg r adio australia, a 50:50 joint 
venture with illyria, an australian 
company that is the private investment 
vehicle of mr l achlan murdoch, which 
was established in december 2009. 
strategy
the overarching strategy for the g roup 
is to remain the owner of high quality, 
sustainable, market-leading media  
and information assets across both  
the b2b and consumer sectors and to 
improve dmgt ’s overall share rating. 
o ur intention is for dmgt to become  
a truly global growth company with 
sustainable earnings and dividend 
growth with an increasing exposure to 
growth economies and international 
opportunities. the three pillars of my 
leadership continue to be growth, 
adaptability and innovation. 
o ur strategy is underpinned by five 
guiding tasks.
the first is to enhance focus by 
concentrating our management and 
investment on a subset of businesses 
where we see the closest alignment 
between opportunities and growth, 
and which fit with our investment 
criteria. o n this task, we have made 
considerable progress. secondly, we 
have been strengthening our balance 
sheet in order to maintain financial 
flexibility so that we are able to take 
advantage of opportunities as they 
arise. the third key priority remains 
reducing pension liabilities. the fourth is 
applying consistent investment criteria. 
this requires being highly disciplined 
both in regularly assessing our current 
businesses and in the way we assess all 
future investments, resulting in a clear 
capital allocation process. there must 
also be a preparedness to sell as well as 
buy on a timely basis. 
f inally we are building on dmgt ’s 
distinct values and management 
philosophy. We remain committed to a 
decentralised operating structure with 
a small central team in order to nurture 
innovation and an entrepreneurial mind 
set. We have been raising the bar on 
talent by being committed to attracting 
and retaining the best people in order 
to optimise our management 
philosophy and to meet our global 
growth ambitions. if anything it has 
become even clearer over the last year 
just how critical our work on talent is, in 
order to have the entrepreneurially 
minded people who can drive the 
revenue line and our strategic 
ambitions.
in summary we have pursued our 
strategy with vigour over the last  
twelve months. 
We have established a new investment 
and f inance Committee alongside a 
newly formed dmgt l eadership team, 
which together will improve investment 
decision making and g roup strategy 
development, at the higher operating 
tempo we have been setting and 
which, i firmly believe, is so crucial to our 
success. the l eadership team 
comprises all the divisional company 
leaders, together with the dmgt 
executive. its remit is to focus on 
developing dmgt g roup-wide longer- 
term strategy, on furthering cross g roup 
co-operation when and where this 
makes sense, and to guide policy on 
matters which are cross divisional in 
nature, for example g roup leadership 
courses, communications and aspects 
of technical capability. it does not 
replace the decision making and 
accountability structures in place 
through our decentralised operating 
structure.
the new Committee comprises the 
dmgt executive and two non-
executives. it acts independently on 
investment decisions and capital 
allocation from the divisions, although it 
will invite attendance and contributions 
from time to time by divisional Ceos as 
well as from outside experts. 
We recognise that our future is largely 
digital, whether it be in the consumer or 
the b2b markets, and we are uniquely 
placed to take key learnings and 
experience from one to inform the 
other. accordingly, we have 
encouraged the sharing of more 
information regarding technology 
developments across the g roup, 
particularly regarding new product 
development and entering new 
markets. We have retained the services 
of a technology expert to advise us at 
g roup level.
o ur plan is to continue to run the 
Company on a conservative basis over 
the next few years because tough 
economic conditions may prevail in the 
uK for some time yet and the course of 
the us economy remains uncertain. We 
are giving priority to investing in the 
considerable organic growth potential 
of our existing portfolio of businesses, 
supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions 
offset by a few minor disposals. We are 
taking steps to limit the growth in our 
pension scheme liabilities and to 
reduce the schemes’ volatility.
progress in year
i am proud to report that we have 
delivered on what we promised two 
years ago. We achieved our targeted 
£150 million in profit enhancements, 
enabling us to preserve our investment 
in innovation and organic growth. We 
re-focused the portfolio with a wide 
range of disposals, closures, and 
re-organisations. o ur results are a 
testament to our success in meeting 
these short-term objectives. daily mail and general trust plC  
annual report 2010

two years ago, i recognised the need to 
focus on a narrower range of activities in 
order to concentrate human resources 
and financial capital where the most 
potential for long term growth and value 
creation existed. i stated that we would 
remain active managers of our portfolio 
of businesses and apply our investment 
criteria vigorously in determining where 
to allocate capital but at the same time 
maintaining our long term perspective 
and rate of internal investment to drive 
organic growth. 
the investment criteria that i identified 
were to focus on having businesses 
which operate in attractive growth 
markets. such businesses should have 
products or services that are highly 
innovative and highly valued, ones 
which customers repeat buy. We have 
a strong bias towards market leaders. 
businesses with these characteristics will 
not only grow but be high margin, cash 
generative and produce a high return 
on capital. We are also focused on 
capturing and retaining entrepreneurial 
management and we give preference 
to businesses which can benefit from 
dmgt ’s long term perspective. 
We have fully adopted these investment 
criteria both in new investments and in 
the management of currently owned 
businesses. in keeping with this 
approach, we have re-focused the 
portfolio with a further wide range of 
disposals, closures and reorganisations.
at a&n media, we closed l ondon l ite in 
the l ondon evening newspaper market 
in n ovember 2009 following on from the 
sale of 75% of the evening standard and 
its subsequent move to a free revenue 
model, and closed teletext’s television 
operations in december 2009. We sold 
allegran, our online dating business, 
dmr , our digital data and auto 
business, l oot and our slovakian 
newspapers. We have re-engineered 
n orthcliffe uK, including the closure of a 
further print plant at plymouth. We 
merged metro dublin with herald am. 
We restructured dmg world media, 
eliminating its corporate centre and 
renaming the smaller and leaner 
business, dmg events, and we sold 50% 
of dmg r adio to illyria.
impressive. headcount is down almost 
50% from its peak levels in 2004. 
n orthcliffe’s operating structure has 
been reorganised into new publishing 
centres, focused on their core 
competencies of news gathering and 
local advertising sales; and centres of 
excellence established for common 
business functions, including sub-
editing, advertising production, 
information technology, finance, 
printing and digital publishing; and 
regional contact centres, which 
improve the overall customer 
experience, for recruitment and private 
advertising, as well as the home 
delivered sale of our newspapers.  
this much lower cost operating  
model means that n orthcliffe is more 
operationally geared today and so  
will see substantial benefits when the 
economy recovers. We are 
implementing plans for additional  
cost and efficiency gains. 
there has been much talk within the 
media of potential consolidation within 
the regional newspaper industry. Whilst 
we can see benefits, we will not put 
further capital into the industry because 
of the more certain potential of our other 
opportunities for investment. We are, 
however, committed to the ongoing 
transformation of n orthcliffe because 
we believe there will always be a 
demand for local news and information. 
to this end we have launched l ocal 
people, a digital service aimed at 
smaller communities than are often 
covered by local print media. 
the recovery of the profits* of our uK 
national consumer media activities 
means that the percentage of the 
g roup’s operating profits* derived from 
b2b fell this year, as expected, from  
71% to 66%. a significant part of our 
operations are now outside the uK with 
more than half of the g roup’s operating 
profits* again derived from outside the 
uK, which also has the effect of 
reducing the g roup’s exposure to 
media regulation. 
With a more focused portfolio, 
improved margins and a somewhat 
better trading environment, operating 
profit* rose by 17% to £320 million and 
debt has fallen. o perating margin* rose 
from 13% to 16%. We have beaten our 
initial debt: ebitda target of 2.5 times 
and have virtually no bank debt. 
moreover, since we made every effort 
not to lose sight of our long-term 
strategic objectives and maintained 
organic growth investment during this 
difficult period, we should not need to 
increase our rate of investment in  
new products and services during  
the recovery. 
dmgt has always been a first mover in 
the media and information industry. o ur 
results demonstrate once again that 
the success of the decision made many 
years ago by the Chairman’s father to 
diversify our portfolio and move away 
from a dependence on uK newspapers 
has been a remarkable success. today 
our national newspapers are 
strengthening further their market 
leading positions, complemented by 
growth in our newer consumer digital 
business and our strong portfolio of b2b 
sector companies. 
a&n media has made huge progress in 
bringing focus to its activities and in 
advancing impressively in print as well 
as in digital consumer media. mail 
n ewspapers stands apart from other 
newspaper businesses in the uK and is 
now in a different league in newspaper 
digital activities through mail o nline, 
which is a core engine for growth.  
the daily mail and the mail on sunday 
improved their market shares towards 
the end of the year to record levels, a 
testament to our strategy of investing in 
editorial content and in marketing  
and promotion. 
at n orthcliffe media, which still faces 
difficult market conditions, our strategy 
has been to create a lower cost, high 
quality publishing business with 
improved levels of service for readers 
and advertisers, coupled with 
investment in digital media. this has 
been achieved by harnessing 
technology, leveraging the scale of the 
n orthcliffe portfolio and working more 
collaboratively with the rest of a&n 
media. the results have been

dmgi achieved another record

impressive history of profits* growth, 
illustrated on page 20. r evenues 
increased by 1%, with strong growth 
from its companies in the education, 
financial and energy information 
markets. margins rose from 20% to 23%.
dmgi’s strategy remains focused on 
investing in those companies within the 
existing portfolio which operate in an 
attractive sector and have the 
combination of attractive business 
models, strong market positions, growth 
potential and good management. its 
ambition to invest in must-have, 
high-growth, innovative business 
information companies remains 
unchanged, as does its remit to diversify 
dmgt by sector, by business model and 
by geography.

g roup and edr are developing their 
strategy to expand their offering from

aspects of the property market and 
more on physical data on property, 
together with an increased expansion

Within finance, trepp is pursuing its 
strategy to enter the broader 
commercial real estate market. Within 
energy, g enscape is accelerating its 
organic growth across new energy 
classes, such as gas and oil, and has 
made progress in strengthening its

we have continued to nurture 
operational autonomy with strong 
incentives based on performance, 
whilst retaining central control over 
surplus capital and its reinvestment. 
maintaining this approach is of upmost 
importance to me. the benefits are 
numerous and enabled us to respond 
rapidly to the economic downturn. at

survive in this sector, you must be able to 
react quickly and efficiently to the 
rapidly changing media world. if 
management teams are able to 
exercise relative autonomy, they are 
able to keep decision making as close 
to their customer as possible. r eal 
innovation comes from having a 
customer focus and our decentralised 
model provides a fertile environment for 
innovative people and, in turn, a positive 
breeding ground for innovative ideas. 
business to business summary
i am pleased to report that our b2b 
operations achieved good profit* 
growth in the year, driven by solid 
subscription revenues and tight cost 
control, with no benefit from foreign 
exchange as the average sterling: us 
dollar exchange rate was unchanged. 
they reported combined revenues of 
£824 million, down 4% due to the effect 
of prior year disposals within dmg 
events, but an improved operating 
margin up from 24% to 27% on an 
operating profit of £226 million. 
r isK management solutions
rms achieved another record 
operating profit*, up 12% on revenues 
also up 12%, reflecting continued 
growth from both its core modelling 
business and newer initiatives. margins 
remained at 31%, a very acceptable 
level, given the need to invest in the 
business to maintain existing 
subscriptions and in order to drive  
future growth. 
We have continued to focus on business 
fundamentals and organic growth and 
on nurturing our existing businesses, 
rather than on making large scale 
acquisitions. We have been willing to 
make a small number of highly 
attractive bolt-on acquisitions and 
investments with low risk and high 
returns which strengthen the 
competitive position of our businesses. 
these were within dmg information and 
a&n media: builder r adius, which has 
built a proprietary database of building 
permit information from cities and 
counties across the us for edr , Calnea 
analytics, which supplies automated 
valuations for residential properties, and 
argyll environmental, providers of 
environmental risk reports, for 
l andmark; f oresight analytics, which 
provides real estate analysis for 
commercial and residential real estate, 
for trepp; and 50% of g lobrix, a uK free 
to list property portal for the digital 
property g roup; and as previously 
mentioned, l ocal people which we 
launched in the summer of 2009. 
euromoney also acquired arete 
Consulting, a small but high quality 
online publishing business, with its 
proprietary database containing 
information on more than 1.3 million 
structured products around the world.
Whilst we have been focused necessarily 
on reducing our debt over the short 
term, our capital constraints have not 
caused us to miss any significant 
acquisition opportunities. We are now in 
a better position to make acquisitions 
again, but will continue our policy to 
prioritise a programme of selective 
smaller scale deals which we can 
develop and which can benefit from 
our longer-term perspective. We will 
continue to divest on a periodic basis 
and our track record over recent years 
is good on this count.
dmgt o perational model
dmgt ’s approach to managing the 
g roup’s companies has not changed: 
we continue to adopt a decentralised 
structure. We take a considerable 
amount of comfort in the fact that we 
know all our companies are run by chief 
executives with expert knowledge of 
their companies and the markets in 
which they operate. o ver the last year,  daily mail and general trust plC

reach to our chosen audiences over  
a multitude of platforms, it has had  
a significant deflationary effect on 
advertising yields and newspaper  
copy sales. the environment forces  
us to remain even more focused and 
orientated around the needs of our 
customers and on the strength of  
our brands.
a&n media has made significant 
progress in bringing focus to its 
activities, and is advancing impressively 
in print and in digital consumer media. 
We continue to focus on building 
around the mail brand and formulating 
the next stage of our strategy for the 
consumer digital market.
the mail titles, despite operating in a 
sector in long term decline, are and will 
be a core business for many years to 
come and will continue to offer real 
growth opportunities, for example 
because of the excellent progress of its 
online offering, mail o nline, which has 
significant growth opportunities ahead 
of it.
asso Ciated neWspapers
the mail publications continue to 
capture market share from competitors. 
Content has been at the heart of our 
success at associated and we continue 
to invest in editorial quality. the graph 
on page 26 shows that our actions are 
proving successful with circulation on 
the daily mail stabilising in recent 
months and market share rising once 
again for both mail titles. the increased 
gap in cover price compared to the so 
called “quality” newspapers, combined 
with the pressures from rising newsprint 
prices on those with lower cover prices, 
may provide us with an option to raise 
cover prices, once consumer 
confidence recovers.
o ur national free morning newspaper, 
metro, grew rapidly this year and 
traded strongly. r eleased from 
competing in the free l ondon 
afternoon market, management has 
been able to turn its entire focus on 
metro and has delivered an increase in 
euromoney has outperformed all 
expectations, allowing management to 
shift its focus to positioning the business 
for growth, both from existing products 
as markets recover, and from 
investment in technology and new 
products as part of the migration to a 
digital information business. 
euromoney’s performance and its shift 
into more subscription and digital 
activity means that the board regards it 
as core to dmgt ’s own strategic global 
growth ambitions. 
euromoney’s separate listing on the 
l ondon stock exchange has enabled  
it to introduce its capital appreciation 
plans which have motivated 
management to grow the company 
significantly over recent years. We 
remain a supportive shareholder, fully 
backing its management’s expansion 
strategy. dmgt again took its share of 
dividends from euromoney in the year  
in the form of a scrip. this enabled us to 
offset the dilutive effect of the vesting  
of the final tranche of euromoney’s first 
capital appreciation plan, thereby 
maintaining our equity interest at 
around 66%. it is the board’s intention 
also to take euromoney’s forthcoming 
final dividend in the form of a scrip in 
order to avoid dilution caused by its 
management incentive plans. 
to sum up, within b2b overall there 
remains a concerted continuing focus 
on organic growth supplemented by 
bolt-on acquisitions and aimed at 
strengthening the quality of the 
portfolio over time. 
Consumer 
higher national advertising revenues, 
together with a focus on cost control, 
enabled a&n media to increase its 
operating profits by 46%. this was in 
spite of a reduction of 5% in reported 
revenues, reflecting portfolio changes 
and high standards of execution. 
margins* rose from 7% to 11%.
the consumer media industry is 
continuing to witness a time of 
unprecedented change. Whilst 
technology is undoubtedly an  
enabler, allowing us to extend our 
dmg events (formerly dmg 
World media) 
dmg events’ operating profits fell by just 
£7 million, despite a reduction in 
revenues of £64 million due to the 
impact of prior year disposals. although 
the underlying
†
 revenues of dmg events 
were down by 9%, the most significant 
declines were experienced early in the 
year and more recent events have 
been in line with or ahead of prior year 
revenues. margins rose from 21% to 27%.
the refinement of our portfolio of 
exhibitions was concluded earlier in the 
year. the business has been 
transformed from more than 300 b2C 
and b2b exhibitions, fairs, conferences 
and magazines to 36 b2b exhibitions 
and two conference businesses, all with 
number one or two positions in their 
market places. the group, renamed 
dmg:: events, has been restructured 
into five operating groups and 
management layers removed.  
g rowth will be driven by geo-cloning, 
expanding into adjacencies and 
selected early stage exhibition 
acquisitions. n ew management  
have begun to launch new shows  
once again.
e uromoney institutional investor
euromoney achieved a record 
operating profit*, up 25%, maintaining 
its recent history of profits* growth, 
illustrated on page 23. the rebound in 
its revenues came faster than expected 
and it has benefited from early and 
aggressive action at the onset of the 
downturn in its markets.
the benefits of euromoney’s strategy to 
build a more resilient and better 
focused business by increasing the 
proportion of revenues derived from 
subscription products, now nearly a half 
of total revenues, and transforming a 
predominantly publishing driven 
business to one with significant activities 
in electronic information and database 
services, were again demonstrated by 
these results.

north Cliffe media
o ur expectation in may, because of 
gradually improving uK advertising 
trends, that n orthcliffe uK would move 
into year on year growth during the 
second half of the year, proved 
over-optimistic. We now expect 
n orthcliffe to have another hard year in 
prospect and to continue to suffer from 
the effects of reduced public sector 
advertising spend. until recruitment 
advertising recovers, it is difficult to see 
growth and there is new uncertainty 
over the property market. n orthcliffe is, 
however, outperforming its rivals, which 
is testament to the way its management 
is transforming the company’s 
operations.
the commercial relationship between 
n orthcliffe and our pure play digital 
businesses, in recruitment, property and 
motors, continue to be strategically 
important to the company. 
dmg radio australia
We disposed of 50% of dmg r adio 
australia. the new joint venture has 
started well with a rise in operating 
profits* year on year. 
summary 
during 2010 we delivered on our 
promises and have demonstrated the 
benefits of our diversified international 
portfolio of market-leading businesses 
with revenue beginning to rise, higher 
operating margins* and our debt falling 
rapidly. i feel confident the g roup is well 
placed to benefit from improvements in 
our markets and from our ongoing 
commitment to internal investment in 
organic growth.
r egaining investment grade 
credit status is an objective as we 
contemplate being able safely to 
expand our balance sheet as we 
move closer to our remaining bond 
repayment in 2013. Containing and 
eventually eliminating significant 
liability risk and volatility from our 
pension schemes remains a  
high priority.
g ood progress has been made in our 
efforts to monetise the reach of our titles 
through database marketing. the 
revenue achieved by the growth of 
a&n media enterprises demonstrates 
the mail’s ability to diversify revenue 
streams by leveraging its strong brands 
and developing new products and 
services to meet the needs of its 
targeted audiences, for instance 
through the mail’s multi-channel retail 
brand, maill ife.co.uk. 
digital only businesses  
(formerly and )
We reassessed our portfolio of 
businesses and reorganised to 
concentrate on those companies seen 
as having worthwhile long-term 
prospects. as a result a number of 
businesses were sold and divisional 
operating costs substantially reduced. 
We are now focused on the verticals of 
jobs, property, motors and travel. the 
digital property g roup was 
strengthened with the acquisition of 
50% of g lobrix. the second half saw a 
pleasing upward trend in revenues at 
Jobsite and the digital property g roup.
a&n international media
n orthcliffe’s Central and eastern 
european operations now report 
directly to a&n media’s Ceo, Kevin

and launched successful mobile

for both parties. o ur competitors to the 
irish metro are now our partners in 
metro herald. 
mail digital made significant progress 
this year, recording a 33% improvement 
in revenue. traffic to its primary website, 
mail o nline, increased by more than 
70% to 50 million unique users in 
o ctober 2010. l aunched in its current 
form only in may 2008, it is already now 
the largest uK newspaper website. it is 
differentiated from the print newspaper 
by a particular focus on celebrity, 
gossip and colour features which 
appeal to a younger demographic of 
mid britons, the majority of whom do 
not buy a mail newspaper. iphone and 
ipod touch versions have recently been 
launched to be followed by an ipad 
version within months. We therefore see 
digital publishing as a growth 
opportunity, and a means of extending 
the mail brand. o ne example is a large 
and growing non-uK audience, 
especially in the usa . an ambitious 
expansion strategy targeting the us is 
underway. in may, we opened an office 
is l os angeles, to be followed by a n ew 
york office, in order to increase us 
content, users and thereby to drive us 
advertising sales.
there has been much media debate 
about whether online newspaper sites 
should erect paywalls. o ur position with 
respect to mail o nline is that few 
consumers will pay for general news 
content which they can access free 
from elsewhere, such as from the bb C, 
and our strategy is to build large 
audiences. they will pay, however, for 
more specialised information and for 
special applications such as on the 
ipad. this is still very much an emerging 
area and our approach is to provide 
compelling content and to remain 
flexible on distribution channels  
and pricing.  daily mail and general trust plC

by the year end, we had virtually no 
bank debt and £300 million of unused 
bank facilities. We have no refinancing 
to contemplate until 2013. having 
beaten our initial debt: ebitda target of 
2.5 times by achieving a ratio of 2.3 
times, we will continue to manage the 
ratio down through strong cash flow 
generation, in order to create more 
capacity to satisfy attractive acquisition 
and investment opportunities. 
Whilst we can run the g roup without 
having to raise new finance, we will 
want to do so in order to sustain the 
g roup’s long term growth ambitions. 
therefore regaining investment grade 
status remains a key objective.
r esour Ces 
the g roup’s main resources are its 
brands, reputation, the market-leading 
position of its major businesses and 
above all its people. it is my strong 
belief that it is the obligation of a Chief 
executive to leave a company in a 
better shape than he found it in and i 
realise that the skills required of leaders 
in our industry ten years ago are not the 
same today. We cannot capitalise on 
the future unless we invest in the talent 
of today, in the leaders of tomorrow.  
We understand that superior business 
performance starts with superior 
people, and it is my overriding priority 
to ensure that we continue to attract 
and promote the very best talent and 
reward talent suitably in line with 
shareholders’ interests.
o ur commitment to raising the bar on 
talent is continuing and increasingly 
effective, applying human capital 
where growth prospects are best – if 
you like, to where the money is. three 
dmgt -wide executive training courses 
have been held and talent reviews are 
now taking root in every business under 
the direction of our human r esources 
director, Joe mcCollum.
the market appears gradually to be 
absorbing the quality of our diversified 
portfolio of assets. this, together with 
the operationally geared nature of  
our national advertising revenues in 
particular, led to us out-performing  
our peers again this year. 
as a consequence of a decision by ftse 
in may, in response to the f inancial 
services authority’s policy n otice in 
f ebruary, to adopt listing classifications 
for determining the weighting of share 
classes in their indices, dmgt ’s 
weighting in the uK index series will fall 
from 75% to 0% when our ‘a’ shares are 
re-designated by the fsa as having a 
standard listing on 31st may, 2012. dmgt 
will remain a premium listed company, 
following this change, by virtue of its 
o rdinary shares. pure index funds tend 
to hold only around 5% of our ‘a’ shares.
Capital stru Cture
the Company has not made a capital 
call on its shareholders since 1933. 
Capital growth is funded by long-term 
debt and by retained earnings. since 
the late 1980s, our strategy has been to 
seek to raise the dividend in real terms 
and since 2002, the board’s policy has 
been to target a real rate of growth in 
the dividend in the region of 5% to 7% 
on the basis of the directors’ 
confidence in the g roup’s long-term 
financial health. 
having held the dividend during the 
financial crisis, whilst maintaining its 
policy of seeking to increase the 
dividend in real terms over the 
economic cycle, the board has 
declared a final dividend up 11%, 
making an increase of 9% for the year. 
as shown on page 11, the compound 
dividend growth over the last 22 years is 
10% in nominal terms, which is an 
increase of 7% in real terms. 
the Company acquired 2.9 million of  
its ‘a’ o rdinary shares for £12 million, 
using them to provide shares under 
various incentive plans. the Company 
currently holds 9.6 million shares in 
treasury to meet obligations that may 
arise to provide shares under various 
incentive plans.
because of continuing economic 
uncertainties, we will remain disciplined 
about our approach to costs and 
acquisitions. at the same time we will 
work on building a pipeline of potential 
new innovative products, and in 
growing a target list of attractive target 
bolt-on acquisitions.
at our first investor day in march 2009, i 
stated that our aim for dmgt was to be 
a modern company of tomorrow, not a 
legacy company of the past. We have 
a much sounder platform today than 
we did then on which to execute this 
objective, due to the management 
actions taken right across the g roup, 
and from some recovery in a number of 
key markets. therefore our strategy 
remains unchanged.
Whilst we believe print is far from dead, 
our growth lies in digital media in both 
consumer and in b2b, and we are 
increasingly focused on doing what is 
needed to excel in the digital world.
We envisage dmgt becoming a global 
growth company. We plan to be 
nimble, bold and decisive in order to 
realise this vision. o ur objective is to 
ensure profitable sustainable growth 
over the long term.
share pri Ce performan Ce
o ur share performance remains 
important to us as an indicator as to 
whether our strategy is understood and 
appreciated by institutional investors.
the price of our widely traded ‘a’ 
o rdinary n on-voting shares has 
been less volatile this year, aided by 
stock lending of the shares trending 
downwards below 15% of the free float. 
the share price started the financial 
year at £4.39, falling to £3.90 at the end 
of o ctober, before rising to a high of 
£5.33 at the end of april, a movement 
of 36%. the shares fell back in early 
summer, along with the wider market 
in the light of the prevailing economic 
uncertainty, before closing the year  
at £5.26.

dmgt and the environment
We recognise that our businesses have 
an impact on the environment, be that 
through our printing operations, offices, 
transport or other activities. We are truly 
committed to ensuring that, where 
possible, our impact on the 
environment is minimised. 
the greatest impact we make arises 
from our printing operations. here, i 
am pleased to say that we have been 
diligent in measuring and reducing 
waste in our usage of materials, and, 
through our analysis of our carbon 
footprint, monitoring and improving  
our efficiency in the use of energy. 
We started to measure our footprint in 
2006 and the graph shown to the left 
illustrates that the g roup’s emissions 
have fallen steadily since then.

We continue our commitment to raising 
the profile of dmgt and

We have increased the regularity and 
consistency of our communications. in

We made several further key 
appointments in order to populate the

from within and from outside the g roup. 
at g roup level, as the Chairman has 
said in his statement, we have hired 
stephen daintith, from dow Jones, who 
joins us in January to succeed peter

as regards the g roup’s principal 
commodity, newsprint, arrangements 
are made annually with a range of 
suppliers to ensure the security of supply 
at the best available prices, having 
regard to the need for the necessary 
quality. particularly in the light of its 
strategy to create a diversified 
international portfolio of media 
businesses, the g roup is not dependent 
on any suppliers of other commodities, 
nor for its revenue on any particular 
customer. distribution arrangements 
are in place to ensure the delivery of 
newspapers to retail outlets.
trends and fa Ctors li Kely to 
affe Ct the outloo K
We have entered our new financial year 
in good heart as our businesses are 
performing well. many markets remain 
tough, however, and there is continuing 
economic uncertainty in the medium 
term, including in the uK where the 
impact of the g overnment’s austerity 
measures has yet to be fully felt. 
moreover, whilst we do not anticipate  
a ‘double dip’, external risks, such  
as the sovereign debt crisis, have not  
gone away.
rms has started the year well with a 
number of contracts booked and a 
solid sales pipeline. it is expecting to 
achieve low double digit growth again 
this year. 
at dmgi, we expect the combination of 
continuing investment in core growth 
initiatives, combined with improving 
market conditions, to drive a modest 
acceleration in revenue and profits* 
growth.
at dmg events, recent attendance and 
bookings trends have been moderately 
encouraging and we anticipate these 
continuing to improve in 2011. the 
forthcoming year will benefit from  
two of our three major biennial shows  
taking place.
g iven the size of the Company’s 
pension commitments compared to the 
size of the g roup, this cost needs to be 
controlled to ensure the financial health 
of the Company and of these pension 
plans. accordingly, the board decided 
to close its defined benefit (final salary) 
plans to new employees from the start 
of the financial year, whilst keeping 
them open for current employees. the 
Company has also announced plans to 
introduce a series of measures during 
the 2010/11 financial year designed to 
help secure the financial health of these 
plans into the future. 
 all new employees of a&n media are 
now offered a defined contribution 
pension plan, which is consistent with 
our other newer and more 
internationally focused companies 
where we have long believed this type 
of pension plan to be more appropriate. 
so Cial and Community issues
Community involvement is integral to 
the way we run our company, as is its 
importance to the personal motivation 
of our employees. We donate money, 
time and in-kind donations such as 
radio airtime and advertising space, 
and staff participate in a huge range of 
activities, including fundraising, 
organising events and acting as trustees 
to charitable initiatives.

the number of employees rose by 338 
from 14,254 at the beginning of the year 
(excluding dmg r adio australia) to 
14,592 at the year end, an increase of 
2%, due to an increase within rms ’s

increase and with a continued focus on 
cost reduction, the number of 
employees fell by 736 in the year. Within 
this number there was a fall within 
n orthcliffe uK and a&n media’s uK 
printing operations of nearly 400 (10%), 
including the job losses from the closure 
of our printing plant in plymouth.
a variety of approaches to staff 
communications exist within the g roup, 
as explained in our Cr report. i n march, 
we communicated the introduction of 
a share incentive plan, dmgt s hare 
purchase+, which is available to all 
eligible uK staff to give them the 
opportunity to own the Company’s 
shares, so that they can benefit if we 
are successful in meeting our financial 
objectives. this followed approval by 
shareholders at our agm in f ebruary.
the Company attaches great 
importance to a clear understanding of 
personal financial issues by its 
employees, a view which prompted the 
development by dmgt p ensions of an 
online workplace financial information 
website (www.timeformoney.co.uk), 
which was launched in the uK in august.
dmgt has been operating defined 
benefit pension schemes, primarily in its 
newspaper businesses, for a long time 
and has a reputation for the quality of 
pension provision. however, the cost of 
providing this benefit continues to rise 
as people are expected to live longer 
and, more recently, as turmoil in 
financial markets has reduced 
expected investment returns.

n orthcliffe also is focused on revenue 
opportunities as it builds on its digital 
strengths and sales capability. 
f or the g roup as a whole, we will build 
on our achievements over the last two 
years by maintaining firm control of 
costs and seizing on the growth 
opportunities we see. o ur focus will 
remain on cash generation and debt 
reduction, as we seek to recover our 
investment grade credit rating. at the 
same time, we will continue to drive 
organic growth through new product 
development, investments to increase 
market share and carefully selected 
acquisitions.
although we remain wary of market 
conditions due to continuing economic 
uncertainty, the strength of our leaner 
more focused g roup with its diversified 
international portfolio of market leading 
companies allows the board to be 
cautiously optimistic of achieving 
another year of underlying growth.
martin morgan 
Chief executive
f or euromoney, although the broader 
outlook for global economic growth 
remains challenging, the outlook for the 
start of the new year is good and 
euromoney expects the good revenue 
performance achieved in the second 
half of the year to continue into the first 
quarter. f urther, subscriptions were 
growing at an annual rate of 7% at the 
end of 2010, which provides support for 
further growth in 2011. however, there is 
uncertainty over the outlook beyond 
december.
after a strong recovery and return to 
revenue growth in 2010, euromoney will 
continue to pursue its successful 
strategy with an emphasis on investing 
in technology and new subscription-
based electronic information services, 
supplemented with small strategic 
acquisitions. the level of spending on 
technology and new product 
investment will increase further in 2011. 
in the short term, this may reduce 
operating* margins as most of the 
investment is being made in 
subscription-based electronic 
information services which have a long 
lead time to build and sell. 
Within a&n media, national advertising 
revenue at associated in the first eight 
weeks of the new year was up 9% on 
last year, continuing the recovery we 
have seen since January. it is still very 
difficult to predict future revenue trends, 
but the strength of our key brands, fast 
growing digital businesses and focused 
cost control, leave associated well 
placed to capitalise on any further 
recovery in the economy.  We are, 
however, facing upward pressure on 
newsprint prices. We expect to see 
continuing strong growth in mail o nline 
readership.
n orthcliffe is facing another tough year. 
advertising revenue in the first eight 
weeks was down 6% on last year, 
continuing to track the year on year 
trend experienced in 2009/10 (like-for-
like decline of 7%). the outlook for the 
first quarter is not expected to improve 
on this trend. as with associated, 
n orthcliffe will be affected by higher 
newsprint prices. although cost 
reduction initiatives will continue,  daily mail and general trust plC

summary
rms rebounded from the more difficult 
trading conditions of 2009 to achieve 
strong underlying
†
 revenue growth of 
12% and operating profit growth of 12%, 
whilst maintaining profit* margins at 
approximately 30% and continuing its 
investments in the n ext g eneration 
platform and other growth initiatives in 
the data and l ife & health markets. the 
reported results were unaffected by 
foreign exchange movements this year 
with little change in the average 
sterling: us dollar exchange rate.
year under revie W
rms achieved a balanced 
performance across its various business 
units. While nearly 75% of new sales 
were once again achieved in the core 
modelling business, more than 25% of 
new sales came in growth areas such as 
emerging r isk solutions, Capital markets 
and data solutions.
o perating achievements for the year 
included the release of r iskl ink version 
10.0, the launch of the first of rms ’s n ext 
g eneration platform capabilities, in the 
form of enterprise g rid Computing 
(egC), and continued sales momentum 
for growth initiatives such as rms ’s data 
Quality analytics, (‘miu’) software for 
managing portfolios of catastrophe 
(‘cat’) bonds, and the l ife & health 
market, including the successful 
completion of the first excess mortality 
cat bond. 
strategi C fo Cus
rms continues to focus on developing 
complete solutions for its clients across 
the re/insurance value chain. this 
includes providing access to 
sophisticated models, an ability to 
integrate those models into enterprise-
wide business processes, and analytics 
that help clients make better decisions. 
Clients seek upstream capability to 
acquire and manage high-quality 
exposure data, and downstream 
capability to open and interpret the 
models, and then apply these insights 
to deliver targeted decision support for 
underwriting, pricing and managing 
their business.
rms is developing a n ext g eneration 
platform to deliver these capabilities, 
and these solutions, to its global client 
base. the rollout of new capabilities will 
take place over several years, and was 
initiated in 2010 with the release of 
rms ’s enterprise g rid Computing (egC) 
capability, which enables its clients to 
pool the computing power of their 
servers into one high performance grid. 
benefits include unparalleled analysis 
speed and scalability, flexible job and 
resource management, and highly 
efficient use of computing resources,  
all leading to deeper catastrophe risk 
insights and faster time-to-market.  
rms is targeting delivery of its full suite 
of n ext g eneration platform capability 
in 2013.
Core business
rms continues to focus primarily on the 
commercial catastrophe modelling 
business, which includes modelling of 
natural hazards risks such as 
earthquake, hurricane and flood, as 
well as terrorism risk and risk from 
pandemic diseases. its primary market 
is the global property and casualty re/
insurance industry, where it currently 
serves over 350 customers in 30 
countries around the world. products 
and services are developed and 
delivered through the activity of nearly 
550 rms employees in n orth america, 
europe, Japan and China, and more 
than 2,200 additional employees at 
india-based rmsi .
rms models are deeply embedded in 
risk decision-making processes 
throughout the re/insurance vertical, 
including insurance companies, 
insurance and reinsurance brokers, 
reinsurers and the capital markets. 
during 2010, rms was engaged in the 
development of substantial updates to 
two of its core peril models, atlantic 
hurricane and european Windstorm, 
which will be released as r iskl ink 11.0 in 
2011. the release is driven by significant 
increases in hazard and loss data, as 
well as advances in research and 
technology since the models were last 
updated. rms will also be releasing a 
new China typhoon model in 2011.

risK management solutions Continued
o utloo K
the new year has started well with 
a number of contracts booked and 
a solid sales pipeline. rms has now 
released initial elements of its n ext 
g eneration platform, including new 
capability such as enterprise g rid 
Computing (egC). in its l ife & 
health initiatives, it has a strong 
pipeline of business opportunities in 
the pensions market for its new 
developed l ongevity risk modelling 
product and services. rms is 
expecting to achieve low double 
digit growth again this year. 
l ife & health
o ne of rms ’s emerging growth areas is 
the l ife & health marketplace, where it 
is pursuing a variety of initiatives related 
to longevity and e xcess mortality risk. 
With respect to l ongevity, rms has 
developed a strong pipeline of interest, 
including the uK pension market, where 
rms ’s efforts to project longevity risk 
more accurately are seen as an 
opportunity to manage existing books 
of pension liability better. With respect 
to excess mortality, rms was chosen in 
2010 to be the modeller for swiss r e’s 
excess mortality bond, vita , the first 
such bond executed in the capital 
markets.
investment programme
rms once again achieved its operating 
profit budget while maintaining a strong 
investment programme in initiatives 
designed to generate future growth, 
including its n ext g eneration software 
platform, data solutions products and 
services, and emerging r isk solutions 
such as l ife & health.
data solutions
rms continues to expand ‘upstream’ 
from its models to provide its clients with 
data and data management solutions. 
in 2010, rms completed additional sales 
of its data Quality toolkit in new markets 
such as bermuda. this product 
integrates client business rules with rms 
analytics to ensure that data is 
complete, consistent, accurate and fit 
for purpose. rms is continuing to 
improve its data solutions, and expects 
to release the next version of the toolkit 
in 2010/11, as part of its mission to help 
the industry achieve a universal 
standard for measuring, managing and 
communicating data quality.
Capital mar Kets
the capital markets experienced a 
strong rebound from 2009’s reduced 
level of activity. rms took advantage of 
improved markets to execute 15 cat 
bond deals this year, and maintained its 
leading market position. in addition, 
rms continued to sell its m iu software 
product to clients and investors to help 
manage portfolios of cat bonds, with 
an expanded version scheduled for 
release in 2010/11.

environmental data r esources (‘edr ‘), 
benefited from a slight improvement in 
commercial property transactions 
enhancing revenue and this, together 
with the full effect of cost saving 
initiatives made in 2009, led to a 
significant improvement in operating 
profit*. edr continues to enhance its 
position in the lender market and also 
introduced a property monitoring 
product during the year.
l andmark information g roup also 
increased both revenues and operating 
profits*, despite the continuing 
difficulties in the uK housing market. We 
saw some improvement in the early 
part of the year, enhanced by the 
stamp duty holiday that expired on 
31st december, 2009, but throughout 
the remainder of the year housing 
transaction volumes remained similar to 
the prior year levels, hovering around 
half of the long-term average. the 
abolition of home information packs 
following the g eneral election in may 
further disrupted the market, although 
l andmark accrued limited margin from 
this relatively short-lived product line. 
l andmark made two small acquisitions 
to enhance our offerings to the 
property information market in the uK. 
Calnea, a leading provider of 
automated valuation models, was 
acquired in July and the argyll 
environmental acquisition was 
completed shortly after the end of the 
year.
dmgi also has a significant investment in 
builder adius, a property information 
business. builder adius has built the 
largest database of building permit 
data in the us with in excess of 70 million 
records from cities and counties across 
the us . it also provides building permit 
and inspection software (‘blueprince’) 
to municipal governments.

64% of dmgi’s revenue was generated 
by companies operating in the 
financial, education, energy and 
geospatial markets. pleasing growth 
was experienced in all of these with the 
exception of geospatial where the 
continuation of tough market 
conditions, driven by tight us state and 
federal budgets, led to a reduction in 
sanborn’s revenue. in total, revenue in 
these other markets was up 2% at £148 
million and they contributed operating 
profits* of £36 million, representing 11% 
growth. the underlying
†
 revenue and 
operating profits were higher by 1% and 
9% respectively.
in the financial information market, 
trepp is the market leader of 
information to the Commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (“Cmbs”) 
market and once again grew revenue 
and operating profit strongly. trepp 
successfully acted as the collateral 
monitor for Cmbs for the f ederal 
r eserve bank of n ew york as part of the 
us federal government’s t erm asset-
backed securities l oan f acility (talf ). 
trepp also developed its core Cmbs 
products significantly during the year 
and started to expand into adjacent 
areas.
l ewtan, offering products to both 
investors and issuers in the asset-backed 
securities market, also enjoyed a good 
year with record profits buoyed by the 
successful launch of its abs l oan 
product line. a major upgrade of its 
absn et product is to be launched in 
early 2011.

 revenue reduced by 
9% in the year, the most significant 
reductions were experienced early in

of exhibitions due to cost saving 
initiatives.
the largest show, the bi-annual n ew

year on year increases in both revenue

shows in the year were big 5, held in

construction sector, which grew 
strongly, and the biennial g lobal

continued to expand aggressively the 
programme of successful sponsorship-
driven leadership conferences under 
the evanta brand and now have events

professionals, in addition to Chief 
information o fficers initially served.
summary
dmg events’ reported revenues were 
down 37% to £110 million and operating 
profit* down 19% to £30 million, due in 
large part to the divestment of 
businesses in the prior year. these results 
also reflect the inclusion of one large 
biennial event in June, the g lobal 
petroleum show, but the absence of 
two others, g astech and adipeC. 
during the year the restructuring of our 
exhibitions division was completed.
the performance of the reshaped and 
renamed group has been pleasing. 
although profits* are lower, this is due in 
part to the late-cycle nature of 
exhibitions and also to the timing of 
some of our biennial shows.
margins* have significantly improved by 
6% to 27% as a consequence of 
reducing central costs, simplifying 
operations and focusing on market 
leading b2b events. 
the division is now organised into five 
operating units, covering the sectors of

euromoney increased its operating 
profit* by 25%, on revenues up 4%. these 
record profits underline the success of 
its strategy to build a more robust and 
higher quality information business.
Whilst the first half of the year benefited 
from the cost cuts made the year 
before, the second half brought a 
return to revenue growth earlier and 
faster than expected. this better than 
expected revenue performance 
helped to offset euromoney’s significant 
investment in new products and the 
online migration of its print businesses. 
strategy
euromoney’s strategy is to build a more 
resilient and better focused global 
information business, with a strong 
emphasis on emerging markets. While 
tight cost management was 
maintained throughout the year, the 
strategic focus has shifted to driving 
revenue growth, both from existing 
products as markets recover, and from 
investment in technology platforms and 
new products as part of the migration 
to an online information business. 
during the year, euromoney invested in 
online products and started to execute 
long-term investment programmes for 
two of its most important electronic 
information businesses: bCa, the 
independent economic research 
business, and CeiC, the provider of 
emerging market databases for 
economists and analysts around the 
world, with a view to building rapidly 
the quality and coverage of their 
products as well as expanding their 
global sales resources. this increased 
level of investment is being undertaken 
with a view to driving revenue growth 
for 2012 and beyond. 
in august, euromoney acquired arete 
Consulting, the definitive global data 
and news source for structured retail 
investment products. euromoney will 
continue to pursue its successful 
strategy in 2011, with an emphasis on 
investing in technology and new 
subscription-based electronic 
information services, supplemented 
with small strategic acquisitions, to drive 
revenue growth. 
trading r evieW
traditionally the recovery in revenue at 
the end of a downturn tends to be 
slower than the fall at the start, but this 
has not been the case following the 
credit crisis, when the recovery has 
happened much earlier and faster than 
expected.  
the faster than expected recovery of 
subscription revenues was the most 
encouraging trading sign during the 
second half. the pick up in subscription 
renewal rates began in the summer of 
2009, and has been followed by a 
recovery in sales of new subscriptions. 
this reflects a combination of stronger 
markets, increased investment in 
marketing and electronic publishing, as 
well as many new customers identified 
in the aftermath of the credit crisis. 
subscriptions continue to account for 
nearly 50% of revenues. 
most of euromoney’s biggest 
subscription businesses have seen 
revenues and renewal rates return to 
pre-credit crisis levels earlier than 
expected.
advertising revenues were the first to 
suffer during the credit crisis, and the 
first to recover. advertising budgets and 
campaigns tend to be linked to the 
calendar year, although the rate of 
recovery has improved each quarter as 
global financial institutions became 
more confident about the outlook for 
financial markets. in addition, the 
financial year closed with a particularly 
strong september, the key month of the 
year for many of euromoney’s 
advertising-led businesses. 
r evenues from events, which comprise 
both sponsorship and paying 
delegates, experienced the most rapid 
recovery in 2010. event revenues were 
hit hard during the credit crisis as 
customers exercised tight controls over 
training, event attendance and travel. 
at the same time euromoney cut event 
volumes by eliminating many of its 
smaller, low margin events, and 
continued to invest to enhance the 
market leading positions of its annual 
conferences and meetings. as markets 
have recovered, so attendance at 
these events has returned rapidly to 
pre-credit crisis levels or better.  
emerging markets, which account for 
more than a third of the group’s 
revenue, continued to hold up 
reasonably well, with asia and l atin 
america providing the main sources  
of growth.

f inan Cial publishing
r evenues increased by 3% to £77 
million. margin improved partly due to 
the cost cuts made in 2009 and partly 
to the strong end to the year as many of 
the titles publish their biggest issue of 
the year in september. among the best 
performers were euromoney, euroWeek 
and l atin f inance, all of which have a 
significant emerging market exposure.  
business publishing
euromoney’s activities outside finance 
are less volatile, reflecting the spread of 
sectors covered, including metals, 
commodities, energy, telecoms and 
law, and the higher proportion of 
revenues derived from subscriptions. 
these sectors held up relatively well 
during the credit crisis and were not 
subject to significant costs cuts, leaving 
limited margin upside. r evenues 
increased by 5% to £59 million. metal 
bulletin was again the best performer as 
subscription revenues continued to 
grow, driven by a combination of 
product investment and increased 
marketing spend. 
training
this division predominantly serves the 
global financial sector and was the 
hardest hit by the credit crisis and cuts 
in training spend, headcount and travel 
budgets. training revenues, which are 
mostly derived from paying delegates, 
fell by 6% to £30 million, as the impact of 
the credit crisis continued into the early 
part of the financial year. f rom January, 
as customer training budgets returned, 
delegate bookings gradually improved, 
although course volumes have been 
held back until there is more certainty 
over the recovery. 
Conferen Ces and seminars
r evenues comprise both sponsorship 
and paying delegates and increased 
by 4% to £79 million. the recovery in 
margin demonstrates the success of the 
group’s strategy to cut low margin 
events in a downturn, while continuing 
to focus on building its larger, must-
attend annual events in niche markets. 
as markets have recovered, the group’s 
bigger events have seen a sharp 
recovery in demand and attendance 
has improved. g rowth has come across 
all sectors, with some, such as 
structured finance and hedge funds, 
rebounding faster than expected, and 
others, such as metals, coal and 
telecoms, with their strong emerging 
markets exposure, achieving record 
attendance and revenues. 
databases and information 
servi Ces
r evenues are predominantly derived 
from subscription contracts of 12 months 
or longer, and the performance of this 
division therefore tends to lag the 
others. r evenues increased by 3% to 
nearly £90 million. r evenue growth 
recovered in the second half. bCa 
returned to growth from the third 
quarter, earlier than expected. CeiC 
continued to experience strong growth 
in revenue from its emerging markets 
data service, which helped offset 
weaker demand for isi ’s emerging 
markets information service. 
o utloo K
the recent strength of equity and 
commodity markets, and the 
positive outlook for emerging 
markets, all provide momentum for 
further recovery. however, the 
broader outlook for global 
economic growth remains 
challenging. this, together with 
lingering concerns over sovereign 
debt levels in europe, and the 
effectiveness of measures to avoid 
a repeat of the credit crisis, creates 
uncertainty over the outlook 
beyond december.  
n evertheless, euromoney expects 
its good second half revenue 
performance to continue into the 
first quarter of the new financial 
year. f urthermore, subscriptions 
provide support for further revenue 
growth in 2011.  
the level of spending on 
technology and new product 
investment will increase further in 
2011. in the short term, this may 
reduce operating margins. 
euromoney will also continue to 
execute significant long-term 
investment programmes for bCa 
and CeiC with a view to building 
rapidly the quality and coverage of 
their products as well as expanding 
their global sales resources.  
euromoney will continue to pursue 
its successful strategy in 2011, with 
an emphasis on investing in 
technology and new subscription-
based electronic information 
services, supplemented with small 
strategic acquisitions.

was changed to provide a new r eview 
newspaper supplement and a 
redesigned live magazine. t hese 
changes have been well received by 
readers and advertisers. the mail on 
sunday’s other magazine supplement, 
you , won “supplement of the year” at 
the british press awards for an 
unprecedented third successive year.
although there were no cover price 
rises, total revenues for the combined 
national titles were flat year on year. 
despite a contraction in combined 
display and Classified advertising 
revenues during o ctober to december 
2009, revenues increased annually by 
2% with particularly strong growth in the 
second half of the year. the benefit of 
lower newsprint prices and further 
reductions in the cost base resulted in a 
20% rise in operating profit* for the two 
national titles with the daily mail 
recording its highest ever profit whilst 
profitability of the mail on sunday more 
than doubled. 
the mail digital division, which hosts the 
newspapers’ companion websites, had 
another strong year of growth, 
recording a 57% improvement in 
advertising revenue. there was a 
significant rise in traffic to its primary 
site, mail o nline, thereby securing it as 
the uK’s most popular ’newspaper‘ 
website with a daily average of 1.13 
million unique visitors in september, up 
71% year on year. o n a global basis 
traffic to mail o nline grew to 47 million 
unique visitors during the same month, 
making it the world’s second largest 
english language online newspaper.
the f ree n ewspaper division 
experienced a strong recovery this 
year. this was achieved through a 
combination of the closure of l ondon 
l ite, cost control and record revenues. 
metro maintained its daily circulation 
base at 1,331,000 (down less than 1% 
year on year) and experienced 
advertising revenue growth of 21%. 
Costs, excluding those directly related 
to increased paginations, increased by 
only 1% year on year. in march, metro 
renewed its agreement to distribute in 
l ondon underground stations for a 
further seven and a half years. traffic to 
metro.co.uk has seen strong growth 
during the year following a redesign of 
the site, up 163% to an average of 2.8m 
uK unique visitor per month in the last 
quarter. digital revenue grew by 68% in 
the year.
metro ireland, in which associated held 
a 45% share, merged in January with 
herald am, owned by independent 
n ews and media, following clearance 
from the irish Competition authority. 
associated holds 33% of the new 
operation, metro herald, and our share 
of losses on the product has reduced by 
83% this year with revenue growth of 29% 
year on year. 7days in dubai saw a 
recovery in revenues, up 16% year on 
year for the full year, but stronger later in 
the year, up 58% in the final six months.
mail today, the delhi-based daily 
newspaper, in which associated holds a 
26% interest, has grown its circulation by 
71% since the beginning of 2010, 
making it the fastest growing 
newspaper in its market. although still 
loss-making, this has already had a 
clear impact on revenues which have 
grown by over 42% year on year in the 
last 6 months. the strategy of investment 
in circulation growth will continue for 
2010/11.
printing
Changes to the printing requirements in 
the south West led to the closure of our 
print centre in plymouth. some 
production was transferred to the four 
remaining sites. harmsworth printing 
continuously looks for opportunities for 
further operational efficiencies.
digital operations 
r evenue across the portfolio of digital 
companies was up 1% year on year to 
£95 million with particularly strong 
growth in the property sector. the 
digital only businesses grew profit* by  
£5 million to £6 million and improved 
their margin* whilst continuing to invest 
in their products and marketing across all 
businesses and supporting international 
expansion in the Jobs sector. 
during the final quarter, the associated 
n orthcliffe digital central functions 
were integrated with a&n media, 
producing significant cost savings. the 
digital only businesses now report 
directly into a&n media and head 
office support functions are leveraged 
across all a&n media businesses. 
Jobs
the flagship recruitment portal, Jobsite, 
maintained its commitment to invest in 
brand building with multiple tv 
campaigns and sponsorship of 
portsmouth f C, resulting in record traffic 
and uploaded Cvs. the decline in 
vacancy volumes experienced during 
the prior year reversed with consistent 
growth throughout the year, and also a 
marked increase in client numbers. the 
number of vacancies advertised in 
september was 24% higher than the 
previous year, and this was reflected in 
sustained revenue and profit delivery for

the motors digital division continued to 
grow, with underlying
†
 revenues up 9% 
year on year, and has built market share 
to move ahead of ebay motors and 
establish itself as a clear number two to 
autotrader. dealer numbers were up 5% 
and vehicle numbers increased by 19%. 
the signing of partnership agreements 
with four regional newspaper groups at 
the beginning of 2009/10 is starting to 
contribute to overall growth. more 
strategic partnerships are planned. the 
software and services offerings have 
been re-launched, with dedicated 
sales teams now focusing on growing 
this part of the business. the business 
has been restructured under a new 
leadership team which launched a new 
motors.co.uk brand and website, 
resulting in an 11% year on year growth 
in reach of online used car searches 
from 16.9% to 18.7%.

it is still very difficult to predict

placed to capitalise on any further 
recovery in the economy. it is, 
however, facing upward pressure

brands and deliver an excellent 
customer experience. 
travel
the loss-making teletext information 
services business, provided under the 
terms of the public teletext licence, was 
closed in december 2009. the 
continuing business, teletext holidays, 
operates as an aggregator within the 
travel sector and has gone from 
strength to strength, despite 
challenging market conditions with the 
value of uK spend on foreign holiday 
travel falling by 12%. teletext holidays 
reported online profit* growth of 18% 
driven primarily by online revenue 
increases in both yield (23%) and 
volume (9%). at v illarenters online, the 
holiday villa letting portal, new 
management took over from the 
outgoing founders. trading was up with 
the conversion rate on the new 
v illarenters.com website improving by 
6% and an increase in bookable 
properties of 38%.
the profitable elements of teletext tv 
services have been retained, operating 
as a&n media mobile and tv . this 
business has core expertise in 
monetising mobile channels, including

n orthcliffe’s portfolio of titles continued 
to be affected by weak advertising 
markets. r ecruitment and n otices 
categories in particular were affected 
by low private sector demand and

 revenues were 
down £16 million or 6%, offset by cost 
reductions. exceptional costs of £15 
million were incurred on restructuring 
activities, including asset impairments. 
n ewspaper sales revenues fell on a 
like-for-like basis by 6% or £4 million. 
modest cover price increases were 
implemented in the year on specific 
titles. f or the January to June 2010 abC 
period, circulation of our dailies was 
down 7.7% compared with an industry 
average of 6.7%. the weekly titles 
recorded a fall of 4.4%, a result which 
outperformed the industry average by 
1.5 percentage points.
despite the fall in revenues, n orthcliffe 
has continued to innovate to improve 
the quality and quantity of its 
newspaper content. since o ctober 
2009, 10 daily titles have introduced a 
total redesign and four have adopted 
partial redesigns. f ourteen weekly 
newspapers have also introduced 
significant design changes. the volume 
of community provided news and 
photography continues to increase in 
all titles to add unique content and 
celebrate local life.
after unprecedented advertising 
declines in 2009 and a year on year 
decline of 17% in the first quarter, 
advertising trends improved to reach a 
full year result of 7% down year on year 
on a like-for-like basis. 
although the increase in 
unemployment levels showed some 
early signs of slowing, recent budget cut 
announcements have, as expected, 
had a heavy impact on our private  
and public sector recruitment spend.

in the property category, revenues 
grew by 5% with year on year growth 
recorded each month since quarter

robust despite recent market 
intelligence indicating a reduction in 
the level of mortgage approvals.
motors advertising benefited from a 
strong digital performance. the

despite the challenges of a contracting

continued to invest in the development 
and roll out of a customer relationship 
management (Crm ) system to harvest 
business leads and improve sales 
productivity. all n orthcliffe centres will 
be using the system by early 2011. 
n orthcliffe also completed the 
development of new circulation 
software, which will be implemented

uK advertising revenues into the 
new financial year have continued 
to track the year on year trend 
experienced in 2009/10. the 
outlook for the first quarter is not 
expected to improve on this trend.
as with associated, n orthcliffe will 
be affected by higher newsprint 
prices. although cost reduction 
initiatives will continue during the 
current year, we are now focused 
on revenue opportunities as we 
build on our digital strengths and 
sales capability.
at the end of the year. this positions 
n orthcliffe to serve local advertisers 
and users better through the thisis and 
l ocalpeople networks. technical 
investment in the l ocalpeople digital 
platform will be leveraged across all 
digital products to improve user 
experience.
n orthcliffe has continued to innovate 
and change processes to drive down 
operational costs. these have reduced 
by £26m or 10% compared to the same 
period last year.
staff costs fell by £14 million (underlying) 
as headcount was reduced by 242 or 
7% since september 2009. g reater 
efficiency has been delivered across  
all departments.
production and distribution costs have 
reduced by an underlying £15 million. 
some savings were as a consequence 
of lower activity levels. however, more 
significant reductions have been made 
through rationalisation of the product 
portfolio, distribution changes and the 
full year impact of prior year print  
plant closures.

r evenue
g roup revenue for the year was £1,984 
million compared with £2,118 million for 
the prior year, representing a fall of 6% 
but an underlying
†
 increase of 2%. 
underlying
†
 revenues from the g roup’s 
b2b operations were 3% higher than last 
year. r eported revenues were 4% lower, 
principally reflecting the effect of prior 
year disposals within dmg events, with 
little change in the average sterling: us 
dollar exchange rate. r evenues from 
our consumer operations totalled £1,160 
million, an underlying
†
 increase of 1%, 
though 8% lower on a reported basis, 
reflecting various portfolio changes and 
one fewer week’s trading.
the analysis of revenue by activity, 
illustrated in graph 1, shows that the 
percentage of revenue from consumer 
media has fallen slightly this year and is 
now 58%, down from 67% in 2006. 
g raph 2 shows the geographic split of 
revenue. this shows that 66% of revenue 
by source was generated by uK 
businesses, compared with 75% in 2006.  
o perating profit
o perating profit* was up by £47 million 
or 17% on the equivalent figure for the 
prior year at £320 million, an underlying
†
 
increase of approximately 10%. this 
increase was due to margin 
improvements across our portfolio, but 
particularly in our consumer businesses. 
o verall operating margin* rose from 
13% to 16%.
o perating profit* is stated before 
charging £39 million as exceptional 
operating costs. this charge comprised 
impairment of property, plant and 
equipment of £26 million and 
reorganisation costs of £13 million 
principally within a&n media.
the charge for amortisation of 
intangible assets fell by £18 million to  
£71 million due mainly to the disposal of 
50% of dmgra . the g roup also made a 
net impairment credit of £20 million, 
being a write back of impairments 
made in dmg events (£27 million), offset 
by charges totalling £7 million.
the analysis of operating profit* by 
activity is shown in graph 3. this shows 
that 66% of this year’s operating profit* 
was generated from the g roup’s b2b 
operations and 34% from consumer, 
compared to 40% and 60% in 2006. 
these percentages have been 
calculated on a new basis of an 
allocation of central costs according to 
the number of employees.  
the g roup’s b2b companies increased 
their overall profit* by £23 million or 12% 
to £226 million, an underlying

 increase 
of 15%. the largest increase was by

as the table shows, net interest payable 
and similar charges (including deemed

fell by £3 million to £73 million due to 
lower average debt.  
as stated above, the ias 19 pension net 
financing charge has been reported 
within net finance costs, rather than 
within g roup operations as in previous 
reporting periods. this financing item 
increased by £7 million due to the 
movement in the pension fund deficit 
and the discount rate used. 
the g roup’s interest cover, calculated 
as the ratio of adjusted profits* before 
interest, depreciation and amortisation 
(ebitda) to net interest payable was 5.2 
times this year, up from 4.5 in 2009, and 
well above the required three times.  
since we no longer regard this as a key 
performance indicator, we have not 
illustrated this by means of a graph  
this year.
o ther in Come statement items
the g roup recorded other net gains of 
£0.1 million, compared to net losses of 
£24 million last year. profit attributable 
to operations treated as discontinued, 
principally 50% of dmgra , amounted 
to £33 million.
r esult before tax
the statutory profit before tax for the 
year was £146 million, after charging 
£58 million of amortisation charges and 
impairment losses and £39 million of net 
exceptional charges.
million and both the daily mail and 
metro recorded their highest ever 
operating profit*. northcliffe’s profits* 
improved by £6 million to £30 million. 
dmgra made £3 million before it 
became a 50% joint venture. 
We have decided to report the ias 19 
pensions financing items within net 
finance costs, rather than within 
operating profit*. the prior period 
figures have been restated so as to 
reallocate a credit of £5 million from 
corporate costs within operating profit* 
into net finance costs. 
due in large part to the divestment of 
businesses in 2009 and, to a lesser 
extent, the late-cycle nature of 
exhibitions. the average sterling: us 
dollar exchange rate for the year was 
£1: $1.56 (against £1:$1.55 last year). 
Within consumer media, profits* rose by 
£38 million. the profits* of a&n media 
were significantly higher, up 46%, due to 
cost efficiencies the elimination of 
loss-making activities and national 
advertising revenue growth. at

the restatement will reduce the 
adjusted profit* and adjusted earnings 
per share numbers reported for the  
year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010 by the 
software amortisation charge of £17 
million to £230 million and 3.7 pence to 
46.3 pence respectively. there is no 
impact on our statutory figures. 
pensions
the g roup’s defined benefit pension 
schemes provide retirement benefits  
for uK staff, largely in a&n media.  
the deficit in these schemes fell from 
£430 million at the beginning of the 
year to £271 million at 3rd o ctober, 2010 
(calculated in accordance with ias 19). 
this improvement is due to an increase 
in the market value of the schemes’ 
assets coupled with a reduction in the 
value of liabilities arising from changes 
in the schemes’ membership, and 
despite a further fall in the corporate 
bond yield used to discount those 
liabilities.
the Company is continuing its funding 
discussions with the trustees as part of 
the process associated with the triennial 
actuarial valuation of the main 
schemes as at 31st march, 2010. this 
valuation and the associated funding 
agreement are expected to be 
completed by June 2011, within the 
statutory period.
Cash f lo W and net debt
n et debt has fallen by £187 million 
during the year from £1,049 million to 
£862 million, as the g roup focused on 
reduction of indebtedness. at the year 
end, only £3 million of short-term bank 
loans remained outstanding, with most 
debt in the form of long-term eurobonds.
g raph 4 illustrates the movement in net 
debt and shows the g roup’s sources of 
free cash flows and use of those funds 
during the year. the g roup generated 
trading cash flow of £339 million and 
disposal proceeds of £81 million. these 
funded acquisitions of £40 million, 
capital expenditure of £52 million, 
taxation of £9 million, interest of £68 
million and dividends totalling  
£64 million. 
in general, the g roup’s profits are 
converted rapidly into cash and cash 
generation was strong across the 
g roup, with 99% of profits* converted 
into cash, before allowing for 
exceptional operating costs.
profit/loss after tax
adjusted profit after tax and minority 
interests amounted to £191 million. the 
statutory result was a profit for the year 
of £219 million, after the exceptional  
tax credits.
planned restatement of profit* 
and earnings per share*
We have decided to alter the 
presentation of our adjusted results* 
from 2010/11 so as to include the 
amortisation of software and internally 
generated intangible assets. under ifrs , 
software is included within intangible 
fixed assets which are amortised over 
their useful lives. the level of software 
amortisation has grown steadily since 
our adoption of ifrs in 2006.
henceforth, the g roup will add back 
only the amortisation of intangible 
assets acquired in a business 
combination in arriving at its adjusted 
numbers. this change will bring it into 
line with the practice of the majority of 
other companies. 
taxation
after excluding the effect of 
exceptional and other items that are 
not expected to recur, the underlying 
tax rate fell from 22.1% to 13.7%. the 
continued low rate reflects tax 
reductions from tax-efficient financing 
and tax deductible amortisation in the 
us that are expected to recur.
the g roup has recognised significant 
tax losses that are likely largely to 
eliminate tax payments by its businesses 
in both the uK and us , other than 
euromoney, for in excess of two years, 
assuming current levels of profitability. 
this rises to in excess of four years if 
unrecognised losses can be utilised. the 
recognition of as yet unrecognised tax 
losses in future years could assist in 
sustaining the current low rate of 
adjusted tax in the short term.
there were net exceptional credits of 
£72 million including the write back of 
provisions arising from the agreement of 
certain prior year open issues with tax 
authorities (£46 million) and the tax 
credit on recognition of uK tax losses 
(£30 million).

using the most efficient or appropriate 
approach. this may result in ifrs 
accounting volatility.
o vervie W
the g roup has adequate committed 
debt finance to meet current trading 
requirements. the g roup aims to have 
70% to 80% of its debt at fixed interest 
rates to reduce the impact of interest 
rate fluctuations. f oreign exchange risk 
on transactions is not a large issue for 
the g roup as the majority of its 
businesses operate in the country in 
which they are located. in principle, the 
underlying currency of net debt after 
taking account of derivatives is 
managed in proportion to the ebitda in 
each currency. more than half of the 
g roup’s profits are expected to be 
earned from revenue billed in us dollars 
outside the uK. the g roup’s foreign 
assets are only partially hedged by its 
foreign currency debt and 
economically its earnings are most 
exposed to movements in value of the 
us dollar. 
(a) l iQuidity r isK
it is the g roup’s policy to have sufficient 
surplus borrowing headroom such that 
its development is not constrained. the 
g roup is funded by a mixture of equity, 
debt and retained profits. debt consists 
mainly of committed bank facilities and 
bonds. the bank facilities provide the 
g roup with flexibility for operational 
requirements and acquisitions. 
o verdraft facilities are also utilised. the 
bonds currently in issue consist of four 
sterling eurobonds. maturities of debt 
are maximised and spread in order to 
avoid the requirement for significant 
repayments at any point in time, as 
shown in g raph 6. surplus funds are 
generally used to pay down bank debt. 
if temporary surpluses arise, they are 
generally deposited in money market 
accounts with banks that provide 
bilateral credit lines. 
Covenants on debt instruments are kept 
to a minimum, even if this results in 
marginally higher interest costs. external 
finance is unsecured and is usually an 
obligation of the Company or its 
immediate subsidiary, rather than of 
trading subsidiaries. this gives operating 
management maximum flexibility to run 
the business without the distraction of 
meeting short-term financing 
requirements.
repayment in 2013, 2018, 2021 and 2027. 
it also had £180 million of committed 
banking facilities available to it until 
september 2011 and £240 million until 
september 2013. Consequently, the 
g roup has sufficient committed debt 
facilities to meet its foreseeable 
requirements. it had surplus committed 
facilities of £355 million at the year end.
treasury poli Cies 
the following paragraphs are a 
summary of the treasury policies of the 
g roup and, where appropriate, of the 
Company. dmgt aims to have sufficient 
liquidity to meet both operational and 
capital cash flows and to impose the 
minimum cash constraints on the 
management and operation of the 
g roup. f inancial instruments, including 
derivatives, are used by the g roup in 
order to manage the principal financial 
risks that arise in the course of business. 
these risks are liquidity or funding risk, 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk 
and counterparty risk. the instruments 
are used within the parameters set by 
the investment & f inance Committee of 
the board, and are not traded for a 
profit. the g roup’s priority is to address 
the economic impact of financial risks 
acquisitions were largely pre-
contracted earn-out payments and 
other deferred consideration. disposals 
were of properties and businesses, 
principally the sale of 50% of dmgra in 
december 2009.
g raph 5 shows the movement in the 
g roup’s ratio of year end net debt to 
ebitda since 2005. by the 2010 year end 
it was 2.3 times, within the g roup’s 
target range of 2.0 to 2.5 times and 
comfortably within the requirements of 
the g roup’s bank covenants. during the 
year, the g roup continued to act to 
increase profitability and reduce cash 
outflows, in particular by reducing 
acquisition activity and achieved its 
short-term aim of returning the ratio of 
net debt to ebitda to less than 2.5 one 
year ahead of expectations. the 
g roup’s corporate credit ratings are 
bbb – from f itch and bb + from standard 
& poor’s due largely to the latter’s 
perceived weakness of the consumer 
businesses and concern over debt 
levels, including the pension deficit. 
most of the g roup’s debt remains in 
long-term bonds, the earliest of which, 
totalling £157 million, is not repayable 
until 2013. at the year end, the g roup 
had £853 million of bonds due for

negate short-term changes in interest 
rates. at the year end, fixed interest rate 
debt represented approximately 106% 
of total net debt (including options 
which are not treated as effective 
hedges under ifrs ).
(d) Counterparty r isK
Counterparties and their credit ratings 
are regularly reviewed by g roup 
treasury. the g roup has counterparty 
limits for banks with long term credit 
ratings of ‘aa’ or better, and a lower 
limit for single ‘a’ rated banks. typically 
this is banks that extend credit facilities 
to the g roup. the g roup does not 
expect any counterparties to be unable 
to meet their obligations. 
(e) debt l evels
the g roup currently aims to manage its 
finances such that the ratio of net debt 
to ebitda does not normally exceed 
2.5:1. it is believed that this achieves 
close to the optimum level of gearing 
for the g roup, but leaves it with 
sufficient headroom should it desire to 
increase its debt levels. the exact target 
will depend, amongst others, on 
management’s perception of the 
quality of earnings and the risk of cash 
calls from its pension schemes, but 
would be expected to be in the range 
of 2.0 to 2.5 times. the ratio will not be in 
this range consistently, but this range 
currently defines the medium-term 
target level of net debt. Covenants on 
the g roup’s bank facilities and hire 
purchase obligations are n et debt: 
ebitda of no more than 4:1 and ebitda: 
interest of no less than 3:1.
g oing Con Cern
the directors have continued to adopt 
the going concern basis for the 
preparation of the accounts. this has 
been done since, after considering 
relevant information, they have a 
reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the g roup have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. 
 
peter Williams 
f inance director
managed to be approximately equal to 
the proportion of foreign ebita, 
compared to total g roup ebita. a 
substantial proportion of non-sterling 
debt liabilities are created through the 
use of foreign exchange derivatives 
which are treated as net investment 
hedges. the consequence of this  
policy is that the g roup’s significant 
foreign earnings are not hedged back 
to sterling.
(iii) economic exposure
a substantial proportion of the g roup’s 
value relates to foreign subsidiaries, in 
the us in particular. the foreign currency 
debt described above is only a partial 
hedge of this economic exposure.
(iv) n etting
the g roup may offset currency risks on 
trading, capital expenditure, tax and 
borrowings and only hedge the net 
exposure. this may result in not 
obtaining ifrs hedge accounting.
(C) interest r ate r isK
the g roup aims to have approximately 
70% of forecast net debt to 80% of 
target net debt as fixed interest rate 
liabilities. it aims to achieve this ratio 
over the medium term and it is applied 
to each of the g roup’s main currencies. 
the predictability of interest costs is 
deemed to be more important than the 
possible opportunity cost foregone of 
achieving lower interest rates. 
borrowings are made in either fixed or 
floating rates. interest rate swaps, cross 
currency swaps, and options are used 
to help attain the g roup’s target level of 
fixed interest rate debt. the maturity 
dates are spread in order to avoid 
interest rate basis risk and also to 
(b) f oreign exChange r isK
(i) transaction r isk
most of the g roup’s businesses do not 
transact cross-border: hence multi-
currency transaction risk is not 
substantial. the main exception is 
euromoney which has net receipts in us 
dollars and euros and net payments in 
sterling and Canadian dollars. 
euromoney has a series of us dollar and 
euro forward sale contracts in place up 
to two years forward to meet its sterling 
and Canadian dollar outgoings. o ther 
than in euromoney, there were no 
significant foreign currency forward 
contracts in existence that hedge 
revenues or costs. major items of capital 
expenditure in foreign currency are 
fixed using forward currency purchases.
tax on non-trading exchange rate 
movements is hedged, using cross 
currency swaps and forward currency 
contracts. however, ias 12 prohibits 
gains and losses from such hedges 
being shown net in the tax line and as  
a result increased volatility is introduced 
in the income statement. this year has 
not been materially impacted by this 
treatment but in 2009 statutory profit 
before taxation was reduced by  
£28 million tax payable by a similar 
amount. both were removed in arriving 
at 2009 adjusted profits. these 
transactions are unlikely to continue in 
the near future.
(ii) translation exposure
primary borrowings are principally 
incurred in sterling, with lesser amounts 
in us dollars and other currencies. 
g enerally, the proportion of foreign 
currency debt (after allowing for any 
hedging instruments) to total net debt is

dmgt and Corporate responsibility
all these activities underpin our 
commitment to reduce our Carbon 
f ootprint by 10% in the five financial 
years to 2012. this year our f ootprint was 
102,700 tonnes of Co
2
 (2009 107,700 
tCo
2
), a decrease of about 16,000 
tonnes (13%) compared to the baseline 
(118,600 tCo
2
 in 2007), as energy 
efficiency measures, particularly in 
printing facilities, and new travel 
policies took effect across the g roup. 
having achieved our targeted 10% 
reduction in under five years, we are 
now considering what commitment we 
should make for the next five years to 
2014/15.
Waste
n ewsprint production waste, the most 
significant element of waste arising from 
our activities, has been reduced again 
this year.
With the direct environmental impact 
from our office-based divisions already 
low, the existing paper recycling 
schemes at our offices across the world 
are being complemented by other 
recycling initiatives. plastic, glass, toner 
cartridges, mobile phones and it 
equipment are now being covered 
and, at hobsons, also aluminium  
and metal.
the rms offices in n ewark and l ondon 
order all office supplies from local 
suppliers that purchase recycled 
stationery and practise recycling 
themselves. they have an open plan 
office environment designed to take full 
advantage of natural light as well as 
using only low energy, low wattage 
compact fluorescent light fixtures  
and bulbs. 
a&n media was praised by the g reen 
standards trust for participating in the 
registered charity Waste to Wonder‘s 
initiative, recycling and redistributing 
over 11 tonnes of redundant office 
furniture; this initiative is now being 
promoted across the g roup.
dmg events is working with its suppliers 
to recycle as much carpet as possible 
– the largest waste by-product of any 
event as venue halls are carpeted in full 
for each event, with recycling ranging 
between 30 and 100%.
this year both harmsworth Quays, our 
largest printing plant, and n orthcliffe 
house, dmgt ’s headquarters, and the 
l ondon base of associated 
n ewspapers, n orthcliffe media and 
dmg events, achieved the key 
international environmental standard 
iso 14001. With these buildings 
recognised as having a world class 
standard of managing their 
environmental impact, our focus has 
now moved to the facilities in other 
parts of our business.
euromoney institutional investor has 
reduced the total operational hours of 
main plant systems in all of its buildings, 
saving the equivalent of over 94 days of 
continual running per year at its four 
main l ondon sites alone.
the use of energy, newsprint, ink and 
plates have cost implications and are, 
therefore, intensively managed across 
the g roup for reasons of good business 
sense, as well as to reduce their 
environmental impact.
dmg information’s l andmark has 
developed Carbon Counter, an online 
service to prepare businesses for the 
governmental Carbon r eduction 
Commitment energy efficiency scheme. 
also dmgt qualified for this climate 
change and energy saving programme, 
central to the uK’s strategy for reducing 
carbon dioxide (Co
2
) emissions. 
at dmg events, big 5 won the g reen 
award at the middle east event awards, 
an event where 200 nominations are 
made and decided by a panel of 
internationally and regionally 
recognised and respected judges.
at dmgt , we know that to be successful 
in today’s world, we need to respond 
appropriately to global challenges such 
as climate change, environmental 
damage and social and ethical issues. 
to us corporate responsibility (Cr ) and 
sustainability require that we manage 
our businesses and brands responsibly 
for the long-term success of our g roup 
and the communities we serve.
r eported here is a summary of our 
activities in this area. there is a 
dedicated section on the g roup 
website, www.dmgt.co.uk, with  
further information available that is 
updated regularly. 
r esponsibility for this area lies with the 
Corporate social r esponsibility 
Committee, a sub-committee of the 
board which is the forum at which 
corporate responsibility is discussed. the 
Committee’s remit is to oversee dmgt ’s 
environmental, waste, sustainability, 
employee, customer, supplier and 
community practices. the board has 
policies in place on equal opportunities, 
whistle-blowing, health and safety, the 
environment and a g roup Code of 
Conduct. o verall responsibility for Cr  
at board level lies with the Chairman  
of the Committee, david dutton.  
all of these policies are set out on  
the dmgt i ntranet.
environment
at the end of the year, dmgt achieved 
Carbon trust standard certification for 
all uK operations, including all 
subsidiaries. the standard, which is 
internationally recognised, was 
developed in 2007 to encourage good 
practice in carbon measurement, 
management and reduction by 
businesses and public sector 
organisations.
Key D evel OpMen TS
• Group carbon footprint for 2010 was 102,700 tonnes of CO
2
. 
This represents a 5% reduction on last year’s results and a 13% 
reduction when compared to the 2007 baseline.

• DMGT donated £860,000 to charity during the year.
• Key environmental milestones achieved.
# this is based on restated figures resulting from the consideration of structural changes that took place in 
2010 (in particular dmg r adio’s emissions were excluded for all periods as the division has become a 
Joint venture and it is no longer under dmgt ’s operational control).  35

Community
Community involvement is integral to 
our core value of enriching lives and 
the personal motivation of our 
employees. this includes community 
partnerships, supporting local projects, 
staff volunteering their time and 
charitable giving. 
o ur long-term perspective on our 
businesses and encouraging their 
active involvement in their communities 
are key to our corporate responsibility 
approach. both g enscape and 
hobsons support the independent 
development organisation plan, and 
their staff have been raising money for, 
visiting and helping communities in 
n icaragua and g hana. 
rms ’s company-wide helping hands 
initiative has continued to grow in 
participation and reach since its start as 
a single, one-department event five 
years ago.
all our newspapers promote significant 
Cr community activities. 
at n orthcliffe media, an ambitious local 
campaign ‘Cots for tots’ shows that 
local activity remains at the heart of  
its regional publishing responsibility.  
the campaign aims to raise £1 million 
for the neonatal intensive care unit  
for premature babies in bristol’s  
st michael’s hospital. the unit serves  
the whole of the south West which 
means that every month, up to 10 
babies are turned away because there 
is no room for them. the £1 million will 
pay for more intensive care cots, create 
more space on the ward and provide 
more accommodation for families. 
Working with the hospital, the campaign 
encourages readers to donate and to 
organise fund-raising events. the 
evening post is running daily stories 
about the work of the unit, its medical 
staff and the children and parents it has 
helped. in its first month the campaign 
has already raised £50,000. 
Customers, suppliers, Community
r emaining in touch with the diverse 
groups who make up our stakeholders, 
so as to reflect their interests and 
champion their causes, is critical to 
dmgt ’s continued success. We promote 
and monitor the spread of best practice 
across our companies and make 
recommendations to achieve an 
honest, reliable and trusted relationship 
with both our customers and suppliers.
Customers
across the g roup customer satisfaction 
is monitored and analysed in a number 
of ways, including considered responses 
to complaints, readership surveys, 
customer interviews and other 
processes to ensure we receive timely 
and relevant feedback from our 
customers.
there are also a number of standard-
setting bodies that have established 
codes to which dmgt ’s consumer 
media division adheres including that 
of the press Complaints Commission 
and the Code of practice of 
n ewspaper and magazine publishing. 
suppliers
aware of the responsibilities we have 
along the supply chain, we aim to work 
with organisations that share our 
principles and aspirations. in particular 
for newsprint, our largest purchase, we 
continually review the environmental 
credentials of our suppliers and the 
sourcing of their products. We source 
our paper mainly from european mills, 
all of which hold the environmental 
management standard iso 14001. 
Where virgin fibres are used in paper 
manufacture, we require that the forests 
are certified either by the f orest 
stewardship Council or the pan 
european f orestry Commission, which 
run schemes that provide credible 
guarantees that the product comes 
from well managed forests. 
o ur non-print businesses also have 
supplier policies. a&n media aims to 
acquire goods and services from 
reputable companies with a sound 
financial and ethical background, 
ensuring where possible goods are 
obtained from sustainable sources. 
l andmark’s policy states its belief in 
sourcing goods and services from 
suppliers which operate in an  
ethical way. 
the international Contemporary 
f urniture f air, part of dmg events, 
coordinates the donation of surplus 
exhibitor product to f urnish a f uture, 
providing formerly homeless families 
leaving city shelters with furniture and 
household goods, and in the tradition of 
the daily mail’s “banish the bags”, the 
f olkestone herald’s “pack it in” 
campaign has encouraged local 
businesses to recycle plastic waste, 
including shrink wrap and polythene.
employees
as an equal opportunities employer we 
believe, it is important for our staff to 
feel a connection between their values 
and their work, so we strive to create an 
inspiring, healthy and inclusive work 
environment. 
each autonomous business has its  
own policies and employee initiatives, 
such as l andmark’s travel plan which 
has already seen a significant rise in 
car-sharing and cycling among staff.  
at rms in l ondon all staff travel to work 
by public transport, cycle or on foot; 
and dmg events in its san f rancisco 
office has introduced transportation 
credits for employees using public 
transport and a six month trial to allow 
staff to work from home up to two days 
a week to reduce the time, cost and 
impact of commuting.
g roup-wide we carried out our first 
employment survey during the year, 
which will help us improve employment 
practices. We launched a fully 
interactive global intranet, dmgt 
Connect, with a specific section 
devoted to our Cr activities. We also 
invest heavily in training and helping 
our staff develop fulfilled careers with 
us. a variety of approaches to staff 
communications exist within the g roup: 
in addition to dmgt Connect, we have 
numerous intranets within each 
business; our Chief executive writes a 
monthly blog; there are regular 
communication events and briefings, as 
well as face-to-face meetings and 
programmes related to specific key 
events (such as major changes in 
operations or equipment). daily mail and general trust plC

encouragement to families wanting to 
make a positive change to their lives. in 
its 15 years, f amily f riends has assisted 
over 400 families. 
dmgt is also committed to helping 
initiatives around the g roup, donating 
money to charities where its businesses 
are involved. by the end of the current 
year, awards had been committed to 
build Change through rms , the water 
and sanitation project in Kechene, 
ethiopia (described above) through 
euromoney and two charities through 
a&n media, the Journalism diversity 
f und and Catch 22.
sustainability
at the heart of our corporate 
responsibility approach is 
sustainability. We know that to be a 
successful business requires not only 
achieving on the conventional 
measures, but doing so while 
operating in a wholly socially 
responsible way. 
the issues surrounding sustainability 
offer our businesses opportunities, 
aligning our interests with those of 
society as a whole. We are 
continually investigating how to 
employ more sustainable practices.
o ur objective is to contribute more 
to society, take less from the 
environment and still improve our 
prospects as a business. We are 
determined to make a positive 
social impact with our various 
stakeholders as well as the 
community at large.
n orthcliffe’s bristol n ews and media 
raised £17,000 – topped up by dmgt to 
£20,000, double the target – for the 
prince’s trust’s enterprise project with a 
team of 10 volunteers from the 
newspaper, while the publisher’s 
flagship paper, the bristol evening post 
was praised in parliament after it 
secured 100 apprenticeships with 100 
local businesses.
euromoney, following its successful 
establishment of an eye hospital in 
o rissa, india, has a new charity project 
selected from employee suggestions 
and ultimately voted on by them – a 
water and sanitation project in 
Kechene, ethiopia. some £250,000-
£300,000 will be contributed from the 
company’s charity budget, clients and 
staff fundraising.
in January, dmgt ‘s head office staff 
chose three charities to support through 
f ocus : Kensington & Chelsea. the 
charities were nova n ew 
o pportunities, f ull of l ife and f amily 
f riends. these charities all support 
disadvantaged young people in the 
borough of Kensington and Chelsea 
where our head office is based.
nova concentrates on training those 
who have missed out on learning new 
technologies and helps them into work 
and further training. it runs classes in 
numeracy, literacy and english 
language, as well as helping with Cvs 
and preparing for job applications. 
many of nova ’s clients are mothers 
returning to work and over 22% are  
lone parents. 
f ull of l ife was set up by parents of 
disabled children in Kensington and 
Chelsea, to provide after-school and 
holiday activities for their children, as 
well as support and advice to families 
and to lobby for improved services  
for them.

direCtors’ report 
newspaper divisions and certain senior 
executives. r eported earnings may be 
adversely affected by changes in our 
pension costs and funding requirements 
due to lower than expected investment 
returns, changes in bond yields and 
changes in demographics, particularly 
longer life expectancy. a funding 
approach and a revised asset 
allocation strategy, designed to reduce 
and diversify the risk inherent in the 
investment portfolios have been 
agreed and implemented and a risk 
management working group has been 
established to consider all aspects of 
financial risk and potential solutions.  
the schemes remain neutral in cash flow 
terms and so do not currently need to 
sell assets. the next triennial valuation of 
the schemes, as at 31st march, 2010, will 
be completed by June 2011.
impaCt of a ma Jor disaster or 
outbrea K of disease
any disaster, such as a geopolitical 
event or outbreak of disease which 
significantly affects the wider 
environment or the infrastructure in an 
area where we have material 
operations, could adversely affect the 
g roup. the importance of travel to many 
of our event businesses was highlighted 
when during the year the eruption of the 
eyjafjallajökull volcano in iceland 
grounded all european and some 
international air travel. although business 
continuity plans and procedures are in 
place to mitigate the impact of ‘disaster’ 
risks, a terrorist attack, a major fire or 
pandemic might affect our ability to 
deliver products, reduce the demand 
for them or increase our cost base.
r elian Ce on Key management 
and staff retention
We employ successful and talented 
management and staff across all of our 
businesses. although we cannot predict 
with certainty that we will enjoy 
continued success in our recruitment 
and retention of high quality 
management and creative talent, our 
g roup human resources director works 
with divisional and executive 
management across the g roup on a 
formal approach to talent 
management and succession planning. 
this includes payment of competitive 
rewards, employee performance and 
turnover monitoring and a variety of 
approaches to staff communication.
downturn in the global economy in the 
past two years, although in recent 
months we have seen some recovery, 
especially in our uK national newspaper 
titles. a similar, although reduced, 
effect has been seen in our businesses 
that rely on non-advertising revenues in 
the financial and property markets. a 
‘double dip’ recession gives rise to a risk 
of not achieving the g roup’s forecast 
results. o ur experience in the past two 
years has demonstrated how our 
long-term strategy of diversifying the 
g roup’s portfolio, into business 
information and subscription revenue 
streams, along with investment in strong 
brands, puts us in a robust position both 
now or if growth slows or falls in the 
future. f urther, management of costs 
over the last two years has reduced the 
g roup’s cost base.
the impaCt of te Chnologi Cal 
and mar Ket Changes on our 
Competitive advantage
o ur businesses operate in highly 
competitive environments that can be 
subject to rapid change. o ur products 
and services, and their means of 
delivery, are affected by technological 
innovations, competitor activity and 
changing customer behaviour. this has 
been seen most obviously in our regional 
newspapers which have seen revenues, 
especially in classified advertising, 
migrate to online portals.
all of our businesses are alert to market 
changes and emerging technologies 
that could disrupt their products and 
brands. the autonomous culture of the 
g roup encourages an entrepreneurial 
approach to the development of new 
opportunities in response to these threats 
and we continue to invest and adapt to 
remain competitive. o ur strategy of 
diversification and willingness to take a 
long-term view helps us to react to these 
challenges and opportunities when they 
arise. in particular we have developed 
an internet strategy for each of our main 
segments of advertising revenue and, as 
such, our print and online businesses are 
working closely together to maximise  
the synergies that exist between these 
two formats.
pension s Cheme shortfalls
although closed to new employees in 
2009, we continue to operate defined 
benefit pension schemes for our 
the directors present their r eport and 
accounts for the year ended 3rd 
o ctober, 2010.
aCtivities
the principal activities of the g roup are 
set out on pages 14 and 15 of this 
annual r eport.
the analysis of turnover and operating 
profit for the years ended 3rd o ctober, 
2010 and 4th o ctober, 2009 are 
included as n ote 3 to the Consolidated 
income statement.
business r evieW
the information that fulfils the 
Companies act requirements of the 
business review is included in the 
business r eview on pages 4 to 33. this 
includes a review of the development 
of the business of the g roup during the 
year, of its position at the end of the 
year and of likely future developments 
in its business. details of the principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the g roup 
are set out below.
prin Cipal ris Ks and un Certainties
the principal risks and uncertainties the 
g roup faces vary across the different 
businesses and are the focus of the r isk 
Committee. these risks are identified in 
the dmgt g roup r isk r egister. the 
materiality of each risk is assessed 
against a framework to determine  
its significance and likelihood of 
occurrence. the r isk r egister is used to 
determine the agenda and activity of 
the r isk Committee. the most material 
risks identified in the r isk r egister, 
together with the steps taken to 
mitigate them, are described below. 
the operation of the r isk Committee  
is described on pages 44 and 45.
the geographic spread and diverse 
portfolio of businesses within the g roup 
help to dilute the impact of some of the 
g roup’s key risks. Certain of these risks 
are interdependent and should not be 
considered in isolation.
exposure to Changes in the 
eConomy and Customer 
spending patterns
a significant (although decreasing) 
proportion of our revenue is derived 
from advertising, largely from the uK 
newspaper division, a&n media. this 
revenue was heavily affected by the  39

 finanCial statements 
 shareholder information 
fluctuations impacting on the g roup’s 
reported earnings, liquidity risk, interest 
rate risk and debt levels. in addition  
the treasury function within dmgt 
undertakes high value transactions and 
therefore there is inherently a risk of 
treasury fraud or error. the policies and 
procedures in place to manage these 
risks are discussed in the f inancial and 
treasury review on page 32.
tax ris K
o ur operations are global and therefore 
our earnings are subject to taxation at 
differing rates across a number of 
jurisdictions. Whilst we endeavour to 
manage our tax affairs in an efficient 
manner, due to an ever more complex 
international tax environment there will 
always be a level of uncertainty when 
provisioning for our tax liabilities. there is 
also a risk that changing tax laws would 
have an adverse effect on our financial 
results. Working with divisional 
management and external experts we 
have a team of in-house specialists who 
review all tax arrangements within the 
g roup and keep abreast of changing 
legislation.
f or Ward-loo King statements
this annual r eport contains certain 
forward-looking statements with respect 
to the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the g roup. by their nature, these 
statements involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to events and 
depend on circumstances that may or 
may not occur in the future. there are a 
number of factors that could cause 
actual results or developments to differ 
materially from those expressed or 
implied by these forward-looking 
statements. n o assurances can be given 
that the forward-looking statements are 
reasonable as they can be affected by 
a wide range of variables. the forward-
looking statements reflect the 
knowledge and information available 
at the date of preparation of this annual 
r eport, and will not be updated during 
the year. n othing in this annual r eport 
should be construed as a profit forecast.
r esults and dividends
the profit after taxation of the g roup 
amounted to £219 million. after 
charging minority interests of £19 million, 
the g roup profit for the year amounted 
to £200 million.
dedicated project management teams 
are used to manage the risk in any 
development or change project and 
business continuity plans are in place 
and are regularly tested in each division 
to protect existing systems.
information se Curity
information security continues to be an 
important issue for all businesses across 
the g roup. l osses of data in the past 
have highlighted the importance of 
information security. o ur divisions 
manage information security risks 
locally with support and oversight from 
the r isk Committee on areas such as 
policy, training and technology. any 
future breach in our data security could 
have a harmful impact on our business 
and reputation.
l egal and regulatory
o ur businesses are subject to varying 
legislation and regulation in the 
jurisdictions in which we operate.  
these typically cover such areas as: 
competition; data protection; privacy; 
health and safety; and employment 
law. the recently enacted uK bribery 
act (which comes into force in april 
2011) is notable as having multi-
jurisdictional reach i.e. all of our 
businesses across the globe are 
required to comply. it also extends 
beyond the g roup’s direct subsidiaries, 
covering associates, joint ventures and 
sales agents. additionally we are party 
to more specific regulations such as 
from the o ffice of f air trading and the 
audit bureau of Circulation.
We take compliance with laws and 
regulations seriously throughout the 
g roup. o ur dmgt Code of Conduct 
(and supporting policies) sets 
appropriate standards of business 
behaviour and highlights the key legal 
and regulatory issues affecting our 
businesses and is available to all staff. 
training and further guidance is 
provided where necessary. Controls are 
also in place surrounding compliance 
with the audit bureau of Circulation’s 
regulations and other regulatory bodies 
to which we adhere.
treasury ris K
there are a number of risks arising from 
the g roup’s treasury operations 
including currency exchange rate 
Commer Cial r elationships 
inCluding volatility of ne Wsprint
We are reliant on a number of 
commercial relationships with key 
suppliers and third parties. a significant 
change to the commercial terms under 
which we trade, or the loss of any of 
these key relationships, could have a 
material impact on the g roup’s results. 
in response to this, significant time and 
resources are committed to developing 
these relationships to ensure they 
continue to operate satisfactorily.
an example of this is newsprint which 
represents a significant proportion of 
our costs. n ewsprint prices are subject 
to volatility arising from variations in 
supply and demand. the g roup’s 
newsprint requirements are managed 
by a dedicated newsprint buying team 
and monitored by the board of 
harmsworth printing. Where possible, 
long-term arrangements are agreed 
with suppliers to limit the potential  
for volatility.
aCQuisition and disposal ris K
as well as launching and building new 
businesses, an integral part of our 
success has, and will continue to be, 
the acquisition of businesses that 
complement our existing products or 
expand the scope of our expertise.  
a number of risks are inherent within 
any strategy to acquire. the majority of 
acquisitions are in related markets and 
are smaller businesses with a high 
potential for growth. this reduces the 
size of the risk of each acquisition to  
the g roup.
there are risks to our ability to achieve 
optimal value from disposals including 
the incorrect timing of any sale, the 
inability to identify and agree a deal 
with a purchaser, the unsuccessful 
separation of a business and 
management of any related costs, as 
well as the failure to realise any other 
anticipated benefits of a disposal.
r elian Ce on it infrastru Cture
all of our businesses are dependent on 
technology to some degree, either 
through internal systems or software 
products. disruption to our information 
technology infrastructure or failure to 
implement new products systems 
effectively could result in lost revenue 
and damage our reputation.  daily mail and general trust plC

dire Ctors’ responsibilities 
statement
the directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual r eport and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the 
g roup financial statements in 
accordance with international 
f inancial r eporting standards (ifrs s) as 
adopted by the european union and 
article 4 of the ias r egulation and have 
elected to prepare the parent 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with united Kingdom 
g enerally accepted accounting 
practice (united Kingdom accounting 
standards and applicable law). under 
Company law the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
the Company also purchased 2,862,747 
‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting shares for 
holding in treasury, having a nominal 
value of £357,843 in order to match 
obligations under various incentive 
plans. the consideration paid for  
these shares was £12.3 million. shares 
purchased during the year represented 
0.77% of the called up ‘a’ o rdinary 
n on-voting share capital at  
3rd o ctober, 2010.
f ull details of the Company’s share 
capital are given in n ote 36.
employees
under the g roup’s general policy of 
decentralised management, it is the 
responsibility of the management in 
each subsidiary to encourage the 
involvement and participation of 
employees in their company. the 
methods used vary company by 
company, but the linking to 
performance targets of a significant 
portion of remuneration is one widely 
used means.
the g roup gives full and fair 
consideration to suitable applications 
from disabled persons for employment. 
if existing employees become disabled 
they will continue to be employed, 
wherever practicable, in the same job 
or, if this is not practicable, every effort 
will be made to find suitable alternative 
employment and to provide 
appropriate training.
poli Cy on payment of suppliers
the g roup’s policy on supplier 
payments varies across its subsidiaries. 
these companies have no formal code 
or standard which deals specifically 
with the payment of suppliers. however, 
their policy is to ensure that the terms of 
payment, as specified by, and agreed 
with the supplier at the outset, are  
not exceeded.
the Company had no trade creditors  
at the year end date.
the g roup’s average payment period, 
calculated on the basis of year end 
trade creditors, is 66 days (2009  
66 days), although this is dependent  
on the year end date and cannot 
therefore be regarded as meaningful.
an interim dividend of 5.0 pence per 
share was paid on the o rdinary and ‘a’ 
o rdinary n on-voting shares and the 
directors recommend that a final 
dividend of 11.0 pence per share be 
paid on 11th f ebruary, 2011 making  
16.0 pence per share for the year  
(2009 14.7 pence).

included on the Company’s website. 
l egislation in the united Kingdom 
governing the preparation and

may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
r esponsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared  
in accordance with international 
f inancial r eporting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and  
profit or loss of the Company and  
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the business r eview, which is 
incorporated into the directors’

development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks  
and uncertainties that they face.
auditors
each of the persons who is a director at 
the date of approval of this annual 
r eport confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of 
which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps 
that he ought to have taken as a 
director in order to make himself 
aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
this confirmation is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of s418 of the Companies  
act 2006.
the Company’s auditors, deloitte llp , 
have indicated their willingness to 
continue in office and, in accordance 
with section 489 of the Companies act 
2006, a resolution proposing their 
reappointment will be put to the  
annual g eneral meeting.
in preparing the parent Company 
financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• state whether applicable uK 
accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
in preparing the g roup financial 
statements, international accounting 
standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply 
accounting policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in ifrs s are insufficient 
to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the 
Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
the directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies act 2006. they are 
also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud  
and other irregularities. daily mail and general trust plC

uk/corporate governance.
the board met six times during the 
2009/10 financial year, which were 
attended by all directors, except that 
messrs f allon, dunstone and balsemão 
were each unable to attend one of 
them. individual attendance by 
directors is set out on page 43.
the division of responsibilities between 
the executive Chairman and the Chief 
executive is understood and works well. 
the Chairman’s role is to lead the board 
and oversee the Company’s operations 
and strategy. the Chief executive’s role 
is to manage the Company, develop 
strategy and ensure its successful 
implementation.
the board normally meets regularly five 
times a year and at such other times as 
are necessary. it discusses and 
the b oard
the Company is headed by a board 
which comprises a balance of seven 
executive directors, including the 
Chairman and Chief executive,  
and seven non-executive directors. 
biographical details of each of the 
directors are set out on page 37.  
the board has been progressively 
refreshed in recent years with several 
appointments, including four new 
independent directors.
the Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. the paragraphs below and in the r emuneration 
r eport on pages 47 to 62 describe how the board has applied the principles set out in the Combined Code (‘the Code’) 
issued by the f inancial services authority in June 2008. the Code is part of the l isting r ules and applied to the Company 
throughout the year.
in may, the f inancial r eporting Council revised the Code, publishing the uK Corporate g overnance Code (‘the r evised 
Code’). the r evised Code is not applicable to the Company in the year under review, but the Company has begun the 
process of reviewing its procedures to enable the board to report, as required, under the r evised Code in the year beginning 
4th o ctober, 2010.
the Company has substantially complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the year, except where the board has 
determined that they are inappropriate to the particular circumstances of the Company. the areas in which the Company

(without the Chairman being present).
a3.2 Composition 
of the board
l ess than half of the board are independent non-executive directors.
a3.3 Composition 
of the board

Committee
independent non-executive directors do not comprise a majority of the 
Committee’s members since mr balsemão is the only independent non-

mr hemingway is a non-executive director who has served for more than nine 
years but was not subject to annual re-election.
the board did not adopt the provision in the Code that non-executive directors 
who have served for more than nine years should be subject to annual 
re-election on the grounds that its practice complied with Company law and 
with the articles and worked well. it has decided, however, to adopt the 
provision in the r evised Code that all directors should seek annual re-election 
at the forthcoming annual g eneral meeting.
b 1.6 service contracts and  
compensation
the service contracts of messrs morgan and dacre exceed the one year

eleCtion and re-ele Ction
the Company’s new articles of 
association, adopted in f ebruary 2010, 
require that a director appointed by 
the board must stand for election at  
the next annual g eneral meeting. 
thereafter all directors are subject to  
re-election at least every three years. 
the board has decided, however, to 
adopt the provision in the r evised  
Code that all directors should seek 
annual re-election.
the terms and conditions of 
appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection at 
the r egistered o ffice of the Company 
during usual business hours.
b oard evaluation
the board has undertaken its annual 
evaluation of its own performance and 
that of its individual directors. it reviewed 
its performance by reference to the 
schedule of matters reserved for it. the 
evaluation process took the form of a 
questionnaire sent to each director, 
seeking their views on progress made 
on vision and strategy; the handling of 
strategy by the board; the structure of 
board meetings, quality of papers and 
communications; areas of operations 
presented; balance of skills; 
consideration of directors’ views; and 
solicited other comments. the 
Chairman reported the consensus view 
on performance to the board at its 
meeting in september, enabling it to 
conclude that it had been effective in 
the year under review. n o changes to 
procedures were judged necessary.
b oard Committees
the board has established n ominations, 
r emuneration, audit, r isk and 
Corporate social r esponsibility 
Committees with mandates to deal  
with specific aspects of its business.  
the remits of these committees are 
published on the Company’s website  
at www.dmgt.co.uk. details of the 
membership of these committees are 
given on pages 43 to 45. each 
committee reports to the board at 
every regular meeting. in september, 
the board carried out a review of the 
performance of its committees and 
concluded that they had been 
effective in the year.

the board believes that four non-
executive directors may be considered 
to be independent under the Code, 
namely messrs dunstone, balsemão, 
verey and berry.
messrs hemingway and g illespie are 
not regarded by the board as 
independent under the Code because 
they have advised the Company over 
many years; nor is mr n elson because 
he is an advisor to the Chairman. 
n evertheless, the board believes that 
these non-executive directors make  
an important contribution to its 
deliberations and have invaluable 
experience of the Company, its business 
and its staff.
information and professional 
development
procedures have been established to 
ensure that the board receives timely 
and appropriate information both for its 
meetings and regularly between 
meetings. all directors are offered such 
training as is considered necessary, 
both on appointment and at any 
subsequent time. there is an agreed 
procedure for directors to take 
independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, if necessary.

information systems operated across 
the g roup. this is supported by a 
framework of budgets that are 
approved at a divisional level by the 
investment and f inance Committee. 
variance analysis of actual results 
versus budget and forecast is 
undertaken regularly throughout  
the year.
the g roup now maintains a detailed 
accounting and treasury manual and 
guidance is issued from the centre. 
Where applicable, divisions maintain 
their own manuals.  
in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control, the board  
has considered material controls 
(including those undertaken through  
its committees), including financial, 
operational and compliance controls 
and risk management systems as 
follows: the central r isk and assurance 
function carries out internal audit 
activities across the g roup. it operates 
under an internal audit charter which 
covers: the purposes and objectives of 
the g roup’s internal audit function; its 
authority and scope; independence 
issues; standards of professional 
practice, performance monitoring, 
planning and reporting. the 
department also co-ordinates with a 
number of the divisions who undertake 
control reviews on companies within 
their divisions. f ollowing each review,  
a formal report is issued to divisional 
management with the audit findings 
and management’s response. at each 
audit Committee meeting, the head of 
r isk and assurance, mr ashby, reports 
on the internal audit activity across the 
g roup, including progress against 
completion of the annual assurance 
plan and a summary of the findings  
of assurance reviews undertaken.
r isK Committee
the r isk Committee gives the board 
assurance on risk management issues 
and processes. the process for the 
management of significant risks is 
undertaken by the r isk Committee and 
it accords with the turnbull g uidance 
on internal control, appended to the 
Code. o ver the course of the past year 
the r isk Committee has considered the 
key risks pertaining to all divisions and 
head office functions within the 
business as well as the key risks which 
affect the g roup, including fraud risk.
internal Controls and 
management of ris K
the board has overall responsibility for 
the g roup’s system of internal control. 
this system is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance of the 
safeguarding of assets and 
shareholders’ investment and the 
reliability of financial information.  
any such system can, however, provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance of these matters. the 
directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the 
g roup’s system of internal control for 
the period up to the date of the 
approval of the accounts. the board 
has not identified any significant failings 
or weaknesses during this review.
the g roup adopts a prudent risk 
strategy, weighing opportunities for 
potential gain against threats to overall 
business objectives and profitability. 
senior management addresses the 
opportunities and uncertainties relating 
to the business activities of the g roup. 
the risk management process consists 
of the identification, evaluation and 
control of risks, which could threaten 
the achievement of the g roup’s 
strategic, operational and financial 
objectives, as well as the active 
management of opportunities. the 
processes described below were in 
place throughout the year.
the g roup operates on a divisional 
basis with each of the divisions 
described on pages 14 and 15 of the 
annual r eport having considerable 
autonomy as regards its operation and 
establishment of control systems. 
o verseeing the divisional structure is  
a central management responsible  
to the board. Certain functions are 
undertaken centrally, notably newsprint 
buying, insurance, treasury, tax, 
pensions, and risk and assurance 
(including internal audit).
o perating businesses within the g roup 
are required to confirm annually their 
compliance with g roup accounting 
policies and financial reporting 
guidelines.
divisional and subsidiary company 
boards regularly review relevant and 
timely financial information that is 
produced from the management 
the Committee reviews the structure, 
size and composition of the board and 
makes recommendations to the board 
on any changes. during the year it 
nominated mr daintith to succeed to  
mr Williams as f inance director in 
march 2011, following the decision of  
mr Williams to retire in 2011. the 
Committee determined, from his 
experience as Chief o perating o fficer 
and Chief f inancial o fficer (Cfo ) of 
dow Jones based in n ew york from april 
2008 and previously as Cfo of n ews 
international that mr daintith was a top 
class executive with extensive consumer 
and business-to-business experience 
and hence has the right balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience, 
needed for the board. external advice 
was taken, but advertising was not 
required in this instance.
the Committee continued to review 
succession planning for both executive 
and non-executive directors. it also 
assessed the most appropriate method 
of evaluating directors’ performance 
which was by board questionnaire.
r elations With shareholders
the Company maintains a regular 
programme of contact with its 
institutional shareholders. in the past 
year, this has included meetings in 
l ondon, scotland, spain, switzerland, 
g ermany and the usa .
n on-executive directors are kept 
informed of the views of institutional 
shareholders by the regular distribution 
of analysts’ reports and feedback is 
provided from institutional meetings.
all shareholders are welcome to attend 
the annual g eneral meeting, of which 
20 working days’ notice is given, where 
they have the opportunity to speak  
to directors.
in the interests of transparency and  
to assist private shareholders, the 
Company posts all announcements 
and general presentations given to 
analysts and institutions on its corporate 
website. shareholders and others 
interested in the g roup are encouraged 
to use the site and to email questions 
which they might have to investor.

accounting policies and reviews a 
summary of recommendation letters  
to management prepared by the 
g roup’s external auditors following  
their audit procedures.
the Committee comprises four non-
executive directors: messrs verey, its 
chairman, hemingway, berry and 
n elson. the Code recommends that an 
audit committee should comprise at 
least three members, all of whom 
should be independent non-executive

are considered to be independent 
under the Code. n evertheless, the 
board believes that the Committee 
operates independently. members’

satisfied that mr n elson, senior partner 
of a firm of chartered accountants,  
and mr verey, the Committee 
chairman, have recent and relevant 
financial experience. the Company

the Committee has implemented the 
procedures set out in the smith 
g uidance to the Code which are within 
its control. it reviews the g roup’s policy 
on whistle blowing.
in addition, the Committee has primary 
responsibility for making a 
recommendation to the board on the 
appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditors, 
together with approval of their 
bribery act, exposure to public sector 
spending cuts; health and safety, fraud, 
information security; and again on 
business continuity and disaster 
recovery planning. in addition, the 
Committee aimed at ensuring that the 
business conduct of its employees is 
appropriate to, and in accordance 
with, the g roup’s values and ethics. the 
Committee also monitors developments 
in relevant legislation and regulations to 
consider the impact these might have 
on the g roup and on its system of 
internal control.
members of the r isk Committee also 
maintain direct links with each of the 
main divisions through attendance at 
divisional board meetings as directors 
of these boards. the Committee reports 
to the board after each of its meetings 
to assist the board in its determination of 
the overall effectiveness of the system 
of internal control and risk 
management more widely.
audit Committee
the audit Committee, on behalf of the 
board, has responsibility for the review 
of financial risk management and of 
internal financial controls, as these 
directly relate to the quality of financial 
reporting. in addition, the Committee is 
mandated to:
• review all public financial statements 
of the Company and of the g roup, 
including the half year and annual 
financial statements, before such 
statements are submitted to  
the board;
• consider any appointment of 
external auditors to g roup 
companies, to review audit fees and 
to consider any questions of 
resignation or dismissal of auditors;
• monitor and review the resources 
and effectiveness of internal audit 
(including approval of the 
appointment and removal of the 
head of assurance);
• agree the internal audit programme 
for the forthcoming year; and
• to consider a summary of g roup 
internal audit reports and such 
individual reports as the Committee 
sees fit and management’s response 
to any recommendations, and to 
monitor the progress of any  
required actions.
the Committee comprises messrs 
morgan, its chairman, Williams, dutton, 
verey, Kass, the legal director of a&n 
media and mr page, its deputy finance 
director and former secretary to the 
Committee. mr page became a 
member in september. mr verey

the r isk Committee considers risk 
registers prepared by each of the 
divisions of the g roup and by central 
functions, on a rotational basis, in 
general reviewing a division and  
central function at each meeting. these

3rd december, 2010
procedures exist to monitor the 
independence of the external auditors 
and include a policy on employment of 
former audit principals. there is also a 
policy on the provision of non-audit 
services with which the g roup’s head 
office and each division complies. the 
choice of firm is normally determined 
on the basis of professional expertise 
and competitiveness. the g roup may 
engage the external auditors to 
perform audit-related work, 
accountancy advice and corporate 
tax services. n on-audit services in other 
areas are decided on their merits and 
are put out to tender where the 
amounts in question are significant. the 
external auditors are excluded from the 
following areas: where they are 
auditing their own work; where a 
mutuality of interest is created; or where 
the external auditor would be put in the 
role of advocate for the Company.
n on-audit fees payable to deloitte llp 
in 2009/10 amounted to £1.2 million, 
compared to £2.3 million the previous 
year. this reduction reflected the 
conclusion of their involvement in the 
restructuring of n orthcliffe media.
during the year, the Committee 
received reports from management on 
the status of the finance systems within 
a&n media, ongoing concern and on 
developments in international financial 
reporting standards.
the Committee also reviewed the 
annual internal audit plan, summaries 
of reports received and reviewed the 
effectiveness and resources of the 
g roup’s internal audit function. in 
september, it carried out an annual 
review of its terms of reference and of its 
effectiveness and concluded that it did 
not need to recommend to the board 
any substantive changes to its remit or 
operations. in september, the board 
conducted its own review of the 
Committee’s performance and 
confirmed that the Committee had 
fulfilled its obligations and been 
effective in the year under review.
remuneration. as part of its role in 
ensuring the effectiveness of the audit 
process, the Committee also 
undertakes an annual assessment of 
the qualifications, expertise and 
resources of the external auditors.
the appointment of deloitte llp as the 
g roup’s external auditors (incumbents 
since the last audit tender in 2001) is 
kept under annual review, and, if 
satisfactory, the Committee will 
recommend the reappointment of the 
audit firm. the appointment of deloitte 
followed a formal tender process 
undertaken in 2001 and, rather than 
adopting a policy on tendering 
frequency, the annual review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit is 
supplemented by a periodic 
comprehensive reassessment by the 
Committee. the last such reassessment 
was performed in 2008/09, as with many 
suppliers, when having received 
assurances on the continued quality of 
the audit, the Committee determined 
to recommend the reappointment of 
the incumbent firm. as the appointment 
of the auditors is for one year only, 
being subject to annual approval at the 
Company’s agm , there is no 
contractual commitment to the current 
audit firm and, as such, the Committee 
may undertake an audit tender at any 
time at its discretion.
in performing its review, the Committee 
evaluated the adequacy of the audit 
firm’s key processes and controls in 
certain key areas including, but not 
limited to:
• arrangements for ensuring 
independence and objectivity, 
including the rotation of key  
audit partners;
• appropriateness of the planned 
audit scope and its execution;
• the robustness and perceptiveness  
of the auditors in their handling of 
the key accounting and audit 
judgments; and
• the quality of their reporting. 47
remuneration report
this report has been prepared in 
accordance with the relevant 
requirements of the l arge and medium-
sized Companies and g roups 
(accounts and r eports) r egulations 
2008 and of the l isting r ules of the 
f inancial services authority. as required 
by the r egulations, a resolution to 
approve the report will be proposed at 
the Company’s agm .
the r emuneration Committee
the r emuneration Committee, which 
was established in 1992, is responsible 
inter alia for overall g roup remuneration 
policy and for setting the remuneration, 
benefits and terms and conditions of 
employment of the Company’s 
executive directors and other senior 
executives. the Committee’s terms of 
reference are available on the 
Company’s website.
the members of the Committee are the 
v iscount r othermere, its chairman, mr 
berry and mr n elson. the Combined 
Code (‘the Code’) recommends that a 
remuneration committee should be 
composed entirely of independent 
non-executive directors. the board 
considers it appropriate that the 
v iscount r othermere, as Chairman of 
the board and as the Company’s 
largest shareholder, is a member of the 
Committee. he always leaves meetings 
in advance of any discussion of his own 
remuneration. While mr n elson is not 
considered to be independent under 
the Code, the board does consider him 
to act independently as regards 
remuneration issues.
the Committee met seven times during 
the year, four of which were regular 
meetings. all meetings were attended 
by all serving members, except that the 
v iscount r othermere did not attend 
any part of one meeting, when matters 
affecting his own remuneration were 
discussed. individual attendance by 
members is set out below:

the f inance director, mr Williams, is 
secretary to the Committee.
the Committee seeks the 
recommendations of the Chief 
executive, who usually attends 
meetings of the Committee by invitation 
other than when his own remuneration 
is being discussed, as regards the 
remuneration of the other executive 
directors and of other senior executives. 
it also seeks input from the f inance 
director regarding financial 
performance and other issues,  
from the hr director and from the 
Company secretary.
the Committee makes reference, where 
appropriate, to pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the g roup, 
especially when determining annual 
salary increases, and to external 
evidence of remuneration levels in 
other companies, particularly in the 
media field. it also makes reference to 
advice sought from external advisors. 
during the year such advice was 
received from mm&K, who provided 
market data and gave advice on best 
practice. mm&K were appointed by  
the Committee. mm&K also provided 
the Company with advice on share 
schemes and other remuneration 
matters.
in september, the Committee 
conducted a formal review of its 
effectiveness and concluded that it 
had fulfilled its remit and been effective 
in the year.
r emuneration poli Cy –  
exeCutive dire Ctors
the Committee seeks to structure 
remuneration packages on an 
individual basis appropriate to the level 
of responsibility, but generally designed 
to motivate and retain the individual.
the Company encourages directors to 
own shares in the Company and 
executive directors have a target of a 
minimum shareholding of 1.5 times their 
salary, to be built up over a suitable 
period. the design of the incentive 
plans encourages executive directors 
to achieve this goal which aligns their 
interests with those of shareholders.
the Committee considers that a 
successful remuneration policy needs to 
be sufficiently flexible to take account 
of commercial demands, changing 
market practice and shareholder 
expectations. o rdinary shareholders will 
be provided with the opportunity to 
endorse the Company’s remuneration 
policy on a regular basis through the 
annual vote on the r emuneration 
r eport.
a significant proportion of each 
executive director’s remuneration is 
performance-related. the main 
components of the remuneration 
package for executive directors are:
i. basic fees and salary;
ii. annual performance-related 
bonuses;
iii. l ong-term performance-related 
incentive arrangements – through 
membership of the g roup’s ltip ;
iv. share options – grants are no longer 
made, other than in exceptional 
circumstances such as the 
recruitment or retention of a key 
executive;
v. pension entitlements/cash 
allowances – in lieu of pension 
allowances under the dmgt s enior 
executives pension f und (‘sepf’) 
and;
vi.  o ther benefits, i.e. benefits in kind, 
expense reimbursement, etc.
in setting the remuneration of the 
executive directors other than mr 
f allon, the Committee is cognisant of 
the remuneration increases being given 
around the g roup.
the Chairman’s substantial 
shareholding in the Company provides 
an alignment with long-term 
shareholders that is not always the case 
in other companies. Consequently, as 
explained in last year’s report, in 2009 
the Committee, without the v iscount 
r othermere present, decided that with 
effect from 1st o ctober, 2009, the 
Chairman would not receive any future 
ltip awards, but as partial 
compensation would be entitled to a 
maximum annual cash bonus of 50% 
salary, and a deferred annual bonus

remuneration report Continued
shares and cash. the Committee 
believes this approach is both simple 
and transparent and provides a strong 
alignment with other shareholders over 
the long term.
in the case of mr f allon, the Committee 
considers that his remuneration as 
executive chairman of euromoney, a 
separately listed company, should be 
set by the remuneration committee of 
that company. the report on this is set 
out in euromoney’s annual r eport.
the Chief executive participates in the 
dmgt e xecutive bonus scheme, with a 
maximum payment of 100% of salary 
and receives awards under the dmgt 
ltip . mr beatty is also eligible to receive 
an ltip award and participates in an 
annual bonus scheme, with a maximum 
payment of 60% of salary, based on his 
division’s results. mr Williams participates 
in a bonus scheme, with a maximum 
payment of 150% of salary for 2010/11, 
but will not receive further awards 
under the dmgt ltip . the Committee 
agreed in n ovember 2009 that ltip 
awards would be made, with 
appropriately stretching performance 
targets linked to the business strategy 
with four equally weighted measures 
– ebita, f ree Cash f low, n et debt/
ebitda and performance against the 
g roup’s strategic plan. in the case of mr 
beatty, part of his ltip performance 
target is based on his divisional 
strategic plan. the policy for future ltip 
awards is that awards will be made, 
with appropriately stretching 
performance targets linked to the 
business strategy.
paul dacre
during the year, a revised remuneration 
arrangement was put in place for mr 
dacre following his normal retirement 
age, his 60th birthday, since the g roup 
wished to encourage him to remain in 
his role. his salary is to be based on its 
level at o ctober 2008, but increased by 
the rate of inflation or 5%, whichever is 
higher. mr dacre waived any increase 
as at 1st o ctober, 2009.
this year marks the 20th anniversary of 
him editing one of the g roup’s titles. it is 
the unanimous view of the board that 
mr dacre, both as editor of the daily 
mail for 18 years and editor-in-Chief for 
12 years, has made a truly outstanding 
contribution to the success of the 
Company during this time. under his 
editorship the mail has hugely 
increased circulation and profitability. 
under his aegis, metro and mail o nline 
– both of which have been highly 
successful – were launched. he is simply 
the most impressive editor in his industry 
and the Company and its shareholders 
have benefited significantly from his 
loyalty and contribution over the past 
two decades.
the Committee has decided that it is in 
all of our stakeholders’ interests to 
recognise this contribution and to retain 
the services of mr dacre in his current 
role. accordingly the Committee has 
decided to make the following 
exceptional arrangements for mr 
dacre’s remuneration. despite being a 
board member since 1998, mr dacre 
has not participated in the executive 
bonus scheme available to other 
executive members of the board. in 
recognition of this and his loyal service, 
the Committee has approved giving 
him a one-off lifetime bonus of £1m. in 
addition, now that mr dacre has passed 
his retirement age, the board is paying 
him an additional £500,000 for each full 
year that he continues working until he 
is 65, the first of which was paid during 
the year. mr dacre, who is 62, will not 
participate in any bonus or other 
long-term incentive scheme, and will 
reduce his notice period to 12 months 
over the next two years.
the Committee recognises that these 
payments fall outside the current 
Corporate g overnance guidelines but 
believes that maintaining the services 
of mr dacre is in the best interests of the 
Company, its leading title and our 
shareholders.
o ther executive directors
mr dutton is entitled to receive an 
annual bonus, based on his 
achievements during the year.
the Committee also reviews the Chief 
executive’s recommendations for the 
remuneration packages of other senior 
executives, except those in euromoney, 
and oversees the bonus arrangements 
established in each division, including 
long-term incentive arrangements. 
these are designed individually to 
reflect the targets and objectives of 
each division.
r emuneration – non-executive 
directors
the remuneration of non-executive 
directors is determined by the board. a 
base fee is paid for board membership 
and fees are paid for membership of 
board committees ranging from £4,000 
per annum to £12,500 per annum. n o 
fee is paid for chairing a committee, 
except that the audit Committee 
chairman receives a fee of £25,000. n o 
increases were made in the year in the 
basic fee. f rom 1st o ctober, 2010 the 
fee for the r emuneration Committee 
membership was increased to £12,000 
and members of the new investment 
and f inance Committee, which 
replaces previous committees and 
subsidiary boards, receive £25,000 p.a. 
the net result is that fees will be reduced 
by £6,000 from last year in total.

iv) annual performance- 
related bonuses
the v iscount r othermere, mr morgan 
and mr Williams are members of the 
dmgt e xecutive bonus scheme (‘the 
scheme’) which was introduced in 1993 
and revised in 2006 and 2008. the 
bonus is paid in a combination of cash 
and either ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting 
shares, which must be retained for at 
least three years, or nil-cost options in 
dmgt , which cannot be exercised for at 
least three years. mr morgan and mr 
Williams may choose the proportion of 
the bonus which is to be deferred in the 
form of shares or options, but must defer 
at least 50%.
the maximum annual bonus payable  
to the v iscount r othermere is 200%  
of salary and for mr morgan and  
mr Williams 100%. f or 2009/10 the 
Committee targeted the bonus against 
a mixture of adjusted pre-tax profits and 
net debt: ebitda.
take his pension. under the terms of his 
contract, mr morgan was due to 
receive an annual housing allowance 
of £220,000 as part of his relocation 
from the usa . in f ebruary, this right was 
bought out for an additional payment 
of £880,000. mr morgan’s outstanding 
loan of £203,950 (us $316,000) from dmg 
information, made before he became 
a director, was deducted in arriving at 
a net settlement to him. the table 
above includes the allowances paid up 
to the buy out date, but not the buy out 
payments to messrs morgan and dacre.
the v iscount r othermere, mr morgan 
and mr Williams also receive a cash 
allowance instead of having a 
company car.
iii) benefits in kind
benefits in kind include the taxable 
value of company cars, fuel allowances 
and company contributions to medical 
insurance plans.
i) basic fees and salary
basic salaries are set by the Committee 
and reviewed annually. the figures for 
fees and salary for the v iscount 
r othermere and messrs morgan and 
f allon include fees as directors of 
euromoney. f or non-executive directors 
they also include Committee fees, 
where applicable.
ii) Cash allowances
annual cash allowances include an 
allowance paid to each of the v iscount 
r othermere and messrs Williams and 
beatty, in lieu of continued membership 
of the dmgt s enior executives pension 
f und. mr dacre was paid a similar 
allowance until december 2009. until 
January, he also received an allowance 
instead of the Company providing 
Central l ondon accommodation.
the allowances of mr dacre were 
bought out for a payment of £973,500 in 
January, following his purchase of a 
property in l ondon and his decision to

remuneration report Continued
commonly adopted as a measure of 
comparative performance. these 
performance conditions were chosen 
by the Committee in order to incentivise 
the executives to increase long-term 
shareholder value.
individuals were given six months to 
make commitments in order to allow for 
them to make purchases of shares, 
where appropriate. o nce an individual 
agreed to commit shares which were 
owned by him or by his close family, the 
trustee of the trust decided whether to 
make an award of an equal number of 
shares to those committed.
l ong-term performan Ce-related 
inCentive arrangements
the daily mail and g eneral trust 
l ong-term incentive plan (ltip ), 
established in 2001 and revised in 2006 
and 2008, is designed to align the 
interests of participants and 
shareholders. f urther, the ltip will only 
provide rewards for participants if the 
Company achieves exceptional returns 
for shareholders. this is achieved by 
calibrating participants’ rewards to 
stretching performance targets.
these award levels have been set to 
take account of the current 
remuneration strategy. the Committee’s 
intention is to continue to monitor 
market practice and will consider the 
appropriate targets in relation to each 
year’s awards. it will therefore ensure 
that award levels are competitive and 
motivational to the executives 
concerned and acceptable to 
shareholders. the Committee intends to 
operate the ltip annually.
the ltip is supervised by the Committee 
and is operated in conjunction with an 
employee discretionary trust (the 
‘trust’). the trust will acquire ‘a’ 
o rdinary n on-voting shares in the 
Company (‘shares’) to satisfy awards 
under the ltip or treasury shares will  
be used.
f rom 2001 to 2006/7, executives were 
invited to commit shares in the 
Company at a market price and 
receive a matching award under  
the ltip . if a participant holds the  
committed shares for five years, he  
will be eligible to receive matching 
shares on a sliding scale.
awards under the ltip are subject to 
performance conditions, which will 
determine whether, and to what extent, 
shares under awards will vest. the 
performance conditions relate to the 
tsr of the Company initially over a 
five-year period against a peer group 
of uK and overseas companies 
determined by the Committee. tsr is 
the aggregate of share price growth 
and dividends paid (assuming that such 
dividends are reinvested in shares 
during the five-year period), and is 
the g roup adjusted profit before tax for 
the year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010 
(before amortisation and impairment of 
intangible assets and exceptional items) 
was ahead of target. this resulted in a 
(profit-linked) bonus of 96.0% of salary 
being earned by the v iscount 
r othermere and of 48.0% by mr morgan 
and mr Williams. against stretching 
targets for net debt: ebitda the g roup 
has performed well, resulting in an 
incentive earned by l ord r othermere of 
100% and of 50% by messrs morgan and 
Williams of salary. this resulted in total 
bonuses of 196.0% of salary for l ord 
r othermere, a quarter of which is 
payable in cash and three quarters of 
which will be deferred into shares in the 
form of nil price options. f or mr morgan 
and mr Williams, the total bonus was 
98.0%. half of this bonus is payable in 
cash and half will be deferred into 
shares in the form of nil price options. 
the cash component of the bonus is 
shown in the table on page 49.
major progress was made in 2009/10 in 
defending the g roup’s profitability 
through the cost enhancement 
programme and in reducing the 
g roup’s indebtedness. the Committee 
believes that the bonuses fairly reflect 
these achievements.
mr beatty has a bonus based on the 
performance of his division. the 
maximum bonus he could earn is 60%  
of salary. half of this bonus is payable  
in cash and half will be deferred into 
shares in the form of nil price options. 
the cash component of this bonus is 
shown in the table on page 49.
mr dutton received a bonus, payable in 
cash, in recognition of his performance.
mr f allon is entitled to 6.49% of the 
pre-tax profit earned by euromoney, 
which has a comprehensive profit 
sharing scheme that links the pay of its 
executive directors to the profits of  
that group.
v) pension contributions
pension contributions were made  
on behalf of mr morgan in lieu of 
continued membership of the dmgt 
senior executives pension f und, as

income tax and employee national insurance contributions) which was made on 11th f ebruary at the prevailing share price of 
£4.391, and each of them retained all of the shares awarded. this gave rise to respective gains of £219,446, £62,620, £132,675 and

an award will be increased during the 
r elevant period by reference to 
dividends which would have been  
paid on those shares during the 
r elevant period.
the first Core awards were made in 
march 2008. as these Core and 
matching awards were not capable of 
vesting in full until 2014, the Committee 
also made ‘transition awards’ in 2008.
the transition awards will normally vest 
to the executives only if they are still 
employed in the Company three years 
after the award, i.e. 19th march, 2011. 
there are to be no post-grant 
performance conditions attached  
to the transition awards. transition 
awards do not benefit from any  
linked matching awards.
n o awards were made in 2008/9 
because the Committee decided to  
set a special bonus incentive instead  
in the light of the challenges faced by 
the g roup due to the very challenging 
economic environment prevailing.  
in december 2009, the Committee 
granted a core incentive award, as 
explained on page 48.
f or the march 2008 awards, no part of 
the award was to vest if eps growth was 
less than 5% p.a. compound growth. 
since the g roup’s eps for the year 
ended 3rd o ctober, 2010 was lower 
than that for the base year ended 30th 
september, 2007 these awards did not 
vest and have lapsed. 25% of the award 
of mr beatty was eps-based. o f the 
remaining 75%, which was set against 
the performance of his division for the 
three year period to 3rd o ctober,  
2010, none was achieved and so  
these awards did not vest and have 
also lapsed.
the expected value of an award of 
62.5% of salary has been calculated by 
pwC as 68% of salary using a monte 
Carlo valuation model using 
assumptions based on their historical 
analysis which do not indicate a 
forecast of management of expected 
outcomes for dmgt .
in exceptional circumstances, an initial 
grant of up to 100% of salary may be 
made, which could result in a maximum 
award after six years of 300% of salary.
illustrate performance over a 24 year 
period for which data is available.
the graphs on pages 54 and 55 are 
unaudited.
f ollowing a revision to the scheme in 
2008, ltip s awarded subsequently 
comprise either Core awards, matching 
awards or transition awards.
the normal maximum Core award to an 
executive is 62.5% of salary annually, 
and the maximum matching award is 
two times the number of shares that 
vest under the Core award.
Core awards will vest under normal 
circumstances after three years. the 
proportion of the shares that vest will 
depend for the december 2009 award 
on performance against four equally 
weighted measures – ebita, f ree Cash 
f low, n et debt/ebitda and 
performance against the strategic plan. 
in the case of mr beatty, the fourth part 
of his ltip performance target is based 
on his divisional results.
the employee would then receive 
matching awards of shares equivalent 
to 50% of the vested Core award which 
will vest at the end of three, four, five 
and six years from the date of award,  
so long as he continues to hold the 
shares in the Core award.
thus, if the participant continues to be 
employed by the Company six years 
after the award was granted, the 
employee could receive a maximum  
of shares, valued at the award date,  
of 187.5% of salary. he would have to 
wait six years to be able to receive  
this maximum.
therefore, the vesting level of both the 
Core awards and matching awards is 
determined by performance over the 
initial three year performance period. 
the vesting profile of matching awards 
is designed to achieve retention of 
executives, and encourages long-term 
shareholding.
f or executives whose main focus is on 
their division, the performance criteria 
may reflect the performance of  
their division.

g raphs
g raphs of dmgt ’s performance against 
each of its comparators for each of 
these periods are set out on page 55. 
these graphs have been plotted using 
the relative rankings of each comparator 
at the end of each month. as such, they 
are approximations to the actual 
rankings under the rules, which are 
calculated using a two month average 
for the starting point and for each 
subsequent month. this can give 
different results between the table 
above and the graphs.
the graphs on page 54 compare the 
dmgt total shareholder return with  
that of the ftse 100 index and of the 
media index over a period of five  
years, as required by the directors’ 
r emuneration r eport r egulations 2002. 
as a constituent of the ftse 100 from 
1999 to 2006 and during 2007 and  
as a constituent of the media index 
throughout the period, the directors 
regard both indices as the most 
appropriate indices for purposes of 
comparison of the g roup’s performance.

share options
1997 executive share o ption scheme: options were granted under this scheme prior to 2006. o ptions granted do not 
normally vest until three years after the award and two performance conditions have been met. the first condition is that, in 
respect of four out of six consecutive monthly calculation dates (which start in the 30th month following the date of grant of 
a particular option), the total shareholder return (tsr ) of the Company must exceed that of the ftse 100 index. s econdly, 
there must be real growth in earnings per share (‘eps’) over a period of three consecutive financial years.
the status of both performance conditions on share options outstanding during the year is as follows:

dec 03 6.08 -60% met not vested
dec 04 7.24 -59% met not vested
2006 executive share o ption scheme: under the 2006 scheme, each award of options has a maximum life of 10 years. the 
maximum award limit is 100% of salary in any year in normal circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances. 
awards to directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility will not normally vest until three years after the award 
and the performance conditions have been met. 57
o ptions granted under the 2006 scheme have two separate conditions. the first condition is that the total shareholder  
return (‘tsr ’) of the Company must exceed that of the 250 largest companies in the ftse index. n o part of the award will  
vest for below median tsr: 12.5% of the o ption vests at median tsr ; 50% vests at upper quartile tsr and pro rata between 
these points. the second condition is growth in earnings per share (‘eps’) – 12.5% of the o ption will vest at eps growth of rpi 
+3% p.a. (nil below this); 50% will vest at rpi +5% p.a.; and pro rata between these points. t hese performance conditions  
were chosen by the r emuneration Committee in the light of institutional guidelines in order to incentivise the executives  
to increase shareholder value. under the 2006 scheme, should the performance conditions not be met, re-testing is  
not permitted.
the status of both performance conditions on share options outstanding during the year is set out below. since neither the 
tsr nor the eps condition for the options granted in n ovember 2006 was met, all of those options granted to participating 
directors have now lapsed.

the g roup operates a two-tier defined benefit pension scheme for senior employees (including most of the Company’s 
executive directors), details of which are given on page 59. it is the Company’s policy that annual bonuses, payments under 
the executive bonus scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
prior to 6th april, 2006, the Committee reviewed in detail the impact of the pensions tax regime operating from that date.  
it developed a new policy, designed to be neutral in terms of cost compared to existing expenditure on pensions. this new 
policy incorporated the removal of the pensionable earnings cap for pension accruing after 6th april, 2006.
individual executive directors were affected very differently by these changes and for some it was not tax-efficient to accrue 
further pension for service from 6th april, 2006. however, it is for individual directors to decide when to opt out of the scheme, 
in which case a cash allowance is paid. Cash allowances paid in lieu of pensions are shown on page 49.
under the prescribed transitional arrangements, their accrued pension at that date will remain linked to future increases in 
pensionable earnings and they will continue to be eligible for death in service benefits.

n otes to directors’ pension entitlements
(i) n o executive directors are now accruing further pension in the dmgt s enior executives pension f und. the normal retirement age 
under the f und for this group is 60. f or each director, the accrued entitlement at 3rd o ctober, 2010 represents the annual 
pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, based on the salary of each director at this date and 
pensionable service accrued to 5th april, 2006 or subsequent date of opting out of the f und. a spouse’s/dependant’s pension 
equal to two thirds of the director’s pension is incorporated and the director can elect to receive the pension from age 50, 
subject to a discount if retirement takes place before 60. the pension, when in payment, will receive annual increases in line with 
inflation, which may be limited when inflation exceeds 3% per annum.
(ii) all transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with uK legislation. the transfer values 
of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension 
provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of the directors’ pension benefits.
(iii) mr f allon’s pension benefit in the above table relates to a deferred pension in the harmsworth pension scheme for pensionable 
service between 1st april, 1978 and 1st april, 1986. this benefit has been increased for payment after normal r etirement age. 
n either the g roup nor mr f allon makes any further contributions to this scheme.
(iv) the Company does not make any pension contributions on behalf of mr dutton.
(v) mr morgan began to take his pension benefits, including a lump sum payment, on 20th march, 2010. mr morgan’s pension benefit 
in the above table relates to a pension in the dmgt ’s senior executive pensions f und for pensionable service between 8th may, 
1989 and 31st august, 2000, when he transferred to the us i n addition, mr morgan has the following pension arrangements:
• a us deferred compensation plan, which is held in a rabbi trust. t his provides a defined contribution cash benefit with a defined 
benefit pension underpin in respect of the period 1st september, 2000 to 30th september, 2008.
• an employer financed retirement benefits scheme (efrbs ) in respect of service from 1st o ctober, 2008 operated on behalf of 
the Company under an offshore trust located in Jersey.
(vi) mr dacre began to take his pension benefits on 14th november, 2008.

  mr dacre’s notice period will reduce 
to 1 year on 14th n ovember, 2011 until 
14th n ovember, 2012 and then the 
residual term until his 65th birthday  
on 14th n ovember, 2013.
in the event of earlier termination of 
their contracts, each director is entitled 
to compensation equal to their basic 
salary, benefits, pension entitlement 
and, as appropriate, bonus or profit 
share for their notice period.
the contracts of mr morgan and  
mr Williams are subject to mitigation 
and, in the event of the director 
obtaining alternative employment 
during the notice period, do not provide 
for further payment after such event. 
this mitigation does not apply to their 
pension benefit. share options and ltip s 
would be treated as for any member of 
the scheme, depending on the reason 
for termination of the contract.
mr f allon has a second service contract 
with euromoney publications (Jersey) 
l imited (‘ep J’), a subsidiary of 
euromoney dated 4th may, 1993.  
this contract has the same terms as  
his first contract, except that 
termination does not include a car 
allowance as mr f allon does not 
receive this benefit from ep J.
non-exe Cutive dire Ctorships
the Company allows its executive 
directors to take a very limited number 
of outside directorships. individuals 
retain the payments received from such 
services since these appointments are 
not expected to impinge on their 
principal employment.
mr Williams retained fees of £12,500 
(2009 £12,500) from his outside non-
executive directorships.
service Contract arrangements
Contracts of service are negotiated on 
an individual basis as part of the overall 
remuneration package and their length 
is inevitably conditioned by external 
competitive pressures. f or this reason, 
the contracts of two of the executive 
directors exceed the one year 
recommended in the Code. the 
Committee believes that the length of 
contract should be appropriate to the 
individual. thus where dmgt employs 
individuals with unique talents within 
the areas of business within which it 
operates, the Committee believes that 
they should have longer contracts.
the Chairman and messrs Williams, 
dutton, f allon and beatty have 
contracts of up to one year in duration. 
mr morgan has a contract which is 
currently for one year and six months.  
mr morgan’s notice period will reduce 
to one year and three months as of 
1st o ctober, 2011 and to one year on 
1st o ctober, 2012. mr dacre has a rolling 
two-year contract which the 
Committee considers wholly 
appropriate for his particular 
responsibilities and for the industry in 
which he works. the Committee 
differentiates between what might be 
termed ‘corporate executives’ and 
‘media executives’ whom it wishes to  
tie in to the g roup and to prevent from 
working for competitors. mr dacre is a 
media executive.

DMGT is a company incorporated in the 
united Kingdom. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 160.
These financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with 
international Financial r eporting 
standards (iFrs ) issued by the 
international accounting standards 
Board as adopted by the european 
union and with those parts of the 
c ompanies act 2006 applicable to 
companies preparing their accounts 
under iFrs .
These financial statements have been 
prepared for the 52 weeks ending  
3rd o ctober, 2010. The Group and its 
national and local media divisions, 
prepare financial statements for a 52 or 
53-week financial period ending on a 
sunday near to the end of september. 
The Group has prepared the 2010 
financial statements on the basis of a  
52-week financial year to 3rd o ctober 
2010, having been prepared on the 
basis of a 53-week year in 2009 in order 
to ensure that the Group’s year end 
remains close to the end of september. 
as the current financial year is 52 weeks, 
the comparative figures for the 53 
weeks ended 4th o ctober, 2009 are not 
entirely comparable with the amounts 
presented for the current financial year 
as the comparative figures include the 
results of the national and local media 
divisions for 53 weeks.
The Group’s remaining divisions prepare 
financial statements for a financial year 
to 30th september and do not prepare 
additional financial statements 
corresponding to the Group’s financial 
year for consolidation purposes as it 
would be impracticable to do so. as a 
result, the financial statements are 
comparable in relation to those 
elements of the comparatives that 
relate to the Group’s other divisions. The 
Group considers whether there have 
been any significant transactions or 
events between the end of the financial 
year of the other divisions and the end 
of the Group’s financial year and  
makes any material adjustments as 
appropriate.
The significant accounting policies used 
in preparing this information are set out 
in note 2.
These financial statements have also 
been prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out in the 2009 
annual r eport and accounts, with the 
exception of the change in accounting 
policy described below and as 
amended by the new accounting 
standards set out below.
The Group financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of 
the c ompany and all of its subsidiaries 
together with the Group’s share of all of 
its interests in joint ventures and 
associates. The financial statements 
have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
financial instruments.
2  siGni Fican T accoun TinG 
policies
c hange in accounting policy
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme charge under ias 19, employee 
Benefits, contains financing 
components which comprise the 
expected return on scheme assets and 
an interest cost on scheme liabilities. in 
order to provide a more relevant 
presentation to assist the user of these 
accounts to understand the 
components of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension scheme charge, the 
Group has chosen to present these 
financing elements within net Finance 
costs. previously these were included 
within operating profit along with the 
service cost element. accordingly the 
comparatives presented in these 
consolidated financial statements have 
been restated.
in the c onsolidated income statement 
this change in accounting policy has 
resulted in a reclassification of a return 
on scheme assets of £116.2 million and 
an interest cost of £111.4 million from 
operating profit to net finance costs in 
the 53 weeks to 4th o ctober, 2009. in 
the current year the amount presented 
in net finance costs is a net charge of 
£2.2 million.
r eclassification of loans to joint 
ventures and associates
The Group has reclassified loans to joint 
ventures and associates from 
investment in joint ventures and 
associates to trade and other 
receivables. The amount reclassified in 
respect of joint ventures at 4th o ctober, 
2009 was £7.5 million (2008 £6.2 million) 
and the amount reclassified in respect 
of associates as at 4th o ctober, 2009 
was £nil (2008 £nil). in the current year 
the amount presented in trade and 
other receivables was £9.9 million  
in relation to joint ventures and  
£0.3 million in relation to associates.  
This reclassification aligns the Group’s 
presentation more closely with the 
requirements of the relevant 
accounting standards.
impact of new  
accounting standards
The following new and revised 
standards and interpretations have 
been adopted in the current year. The 
adoption of these standards and 
interpretations on the amounts reported 
in the condensed consolidated 
financial statements are as follows:
• improving disclosures about financial 
instruments (amendments to iFrs 7 
Financial instruments: Disclosures)
• ias 1 (2007) presentation of financial 
statements
ias 1 (2007) requires the presentation of 
a statement of c hanges in equity as a 
primary statement, separate from the 
c onsolidated income statement and 
statement of c omprehensive income. 
as a result, a c onsolidated statement of 
c hanges in equity has been included in 
the primary statements, showing 
changes in each component of equity 
for each period presented. The revised 
standard also requires that restatements 
show two statements of Financial 
position for comparison and so certain 
information from the 2009 annual 
r eport and accounts has been 
included in the 2010 annual r eport and 
accounts, where appropriate.
• iFrs 3 (2008) Business c ombinations 
and ias 27 (2008) c onsolidated and 
separate Financial statements.
as a consequence of the adoption of 
these standards, the Group has applied 
the following policies on a prospective 
basis with regard to business 
combinations and purchases and sales 
of shares in a controlled entity effected 
after o ctober 4th, 2009. Transactions 
which completed prior to o ctober 4th, 
2009 have not been restated and 
remain as previously reported. siGniFicanT accounTinG policies conTinueD

Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries and 
businesses are accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The consideration 
for each acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of fair values of assets given, 
liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the Group 
in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
acquisition-related costs are now 
recognised in the c onsolidated income 
statement as incurred.
w here applicable, the consideration for 
the acquisition includes any asset or 
liability resulting from a contingent 
arrangement, measured at its 
acquisition date fair value. subsequent 
changes in such fair values are adjusted 
through the c onsolidated income 
statement. all other changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability are 
accounted for in accordance with 
relevant iFrs s. c hanges in the fair value 
of contingent consideration classified 
as equity are not recognised.
if the initial accounting for a business 
combination is incomplete by the end 
of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for 
which the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period, or 
additional assets or liabilities are 
recognised, to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the 
date of the acquisition that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts 
recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period 
from the date of acquisition to the date 
the Group obtains complete 
information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date and is a maximum of 
one year.
Business combinations achieved  
in stages
w here a business combination is 
achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously held interests in the acquired 
entity are remeasured to fair value at 
the date the Group attains control and 
the resulting gain or loss is recognised in 
the c onsolidated income statement. 
amounts arising from interests in the 
acquiree prior to the acquisition date 
that were recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified 
to the c onsolidated income statement 
where such treatment would be 
appropriate if the interest were 
disposed of.
purchases and sales of shares in a 
controlled entity
w here the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity increases, the non-
controlling interests’ share of net assets, 
excluding any allocation of goodwill, is 
transferred to retained earnings. any 
difference between the cost of the 
additional interest and the existing 
carrying value of the non-controlling 
interests’ share of net assets is recorded 
in retained earnings.
w here the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity decreases, but the 
Group retains control, the share of net 
assets disposed, excluding any 
allocation of goodwill, is transferred to 
the non-controlling interest. any 
difference between the proceeds  
of the disposal and the existing  
carrying value of the net assets or 
liabilities transferred to the non-
controlling interests is recorded in 
retained earnings.
Disposal of controlling interests where 
non-controlling interest retained
w here the Group disposes of  
a controlling interest but retains  
a non-controlling interest in the 
business, the Group accounts for the 
disposal of a subsidiary and the 
subsequent acquisition of a joint 
venture, associate or available-for-sale 
asset at fair value on initial recognition. 
o n disposal of a subsidiary all amounts 
deferred in equity are recycled to the 
c onsolidated income statement. 
Business combinations occurring  
prior to 4th o ctober, 2009
The acquisition of subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the purchase 
method. The cost of the acquisition is 
measured as the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of 
assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued 
by the Group in exchange for control of 
the acquiree, plus any costs directly 
attributable to the business 
combination. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are recognised at 
their fair values at the acquisition date, 
other than non-current assets and 
liabilities of disposal groups which are 
recognised at fair value less costs to sell. 
w here an adjustment to fair values 
relating to previously held interests 
(including interests which were equity 
accounted under ias 28, i nvestments in 
associates) is required on achieving 
control, this is accounted for as an 
adjustment directly in equity.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is 
recognised as an asset and initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of 
the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities recognised. 
w here control is achieved in more than 
one exchange transaction, goodwill is 
calculated separately for each 
transaction based on the cost of each 
transaction and the appropriate share 
of the acquiree’s net assets based  
on net fair values at the time of  
each transaction.
The interest of non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree is initially measured at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportion of 
the net fair value of the assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities recognised. 
purchase and sale of shares in a 
controlled entity occurring prior to 
4th o ctober, 2009
w here the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity increases, no 
adjustments are recorded to the fair 
values of the assets already held on the 
c onsolidated statement of Financial 
position. The Group calculates the 
goodwill arising as the difference 
between the cost of the additional 
interest acquired and the increase in 
the Group’s interest in the fair value of 
the subsidiary’s net assets at the date of 
the exchange transaction. any 
difference between the cost of the 
additional interest, goodwill arising and 
the existing carrying value of the 
non-controlling interest’s share of net 
assets is adjusted directly in equity.
w here the Group’s interest in a 
controlled entity decreases, which does 
not result in a change of control, the 
Group increases the non-controlling 
interest’s share of net assets by the book 
value of the share of net assets 
disposed. any profit or loss on disposal 
of the share of net assets to the non-
controlling interest is calculated by 
reference to the consideration 
received, the book value of the share of 
net assets disposed and a proportion of  73

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and 
position are set out in the Financial and 
Treasury review on pages 29 to 33, the 
Business r eview on pages 4 to 33 and 
the Director’s report on pages 38 to 46. 
The Group’s funding arrangements, 
together with details of undrawn 
facilities, are disclosed in notes 31 and 
32.
as highlighted in notes 31 and 32 to the 
financial statements, the company has 
long-term financing in the form of 
eurobonds and meets its day-to-day 
working capital requirements through 
bank facilities which expire in one to 
three years. The current economic 
conditions create uncertainty 
particularly over the future 
performance of those parts of the 
business that derive a significant 
proportion of revenue from advertising. 
The Board’s forecasts and projections, 
after taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the company is 
expected to operate within the terms of 
its current facilities. after making 
enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will have access to adequate resources 
to continue in existence for the 
foreseeable future. accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
accounting for subsidiaries
a subsidiary is an entity controlled by 
the Group. c ontrol is achieved where 
the Group has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are 
included in the c onsolidated income 
statement from the effective date 
control is obtained or up to the date 
control is relinquished, as appropriate. 
w here necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring their accounting 
policies into line with those used by 
other members of the Group.
all intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated 
on consolidation.
n on-controlling interests
n on-controlling interests in the net 
assets of consolidated subsidiaries are 
identified separately from the Group’s 
equity therein. n on-controlling interests 
consist of the amount of those interests 
at the date of the original business 
combination and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of changes in equity 
since the date of the combination. 
l osses attributable to the non-
controlling interest in excess of the 
non-controlling interest’s share in equity 
are allocated against the interests of 
the Group except to the extent that the 
non-controlling interest has a binding 
obligation and is able to make an 
additional investment to cover such 
losses. w hen the subsidiary 
subsequently reports profits, the 
non-controlling interest does not 
participate until the group has 
recovered all of the losses of the 
non-controlling interest it previously 
reported. siGniFicanT accounTinG policies conTinueD

interests in joint ventures  
and associates
a joint venture is a contractual 
arrangement whereby the Group and 
other parties undertake an economic 
activity that is subject to joint control, 
that is when the strategic financial and 
operating policy decisions relating to 
the activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
an associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence and that 
is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a 
joint venture. significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the 
investee, but is not control or joint 
control over those policies.
The post-tax results of joint ventures and 
associates are incorporated in the 
Group’s results using the equity method 
of accounting. under the equity 
method, investments in joint ventures 
and associates are carried in the 
c onsolidated statement of Financial 
position at a cost as adjusted for 
post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the joint 
venture and associate, less any 
impairment in the value of investment. 
l osses of joint ventures and associates in 
excess of the of the Group’s interest in 
that joint venture or associate are not 
recognised. additional losses are 
provided for, and a liability is 
recognised, only to the extent that the 
Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture 
or associate.
any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the Group’s share of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the joint 
venture or associate recognised at the 
date of acquisition is recognised as 
goodwill. The goodwill is included within 
the carrying amount of the investment.
Foreign currencies
For the purpose of presenting 
consolidated financial statements, the 
assets and liabilities of entities with a 
functional currency other than sterling 
are translated to sterling using 
exchange rates prevailing on the 
period end date. income and expense 
items and cash flows are translated at 
the average exchange rates for the 
period and exchange differences 
arising are recognised directly in equity. 
o n disposal of a foreign operation, the 
cumulative amount recognised in 
equity relating to that operation is 
recognised in the c onsolidated income 
statement as part of the gain or loss  
on sale.
The Group records foreign exchange 
differences arising on retranslation of 
foreign operations within the translation 
reserve in equity.
in preparing the financial statements of 
the individual entities, transactions in 
currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the 
exchange rate prevailing on the date of 
the transaction. at each period end 
date, monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the period  
end date. 
n on-monetary items carried at fair 
value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rate 
prevailing on the date when fair value 
was determined. n on-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are not 
retranslated.
exchange differences arising on the 
settlement of monetary items, and on 
the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in the c onsolidated income 
statement for the period. 
Goodwill, intangible assets and fair 
value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of foreign operations after 
transition to iFrs are treated as part of 
the assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and are translated at the 
closing rate. Goodwill which arose 
pre-transition to iFrs is not translated.
in respect of all foreign operations, any 
cumulative exchange differences that 
have arisen before 4th o ctober, 2004, 
the date of transition to iFrs , were reset 
to £nil and will be excluded from the 
determination of any subsequent profit 
or loss on disposal. 
intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill and intangible assets 
acquired arising on the acquisition of 
an entity represents the excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the entity 
recognised at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an 
asset at cost and is subsequently 
measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. n egative goodwill 
arising on an acquisition is recognised 
directly in the c onsolidated income 
statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments 
arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and are 
translated at the closing exchange 
rates on the period end date.
Goodwill arising before the date of 
transition to iFrs , on 4th o ctober, 2004, 
has been retained at the previous uK 
Gaap amounts, subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. 
o n disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly 
controlled entity, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the c onsolidated income 
statement on disposal. Goodwill written 
off to reserves under uK Gaap prior to 
1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment 
either annually or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate a possible decline in the 
carrying value.
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows, known as 
cash-generating units. if the 
recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to 
the unit and then to the other assets of 
the unit, pro-rated on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the 
unit, but subject to not reducing any 
asset below its recoverable amount. an 
impairment loss recognised for goodwill 
is not reversed in a subsequent period.
The recoverable amount is the higher of 
fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use. in assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the 
current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset or cash-generating unit.

any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the c onsolidated

subsequently reversed.
l icences
r adio licences are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. 
amortisation is charged to the 
c onsolidated income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives from the commencement of 
service of the network, estimated by 
management to be 20 years.
c omputer software licences are 
capitalised on the basis of the costs 
incurred to acquire and bring into use 
the specific software. These costs are 
amortised over their estimated useful 
lives, being three to five years.
c osts that are directly associated with 
the production of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled by 
the Group, and that are expected to 
generate economic benefits exceeding 
costs and directly attributable 
overheads are capitalised as 
intangibles. 
c omputer software which is integral to 
a related item of hardware equipment 
is accounted for as property, plant and 
equipment.
c osts associated with maintaining 
computer software programs are 
recognised as an expense as incurred.
at each period end date, the Group 
reviews the carrying amounts of its 
tangible and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. if any such 
indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). w here the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs.
an intangible asset with an indefinite 
useful life is tested for impairment 
annually and whenever there is  
an indication that the asset may  
be impaired.
r esearch and  
development expenditure
expenditure on research activities is 
recognised as an expense in the period 
in which it is incurred.
an internally generated intangible asset 
arising from the Group’s development 
activity, including software for internal 
use, is recognised only if the asset can 
be separately identified, it is probable 
the asset will generate future economic 
benefits, the development cost can be 
measured reliably, the project is 
technically feasible and the project will 
be completed with a view to sell or use 
the asset. additionally, guidance in 
standing interpretations c ommittee 
(sic ) 32 has been applied in 
accounting for internally developed 
website development costs.
internally generated intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, when 
the asset is available for use, and are 
reported net of impairment losses. 
w here no internally generated 
intangible asset can be recognised, 
development expenditure is charged to 
the c onsolidated income statement in 
the period in which it was incurred.
Marketing costs
Marketing and promotional costs are 
charged to the c onsolidated income 
statement in the period in which they 
are incurred.
o ther intangible assets
o ther intangible assets with finite lives 
are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
amortisation is charged to the 
c onsolidated income statement on a 
reducing balance or straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of the 
intangible assets from the date they 
become available for use. The 
estimated useful lives are as follows:
publishing rights, titles  
and exhibitions 5 – 30 years
r adio licences 20 years
Brands 3 – 20 years
Market and customer- 
related databases 3 – 20 years
c ustomer relationships 3 – 20 years

impairment of intangible assets
at each period end date, reviews are 
carried out of the carrying amounts of 
tangible and intangible assets and 
goodwill to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. if any such 
indication exists, the recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of value in 
use and fair value less costs to sell, of 
the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent, if any, of the 
impairment loss. w here the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, value in 
use estimates are made based on the 
cash flows of the cash-generating unit 
to which the asset belongs.
if the recoverable amount of an asset or 
cash-generating unit is estimated to be 
less than its net carrying amount, the 
net carrying amount of the asset or 
cash-generating unit is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. impairment losses 
are recognised immediately in the 
c onsolidated income statement.
The Group assesses at the end of each 
reporting period whether there is any 
indication that an impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods, for an asset 
other than goodwill, may no longer 
exist or may have decreased. if any 
such indication exists, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of 
that asset. in assessing whether there is 
any indication that an impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods for an asset 
other than goodwill may no longer exist 
or may have decreased, the Group 
considers, as a minimum, the following 
indications:
(a) w hether the asset’s market value  
has increased significantly during  
the period
(b) w hether any significant changes 
with a favourable effect on the entity 
have taken place during the period, 
or will take place in the near future, 
in the technological, market, 
economic or legal environment in 
which the entity operates or in the 
market to which the asset is 
dedicated and
(c) w hether market interest rates or 
other market rates of return on 
investments have decreased during 
the period, and those decreases are 
likely to affect the discount rate used 
in calculating the asset’s value in use 
and increase the asset’s recoverable 
amount materially. siGniFicanT accounTinG policies conTinueD

r evenue
Group revenue comprises revenue of 
the c ompany and its subsidiary 
undertakings. r evenue is stated at the 
fair value of consideration, net of value 
added tax, trade discounts and 
commission where applicable and is 
recognised using methods appropriate 
for the Group’s businesses. 
w here revenue contracts have multiple 
elements (such as software licences, 
data subscriptions and support), the 
c ompany considers all aspects of the 
transaction to determine whether these 
elements can be separately identified. 
w here transaction elements can be 
separately identified and revenue can 
be allocated between them on a fair 
and reliable basis, revenue for each 
element is accounted for according to 
the relevant policy below. w here 
transaction elements cannot be 
separately identified, revenue is 
recognised over the contract period. 
The principal revenue recognition 
policies, as applied by the Group’s 
major businesses, are as follows:
• subscriptions revenue, including 
revenue from information services, is 
recognised over the period of the 
subscription or contract.
• publishing and circulation revenue is 
recognised on issue of publication  
or report. 
• advertising revenue is recognised on 
issue of publication, over the period 
of the online campaign or on the 
date of broadcast. 
• c ontract print revenue is recognised 
on completion of the print contract. 
• exhibitions, training and events 
revenues are recognised over the 
period of the event. 
• software licence revenue is 
recognised on delivery of the 
software licence or over the period 
of the contract if support is unable to 
be separately identified and revenue 
allocated on a fair and reliable basis.
• support revenue associated with 
software licences and subscriptions is 
recognised over the term of the 
support contract.
• l ong-term contract revenue is 
recognised under the percentage of 
completion method according to 
the percentage of work completed 
at the period end date. 
o perating profit before share  
of results of joint ventures  
and associates
The Group discloses as operating profit, 
profit before share of results from 
associates and joint ventures, other 
gains and losses, investment income 
and finance costs. The Directors believe 
that this measure is useful to readers as 
it shows the results of the Group’s 
operations before contribution from 
joint ventures and associates and 
because it excludes one-off gains and 
losses on disposal of businesses, 
properties and similar items of a 
non-recurring nature.

l easing
l eases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership of the asset to the lessee.  
all other leases are classified as 
operating leases. 
assets held under finance leases are 
recognised as assets of the Group at 
their fair value at the inception of the 
lease or, if lower, at the present value  
of the minimum lease payments as 
determined at the inception of the 
lease. The corresponding liability to the 
lessor is included in the c onsolidated 
statement of Financial position as a 
finance lease obligation. l ease 
payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are recognised in the 
c onsolidated income statement.
r entals payable under operating leases 
are charged to the c onsolidated 
income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. Benefits received and receivable 
as an incentive to enter into an 
operating lease are also spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is 
recognised when the shareholders’ 
rights to receive payment have been 
established. Dividends are recognised 
as a distribution in the period in which 
they are approved by the shareholders. 
interim dividends are recorded in the 
period in which they are paid.
Borrowing costs
unless capitalised under ias 23, all 
borrowing costs are recognised in the 
c onsolidated income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
Finance charges, including premiums 
paid on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs and discounts related 
to borrowings, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis and charged to the 
c onsolidated income statement using 
the effective interest method.
r etirement benefits
as permitted by iFrs 1, First-time 
adoption of international Financial 
r eporting standards, the Group 
elected to recognise all cumulative 
actuarial gains and losses in the 
pension schemes operated by the 
Group at 4th o ctober, 2004 the date of 
transition to iFrs . pension scheme assets 
are measured at market value at the 
period end date. scheme liabilities are 
measured using the projected unit 
credit method and discounted at a rate 
reflecting current yields on high-quality 
corporate bonds having regard to the 
duration of the liability profiles of the 
schemes.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the 
difference between the fair value of the 
plan assets and the present value of the 
plan liabilities is recognised as an asset 
or liability on the statement of 
c onsolidated Financial position. 
actuarial gains and losses arising in the 
year are taken to the c onsolidated 
statement of c omprehensive income. 
For this purpose, actuarial gains and 
losses comprise both the effects of 
changes in actuarial assumptions and 
experience adjustments arising 
because of differences between the 
previous actuarial assumptions and 
what has actually occurred. For defined 
benefit schemes, the cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out 
triennially. in accordance with the 
advice of independent qualified 
actuaries in assessing whether to 
recognise a surplus, the Group has 
regard to the principles set out in  
iFric 14.
o ther movements in the net surplus or 
deficit are recognised in the 
c onsolidated income statement, 
including the current service cost, any 
past service cost and the effect of any 
curtailment or settlements. The interest 
cost less the expected return on assets  
is also charged to the c onsolidated 
income statement within net  
finance costs. 
since the assets and liabilities of the 
Group’s defined benefit plans cannot 
be allocated to individual entities on a 
fair and reasonable basis, the scheme’s 
assets and liabilities are not attributed 
to reporting segments and the pension 
charge in each segment in the 
segmental analysis represents the 
contributions payable for the period.
The Group’s contributions to defined 
contribution pension plans are charged 
to the c onsolidated income statement 
as they fall due.
Taxation
income tax expense represents the sum 
of the current tax payable and deferred 
tax for the year.
The current tax payable or recoverable 
is based on the taxable profit for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from profit as 
reported in the c onsolidated income 
statement because some items of 
income or expense are taxable or 
deductible in different years or may 
never be taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using the uK and foreign tax 
rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the period 
end date. 
c urrent tax assets and liabilities are 
offset and stated net in the 
c onsolidated statement of Financial 
position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they either relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority or 
on the same taxable entity or on 
different taxable entities which intend 
to settle the current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be 
payable or recoverable in the future 
arising from temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit. it is 
accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary differences 
arise from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or from the initial recognition 
other than in a business combination of 
other assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit. siGniFicanT accounTinG policies conTinueD

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
for taxable temporary differences 
arising in investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is 
able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Goodwill arising on business 
combinations also includes amounts 
corresponding to deferred tax liabilities 
recognised in respect of acquired 
intangible assets. a deferred tax liability 
is recognised to the extent that the fair 
value of the assets for accounting 
purposes exceeds the value of those 
assets for tax purposes and will form 
part of the associated goodwill  
on acquisition.
The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each period end 
date and reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the 
asset realised, based on tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end date, and is 
not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Tax is charged or credited to the 
c onsolidated income statement, 
except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the tax is also recognised directly 
in equity.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised on the statement of 
c onsolidated Financial position when 
the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset 
and the net amount reported in the 
c onsolidated statement of Financial 
position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to settle on a net 
basis, or realise the asset and liability 
simultaneously and where the Group 
intends to net settle.
Financial assets
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal 
value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts.
available-for-sale investments
investments and financial assets are 
recognised and de-recognised on a 
trade date where a purchase or sale of 
an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the 
investment within the timeframe 
established by the market concerned, 
and are measured at fair value, 
including transaction costs.
investments are classified as either held-
for-trading or available-for-sale. w here 
securities are held-for-trading purposes, 
gains and losses arising from changes in 
fair value are included in net profit or 
loss for the period. For available-for-sale 
investments, gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity, until the 
security is disposed of or is determined 
to be impaired, at which time the 
cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included in the 
net profit or loss for the period. 
The fair value of listed securities is 
determined based on quoted market 
prices, and of unlisted securities on 
management’s estimate of fair value 
determined by discounting future cash 
flows to net present value using market 
interest rates prevailing at the  
period end.
Financial liabilities and  
equity instruments
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing 
and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments issued by the Group are 
classified according to the substance of 
the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial 
liability and an equity instrument. an 
equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all 
of its liabilities. The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial liabilities 
and equity instruments are set  
as follows:
Capital market and bank borrowings
interest-bearing loans and overdrafts 
are initially measured at fair value 
(which is equal to net proceeds at 
inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. a portion 
of the Group’s bonds are subject to fair 
value hedge accounting as explained 
below and this portion is adjusted for 
the movement in the hedged risk to the 
extent hedge effectiveness is achieved. 
any difference between the proceeds, 
net of transaction costs, and the 
settlement or redemption of borrowings 
is recognised over the term of  
the borrowing.
Equity instruments 
equity instruments issued by the Group 
are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of transaction costs.
Derivative financial instruments and 
hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the 
financial risks of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates.
The use of financial instruments is 
governed by the Group’s policies, 
which are set out on pages 32 and 33 of 
the Financial and Treasury r eview and 
approved by the Finance c ommittee of 
the Board of Directors, which provides 
written principles on the use of financial 
instruments consistent with the Group’s 
risk management strategy. The Group 
does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are 
measured at fair value at the date the 
derivatives are entered into and are 
subsequently re-measured to fair value 
at each reporting date. The fair value is 
determined by using market data and 
the use of established estimation 
techniques such as discounted cash 
flow and option valuation models.  
The Group designates certain 
derivatives as:
i hedges of the change of fair value 
of recognised assets and liabilities 
(“fair value hedges”); or
ii hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions (“cash flow hedges”); or
iii hedges of net investment in foreign 
operations (“net investment hedges”)

2 siGniFicanT accounTinG policies continued
To qualify for hedge accounting, each 
individual hedging relationship must be 
expected to be effective, be 
designated and documented at its 
inception and throughout the life of the 
hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges
The Group’s policy is to use derivative 
financial instruments (primarily interest 
rate swaps) to convert a proportion of 
its fixed-rate debt to floating rates in 
order to hedge the interest rate risk.
c hanges in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as fair 
value hedges are recorded in the 
c onsolidated income statement, 
together with changes in the fair value 
of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk to the 
extent that the hedge relationship is 
effective. w hen the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting, hedge accounting 
is discontinued.
c ash flow hedges
The Group’s policy is to use certain 
derivative financial instruments in order 
to hedge the foreign exchange risk 
arising from certain firm commitments 
or forecast highly probable transactions 
in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the relevant Group entity.
c hanges in the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of 
future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the 
c onsolidated income statement. 
if a hedged firm commitment or 
forecast transaction results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or 
liability, then, at the time that the asset 
or liability is recognised, the associated 
gains and losses on the derivative that 
had previously been recognised in 
equity are included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the 
recognition of an asset or a liability, 
amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the c onsolidated income 
statement in the same period in which 
the hedged item affects the 
c onsolidated income statement. 
hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, 
or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. at that time, any 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is 
retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. if a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is 
included in the c onsolidated income 
statement for the period.
n et investment hedges
The Group seeks to manage the foreign 
currency exposure arising on 
retranslation of the reporting entity’s 
share of net assets of foreign operations 
at each reporting date by designating 
certain derivative financial instruments 
and foreign currency borrowings as net 
investment hedging instruments.
exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in 
foreign operations are recognised 
directly in equity in the translation 
reserve. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value of the hedging 
instruments are recognised in equity to 
the extent that the hedging relationship 
is effective. any ineffectiveness is 
recognised immediately in the 
c onsolidated income statement for  
the period. 
hedge accounting is discontinued 
when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
Gains and losses accumulated in the 
translation reserve are included in the 
c onsolidated income statement on 
disposal of the foreign operation.
n on-hedged derivatives
The Group uses forward contracts to 
provide a gain or loss equivalent to 
income tax payable or receivable on 
foreign exchange gains or losses 
incurred when intra-group balances 
are translated to the closing rate at the 
period end. These contracts (“Tax 
equalisation swaps”) are marked to 
market with the movement in fair value 
taken to income. Tax equalisation swaps 
are not capable of being designated 
as hedging instruments under ias 39.
Derivatives embedded in other 
financial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to 
those of the host contracts and the host 
contracts are not carried at fair value, 
with gains and losses reported in the 
c onsolidated income statement.
provisions
provisions are recognised when the 
Group has a present obligation, legal or 
constructive, as a result of a past event, 
and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. 
provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the period end date, and 
are discounted to present value where 
the effect is material.
share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled and 
cash-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. equity settled share-
based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non-
market-based vesting conditions) at the 
date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity settled 
share-based payments is expensed on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate 
of the shares that will eventually vest 
and adjusted for the effect of non- 
market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a binomial 
pricing model which is calibrated using 
a Black-scholes framework. The 
expected life used in the models  
has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for  
the effect of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.
a liability equal to the portion of the 
goods or services received is 
recognised at the current fair value 
determined at each period end date 
for cash-settled share-based payments.
The Group has applied the 
requirements of iFrs 2, s hare-based 
payments, to all equity instruments 
granted after 7th september, 2002 but 
not fully vested at 4th o ctober, 2004, 
the date of transition to iFrs . siGniFicanT accounTinG policies conTinueD

c ritical accounting judgements  
and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty
in addition to the judgement taken by 
management in selecting and applying 
the accounting policies set out above, 
management has made the following 
judgements concerning the amounts 
recognised in the c onsolidated 
Financial statements:
Forecasting
The Group prepares medium-term 
forecasts based on Board-approved 
budgets and three-year outlooks. These 
are used to support judgements made 
in the preparation of the Group’s 
financial statements, including the 
recognition of deferred tax assets in 
different jurisdictions, the Group’s going 
concern assessment and for the 
purposes of impairment reviews. 
l onger-term forecasts use long-term 
growth rates applicable to the relevant 
businesses.
impairment of goodwill and  
intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and 
intangible assets are impaired or 
whether a reversal of an impairment of 
intangible assets should be recorded 
requires an estimation of the value in 
use of the relevant cash-generating 
units. The value in use calculation 
requires management to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from 
the cash-generating unit and compare 
the net present value of these cash 
flows using a suitable discount rate to 
determine if any impairment has 
occurred. a key area of judgement is 
deciding the long-term growth rate of 
the applicable businesses and the 
discount rate applied to those cash 
flows (note 18). The carrying amount of 
goodwill and intangible assets at the 
period end date was £1,113.7 million 
(2009 £1,195.1 million 2008 £1,503.5 
million) after a net impairment reversal 
of £19.9 million (2009 charge £346.6 
million 2008 charge £167.8 million) was 
recognised during the year (notes 18 
and 19).
acquisitions and intangible assets
The Group’s accounting policy on the 
acquisition of subsidiaries is to allocate 
purchase consideration to the fair value 
of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired with any 
excess consideration representing 
goodwill. Determining the fair value of 
assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired requires significant 
estimates and assumptions, including 
assumptions with respect to cash flows 
and unprovided liabilities and 
commitments, including in respect to 
tax, are often used. The Group 
recognises intangible assets acquired 
as part of a business combination at fair 
values at the date of the acquisition. 
The determination of these fair values is 
based upon management’s judgement 
and includes assumptions on the timing 
and amount of future cash flows 
generated by the assets and the 
selection of an appropriate discount 
rate. additionally, management must 
estimate the expected useful  
economic lives of intangible assets  
and charge amortisation on these 
assets accordingly.
acquisition option commitments
written put options to acquire further 
stakes in subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures written at the time of 
business combinations, unless so deeply 
in the money that they represent 
in-substance ownership interests, are 
considered financial instruments under 
ias 32 and ias 39. p ut options over a 
non-controlling interest stake in a 
subsidiary give rise to a financial liability 
under ias 32. put options over an 
associate are within the scope of ias 39 
and are accounted for as derivatives at 
fair value through profit and loss. where 
put options over associates have a fair 
value of £nil, no accounting is required. 
written put options are classified within 
current liabilities if exercisable within 
one year.
The Group is party to a number of put 
and call options over the remaining 
non-controlling interests in some of its 
subsidiaries. ias 39 requires the fair 
value of these acquisition option 
commitments to be recognised as a 
liability on the c onsolidated statement 
of Financial position with a 
corresponding decrease in reserves. 
subsequent changes in the fair value of 
the liability are reflected in the 
c onsolidated income statement. o n 
exercise and settlement of the put 
option liability, cumulative amounts are 
removed from retained earnings along 
with the derecognition of the non-
controlling interest and recognition of 
additional goodwill. Key areas of 
judgement in calculating the fair value 
of the options are the expected future 
cash flows and earnings of the business 
and the discount rate. at o ctober 3rd, 
2010 the fair value of these acquisition 
option commitments is £1.1 million (2009 
£11.9 million 2008 £37.1 million).
c ontingent consideration
estimates are required in respect of the 
amount of contingent consideration 
payable on acquisitions, which is 
determined according to formulae 
agreed at the time of the business 
combination, and normally related to 
the future earnings of the acquired 
business. The Directors review the 
amount of contingent consideration 
likely to become payable at each 
period end date, the major assumption 
being the level of future profits of the 
acquired business. The Group has 
outstanding contingent consideration 
payable amounting to £17.8 million 
(2009 £23.5 million 2008 £37.6 million).
c ontingent consideration is discounted 
to its fair value in accordance with iFrs 
3 and ias 37. For acquisitions completed 
prior to o ctober 4th, 2009, the 
difference between the fair value of 
these liabilities and the actual amounts 
payable is charged to the c onsolidated 
income statement as notional finance 
costs with remeasurement of the liability 
being recorded against goodwill. For 
acquisitions completed in the current 
period, movements in the fair value of 
these liabilities are recorded in the 
c onsolidated income statement  
in Financing.
adjusted profits and exceptional items
The Group presents adjusted earnings 
by making adjustments for costs and 
profits which management believes to 
be exceptional in nature by virtue of 
their size or incidence or have a 
distortive effect on current year 
earnings. such items would include 
costs associated with business 
combinations, one-off gains and losses 
on disposal of businesses, properties 
and similar items of a non-recurring 
nature, together with reorganisation 
costs and similar charges, tax and by 
adding back impairment of goodwill 
and amortisation and impairment of 
intangible assets. see note 13 for a 
reconciliation of profit before tax to 
adjusted profit. From o ctober 4th, 2010 
the Group will cease to add back to its 
adjusted results the amortisation 
charged on internally generated and 
acquired computer software unless it 
was recognised as part of the 
accounting for a business combination. 81

share-based payments
The Group makes share-based 
payments to certain employees. These 
payments are measured at their 
estimated fair value at the date of 
grant, calculated using an appropriate 
option pricing model. The fair value 
determined at the grant date is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the 
estimate of the number of shares that 
will eventually vest. The key assumptions 
used in calculating the fair value of the 
options are the discount rate, the 
Group’s share price volatility, dividend 
yield, risk free rate of return, and 
expected option lives. Management 
regularly performs a true-up of the 
estimate of the number of shares that 
are expected to vest, this is dependent 
on the anticipated number of leavers. 
see note 40 for further details.
Taxation
Being a multinational Group with tax 
affairs in many geographic locations 
inherently leads to a highly complex tax 
structure that makes the degree of 
estimation and judgement more 
challenging. The resolution of issues is 
not always within the control of the 
Group and is often dependent on the 
efficiency of legal processes. such 
issues can take several years to resolve. 
The Group takes a conservative view of 
unresolved issues, however, the inherent 
uncertainty regarding these items 
means that the eventual resolution 
could differ significantly from the 
accounting estimates and, therefore, 
impact the Group’s results and future 
cash flows. as described above, the 
Group makes estimates regarding the 
recoverability of tax assets relating to 
losses based on forecasts of future 
taxable profits which are, by their 
nature, uncertain.
r etirement benefit obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension 
plans is determined using actuarial 
valuations prepared by the Group’s 
actuaries. This involves making certain 
assumptions concerning discount rates, 
expected rates of return on assets, 
future salary increases, mortality rates 
and future pension increases. Due to 
the long-term nature of these plans, 
such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. The assumptions and the 
resulting estimates are reviewed 
annually and, when appropriate, 
changes are made which affect the 
actuarial valuations and, hence, the 
amount of retirement benefit expense 
recognised in the c onsolidated income 
statement and the amounts of actuarial 
gains and losses recognised in the 
statement of c hanges in equity. The 
carrying amount of the retirement 
benefit obligation at o ctober 3rd, 2010 
was a deficit of £271.4 million (2009 
£430.4 million 2008 £41.2 million). Further 
details are given in note 33. Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc

3 seGMenT analysis
w ithin these consolidated financial statements the Group’s radio operating segment (up to and including December 16th, 
2009) has been treated as discontinued operations. Further details are set out in note 26.
The Group’s business activities are split into seven operating divisions: r Ms, business information, events (previously known as 
exhibitions), euromoney, national media, local media and radio. These divisions are the basis on which information is 
reported to the Group Board. The segment result is the measure used for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment 
and represents profit earned by each segment, including share of results from joint ventures and associates but before 
exceptional operating costs, amortisation and impairment charges, other gains and losses, net finance costs and taxation.
Details of the types of products and services from which each segment derives its revenues are included within the business 
review on pages 4 to 33.
The accounting policies applied in preparing the management information for each of the reportable segments are the 
same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 2.
inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices other than the sale of newsprint from the national media to the 
local media division which is at cost to the Group. The amount of newsprint sold between segments during the year 
amounted to £22.0 million (2009 £28.2 million). 83

c hange in fair value of acquisition put option commitments (1.3) (1.8)
(1.3) (35.9)
(77.4) (113.8)
The finance charge on the discounting of contingent consideration arises from the requirement under iFrs 3, Business 
c ombinations, to record contingent consideration at fair value using a discounted cashflow approach.
Tax equalisation swap income and the gain from tax equalisation options totalling £nil (2009 £1.9 million), arises from the 
economic hedging of tax on foreign exchange movements. The foreign exchange loss on tax equalisation arrangements of 
£nil (2009 £27.9 million) is excluded from adjusted profit since it is equal to a reduced tax charge (see note 11). in addition, the 
foreign exchange loss on intra-group financing, premium on repurchase of bonds, on restructured hedging arrangements 
and the change in fair value of acquisition put options are also excluded from adjusted profits.
The foreign exchange losses on restructured hedging arrangements of £nil (2009 £6.2 million) arise from forward contracts 
classified as ineffective under ias 39, Financial instruments, following the Directors’ review of the Group’s us dollar revenue 
capacity in its uK-based businesses. noTes To The consoliDa TeD incoMe sT aTeMenT conTinueD

Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a highly complex tax structure. 
The tax charge is reviewed and measured on a Group total basis only.
a current tax credit of £0.6 million (2009 £nil) and a deferred tax charge of £45.2 million (2009 deferred tax credit  
£120.6 million) was recognised directly in equity (note 36).
The tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the uK of 28% (2009 28%) representing the 
weighted average annual corporate tax rate for the full financial year. The differences are explained below:

11 Tax continued
The net prior year credit of £67.6 million (2009 £30.8 million), which includes a charge of £0.5 million (2009 £1.4 million) relating 
to discontinued operations, arose largely from the agreement of certain prior year open issues with tax authorities, a 
reassessment of the level of tax provisions required and a reassessment of prior year capital allowance claims.
adjusted tax on profits before amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, restructuring costs and non-recurring items 
(adjusted tax charge) amounted to a charge of £33.7 million (2009 £44.3 million) and the resulting rate is 13.7% (2009 22.1%). 
The differences between the tax credit and the adjusted tax charge are shown in the reconciliation below:

Tax on other exceptional items (34.6) (24.1)
adjusted tax charge on the profit/(loss) for the period (33.7) (44.3)
in calculating the adjusted tax rate, the Group excludes the potential future deferred tax effects of intangible assets and 
goodwill as it prefers to give the users of its accounts a view of the tax charge based on the current status of such items.
a credit of £nil relating to tax on foreign exchange losses (2009 £27.9 million) has been treated as exceptional as it matches 
foreign exchange losses of £nil (2009 £27.9 million) on tax equalisation swaps included within finance costs (see note 10).
Tax on other exceptional items includes a credit of £30.4 million (2009 £nil) relating to the recognition of further uK tax losses 
and other temporary differences which are treated as exceptional due to their material impact on the Group’s adjusted  
tax charge.

back to its adjusted results the amortisation charged on internally generated and acquired computer software unless it was 
recognised as part of the accounting for a business combination. This change will bring it into line with the practice of the 
majority of other companies. had this change been made in the current financial year, adjusted profit before exceptional 
operating costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, other gains and losses and exceptional 
financing costs after taxation and non-controlling interests would have been £14.0 million lower at £177.8 million (2009

14 earnin Gs/(loss ) per share
Basic earnings per share of 52.1p (2009 loss 79.8p) and diluted earnings per share of 52.1p (2009 loss 79.8p) are calculated in 
accordance with ias 33. earnings per share, on Group profit for the financial period of £199.8 million (2009 loss £303.4 million) 
and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, as set out below.
as in previous years, adjusted earnings per share have also been disclosed since the Directors consider that this alternative 
measure gives a more comparable indication of the Group’s underlying trading performance. adjusted earnings per share 
of 50.0p (2009 37.2p) are calculated on profit for continuing and discontinued operations before exceptional operating 
costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, after charging the taxation and non-controlling 
interests associated with those profits, of £191.8 million (2009 £140.7 million), as set out in note 13 on facing page, and on the 
basic weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

(i) The amount of goodwill which is deductible for the purposes of calculating the Group’s tax charge amounts to £nil.
(ii) The non-controlling interests, which were acquired with Globrix l imited, were measured at their share of net book value 
of assets and liabilities on acquisition.
(iii) The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent 
consideration relating to acquisitions in the year is £0.6 million to £8.3 million. c ertain contingent consideration 
arrangements are not capped since they are based on future business performance (note 34).
Directly attributable costs in relation to the above acquisitions amounted to £0.7 million.
if all acquisitions had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been 
£1,971 million and Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £201.5 million. This information 
takes into account the amortisation of acquired intangible assets for a full year, together with related income tax effects but 
excludes any pre-acquisition finance costs and should not be viewed as indicative of the results of operations that would 
have occurred if the acquisitions had actually been completed on the first day of the financial year.
Total profit attributable to equity holders of the parent since the date of acquisition for companies acquired during the 
period amounted to £nil.
The aggregate consideration for these and other businesses was £19.4 million, of which £13.5 million was paid in cash during 
the year, an estimated amount of £4.9 million payable in the form of contingent consideration, depending upon trading 
results and £1.0 million satisfied by the issue of a loan note. This contingent consideration has been discounted back to 
current values in accordance with iFrs 3, Business c ombinations. in each case, the Group has used acquisition accounting 
to account for the purchase.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the 
Group’s products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations. 99

During the period, the Group acquired additional shares in controlled entities amounting to £12.8 million (2009 £24.1 million). 
in addition, the Group opted to receive a scrip dividend from euromoney institutional investor plc ( euromoney) amounting 
to £10.7 million (2009 £13.7 million) thereby acquiring a further 0.9 % (2009 1.8 %) of the issued ordinary share capital of 
euromoney. under the Group’s accounting policy for the acquisition of shares in controlled entities, no adjustment has been 
recorded to the fair value of assets and liabilities already held on the c onsolidated statement of Financial position. The 
difference between the cost of the additional shares and the carrying value of the non-controlling interests’ share of net 
assets is adjusted in retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings in the period was a charge of £2.8 million (2009 
£3.1 million) (note 37).

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired. 
intangible assets are tested separately from goodwill only where impairment indicators exist. The Group has no intangible 
assets with indefinite lives. Goodwill impairment losses recognised in the year were £3.2 million (2009 £187.5 million).
w hen testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Group’s cash-generating units (c Gus) are measured at the 
higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. value in use is calculated by discounting future expected cash flows. 
These calculations use cash flow projections based on Management-approved budgets and projections which reflect 
Management’s current experience and future expectations of the markets in which the c Gu operates. r isk-adjusted 
discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 8.5% to 11.5% (2009 9.5% to 12.0%), the choice of rates 
depending on the market and maturity of the c Gu. The Group’s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital has 
decreased from the previous year reflecting principally a 1% decrease in equity premium together with a reduction in bond 
yields. The projections consist of Board-approved budgets for the following year, three-year plans and growth rates beyond 
this period. The growth rates range between 0.0% and 3.0% (2009 0.0% and 5.0%) and vary with management’s view of the 
c Gu’s market position, maturity of the relevant market and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market 
in which it operates.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of ias 36, i mpairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds 
an individual goodwill item relating to a c Gu that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0% of the total net book 
value, in comparison with the Group’s total carrying value of goodwill. Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc

The only significant item of goodwill included in the net book value above relates to Bca , a business within Metal Bulletin, 
which has a carrying value of £146.7 million (2009 £144.6 million 2008 £129.7 million) together with intangible assets with a 
carrying value of £78.0 million (2009 £84.1 million 2008 £82.4 million). The carrying value of Bca has been determined using a 
value-in-use calculation in line with ias 36. The methodology applied to the value-in-use calculations reflects past 
experience and external sources of information including:
(i) Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2011. The Directors believe these to be 
reasonably achievable.
(ii) subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
(iii) a discount rate of 8.5% and
(iv) l ong-term nominal growth rates of 3%.
using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by £125.1 million. For this business 
the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the c Gu. For the recoverable amount to be equal 
to the carrying value then the discount rate would need to be increased by 5.9% or the long-term growth rate would need to 
be reduced by 7.2%.
The carrying values of the Group’s significant items of goodwill in relation to material business combinations, which the 
Group considers to be those which have a purchase consideration in excess of £100.0 million, are further analysed as follows:

The investments above represent listed equity securities and unlisted securities, which are recorded as non-current assets 
unless they are expected to be sold within one year, in which case they are recorded as current assets. The investments in 
listed securities have no fixed maturity or coupon rate and the fair value of these investments is based on quoted market 
prices. since there is no active market upon which they are traded, other unlisted equity securities are recorded at cost less 
provision for impairment, as their fair values cannot be reliably measured.
available-for-sale investments are analysed as follows:

in December 2009, the Group sold a 50.0% interest in dmg radio australia to illyria r adio investments l imited (illyria).  
as required by iFrs 3 (2008) this transaction has been accounted for as a disposal of dmg radio a ustralia and subsequent 
acquisition of a 50% interest in the jointly controlled business. as part of this transaction illyria invested a$37.5 million of equity 
which corresponds with the acquisition fair value of the Group’s 50% stake. in addition, both the Group and illyria subscribed 
a$15.0 million each in redeemable preference shares at the time of the transaction. as a result of the funding and 
borrowings established during the transaction, a balance of a$112.5 million owed to the Group was repaid. since the Group 
has joint control over the management of this business, the Group’s remaining 50.0% interest has been accounted for as a 
joint venture. The revenue of the radio segment was £38.4 million from 17th December, 2009 to 3rd o ctober, 2010. There was 
no inter-segment revenue for this segment.
in the prior year the Group received a final payment of £1.2 million after related costs from the sale of atalink l imited, 
following agreement of their completion accounts. There is no related tax charge. The business and net assets of atalink 
l imited were sold in March 2007 and were treated as a discontinued operation up to that date.

Committed Borrowing Facilities
The Group’s bank loans bear interest charged at li Bor plus a margin based on the Group’s ratio of net debt to e BiTDa. 
additionally each facility contains a covenant based on a minimum interest cover ratio. eBiTDa for these purposes is defined 
as the aggregate of the Group’s consolidated operating profit before share of results of joint ventures and associates before 
deducting depreciation, amortisation and impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets, before exceptional items 
and before interest and finance charges. These covenants were met at the relevant test dates during the period.

The Group’s bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of the premia, direct issue costs, discounts 
and movements in hedged risks. The issue costs, premia and discounts are being amortised over the expected lives of the 
bonds using the effective interest method. The unamortised issue costs amount to £4.5 million (2009 £3.1 million  
2008 £3.4 million), the unamortised premia £13.6 million (2009 £13.9 million 2008 £15.2 million).
The fair value of the Group’s bonds have been calculated on the basis of quoted market rates.
Further details of the Group’s borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial and Treasury r eport on pages 29 to 33.
Loan notes
The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately li BiD to li BiD minus 1%. The loan notes are 
repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six-month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.
32 Financial ins Tru MenTs an D ris K Mana GeMenT
The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business. Derivative financial 
instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not 
employed for speculative purposes. Full details of the Group’s treasury policies are set out in the Financial and Treasury 
r eview on pages 32 to 33.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders’ funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the 
Group are able to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Further details of the Group’s strategy for capital risk management are set out in the Financial and Treasury r eport on  
pages 29 to 33.
Debt management
The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile. The Group’s 
principal sources of funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities. The Group is mindful of its 
credit rating, currently BB, and ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business 
requirements, after taking into account the Group’s holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution 
restrictions which exist. The Group aims to maximise the term and flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form 
of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately £100.0 million. additionally, the Group arranges its currency 
borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Group’s bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely 
medium-term cash requirements of the Group. 
associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding 
requirements. in all cases such financing is non-recourse to the c ompany.
The Group’s interim internal target of net debt to eBiTDa cover is 2.5 times whilst the limit imposed by its bank covenants is no 
greater than 4 times. The actual ratio for the year was 2.31 times (2009 2.99 times 2008 2.59 times).
Cash and liquidity risk management
The Group monitors cash balances and ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet entities’ operational 
requirements. short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash 
resources, giving due consideration to credit risk. 
Market risk management
The Group’s primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements. 
Interest rate risk management
The limit imposed by the Group’s bank covenants is at least 3 times eBiTDa to net interest. The actual ratio for the year was 
4.91 times (2009 4.45 times 2008 5.20 times). 119

The Group’s interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to 
changes in interest rates. Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating. This is 
achieved by issuing fixed-rate sterling bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate 
interest into floating rate. Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements 
and are not entered into unless such risks exist. The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows:
(i) Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Group’s bonds; c hanges in the fair value of the swaps are 
recognised in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for 
movements in the hedged risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the income 
statement. These interest rate swaps amount to £75.0 million (2009 £75.0 million 2008 £75.0 million) with the Group paying 
floating rates of between 1.24% and 3.60% (2009 1.99% and 6.03% 2008 2.38% and 5.85%).
(ii) c ross-currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps. These amounted to £227.6 million/us $435.0 million (2009 £227.6 million/
us $435.0 million 2008 £255.5 million/us $ 485.0 million) resulting in the Group paying fixed us dollar interest at rates of 
between 4.40% and 6.07% (2009 4.40% and 6.07% 2008 5.38% and 5.85%), £8.5 million/aus $20.0 million (2009 £18.8 million/
aus $45.0 million 2008 £18.8 million/aus $45.0 million) with the Group paying fixed australian dollar interest at rates of 
between 6.15% and 6.22% (2009 6.15% and 6.22% 2008 6.15% and 6.22%).
(iii) The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps. These amounted to us $100 million notional (2009 
us $100.0 million 2008 us $100.0 million) at a rate of 6.00% (2009 6.00% 2008 6.00%).
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement 
costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 3rd o ctober, 2010. The fair value of long-term borrowings 
has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management
Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other 
than that of the parent company. The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of 
denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably us dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Group’s  
overseas investments.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to 
financial instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s customer base is diversified geographically and by division with customers generally of a good financial 
standing. Before accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and sets credit 
limits by customer. The average credit period is 44 days (2009 48 days 2008 51 days). The Group considers the credit risk of 
trade receivables to be low, although the Group remains vigilant in the current economic climate. The Group reserves the 
right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although the Group does not hold collateral over any trade receivable 
balances. The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts. This provision is reviewed 
regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Group’s receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made  
where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk
The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments. as a 
result, credit risk arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are 
unsecured. The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal 
amount being hedged. The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and 
cash equivalents. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any “aa” counterparty,  
£10.0 million for “a”-rated counterparties. 
c redit risk is controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and 
investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them. The Group has no 
significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are 
banks with high credit ratings. Group policy is to have no more than £20.0 million deposited (or at risk) with any “aa” 
counterparty, £10.0 million for “a”-rated counterparties. The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure 
spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc

Cash flow hedges 
The Group enters into cash flow hedges using forward exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of 
future currency expenditure. all cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010. all amounts 
deferred in equity at the year end are expected to impact the income statement in the next 18 months when the related 
cashflows are expected to occur. 
Net investment hedges
The Group enters into forward currency sales and cross-currency swaps to hedge the Group’s investment in foreign 
operations. all net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010. 
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting 
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting represent forward contracts which provide a gain or loss equivalent to 
income tax payable or receivable on foreign exchange gains or losses incurred when intra group balances are translated to 
the closing rate at the year end. These contracts (“Tax equalisation swaps”) are marked to market with the movement in fair 
value taken to income. Tax equalisation swaps are not capable of being designated as hedging instruments under ias 39. 121

Sensitivity analysis
in managing the Group’s interest rate and currency risks, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations. 
however, changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Group’s results. 
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0 % in interest rates would have increased the Group’s finance costs 
by £1.0 million (2009 £3.7 million 2008 £3.3 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in 
equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable-rate borrowings, net 
of any interest rate swaps, at the year end date.
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0 % in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s finance 
costs by £1.0 million (2009 £4.0 million 2008 £3.3 million). There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in 
equity. This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable-rate borrowings, net 
of any interest rate swaps, as at the year end date.
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that a 10.0 % strengthening of sterling against the us dollar would have reduced the net 
loss taken to equity by £51.1 million (2009 £51.4 million 2008 £32.5 million) and increased the net loss taken to income by £nil 
(2009 £nil 2008 £2.3 million). a 10.0 % weakening of sterling against the us dollar would have increased the net loss taken to 
equity by £62.4 million (2009 £63.8 million 2008 £41.8 million) and decreased the net loss taken to income by £nil million (2009 
£nil 2008 £2.8 million). This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the foreign exchange change to the Group’s financial 
instruments which are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that a 15.0 % strengthening of sterling against the Japanese yen would have reduced 
the net loss taken to equity by £nil (2009 £nil 2008 £nil) and reduced the net loss taken to income by £nil (2009 £nil 2008 £17.7 
million). a 15.0 % weakening of sterling against the Japanese yen would have increased the net loss taken to equity by £nil 
(2009 £nil 2008 £nil) and increased the net loss taken to income by £nil (2009 £nil 2008 £24.0 million). This sensitivity has been 
calculated by applying the foreign exchange change to the Group’s financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
foreign exchange rates.
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0 % in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of 
payments would lead to a decrease in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £nil (2009 £nil 2008 £0.1 
million).
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0 % in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments 
would lead to an increase in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of £nil (2009 £nil 2008 £0.1 million). 123

Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purpose of measuring fair value
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
l evel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted process (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities;
l evel 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within l evel 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices); and
l evel 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Group operates a number of pension schemes covering most major Group companies under which contributions are 
paid by the employer and employees.
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on final 
pensionable salary in addition to a number of defined contribution pension arrangements. The defined benefit schemes in 
the uK and some defined contribution plans are administered by trustees or trustee companies.
The Group has been progressively introducing a number of pensionsaver group personal pension plans to provide a 
consistent pensions saving vehicle across all Group divisions. These plans have replaced the trust-based defined contribution 
arrangements which are now in the final stages of being wound up.
The assets of all the pension schemes and plans are held independently from the Group’s finances.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010 were £27.7 million (2009 £1.1 million  
net income).
Defined Benefit Schemes
Following the changes announced last year affecting the harmsworth pension scheme, the Group announced in 
september 2010 that a similar limit on future pay increases counting towards pension will apply to all the significant defined 
benefit schemes of the Group. The Group’s proposals will mean that accrued and future benefits in these schemes will 
increase at or below the prevailing rate of inflation, with inflation capped at 5%. This has resulted in an exceptional credit to 
pension costs in respect of the defined benefit schemes of £9.9 million in the year ended 3rd o ctober, 2010 (2009, £27.4 
million). The c ompany continues to develop a series of measures principally designed to limit the company’s exposure to 
people living longer than is currently expected. These measures have been discussed with scheme trustees and a formal 
process of employee consultation will begin in December 2010. The Group expects that this package of changes will secure 
the future of the schemes, which will continue to provide a valuable retirement provision for scheme members. 
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the actuary using the projected unit 
credit method. work in connection with the actuarial valuation of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2010 has commenced 
and the provisional results are expected to become available towards the end of 2010 with a funding agreement between 
the company and trustees in place by the statutory deadline, June 2011. The figures in this note are based on calculations 
using membership data as at 30th september, 2010, along with asset valuations and cash flow information from the schemes 
for the year to 3rd o ctober, 2010. 
The funding strategy agreed with the trustees of the principal schemes in connection with the 2007 valuation made 
allowance for assumed future investment returns on the scheme’s assets of 3.3 % p.a. above price inflation, compared with 
the real return of some 2.6 % p.a. implicit within the calculation of the technical provisions (i.e. the value of the scheme’s 
benefit liabilities). The c ompany agreed with the trustees that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and the 
c ompany put in place letters of credit of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment 
return arising prior to the next triennial valuation. as at 3rd o ctober, 2010, the letters of credit had a value of £54.5 million 
(2009 £32.1 million). post year-end, on 5th o ctober, 2010, the Group made funding payments to the main schemes totalling 
£10.0 million in exchange for which the trustees agreed that the value of the letters of credit could be reduced by a 
corresponding amount.
c ash contributions paid by the c ompany to the principal scheme as required by the schedule of contributions remain at the 
same level of 18.0 % of members’ scheme salaries (2009 18.0 %) with employees contributing either 5.0 % or 7.5 % depending 
on which section of the scheme they are in. however, since 1st January, 2009 a majority of members have agreed to a salary 
sacrifice arrangement whereby the c ompany pays the equivalent of the employee’s contribution in exchange for a 
corresponding reduction in salary. in addition, the c ompany agreed to make a series of funding payments amounting to 
£3.2 million over a period of 27 months commencing in september, 2009. in the year to 3rd o ctober, 2010 the Group paid 
£1.0 million in accordance with that agreement (2009, £1.0 million). 
at 3rd o ctober, 2010, the defined benefit obligation to the Group relating to the DMGT avc p lan, as measured for the 
purposes of this disclosure under the requirements of ias 19, was £61.8 million (2009 £60.9 million). The assets of the plan were 
£52.1 million (2009 £51.5 million), producing a deficit of £9.7 million (2009 £9.4 million deficit). The plan is closed to further 
member contributions. 
The triennial valuation of the plan showed that the combined accumulated assets as at 31st March, 2008 represented 100.0% 
of the plan’s technical provisions in respect of past service benefits. in common with the majority of defined benefit schemes 
there was a sharp deterioration in the funding position of the plan over the following 12 months with the funding level, 
measured on a technical provisions basis, falling to 80.0% as at 31st March, 2009. however, recent quarterly updates provided 
to the Trustee indicate that the funding position has since improved. The Group has not been required to make contribution 
payments in respect of the plan. The next actuarial valuation of the plan is due to take place as at 31st March, 2011.
Members of the defined benefit schemes are able to make additional voluntary contributions (avc s) into unit-linked funds 
held within each scheme. n o benefit obligation arises to the Group from these avc s and the related unit-linked avc assets 
have been excluded from the scheme assets reported in the following tables. 129

The international Financial r eporting interpretations c ommittee, in its document iFric 14, has interpreted the extent to which 
a company can recognise a pension surplus on its statement of Financial position. having taken account of the rules of the 
schemes, the fact that the schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and 
cash contributions, the c ompany considers that recognition of surpluses in the schemes on its statement of Financial position 
is in accordance with the interpretations of iFric 14. i n 2010 and 2009 all schemes were in deficit. in 2008, the two main 
schemes were in deficit, the Metal Bulletin scheme was in surplus and the DMGT avc p lan had its assets capped to the value 
of the liabilities.
The deficit for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax asset of £73.3 million (2009 £120.5 million 2008  
£11.5 million).

£0.1 million (2009 £0.1 million, 2008 £0.2 million).
The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset 
class based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year. The expected return on bonds has 
been selected having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year. The expected returns on equities and 
property are based on a combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields 
on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns. 
The actual return on plan assets was £188.6 million (2009 l oss of £51.7 million 2008 loss of £219.9 million) representing the 
expected return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table:

Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.00  5.40  7.00 
expected overall rate of return on assets 6.60  7.00  7.50 
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the period end date on high-quality corporate bonds. The 
assumption for salary growth has been adjusted to take account of the limit on the extent to which expected future pay 
increases will count towards pension accrued and being earned in the schemes. all assumptions were selected after taking 
actuarial advice.
Mortality assumptions take account of scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy 
based on ‘medium cohort’ projections but with a minimum rate of reduction in mortality rates in future of 1% per annum. 
allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement 
and for the proportion of members with dependants at retirement eligible for a pension. 131

UK defined contribution plans 
The Group has introduced a number of pensionsaver group personal pension plans that have replaced the trust-based 
defined contribution pension plans previously offered to employees. These plans create a consistent pensions savings vehicle 
across all Group divisions. 
The aggregate value of the group personal pension plans and the remaining trust-based defined contribution pension plans 
was £39.1 million (2009 £29.6 million 2008 £24.5 million) at the year end. The pension cost attributable to these plans during 
the year amounted to £2.6 million (2009 £1.1 million 2008 £4.4 million). 
Overseas pension plans 
o verseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in north 
america and australia. The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to £2.2 million (2009 £1.4 million 
2008 £3.3 million). 
Pension arrangements for executives 
The Group operates a contributory defined benefit scheme for senior executives (including some executive Directors), details 
of which are included in the above disclosures. however, no executive Directors accrued further pension during the year. 
Stakeholder pension 
DMGT provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for the other pension 
schemes operated by the Group. 133

(i) The adjustment to goodwill/contingent consideration relates to prior-period acquisitions only.
(ii) o ther current provisions principally comprise dilapidation provisions of £0.3 million (2009 £0.1 million 2008 £0.1 million), 
and provisions for national insurance of £0.7 million (2009 £nil 2008 £nil). 
 o ther non-current provisions principally comprise dilapidation provisions of £1.6 million (2009 £1.7 million 2008 £1.7 million). 
The Group’s coupon discount and redundancy and reorganisation provisions are all expected to be utilised within the next 
12 months. The lease provisions are dependent on the terms of the lease whilst the timing of cash flows for legal disputes 
have been split using Directors’ best estimates. 
The uncertainties surrounding and the nature of the Group’s contingent consideration provisions are disclosed in critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (note 2). The maturity profile of the Group’s contingent 
consideration provision is as follows:

The contingent consideration is based on future business valuations and profit multiples and has been estimated on an 
acquisition by acquisition basis using available data forecasts. The range of undiscounted outcomes for contingent 
consideration is £3.2 million to £47.4 million. c ertain contingent consideration arrangements are not capped since they are 
based on future business performance.

are analysed as follows:

n orth america 55.1 59.1 41.8 
australia 3.7 1.9 1.5 
89.9 79.3 44.9 
These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, 
that sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is 
considered probable that these assets will be recovered. o f these assets, £41.9 million will expire between 2017 and 2029.  
The remaining assets have no expiry date.
included in the credit to income of £31.2 million (2009 £68.7 million) is £0.5 million (2009 £15.4 million) relating to  
discontinued operations. 
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £89.2 million (2009 £68.0 million 2008 £24.0 million) which relates to trading 
losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future. o f these assets  
£17.2 million will expire in 2029 and £19.0 million will expire between 2017 and 2029. The remaining assets have no expiry  
date. There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of £42.2 million (2009 
£23.6 million 2008 £29.4 million).
n o deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £68.2 million (2009 £52.9 million 2008 £621.8 million) 
relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these 
temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at  
3rd o ctober, 2010 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the uK of those 
earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of a dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax 
jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate. 
The uK government has announced a future decrease in the uK corporation tax rate from 27.0 % to 24.0 % over the next three 
years. The impact of these proposed rate changes would be to reduce the uK deferred tax assets included within non-
current assets from £104.2 million to £92.6 million if they were all to reverse at 24.0 %.

The two classes of shares are equal in all respects, except that the ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting shares do not have voting rights 
and hence their holders are not entitled to vote at general meetings of the c ompany.
During the year the c ompany disposed of 2,942,161 ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting shares, in order to satisfy incentive schemes.  
This represented 0.79% of the called up ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting share capital at 3rd o ctober, 2010.
The c ompany also purchased 2,862,747 ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting shares having a nominal value of £357,843 to match 
obligations under incentive plans. The consideration paid for these shares was £7.9 million. shares repurchased during the 
period represented 0.77% of the called up ‘a’ o rdinary n on-voting share capital at 3rd o ctober, 2010.
at 3rd o ctober, 2010 options were outstanding under the terms of the c ompany’s 1997 and 2006 executive share o ption

The Group’s most significant leasing arrangements relate to rented properties. The Group negotiates lease contracts 
according to the Group’s needs with a view to balancing stability and security of tenure and lease terms with the risk of 
entering into excessively long or onerous arrangements. o f the Group’s rented properties, the most significant commitment 
relates to the head office premises at 2 Derry street, l ondon w8 5TT. This lease expires on 25th December, 2022. 
The Group entered into arrangements with its ink suppliers to obtain ink for the period to september 2015 at competitive 
prices and to secure supply. at the year end, the commitment to purchase ink over this period was £109.6 million (2009 £130.5 
million 2008 £148.6 million). 
The Group has entered into agreements with certain printers for periods up to 2022 at competitive prices and to secure 
supply. at the year end, the commitment to purchase printing capacity over this period was £130.8 million (2009 £141.9 million 
2008 £65.1 million). 
Contingent liabilities 
as set out in note 33 the Group has issued stand-by letters of credit in favour of the trustees of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension fund amounting to £54.5 million (2009 £37.8 million 2008 £64.3 million) together with other guarantees of £8.1 million 
(2009 £5.3 million 2008 £9.2million). 
The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and vigorously defends against claims received.  
The Group makes provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims when incurred and provides for any settlement 
costs when such an outcome is judged probable. 
Four writs claiming damages for libel were issued in Malaysia against the company and three of its employees in respect of 
an article published in one of the company’s magazines, international c ommercial l itigation, in n ovember 1995. The writs 
were served on the company on o ctober 22, 1996. Two of these writs have been discontinued. The total outstanding amount 
claimed on the two remaining writs is Malaysian ringgits 82.0 million (£14.8 million). n o provision has been made for these 
claims in these financial statements as the Directors do not believe the company has any material liability in respect of these 
writs. 
40 share- BaseD payMenTs
The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees. The principal 
schemes comprise share options under the DMGT, euromoney and within DMG information, r isk Management solutions

RMS options plan 
r Ms options were granted at market value. The options become exercisable after a four year vesting period and lapse after 
10 years from grant date. previously, the stock issued under the plan was subject to a nine month holding period, which has 
been subsequently removed during 2007. The stock issued under the plan is subject to put or call options where DMGT has 
the right to settle in DMGT ‘a’ o rdinary shares or cash. The options plan classification changed from a cash settled plan in 
June 2005 to an equity settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan.

Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 (CAP 2010) 
The cap 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21st January, 2010 and is a revised version of 
and replaces the previously approved cap 2009. cap 2010 is the direct replacement for cap 2004 as no further awards may 
be granted under cap 2004. each cap 2010 award comprises two equal elements – an option to subscribe for ordinary 
shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share, and a right to receive a cash 
payment. The awards will vest in two equal tranches. The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of the 
primary or secondary performance condition and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30th september, 2020. The second 
tranche of awards becomes exercisable in a subsequent financial year in which the profits achieved in the year of initial 
vesting are again achieved. The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary (or secondary) performance 
condition and an additional performance condition. The number of options received under the share award of the cap 
2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 c ompany share o ption plan (see below).
The cap 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net 
present value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise. The expected term of the option 
used in the models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Company Share Option Plan (CSOP 2010) 
in parallel with the cap 2010, the shareholders approved the csop 2010 u K and c anada at the aGM on 21st January, 2010. 
The csop 2010 u K was approved by hM r evenue and c ustoms on 21st June, 2010 and granted on 28th June, 2010. The csop 
2010 uK option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the company at a price of £6.03 per share, the 
market value at the date of grant. The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding 
share award under the cap 2010 providing the csop option is in the money at that time and does not vest before 28th June, 
2013. The csop 2010 c anada, granted on 30th March, 2010, enables each participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the 
company at a price of £5.01 per share, the market value at the date of grant. n o option may vest after the date falling three 
months after the preliminary announcement of the results for the financial year ended 30th september, 2019, and the option 
shall lapse to the extent unvested at the time. The csop has the same performance criteria as that of the cap 2010 as set out 
above. The number of csop 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the cap 2010, 
the csop effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the cap 2010 award. The csop 2010 option exercise price of £6.03 
(uK) and £5.01 (c anada) will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the csop 
options (calculated as the market price of the company’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by 
the number of options exercised) delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the award had been 
delivered using £0.0025 cap options.

The number of csop 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the cap 2010, the 
csop effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the cap 2010 award. The csop 2010 options have an exercise price of 
£6.031, which will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which results in the same net gain on these options delivered 
in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same award had been delivered using £0.0025 cap options. The 
amount of the funding award will depend on the company’s share price at the date of exercise. Because of the above and 
the other direct links between the csop 2010 and the cap 2010, including the identical performance criteria, i Frs 2 ‘ share 
based payments’ combines the two plans and treats them as one plan (vesting in two tranches). as such the long term 
incentive expense recognised in the year for the csop 2010 and cap 2010 options (including the charge in relation to the 
cash element) was £3,947,000 (2009 £nil).
1. exercise price of c anadian csop is £5.01.
2. n et gain on the csop options is the market price of the company’s shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price 
(£6.031) multiplied by the number of options exercised.

The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 (CAP 2004)
The cap 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 1st February, 2005. each of the cap awards 
comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per 
ordinary share. The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent 
unexercised on 30th september, 2014. The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the 
option pool (a maximum of 7.5 million shares) was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards. o ne third of the 
awards vested immediately. The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional 
performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009. The primary 
performance target was also achieved in 2009 and 1,521,498 options (including a true-up adjustment of 5,654) for the third 
(final) tranche of options in 2009 vested in February 2010. For those individual participants’ businesses where the additional 
performance conditions for the second and final tranche have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at 
least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending 30th september, 2012. The directors 
estimate 303,321 of options will vest in February 2011 following satisfaction of the additional performance test.
The cap options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of the grant for the net 
present value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of the expected exercise.

noTes To The coMpany Balance sheeT – uK Gaap
1 Basis o F prepara Tion
The separate financial statements of the 
c ompany are prepared under the 
historical cost convention, modified to 
include the revaluation to fair value of 
certain financial instruments as 
described below, in accordance with 
the c ompanies act 2006 and uK 
Generally accepted accounting 
principles (uK Gaap). The following 
paragraphs describe the main 
accounting policies under uK Gaap, 
which have been applied consistently 
in both the current and prior year.
profit for the financial year
as permitted by section 480 of the 
c ompanies act 2006, a separate profit 
and loss account for the c ompany has 
not been included in these accounts. 
The c ompany’s profit after tax for the 
year, calculated on a uK Gaap basis, 
was £142.0 million (2009 loss £149.9 
million).
impact of amendments to 
accounting standards
in the current year certain minor 
amendments to uK financial reporting 
standards were issued by the uK 
accounting standards Board. The 
adoption of these amendments has not 
had any impact on the c ompany’s 
accounting policies.
2  siGni Fican T accoun TinG 
policies
intangible fixed assets
intangible assets principally comprise 
purchased trademarks and are 
capitalised and amortised through the 
profit and loss account over the lower of 
their useful economic lives and a period 
of 20 years.
The c ompany tests intangible assets at 
the end of the first financial year after 
acquisition and where there is any 
indication of impairment, or more 
frequently if there are indicators that 
the intangible assets might be impaired. 
w hen testing for impairment, the 
recoverable amounts for all the 
c ompany’s income generating units 
(iGus) are measured at their value in 
use by discounting future expected 
cash flows. These calculations use cash 
flow projections based on 
management approved budgets and 
projections which reflect 
management’s current experience and 
future expectations of the markets in 
which the iGu operates. 
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on all tangible 
fixed assets at rates calculated to write 
off the cost, less estimated residual 
value, of each asset on a straight line 
basis over its expected useful life. some 
of the c ompany’s tangible fixed assets 
are artworks with a residual value at 
least equal to cost and therefore no 
depreciation has been applied in either 
the current or prior period on the basis 
that any change would not be material.
Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than 
the entity’s reporting currency are 
recorded at the exchange rate 
prevailing on the date of the 
transaction. at each balance sheet 
date, monetary items denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. n on-monetary items carried 
at fair value that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rate prevailing on the date when 
fair value was determined. n on-
monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. 
exchange differences arising on the 
settlement of monetary items, and on 
the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in the income statement for 
the period. 
investments
investments in subsidiaries are stated at 
cost, less any provision for impairment, 
where appropriate. 
o ther investments are classified as 
either held for trading or available-for-
sale and are measured at either fair 
value or at cost less provision for 
impairment where fair value cannot be 
reliably determined.
w here investments are classified as held 
for trading, gains and losses arising from 
changes in fair value are included in 
net profit or loss for the period. For 
available-for-sale investments, gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair 
value are recognised directly in equity, 
until the investment is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which 
time the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is 
included in the net profit or loss for the 
period. impairment charges are 
recorded in the profit and loss account 
when they occur.
investments and financial assets are 
recognised and de-recognised on a 
trade date where a purchase or sale of 
an investment is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the 
investment within the time frame 
established by the market concerned, 
and are measured at fair value, 
including transaction costs.
Taxation
c urrent tax, including uK corporation 
tax and foreign tax, is provided at 
amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax is provided in 
full on timing differences that result in 
an obligation at the balance sheet 
date to pay more tax, or a right to pay 
less tax, at a future date, at rates 
expected to apply when they crystallise 
based on current tax rates and law. 
Timing differences arise from the 
inclusion of items of income and 
expenditure in taxation computations in 
periods different from those in which 
they are included in financial 
statements. Deferred tax is not provided 
on timing differences arising from the 
revaluation of fixed assets where there is 
no commitment to sell the asset, or on 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and 
associates where there is no 
commitment to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is regarded as more 
likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax is not 
discounted.
Financial instruments disclosures
Financial assets
– Trade debtors

estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
– Cash and cash equivalents 
c ash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash in hand, short-term deposits and 
other short-term highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible

Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments
Financial liabilities and equity 
instruments issued by the c ompany are 
classified according to the substance of 
the contractual arrangements entered 
into. an equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the c ompany 
after deducting all of its liabilities. 
– Trade creditors
Trade creditors are not interest bearing 
and are stated at their nominal value. 
– Capital market and bank borrowings
interest bearing loans and overdrafts 
are initially measured at fair value 
(which is equal to net proceeds at 
inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost, using the 
effective interest rate method. a portion 
of the c ompany’s bonds are subject to 
fair value hedge accounting and this 
portion of the carrying value is adjusted 
for the movement in the hedged risk to 
the extent hedge effectiveness is 
achieved. any difference between the 
proceeds, net of transaction costs and 
the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over the term 
of the borrowing.
– Equity instruments 
equity instruments issued by the Group 
are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset 
and the net amount reported in the 
balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to settle on a net 
basis, or realise the asset and liability 
simultaneously.
Derivative financial instruments and 
hedge accounting
The c ompany’s activities expose it to 
the financial risks of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. The 
c ompany uses various derivative 
financial instruments to manage its 
exposure to these risks.
The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the Group’s policies, 
which are set out on pages 32 and 33 of 
the Financial and Treasury r eview and 
approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provide written principles on the 
use of financial derivatives consistent 
with the c ompany’s risk management 
strategy. The c ompany does not use 
derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
The c ompany does not apply hedge 
accounting except for fair value 
hedges. Gains and losses arising on 
derivatives that form part of net 
investment hedge or cash flow hedge 
relationships in the consolidated 
financial statements are recorded in the 
profit and loss account in the c ompany.
Financial instruments – disclosures
The c ompany has taken advantage of 
the exemption provided in Frs 29, 
Financial instruments : Disclosures which 
states that disclosure in respect of 
financial instruments is not required in 
parent company financial statements 
where such disclosures are included in 
publicly available consolidated 
financial statements.
c ash flow statement
The c ompany has utilised the 
exemptions provided under Frs 1 
(r evised) and has not presented a cash 
flow statement. a consolidated cash 
flow statement has been presented in 
the Group’s annual r eport.
r elated party transactions
The c ompany has taken advantage of 
the exemptions of Frs 8 which states 
that disclosure of related party 
transactions is not required in the parent 
company financial statements when 
those statements are presented 
together with its consolidated financial 
statements.
share-based payments
The c ompany operates the Group’s l Tip 
and other Group share based payment 
schemes, details of which can be found 
in note 40 of the Group’s annual r eport.
r etirement benefits
The c ompany contributes to defined 
benefit and defined contribution 
pension schemes on behalf of its 
employees. These are managed on a 
Group basis and so the c ompany is 
unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities in the 
defined benefit scheme in which it 
participates on a consistent and 
reasonable basis. The scheme is 
operated on an aggregate basis with 
no segregation of the assets to 
individual participating employers and, 
therefore, the same contribution rate is 
charged to all participating employers; 
the contribution rate charged to each 
employer being affected by the 
experience of the scheme as a whole. 
The scheme is therefore accounted for 
as a defined contribution scheme by 
the c ompany. This means that the 
pension charge reported in these 
financial statements is the same as the 
cash contributions due in the period. 
Details of the financial position and key 
valuation assumptions of these schemes 
can be found in note 33 of the Group’s 
annual r eport. Daily Mail anD General TrusT plc

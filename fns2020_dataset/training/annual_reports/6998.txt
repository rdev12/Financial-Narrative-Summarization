Business Model
Halfords has core competences in marketing, branding, store 
retailing, distribution and international sourcing which allow value 
to be generated while meeting market needs. It is now leveraging 
these competences into Car Servicing.
Range strategy follows our strategic thread of “life on the move” 
and encompasses Car Maintenance, Car Enhancement and 
Leisure categories. Halfords has grown market share, 
consolidating fragmented markets with a national store network 
and strong brand management.
Evolving buyer trends have been met by developing a dynamic 
web offer which has enabled the Company to leverage average 
transaction values and drive many web customers into stores.
With the evolution of more compact and complex vehicles, the 
reduced interest for self service and an escalating main dealer 
service price list, Halfords has augmented the retail offer with 
in-store fitting services. This increases average transaction value, 
and allow store colleagues to up-sell and attach accessories to 
the sales whilst improving customer service and loyalty.
The successful expansion of our retail offer through in-store 
services has driven the decision to invest in car servicing given 
similar market drivers to our successful Car Maintenance 
category. Halfords now also runs the largest chain of UK car 
service centres providing service, repair and MOTs.
As a retailer Halfords makes a profit from the combination of  
low cost sourcing and supply chain coupled with excellent 
marketing skills and a national store network, leveraging these 
skills in the car service sector by running an efficient service offer 
that profits from scale and efficiency. Halfords Autocentres 
provides services cheaper than most franchised garages and 
more comprehensively than many independent garages.
“Range strategy follows our 
strategic thread of ‘life on the 
move’ and runs from cycles to car 
maintenance”
Our customers lead busy lives — there aren’t enough hours in 
the day. The school run, the commute, the pick-ups and drop-
offs, the visits to families and friends, the holidays and free time. 
Each year families make thousands of journeys as essential parts 
of their daily lives. They need to keep moving for work and family 
and they want to travel for their holidays and enjoy active leisure 
time wherever possible. Our customers are living their lives on 
the move. 
At Halfords we understand how journeys are at the heart of work 
and family life, and through our great products, expert advice 
and service we are focused on helping our customers stay on 
the move. We stock the products they need to maintain and 
enhance their vehicles and we have cycles for every age and 
discipline. Through our expert colleagues we offer advice and 
added value services to ensure our customers make the best 
choices around their “life on the move”.

 Introduction
Chairman’s Statement
Financial year 2011 has seen an extended period of economic 
uncertainty and a fragile consumer market, a new Government in 
May 2010, an austerity budget in June and an increase in VAT to 
20% in January 2011. Recognising this backdrop, management 
has focused on strengthening the core Halfords Retail division 
and on delivering its development plan for the recently acquired 
Autocentres business. 
In Retail, revenue was down 5.2% reflecting the tough trading 
environment, but operating profit rose by 1.5% (excluding Central 
Europe) due to both margin expansion and costs being tightly 
managed. A number of significant change initiatives including the 
reconfiguration of the Group’s warehouse and distribution 
network and the remodelling of staffing structures began to bear 
fruit, albeit after some disruption during the year, and the closure 
of our Central European operations was completed as 
scheduled. Our Autocentres business contributed £7million 
operating profit in its first full year and, although below our initial 
target, we are pleased with this investment. 
As a result, growth in both underlying profit before tax of 7.2% 
and in earnings per share of 8.8% was achieved. Importantly, 
cash generation was robust, as is the Group’s financial position. 
This has enabled the Board to recommend a final dividend of 14 
pence per share resulting in a total of 22 pence for the year, an 
increase of 10% over the dividend of 20 pence paid last year. 
The strength of the Group’s cash flows and financial position will 
enable the Board to ensure that shareholders continue to enjoy 
an attractive dividend distribution in the years ahead.
In November 2010, we secured a four year £300m revolving 
credit facility. This provides the Group with sufficient headroom 
and undrawn financing facilities to service its operating activities, 
working capital and on-going capital investment. In addition, in 
April 2011 we commenced a £75m share buyback programme. 
This reflects the Board’s policy of maintaining an efficient capital 
structure.
Halfords Retail maintains market-leading positions across a 
unique blend of product categories that are made available to 
customers via a truly national 466 store network and a highly 
responsive multichannel offer. To complement the product offer, 
store colleagues are charged with providing expert customer 
advice and delivering a suite of value-for-money wefit services. 
Dedication to this high service mantra for our customers is 
sacrosanct and non-negotiable.
Having acquired Nationwide Autocentres in February 2010, we 
have embarked upon a re-branding of the entire network. This 
was concluded in March 2011 and was heralded by the launch 
of a new radio advertising campaign and revamped website. 
Since then, the boost in revenues has been most encouraging. 
The plan remains to open some 30 stores in FY12. 
As the Group entrenches its reputation as the UK’s natural 
destination for “Life on the move”, products and services, we 
launched a consolidated national advertising campaign “that’s 
helpful that’s halfords”. The objective is to reinforce the service 
proposition that Halfords offers to its customers through a simple 
message.
At a time when the environment has been difficult for customers, 
David Wild, our Chief Executive Officer, and his experienced 
executive team have managed the business with vigour. They 
have adopted a trading strategy that offers great value, expert 
services and many new products, including the re-launch of our 
entire Premium Cycle range and the re-branding of the Halfords 
Autocentres, whilst maintaining a clear focus on cost control 
across the Group.
“To complement the product offer, 
store colleagues are charged with 
providing expert customer advice and 
delivering a suite of value-for-money 
wefit services. ”

This year we welcomed to the board, Claudia Arney, who provides the 
board with broad multichannel experience, David Adams, with deep 
experience in retail and finance and who now chairs the Audit 
Committee, and Andrew Findlay as Finance Director with strong retail 
and finance credentials, latterly with Marks & Spencer. Nigel Wilson has 
stepped down from the board after seven years having been Audit 
Committee chairman and latterly our SID. Nick Wharton, our previous 
Finance Director also left the board after four years as a director with 
Halfords. We wish them both well and thank them for their dedicated 
service. 
The Board has endeavoured to provide strong entrepreneurial 
leadership and governance. We have met on a number of occasions 
outside the scheduled nine meeting calendar as the need arose to 
consider new opportunities and challenges. Each member is actively 
engaged in interacting frequently with the management and my key role 
as chairman is to provide an open and challenging environment on the 
board. Given the recent changes to the board, we decided to postpone 
our annual board review until late in the year to give the new members 
the opportunity to settle in to Halfords. We then undertook a more 
personalised Board evaluation process than in the past, the learning’s 
of which will be adopted in the year ahead.
On behalf of the board, I would like to thank the 9,300 loyal and 
dedicated Halfords colleagues in the store network, head office and 
distribution centres who have responded so positively to the needs of 
our customers and to the many initiatives implemented this year, and 
also to the 1,700 Autocentre staff who have performed so well in their 
first year as Halfords colleagues. 
Since the beginning of the 2012 financial year, the underlying UK 
consumer environment has remained difficult though the unusually 
warm weather and proximity of numerous bank holidays in April 
resulted in a surge in retail spending. This was particularly evident in our 
Cycling and Travel Solutions categories on the back of an improving 
trend in the last quarter of FY11. Within Autocentres, the customer 
response to the re-branding has been heartening and the long-term 
growth opportunity of this business remains compelling. We have, 
however, drawn up our plans for the year ahead on the assumption of a 
challenging environment for the remainder of the year and will continue 
to pursue a strategy that further strengthens Halfords’ unique market-
leading product, multichannel and service propositions.

Market Review
Our Customers 
The economic climate during the last year has created uncertainty for 
customers and reduced household incomes. All retailers have been 
affected through a reduction in discretionary expenditure on non-
essential purchases and we have also seen customers delaying items 
like car repairs and servicing. A secondary effect is that fuel prices have 
led to motorists reducing mileage and hence their need for car products 
associated with normal wear and tear. 
As a result sales across the year have been more difficult and we have 
not grown sales at the levels we would like to. 
Even in a tougher climate Halfords looks to drive sales. Our response 
has been to focus on the needs of our customers for better value and 
to work hard to deliver this through a combination of great prices, 
innovative quality products and expert advice and service. 
Looking to the year ahead we expect it to be just as demanding for our 
customers.
Halfords has market-leading positions in long-term resilient categories 
and we have worked hard to rebalance our prices and reinvigorate our 
ranges with innovative new products. Our Autocentres have been 
rebranded and we are now leveraging the strength of the Halfords 
brand in that market. We have launched initiatives to deliver sales 
growth and supported these with a new marketing campaign — “that’s 
helpful that’s halfords” — which emphasises Halfords’ credentials. 
These initiatives give us the potential to trade more strongly in the year 
ahead.
Halfords Retail
We retail from 466 stores in the UK and ROI, of which 402 are 
“Superstores”, 29 are mid-sized “Compact” stores and 35 are the 
smaller “Metro” stores. In most catchments the preferred location is a 
7,500 sq ft unit on an edge of town retail park with parking for around 
20 cars. This is allows us to locate a superstore format which can carry 
some 10,000 lines. 
Around the country 90% of the UK population are within a 20 minute 
drive of one our stores.
The Halfords retail business is split across three main product 
categories: “Car Maintenance”, “Car Enhancement” and “Leisure”. 
Our UK and ROI websites carry our most comprehensive product 
selection and currently display 14,400 product lines. They received 40.5 
million visitors in the year to March 2011. Our web traffic is growing at 
an annual rate of 35% and 81% of online sales are through our industry 
leading Reserve and Collect channel. Here customers buy online and 
collect from their nearest store, which allows us to provide further 
advice for customers and additional sales of accessories. 
In the product categories, Car Maintenance is market-led with 
customers making needs based purchases. These are either to replace 
worn or failed parts like car bulbs, wiper blades and batteries or to 
meet legislative, manufacturer guidelines or safety concerns. This 
market is relatively robust and driven by the large and ageing UK car 
parc. Car Enhancement is technology led and depends largely on 
innovation to drive the market; it also responds to changes in 
discretionary income. Leisure covers a wide range, of which cycling is 
the largest proportion but also includes travel solutions, child safety and 
camping products where we drive business through both awareness 
and promotional activities.
United Kingdom (UK) & Republic of Ireland (ROI)
The Halfords business operates through retail stores, Autocentres and 
websites in the UK & ROI. We continue to grow market share in our core 
markets sectors where we have leading positions in attractive markets. 
Our unique proposition creates value for customers through a combination of 
range, price, quality and service delivered through our multichannel offer by 
our colleagues who extend expert advice and service, thus differentiating 
Halfords from its competition.
The UK has been the core market since the Company was founded in 1892 
and we have operated in the ROI since 2006. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Halfords Autocentres
Halfords Autocentres is the largest independent chain of car service 
garages in the country, comprising 240 centres. The chain was acquired 
in February 2010 and over the last year it has been fully rebranded as 
Halfords Autocentres. The car maintenance market is worth 
approximately £9bn annually, of which Halfords has approximately a 1% 
market share. The market is fragmented: at one end are the more 
expensive franchise dealers and at the other small independent garages. 
Since rebranding, the centres have been relaunched with a national 
advertising campaign to raise awareness and more proactive customer 
relationship management. 
The majority of the business is from direct retail clients where most of 
the cars are over three years old. Advanced client relationship systems 
manage the retention of this type of business and the Halfords brand is 
expected to add further value to an already successful service offer.
Fleet customers tend to operate cars under three years old and 
recognise the cost saving benefits of a non-franchised, high quality, 
national organisation.

Business Review
Extending Range and Services 
Halfords’ trading strategy is aimed at increasing the number of 
products purchased by customers on each visit to a store 
through dynamic use of store space in order to sell products 
which are seasonally relevant or which are being specifically 
promoted. The Directors have also increased staff participation in 
sales-related incentive schemes and have implemented specific 
incentives at peak trading periods to help drive sales.
The Directors intend to continue to leverage Halfords’ brands 
into new categories and new product ranges within existing 
categories. This is one route to increasing sales. During the year 
we introduced a variety of new products across our categories. 
These include innovative new designs like longer life car light 
bulbs, extension of our existing ranges, like new camping lines 
and entirely new ranges like our mobility products. In the coming 
year we will launch three new cycle ranges within our own brand 
Carrera, and our exclusive Voodoo and Boardman ranges. 
Investing in the Store Portfolio 
We are also expanding the services we offer. Halfords has a 
progressive approach to service, that provides fitting of many of 
the products that we sell. We now fit 23% of all the blades, bulbs 
and batteries we sell. We will also undertake oil top-ups and fit 
Sat Navs, child seats and roof boxes. Our move into Autocentres 
is a significant demonstration of our approach to extending the 
service that we offer motorists to include mechanical repairs, 
MOT and car servicing offer.
The Group has considerable experience in both converting 
existing stores and opening new stores. This year we have 
opened five new stores, closed one and relocated three, as well 
as refurbishing 26 others. Our active store refresh programme is 
working across the estate to rebalance the store layout and 
signage around the key areas of growth and customer focus 
within our stores.

at £296.2m, were down 7.4% on the prior year. This decrease 
reflected reductions across all key cost categories. The benefits 
from the review of store labour rotas and structures combined 
with lower than planned colleague store incentive payments 
drove an £8.7m reduction in store staffing costs. Warehouse and 
Distribution costs fell marginally by 0.8%.
Leveraging the Halfords brand in multichannel
A major facet of our strategy is to stay at the forefront of 
multichannel development. Our brand is growing rapidly online 
as customers turn to the internet to research and buy products. 
We have invested in our dot com platform and developed a true 
multichannel approach where 85% of our internet purchases are 
researched and collected from our stores. Our unique product 
mix strongly favours added value, so when customers come to 
store we can offer further advice and fitting services.

Business Review
Autocentre Strategy
Maintaining and growing service advantage 
The Service market consists of three broad segments. At one 
extreme are the franchised dealers: slick, credible and trusted 
but very costly and prepared to only operate at their own pace. 
At the other extreme are the small private garages and 
mechanics, a generally less polished experience and frequently 
without the security of a large organisation’s resources, but the 
costs are lower. The Autocentres business is the perfect balance. 
We are always more competitive than franchised dealers and we 
have the brand and reputation to put customers at ease and the 
diagnostic computer technology to maintain most cars without 
affecting warranties. 
We are also targeting increased penetration of the fleet market. 
There is growing realisation amongst fleet operators that our 
business offers them the scope to lower the cost of maintaining 
their vehicles without compromising the quality of the service 
they receive in any way. 
Investing in new centres 
The second pillar of our sales growth strategy is to increase the 
number of centres. Our research on the geography and 
demographics of the £9bn car servicing and repair market and of 
our local catchment sizes shows that there is scope for up 
to 600 Autocentre locations throughout Britain. We will add new 
centres at the rate of approximately 30 further locations per year 
until we reach this point.
Maintaining low cost structure 
We aim to increase sales in existing centres and make use of 
spare capacity in our technicians. Jobs per productive worker 
per week have improved from 12.5 to 13.8 over the last five 
years and we believe we can raise this to at least 17, i.e. a further 
19% increase in revenue without needing more fixed cost or 
more labour. We aim to improve customer retention at our 
existing centres: over the last five years this has increased from 
43% to 51.5% and we believe we can ultimately achieve 60%+. 
We will achieve this through better marketing and use of 
customer data. Our main commitment though is to the highest 
levels of customer service and we measure this through the Net 
Promoter Scoring which scores each centre on customer 
feedback and recommendation. 
Leveraging the Halfords brand 
We are leveraging the Halfords brand in the car servicing sector 
to cross sell our services to existing Halfords customers and to 
recruit new ones. This will give our Autocentres significantly more 
credibility and recognition and make our marketing much more 
effective in attracting customers. Since acquiring our autocentre 
business we have rebranded the entire estate as Halfords 
Autocentres and launched our first high profile national media 
campaign on radio.
As planned the complete rebranding of 224 existing centres and the 
opening of 16 new centres has met our predictions for year one.

Business Review
People and Culture
Our brand and values serve the Group both internally and 
externally. With over 109 years of heritage our brand, which 
began as being associated with bikes, has progressed to be 
synonymous as broader trusted retailer. Past research has 
identified the Group has having the following characteristics;
■ ■ Offering a unique combination of products
■ ■ Being No.1 in a number of its core categories and being the 
destination of choice for many markets
Within this offering Halfords and its colleagues have always gone 
the extra mile for our customers and this has created an 
environment in which store colleagues are always keen to help 
customers to fulfil their purchase and service needs.
The “We go the extra mile” philosophy was delivered by 
colleagues offering their help and creating an expectation of 
service from the customer, however when questioned not many 
customers were aware of the full range of products and services 
available from Halfords. 
During 2011 we commissioned our advertising agency, to 
develop a new campaign, based on new market research. This 
research confirmed the need for Halfords to focus on points of 
differentiation, which were not being acknowledged by our 
customers.
At a time of economic and household income pressures we were 
seen as been judged on price not on value, there was a low 
awareness of the value add services that made us different to 
other retailers and with the launch of Halfords Autocentres we 
were not building on consumer loyalty across a portfolio of 
products and services that had never been wider.
The idea for a new campaign came from customers. Research 
showed they think we are helpful. It’s also the principle reason 
customers give when they recommend us to their friends. So our 
new campaign speaks about one of our main strengths. 
This is the start of a new era for Halfords, because we are giving 
a public commitment to being helpful. And while helping is our 
strength, customer feedback also throws up a lot of examples of 
where we have fallen short of people’s expectations - in part 
because they expect so much from us! So we do need to 
redouble our commitment to understanding what customers 
need and ensure we deliver helpful consistently for them.
We must also be focused on helping our front line colleagues. 
Ultimately, helpful is delivered in store, but that can only happen if 
we give our store colleagues all the support they need — the 
products, the availability, the appreciation, the information.
that’s helpful that’s halfords will make a major difference for our 
business and help us achieve our commercial goals. It will 
encourage customers to be more loyal, recommend Halfords to 
their friends and these actions will drive footfall and sales. We will 
be a very different and better company. 
There’s been a lot of hard work and preparation getting us to this 
point. Each and every one of Halfords’ colleagues now has the 
chance to take helpful to the next stage making it a living, 
breathing part of our business. In delivering helpful we will be in 
tune with our customers’ needs, make their, and our lives easier, 
continue to go the extra mile for our customers and use all our 
expertise to be helpful as we go public with our commitment. 
The journey has begun.

Customer Response
I am sending you this email to express my extreme 
satisfaction with the service that I have received from your 
Northallerton, North Yorkshire branch.
Working in the retail food industry, high levels of customer 
service are high on my agenda seven days a week. I am 
responsible for nearly 800 food stores and spend much of 
my time encouraging great customer care.
A few weeks ago I took delivery of a new E Class 
Mercedes Coupe and called into the store to buy a Thule 
roof rack system and bike carriers. The problem that I 
encountered was that having the model with a panoramic 
glass sun roof, that when open lifts - the standard Thule 
kit for the coupe was not suitable. The store manager Guy 
spoke with Thule and called me back to advise that they 
did not make a suitable kit for my car. This was despite the 
Thule website indicating that they did - but showing 
incorrect part numbers - that would not give sufficient 
clearance for the roof to open.
I returned to the store and one of the team - Lee set to 
and was determined to solve this issue. The relevant parts 
were duly ordered and last Saturday Lee and a colleague 
fitted these for me - and again found that another part 
number (aero bars) shown by Thule was incorrect as they 
were wider than needed.
I now have a perfect solution that is 100% correct and I 
am delighted.
The standard of customer care shown by Guy, Lee and his 
colleague - name unknown as they were wearing orange 
fluorescent jackets to keep dry in the heavy rain that did 
not deter them.
When the job was completed, I offered them £10 to buy a 
drink and Lee very politely declined saying that it was 
company policy.
Your team really went the extra mile, and this is certainly 
not the first time that my wife and I have had exceptional 
service from the branch, they are a credit to your 
company.
Sincerely
John

I felt I had to write to you and congratulate you on 
your excellent service. I visited your Livingston, West 
Lothian, store this morning and could not have been 
treated any better. I wanted a car seat for my grand 
daughter and the assistant, Heather, who attended to 
me gave me all the help and advice I needed. 
She explained all about the ISOFIX and even came 
out to my car to look and see if I had it!!! She then 
brought the seat out and showed me exactly how to 
slip it into position. I will most certainly be 
recommending you and thank you very much indeed 
for your help. 
It is so nice to walk out of a shop nowadays and be 
able to tell people how well you were treated and 
made to feel as if it mattered to the staff that you 
were happy - Halfords certainly managed this today.  
I am very happy.

Chief Executive’s Review
Introduction
The UK and ROI retail sector is going through one of the 
toughest times for many years. A combination of low economic 
growth, higher taxes and successive increases in VAT to 20% 
have reduced disposable income while higher raw material and 
fuel costs have put pressure on input prices.
Halfords’ response has been to do what we do best — to offer 
great value to our customers through the quality and price of our 
products and the expertise and service of our colleagues. In our 
Retail business we have also built sales through Halfords.com, 
made progress with our store portfolio refresh programme and 
significantly extended our wefit services. We have done this 
whilst managing costs sensibly and investing for the future. Our 
Autocentres business, acquired in February 2010, was 
rebranded during the year and is now positioned to leverage the 
Halfords brand in the automotive aftercare sector.
We completed the closure of our operation in Central Europe to 
focus on the growth opportunities in the near term.
Review of Trading
In what has been a difficult trading year the Group generated an 
7.2% increase in underlying PBT and continued cash generation 
for shareholders through good cost management and margin 
control with free cash flow of £54.7m, after paying dividends of 
£46.2m.
Group sales were £869.7m, up 4.6% overall. This reflected the 
acquisition of our Autocentres business, which added £98.1m of 
sales to our Retail sales of £771.6m. 
Within Retail, sales across the year on a like-for-like basis  
(“LfL”) averaged -5.5% as customers responded to economic 
conditions. Our sales performance was also affected by some 
one-off factors like supply issues from the Far East following the 
Chinese New Year, reduced availability during the commissioning 
of our new Distribution Centre and the product balance in our 
bike range.
Car Maintenance had a solid performance growing by 0.6% LfL 
and a raise in market share. We saw strong sales during 
December’s severe winter weather when products like anti-
freeze, de-icer and scrapers sold in record volumes. 
Our wefit service has seen another year of strong growth. We 
now fit 23.5% of the bulbs, blades and batteries we sell as more 
customers look to Halfords for expert help with basic car 
maintenance. 
Car Enhancement suffered from the continued market 
contraction of Sat Nav and Audio. Halfords consistently gained 
share in a declining Sat Nav market across the year. Audio 
gained market share in the last three months, through better 
deals with branded suppliers and a focus on accessory sales.
In Leisure we again saw increases in the sales of tents and 
camping equipment and increased market share. Cycle sales 
were less buoyant, due in part to the range issues in the Spring/
Summer and winter snow that slowed sales pre-Christmas. 
Halfords.com business has grown strongly across the year.  
Sales have increased by 36.4% and now represent 9.2% of total 
Retail sales. We have invested in better technology, site 
information and deals.

Sales at our Autocentres business were also affected by 
economic conditions and sales decreased by 0.6% LfL as drivers 
cut back on mileage and deferred some repair work. We also 
decided to delay our marketing spend until the completion of 
rebranding and refurbishment of the whole Autocentres estate so 
that we could advertise on a national basis. Since the relaunch of 
the centres and a new Autocentres Website we have seen 
encouraging signs of increased awareness and sales. 
Operational progress
While the sales performance has been challenging, this year has 
been a period of significant operational progress for the group. 
Our major initiatives have enhanced customer service, reduced 
costs and established a solid platform for future growth. 
We successfully reconfigured our distribution network with a new 
Distribution Centre at Coventry, equipped with state-of-the-art 
logistics technology. Following some initial disruption, the new 
DC is now running smoothly and was a major contributor to the 
excellent availability of winter products in our stores pre-
Christmas. The second element of our revised logistics is our 
Redditch warehouse dedicated to cycles.
We also reorganised our store staff structure and rostering 
schedule and strengthened store management. This makes 
more staff available to serve customers during peak periods, 
provides a clearer career path for colleagues and brings savings 
in our overall cost of labour.
New brand campaign 
Our plans for the year ahead are supported by the launch of our 
new brand campaign “that’s helpful, that’s halfords”. This 
reinforces our unique service proposition, demonstrating how we 
understand our customer’s needs and can help them live life on 
the move. These initiatives give us the potential to trade more 
strongly in the year ahead.
Retail
Our consistent strategy continues to provide a roadmap for the 
development of our retail business.
Whilst the economic environment will remain tough in the year 
ahead, we remain confident that our leading positions in strong 
markets, and the continued development of our multichannel 
offer will continue to provide good opportunities for future 
growth, backed by active gross margin management and tight 
cost control.
Our ongoing focus is to offer great value to our customers 
through the quality and price of our products and the expertise 
and service of our colleagues.

been challenging, this year has been a 
period of significant operational 
progress for the group.”

Range 
Halfords Retail maintains market-leading positions across a 
unique blend of categories with ranges of unrivalled breadth and 
depth. Our scale provides a unique ability to develop and source 
high quality, own brand alternatives to branded ranges. These 
offer customers real value through innovative, high specification 
products at great prices and create a competitive advantage for 
Halfords. This programme complements the close association 
and exclusivity we have with many leading global manufacturers 
brands.
Halfords Apollo is the nation’s leading bike brand and this year 
we completely relaunched the range with 16 new models with 
stronger designs and a focus on the trend towards hybrid bikes 
for adults. In our Travel Solutions ranges we successfully 
launched a new exclusive brand of child seats called Pampero 
and a redesigned range of Exodus roof boxes. We developed 
and extended our camping range and were particularly 
successful with our Halfords and Urban Escape branded tent 
packs. Meanwhile in Car Entertainment we were the first movers 
in the development of a digital radio offering through the 
introduction of our new own-brand Sonichi units. 
Looking to the year ahead our focus on product innovation 
continues. We have launched a 2011 range of Boardman cycles, 
designed exclusively for Halfords in the UK by former Olympic 
Champion Chris Boardman. This completely new range of 17 
models has already been widely acclaimed for its leading 
designs, construction and price competitiveness and is endorsed 
by world famous riders like Alistair Brownlee, the reigning World 
Triathlon champion. Halfords also has an exclusive arrangement 
to sell Voodoo bikes in the UK, designed by Joe Murray, the 
award-winning American mountain biker. This range offers a 
premium product to the serious mountain bike rider and we have 
introduced a new range for this year. 
Most of the bikes we sell we also build for our customers. This 
year we are extending our range to include our Trax brand sold 
boxed for self assembly. This quality bike will be available at 
entry-level prices and gives Halfords a competitive offer against 
supermarkets and other non-specialist outlets. These innovations 
mean that Halfords is uniquely positioned to compete strongly at 
all levels of the cycle market from entry level boxed bikes to 
premium cycles for the competitive rider. 
Extending our Service 
The expert knowledge, advice and service of our instore 
colleagues are at the heart of the Halfords customer offer. They 
sell and fit many of our products and this differentiates Halfords 
from our competition, acts as a barrier to market entry and 
generates attractive levels of return.  Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
We build 95% of the bikes we sell and all new bikes come with the offer 
of a free six-week first service. Sales of our Bike Care Plan, which 
provides repairs free of labour charges, increased by over 28.3% during 
the year and have contributed to a 16.3% increase in our service sales 
revenue. 
All product categories include a core service element, for instance, 
more than 2,000 colleagues are professionally trained and accredited 
by RoSPA to fit child seats to cars. The foundation of our fitting 
proposition though is wefit, the on-demand fitting of Car Bulbs, 
Windscreen Blades and Batteries, (3Bs), by our trained in-store 
colleagues. During the year some 1.91 million wefit jobs were 
completed and 23.5% of all 3Bs sold were also fitted. 
Our strategy is to grow awareness of our fitting capability and to 
continue to invest in technical and skills training of colleagues so that 
we can further increase fitting levels. We have set stretching targets for 
the year ahead to increase awareness, uptake and revenue from our 
service offer.
Our colleagues, in all areas of our business, are of paramount 
importance to the provision of both our services and our helpfulness to 
our customers. Their passion and abilities are central to the delivery of 
our strategic objectives and we are extremely proud of their 
commitment and enthusiasm.

2. Investing In The Store Portfolio
The location, assortment and layout of the Halfords Retail store estate 
is a key element of our customer proposition. 
With 466 stores trading throughout the UK and Ireland our scale 
supports our position as the store of first choice. 90% of our customers 
live within a 20-minute journey of one of our stores. 
We have refurbished 26 stores with plans for 50 more in the next  
twelve months. The sales uplifts are encouraging and represent a good 
return on the invested capital. In London we are exploring new formats, 
reflecting the shortage of suitable Superstore opportunities.
3. Ongoing focus on cost control
We are committed to an ongoing focus on cost control. This ensures 
efficient use of resources, the correct operating base for the prevailing 
economic environment and the headroom to fund strategic investments 
in future growth. 
Our three major initiatives this year included the reconfiguration of our 
distribution network, the review of our store labour structure and 
favourable negotiations with landlords. 
We have a flexible sourcing policy and work closely with suppliers 
around the globe to ensure we achieve the most competitive product 
costs. Our sourcing team based in Asia control all aspects of the supply 
chain to eliminate unnecessary costs in transport, shipping and stock 
holding. 
Looking to the year ahead, payroll, energy and occupancy costs are 
expected to increase the underlying cost base by around 2.5%. 
Planned investments in incentives and IT infrastructure will add a further 
1.5%. Product cost pressures are also increasing, but our market 
leading positions and sourcing options provide some flexibility.
4. Leveraging the Halfords brand in multichannel
Online sales have grown rapidly during the year by 36.4%, ahead of the 
industry average of 19.9%. Online sales currently represent 
approximately 9.2% of Halfords Retail sales.
We have made enhancing our online offer and further extending our 
multichannel presence an investment priority. In line with market trends, 
we continue to increase the amount of advertising dedicated to this 
medium. This year customers have also added 26,000 ratings and 
reviews, which together with our “Ask and Answer” facility allows 
customers to tap into the expertise and experience of other users. 
In addition to extending the site functionality, we have increased the 
range of products we offer online. Much of the additional inventory is 
managed in partnership with 3rd party suppliers, this reduces stock 
costs and obsolescence risk.
Our strategy is to seamlessly integrate halfords.com and our store 
operations. Our product mix lends itself to this strategy, as customers 
often want further advice, or a demonstration and fitting. Our online 
ordering service offers customers the option of direct delivery or to 
reserve and collect items at their local store. 85% of online transactions 
are collected in store. The ability to add further expert advice and 
service to our online mix gives Halfords a differentiated offer and a 
competitive advantage.
Autocentres
This has been a year of significant progress and integration since we 
acquired the business in February 2010. We carried out detailed 
customer research on how to apply the Halfords brand into the auto 
servicing market and then rebranded and refurbished the whole estate 
of 240 service centres as Halfords Autocentres in a rolling programme 
across the year. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
Since rebranding was completed we have been actively promoting 
Halfords Autocentres through a national radio campaign and online 
marketing with encouraging results. 
Halfords Autocentres is an excellent complement to Halfords Retail, 
building on our growing car parts and wefit service business. Car 
aftercare is a large and highly attractive sector with a value of £9bn. 
Capacity is shrinking as the number of independent garages declines 
leading to increasing demand from motorists for a reliable, quality 
independent operator. 
The long-term growth opportunity of this business remains compelling 
given the market size, its fragmentation, the strength of the Halfords 
Autocentres proposition and the potential to leverage the Halfords 
brand. During the year we also opened 16 new centres, 30 new centres 
are targeted in FY12 and in the medium term we believe there is an 
opportunity for up to 600 centres nationally. Further growth 
opportunities exist from fleet customers and accelerating tyre sales. 
Benefits of the operational gearing of the Autocentres business are 
expected as sales improve, supported by cost and purchasing 
synergies.
Summary and outlook
Halfords retains clear leadership in its core retail markets of cycling and 
car maintenance. We are a resilient business with an excellent brand 
and have adapted to the changing needs of our customers by creating 
innovative, quality products at great prices supported by the expertise 
and service of colleagues.
We believe Halfords unique, market-leading position provides strong 
potential for us to consolidate further the fragmented markets in which 
we operate. Our Autocentre business gives us a market leading 
position in a large and unconsolidated market and opens another 
exciting avenue of growth for Halfords. 
We expect the consumer environment to remain challenging, but we 
have demonstrated that our business can make good progress in these 
conditions. Our market leading positions, ongoing actions to reduce 
costs and strong cash flow characteristics provide a solid platform for 
medium term growth through our core strategic growth initiatives.
Through this focus on creating value for our customers and active 
management of the business, the Board believes the Group is well 
positioned for the year ahead.
This has been a demanding year for the business and our colleagues 
have risen to the challenges of the year with energy and determination. 
It is a pleasure to lead such a great team of people and I would like to 
thank them for their adaptability and hard work in the tough 
environment in which we currently operate.

Business Review
Finance Director’s Report
Halfords Group plc (“the Group” or “Group”)
All references to Group represent the consolidation of the 
Halfords (“Halfords Retail”/”Retail”) and Halfords Autocentres 
(“Halfords Autocentres”/”Autocentres”) trading entities. The 
Halfords Group operates through two reportable segments or 
strategic business units — “Retail” and “Car Servicing” in the 
United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI).
Financial results
The 2011 accounting period represents trading for the 52 weeks 
to 1 April 2011. The comparative 2010 period represents 52 
weeks to 2 April 2010 for Halfords Retail, and the 44 days post 
acquisition period for Halfords Autocentres.
Group revenue in 2011 was £869.7m, comprising Retail revenue 
of £771.6m and Autocentres revenue of £98.1m. This compares 
to 2010 Group revenue of £831.6m (Retail £818.1m; 
Autocentres £13.5m). Group gross profit at £485.0m (2010: 
£452.7m) represented 55.8% of revenue (2010: 54.4%) reflecting 
an uplift in Retail of 17 basis points (“bps”) and a full year of the 
Autocentres business which generated 66.3% gross margin.
Total operating costs before non-recurring items increased to 
£356.9m (2010: £333.0m) of which Retail represented £296.7m 
(2010: £324.4m) and Autocentres £58.0m (2010: £8.3m). 
Central unallocated expenses of £2.2m (2010: £0.3m) represent 
the amortisation charge in respect of intangible assets from the 
acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres in February 2010, which 
arise on consolidation of the Group results.
A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was provided in the year. This 
expense relates to the creation of a provision for the potential 
liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior 
to July 1989. An estimate of the potential liability relating to these 
guarantees was previously disclosed as a contingent liability in 
the Interim financial statements. The guarantees were provided 
to landlords of properties leased by Payless DIY (now part of 
Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under 
ownership of the Ward White Group. Focus DIY entered into 
administration in May 2011. Non-recurring expenses of £7.4m 
were incurred in 2010 relating to the closure of the Group’s seven 
store pilot within Central Europe.

Underlying profit before tax and non-recurring items was up

Profit before tax after non-recurring items was up 7.7% to 
£118.1m (2010: £109.7m). 
Revenue for the UK/ROI business of £769.7m reflected a total 
sales decline of 5.2%, with a like for like sales decline of 5.5%, 
partially offset by £1.2m of revenue from new space. The 
negative impact of Easter timing on 2011 sales was around 
0.6%. By category, Car Maintenance revenues were up 0.2%, 
whilst the more discretionary categories of Car Enhancement 
and Leisure were down -12.7% and -3.5% respectively. The 
relative split of revenues between Car Maintenance, Car 
Enhancement and Leisure categories was 31.4%: 28.4%: 40.2% 
(2010: 29.6%: 30.7%: 39.7%).
Gross profit for the UK/ROI business at £419.9m (2010:

the prior year (2010: 54.4%). This improvement in gross margin 
reflected continued progress in penetration of fitting services, 
increased accessory sales, and better sourcing, particularly in the

first half of the year, while relative sales growth in the higher 
margin car maintenance category also enhanced margin. 
Although full year gross margins have improved, the second half 
saw a 9bps decline on the prior year, primarily reflecting 
increased product cost pressures, increased levels of 
promotional activity and participation and some selective price 
realignment in response to the difficult trading environment. 
These margin pressures are expected to continue throughout 
2012.
Operating expenses for the UK/ROI business, before non-
recurring items, at £296.2m, were down 7.4% on the prior year. 
This decrease reflected reductions across all key cost categories. 
The benefits from the review of store labour rotas and structures 
combined with lower than planned colleague store incentive 
payments drove an £8.7m reduction in store staffing costs (2011: 
£78.1m; 2010: £86.8m). Warehouse and Distribution costs fell 
marginally by 0.8% (2011: £27.5m; 2010: £27.8m). The new 
network was opened in July 2010 and is now fully operational; 
however improvements in efficiency took longer than expected to 
deliver and were further compounded by a combination of record 
winter volumes, inflationary pressures on fuel and dual running 
costs to ensure that availability was maintained in store during 
the transition period. Without the new network in place 
Warehouse and Distribution costs would have been c.£1m 
higher. Store occupation costs fell 4.6% (2011: £135.4m; 2010: 
£142.0m) due primarily to successful rent negotiations and 
reduced depreciation, although this was partially offset by 
increased utility and rates inflation which is expected to continue 
in 2012. A reduction in support costs, down 12.7% (2011: 
£55.2m; 2010: £63.2m) reflected savings in administrative 
expenses, the largest element being the non-payment of head-
office incentive payments. Removing the cost savings that were 
more one- off in nature, the underlying cost base of the UK/ROI 
Retail business for 2011 would be around £300m.
The discontinuation of the Central European Retail operation was 
announced late in 2010. In 2011, while the closure progressed, 
this operation generated revenues of £1.9m (2010: £5.9m) and a 
loss before taxation of £0.4m (2010: £2.5m) after operating 
expenses of £0.5m (2010: £4.6m).

Autocentres generated total revenues of £98.1m in their first full 
year in the Halfords Group (2010 reported £13.5m; 2010 
proforma £97.3m). Sixteen new Autocentres opened in the year, 
generating £1.5m of new incremental revenue, taking the total 
number of Autocentres locations to 240 as at 1 April 2011. The 
small decrease in revenues from the existing 224 centres 
reflected the effects of lower mileage driven by customers and 
their deferral of non-urgent servicing work. The 2011 results 
reflected minimal benefit from the UK wide brand relaunch which 
was postponed to the last quarter of the financial year. 
Gross profit at £65.0m reflects a gross margin of 66.3%, down 
50bps on proforma 2010 levels driven by an increase in the sale 
and fitting of lower margin tyres and a lower proportion of high 
margin servicing revenues partially offset by improved sourcing of 
parts and oil.
Portfolio management 
The Group continues to actively manage its store portfolio. 
During 2011 the Retail business opened five stores, relocated 
three, closed one and refurbished 26. Lease extension and  
reductions were completed on nine further locations. The Group 
continues to lease one vacant property which is being actively 
marketed. Within Autocentres, 16 new centres were opened and 
two centres were relocated in the period.
Operating leases
With the exception of nine long leasehold and two freehold 
properties within Autocentres, the Group’s operating sites are 
occupied under operating leases, the majority of which are on 
standard lease terms, typically with a 5 to 15-year term at 
inception. The Group has a total commitment under non-
cancellable operating leases of £737.9m (2010: £811.5m).
Finance Expense
Net finance expense was £2.5m (2010: £2.6m). The lower 
expense in the period included £0.9m of interest income relating 
to the settlement of amounts due from HMRC, and 4.5 months 
of interest expense and charges under the new revolving credit 
facility in place since 12 November 2010. Average net bank 
borrowings were marginally higher than last year reflecting the 
acquisition of Nationwide close to the prior year end. The costs 
of forward exchange contracts were £0.3m higher than last year. 
Taxation
The taxation charge on profit for the financial year was £32.6m 
(2010: £32.7m), including a £2.1m credit (2010: £1.4m) in 
respect of the tax on non-recurring items, and represents a full 
year effective tax rate of 27.6% (2010: 29.8%). The effective tax 
rate of 27.6% differs from the UK corporation tax rate (28%) 
principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged 
on capital expenditure and the reassessment of anticipated 
future tax deductions from employee share schemes offset by a 
reassessment of historic tax provisions required against tax 
uncertainties.
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS before non-recurring items was 43.2 pence (2010: 
39.7 pence), an 8.8% increase on the prior year. Basic EPS for 
the period was 40.7 pence (2010: 36.8 pence) a 10.6% increase. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 14 pence per 
share (2010: 14 pence), which, in addition to the interim dividend 
of 8 pence per share (2010: 6 pence), generates a total dividend 
of 22 pence, an increase of 10% on 2010 (20 pence). In line with 
the Boards’ intention, communicated in November 2010, to 
increase over time the proportion of the full year dividend 
represented by the interim dividend to approximately 40%, the 
split of the total dividend between interim and final dividend has 
moved to 36:64 in 2011 from 30:70 in 2010. Given Halfords 
strong cash generative characteristics, the board will maintain a 
progressive dividend policy whilst targeting dividend cover of 
broadly 2 times earnings over the medium term.
Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting 
the final dividend will be paid on 5 August 2011 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 1 July 2011.
Capital expenditure
Capital investment in the period totalled £22.8m (2010: £20.4m) 
comprising £16.6m in Retail and £6.2m in Autocentres. 
Consistent with prior periods, management have continued to 
adopt a prudent approach with regard to capital investment. 
During 2011 the Group invested £14.6m in its property portfolio 
(2010: £7.4m), including £8.4m within Retail and £6.2m to drive 
the Autocentres roll out plan and the rebranding of the 
Autocentres sites under the Halfords banner. Systems to support 
the Retail business and its online customer proposition attracted 
£1.3m of investment. This is an increasing area of focus within 
the business and investment in business systems and the web 
proposition will continue into 2012. The completion of the 
National Distribution Centre project in 2011 resulted in £3.4m of 
capital expenditure during the year. 
Inventories
Group stock inventory held at 1 April 2011 was £147.6m (2 April 
2010: £138.5m), up 6.6% on the prior year. Lower cycle sales 
over the Christmas period, a late Easter in 2011, earlier stock 
fulfilment to avoid prior year stock outs as a result of Chinese 
New Year and stock build in advance of Spring and Summer 
2011 product launches to ensure enhanced store availability, 
contributed to this increase. The management of inventory 
remains a key area of focus for the Retail business while the 
Autocentres business model is such that only small levels of 
inventory are held within the centres with most parts being 
acquired on an as-needed basis.

Cash flow and borrowings
The Group has continued its strong track record of cash 
generation. Net cash generated from operating activities in 2011 
was £118.4m (2010: £148.1m). Free cash flow of £54.7m is after 
taking into account taxation, dividends, share issues, capital 
expenditure and net finance costs. 
Total net bank debt at 1 April 2011 was £91.4m (2 April 2010: 
£143.5m) while further borrowings of £11.8m (2010: £12.0m) in 
respect of the Head Office finance lease resulted in Group net 
debt at 1 April 2011 of £103.2m (2 April 2010: £155.5m). At this 
level, net debt to EBITDA (Earnings before non-recurring items, 
finance expense, depreciation and amortisation) was 0.7 times  
(2 April 2010: 1.0 times). 
On 5 November 2010 the Group signed a new revolving credit 
facility agreement (the new facility) amounting to £300m. The 
new facility replaced the Group’s existing facilities and runs until  
12 November 2014 extendable by a further year to 12 November 
2015. Associated refinancing costs incurred totalled £3.6m, 
which will be amortised over the 4-year life of the new facility.
The Board is committed to continued investment in the growth of 
the business, both through organic development and other 
business development opportunities as they might arise. The 
new facility gives the enlarged Group the appropriate level of 
committed financing for its working capital needs.
Following a review by the Board of the Group’s capital structure 
and cash generation capabilities, with effect from 7 April 2011 
the Group commenced a share buyback programme, with the 
intention to return up to £75m of cash to shareholders over the 
following 12 months. Since the financial year end, approximately 
£20.7 million of buyback has taken place via the purchase of 5.3 
million shares.

Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
■ ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
■ ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
■ ■ Invest surplus cash; 
■ ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and
■ ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash 
flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance 
Director (“FD”). The FD controls policy and performance through 
the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by 
reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee 
meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury 
function. Monthly Treasury Reports provide management 
information relating to treasury activity. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board 
approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an 
annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an 
appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the 
medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet 
the changing needs of the Group. The Group has a syndicated 
four-year facility totalling £300m that provides the Group with 
committed bank facilities until November 2014, extendable by 
one year to November 2015.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective 
are as follows:
Financial risk
The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key 
assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these 
risks is dependent upon the level of EBITDA and the strength of 
the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the 
Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial 
covenants. The Group’s borrowings are currently subject to 
floating rate and the Group will continue to monitor movements 
in the swap market. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure through direct 
sourced purchases of its supplies from the Far East, with most of 
the trade being in US Dollars. The Group does not hedge either 
economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the 
profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they 
remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011, the foreign exchange 
management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase 
between 75% and 80% of the material foreign exchange 
transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis. Hedging is 
performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts, 
spot rates and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Credit risk
The Group’s policy is to minimise the risk that foreign exchange 
and interest rate derivative counterparties, the holders of surplus 
cash and the providers of debt will be unable to fulfil their 
obligations and also, in the case of lenders, unwilling to extend 
the loan facilities when they expire. In executing this policy, the 
Group ensured that such counterparties, who all sit within the 
syndicated group, used for credit transactions and ancillary 
business held at least an A credit rating at the time of syndication 
(November 2010). 
The Treasurer is responsible for determining credit worthiness of 
each counterparty, based on the overall financial strength of the 
counterparty. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the 
Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee 
and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.

Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to 
meet all its commitments when required. The Group ensures that 
there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the 
cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.  
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at £30.0m.
Forecast liquidity is reviewed each month by the Treasurer to 
determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet 
forecast requirements
Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there are 
no significant breaches, which would lead to an “Event of 
Default”. Calculations are submitted at least bi-annually to the 
syndication agent. Reporting on covenant compliance forms part 
of the Treasury Report. There have been no breaches of 
covenants during the reported periods.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce 
debt. The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. 
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to EBITDAR and fixed 
charge cover. Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net 
debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of 
EBITDA plus operating lease charges. Fixed charge cover is 
calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a 
multiple of interest and operating lease charges. As a result of 
the current economic conditions and the attitude towards debt 
the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and 
operates favourably to these target metrics.

Business Review
Risks and Uncertainties
Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and uncertainties that could impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy objectives. 
These risks are accepted as being a part of doing business and the Board recognises that the nature and scope of these risks can change and so 
regularly reviews the risks faced by the Group as well as the systems and processes to mitigate them. 
The Corporate Governance report on pages 78 to 83 describes the systems and internal control processes through which the directors identify, 
assess, manage and mitigate risks.
Our strategy is developed to be delivered under recognisable and measurable 
performance metrics and communicated to all colleagues.
Business Unit Strategy
Senior Management colleagues assess risks on a department by department 
basis using a variety of techniques to identify risk. The likelihood and impact of 
these risks are considered and scored against a recognised framework dependent 
upon their effect on the achievement of our corporate strategies.
Key Risks and Uncertainties
Responsibility for taking necessary actions to manage risk is delegated to 
appropriate colleagues in the business, with executive sponsor involvement. The 
Risk Register is monitored and updated with current and ongoing mitigation on a 
regular basis.       
Mitigation
The Executive Committee and the Group Board consider the risks reported within 
the Risk Register and review and monitor new risks and all mitigating actions to 
ensure the status of risk mirrors the Board’ s appetite for risk.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Strategy
The economy is a major influence on consumer 
spending. Trends in employment, inflation, taxation, 
consumer debt levels and interest rates impact 
consumer expenditure in discretionary areas. Changes 
in Government policies may also affect our consumers’ 
ability to benefit from our products and services.
Economic
Business Strategy
Competition
Compliance
Changing Customer Preferences
The delivery of the Group’s business strategy will 
deliver long-term value to our shareholders. The 
Board understands that if the strategy and vision are 
inappropriately formulated and communicated and that 
the necessary resources are not in place to deliver the 
strategy both from the core business and from M&A 
activity the business will suffer.
The retail industry is highly competitive and dynamic.  
The Group competes with a wide variety of retailers of 
varying sizes and faces competition from UK retailers, 
in both stores and online, as well as international 
operators. Failure to compete with competitors on 
areas including price, product range, quality and 
service could have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial results.
The Group operates in an environment governed by 
legislation, standards and codes in areas including,  
but not limited to, trading, advertising, product quality, 
health and safety, hazardous substances and data 
protection.
Some of the products that Halfords sells, particularly in 
the car enhancement category, are subject to rapidly 
changing consumer preferences. Products such as 
children’s cycles face competition from alternative 
products (such as games consoles) and some of the 
products that the Group sells are non-discretionary in 
their nature and predicting future trends is difficult.
The Group mitigates against these risks by focusing 
on maintaining the “defensive” characteristics of its 
“needs driven” product groups and by ensuring that its 
stores and centres are the key destination for its core 
products and services. We also ensure that we have 
representation with Governmental decision-makers in 
the areas supporting our core categories.
The budgetary and planning process delivers the 
Group’s growth targets (in conjunction with any M&A 
activity) and business plans are developed to ensure 
these targets are achieved and that they are resourced 
appropriately. Regular monitoring of performance 
against plan is carried out by both the executive 
managers of the Company and the Group Board to 
ensure targets are being achieved and that they remain 
relevant to and focused on the Group Strategy. 
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK 
Retailers, both in-store and online, and from the 
national car-servicing network and seeks to continually 
strengthen its “own-brand” and “sub-brand” retail offer 
and develop service opportunities to differentiate the 
Halfords offer.
The Group has a Quality Assurance team and a 
Commercial Regulatory team that manage legal 
and regulatory control processes both in-house and 
externally to advise and take action on existing and 
emerging risk management issues. Our various Codes 
of Practice regulate our behaviour in our dealings with 
all stakeholders including customers, suppliers and 
colleagues and our attitudes toward such areas as the 
environment and ethical trading. 
Halfords has recruited experienced, knowledgeable 
colleagues who can identify and interpret trends and 
consequently respond in a timely manner to changes 
in consumer preferences. Colleagues also monitor 
developments in alternative products and our forecasts 
reflect the latest assumption in these areas. We 
are continually looking at ways of moving into new 
merchandising opportunities to mitigate technology 
changes and to improve forecasting and planning to 
ensure we meet our customers’ changing needs.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Strategy
The Halfords name is a key asset of the business and 
as the largest operator in its markets, expectations of 
the Group are high. Failure to protect the Group’s 
reputation and brand could lead to a loss of trust and 
confidence. This could result in a decline in the 
customer base and affect the ability to recruit and 
retain good people.
Halfords sources a significant proportion of the 
merchandise it sells in its stores from outside of the 
UK, either directly or via third-party suppliers.  
Consequently, the Group is subject to the risks 
associated with international trade (particularly those 
which are common in the import of goods from 
developing countries) including, but not limited to, 
inflation, currency fluctuation, the imposition of taxes or 
other charges on imports, the exposure to different 
legal standards, the burden of complying with a variety 
of foreign laws and changing foreign government 
policies and natural disasters. 
The Board recognises that the quality and safety of 
both our products and services in our stores and 
autocentres is of critical importance to us and that any 
major failure will affect consumer confidence. We 
recognise that if our products are seen to be or 
perceived to be of poor standard or of poor value for 
money then customers will look to obtain these from 
our competitors. There is also the risk that our service 
proposition fails due to inconsistent levels of service at 
individual stores and individual centres.
Reputation
Reliance on Foreign Manufacturers
Product and Service Quality
Ultimately the protection of the Halfords brand 
and position in its core markets will be sustained 
by unique and extensive product offerings and a 
multichannel approach to sales in our stores and 
a high service based customer proposition in our 
stores and autocentres. This is complemented by 
quality training from accredited Automotive Technician 
training to Cytech (Cycles), RoSPA, and the Institute 
of Mechanical Industries, ensuring that colleagues at 
both stores and centres are capable of supporting the 
Halfords brand.
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics 
before the Group procures product from any new 
country or supplier. The Group’s strong management 
team in the Far East has been recruited from local 
nationals who understand the local culture, market 
regulations and risks and we maintain very close 
relationships with both our suppliers and shippers to 
ensure that disruption to production and supply are 
managed appropriately.
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its position 
as store or centre of first choice in each of the 
markets that it serves. Halfords continues to invest 
in both its existing estate to ensure that it remains 
contemporary and in constant product innovation to 
meet customer needs. In addition, the Group’s market 
leading in-store wefit proposition provides a range of 
services at a lower cost to our customers than that 
provided by competitors.  We have an established 
training infrastructure to ensure that our colleagues 
receive ongoing product and service training. In 
our Autocentres the training of our technicians to 
provide high quality motor vehicle repairs is enhanced 
through an apprenticeship programme and accredited 
automotive technician training. Sixty per cent of our 
Autocentre workshop colleagues hold a Motor Industry 
qualification. We continually track performance against 
a broad range of measures that customers tell us are 
critical to their shopping and servicing experience, and 
monitor customer perceptions of ourselves to ensure 
we can respond quickly if required.

Key Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Strategy
In common with most businesses, Halfords is reliant on 
the reliability and suitability of a number of important IT 
systems where any sustained performance problems, 
particularly with regard to store or warehouse, 
multichannel and distribution systems, could potentially 
compromise our operational capability for a period of 
time. With ambitious growth plans for our multichannel 
offer, our trading capacity could be affected by internal 
and external systems resilience and interdependencies.
The success of the Group’s business depends upon its 
senior management closely supervising all aspects of 
its business, in particular the operation of its stores, 
autocentres and the design, procurement and 
allocation of its merchandise. Retention of senior 
management is especially important in the Group due 
to the limited availability of experienced and talented 
retail executives. 
Dependence on key management personnel
Extensive controls are in place to maintain the integrity 
of our systems and to ensure that systems changes 
are implemented in a controlled manner. Halfords’ key 
trading systems are hosted within a secure data centre 
operated by a specialist company remote from our 
Head Office. These systems are also supported by a 
number of disaster recovery arrangements including 
a comprehensive backup strategy, including a hotlink 
secure data centre hosted outside the UK and access 
to a further data support centre elsewhere in the UK in 
case of a major incident. 
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on page 84 details 
the strategies in place to ensure that high calibre 
executives are attracted and retained. The Group looks 
to improve its senior manager cadre through operating 
a talent management process to help individuals 
achieve their full potential within Halfords and to ensure 
that appropriate succession plans are in place to meet 
the future needs of the business. At a junior level the 
Group continues to invest in graduate programmes 
and store/centre colleague training and development.

Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe effective management of our CSR makes good 
business sense. In doing so, we seek to ensure that Halfords, 
which is a household brand, has a positive impact on the 
communities and environment in which we work, be it through 
our operations, products and services or through our interactions 
with our customers, colleagues and suppliers. We are proud of 
our business and we see CSR as a core business consideration 
as it derives strategic, commercial and reputational benefits. We 
aim to achieve standards of responsible care across a number of 
key areas, including: customers, trading, health & safety, the 
environment, employee welfare and the community.
We are concerned to ensure we do the right things and our aim 
is to continually improve our management of the social, 
environmental and economic issues within our control or 
influence these throughout the business and our wider supply 
network. The Group has reviewed its ongoing CSR commitments 
to ensure it meets the needs of the markets and communities in 
which it operates and that the associated Key Performance 
Indicators (“KPIs”) accurately reflect the Group’s success or 
otherwise in implementing its policy. 
For the period to 1 April 2011 the Group continued to follow its 
“ACTING RESPONSIBLY” policy. However, during the year 
Business in the Community (“BITC”) undertook a high level 
review of our activities, both in retail and the autocentres, to 
understand the key business priorities and aspirations of the 
organisation, to review current CSR activities and to review how 
these may be progressed through the formalisation of a CSR 
strategy and framework for the organisation. The review was not 
an audit of Halfords’ activities, but aimed to identify the key 
strengths and gaps in the organisation’s approach to managing 
CSR and how it is integrated within the strategic management 
process. 
To understand our current CSR practices and activities BITC 
undertook detailed discussions with key senior managers 
including the Company Secretary, Divisional Managers, Category 
Managers and managers in HR, H&S, Store Operations, and 
Supply Chain. They also reviewed key documents including 
recent Halfords Annual Reports, information from the website, 
environmental reports and policies and Competitor/Peer CR 
commitments.

BITC concluded that the Company is keenly bottom line driven 
with strong growth ambitions and the thinking hierarchy at 
present is “cost first”. It is therefore essential that any CSR 
programme should be shown to be intricately linked to achieving 
business success and enhancing the business’s value 
proposition. 
The report commented on how Halfords prides itself on behaving 
responsibly to all stakeholders and how CSR forms an integral 
element of this relationship by demonstrating the Company’s 
honesty, reliability and trustworthiness in respecting customers, 
employees, investors and the environment. Feedback from 
customers identified a belief that Halfords should be “doing 
something” in the CSR arena, although there was less clarity 
about what this should be. There are also expectations from staff 
around what it means to be a national “responsible” retailer and 
having pride in an organisation, which is known for “Going the 
extra mile” and wants to become famous for being “Helpful”.
The BITC report also went into detail on actions that the 
Company could undertake to improve its overall CSR agenda 
and these will be reviewed and adopted where appropriate 
during 2011/12, the first step of which is to formalise a 
community investment strategy.
Following this review we shall henceforth report on our activities 
under the headings used by BITC in their report, and we have 
aligned these with our business unit strategies on page 42.
Our commitments are translated into actions and KPIs are used 
to assess success against our internal targets. Paul 
McClenaghan, Commercial Director, takes the lead in ensuring 
that the policy supports the strategic objectives of the business. 
The Halfords Executive monitors performance with regard to 
these objectives and targets via an internal report. It is, however, 
the Board’s responsibility to ensure that the Group operates in a 
responsible manner, and thus the Board reviews the policy and 
our performance against that policy annually. 
In summarising their report BITC wrote: “From our discussions it 
is apparent that there is a significant amount of good work 
currently happening within Halfords that falls under the banner of 
responsible business practices or corporate responsibility, 
however to date it appears that community investment activities 
have been informal and not driven by a clear community 
investment strategy.”

Employer of choice
Our growth in stores/centres and turnover would not have been 
possible without the unfailing support and commitment of our 
colleagues employed across stores, autocentres, distribution 
centres, and our head office operations. Thus, we recognise that 
our colleagues are our single most valuable asset and we are 
committed to a fair but robust approach to equal opportunities in 
all areas of our business, with people gaining promotion on 
merit. We have high expectations of all colleagues and everyone 
is required to perform and deliver value. This creates an 
environment that is challenging and rewarding, enabling 
colleagues to develop quickly and pursue new opportunities. 
We are committed to being seen as an employer of choice within 
the communities in which we operate. We seek to employ 
people who are passionate about customers and service, love 
coming to work, strive to achieve their best and enjoy dealing 
with customers. We recognise and reward high performance 
and by ensuring colleagues have interesting jobs, with real 
accountability, Halfords can provide the opportunity to develop 
careers. In the last three years we have reduced staff turnover 
rates in our retail stores by 1% and over the same period staff 
turnover rates in the autocentre business have fallen by 12%. 
Our colleagues are people who consistently look for 
opportunities to deliver a first-class service, going the extra mile 
with the aim being to be helpful to our customers. Some 4,800 
(2010: 4,000) of our retail staff hold accredited fitting 
qualifications, whilst 60% of our Autocentre workshop 
colleagues hold a Motor Industry qualification. 
The Autocentre business also run a Training Academy 
apprenticeship programme, which currently has approximately 
140 apprentices, all of whom go through a three year fully 
funded programme and will finish as fully qualified Technicians 
with an Institute of Motor Industry NVQ level 3 and a Diploma. In 
addition, they will each finish an Automotive Technician 
Accreditation (ATA) assessment and we provide ongoing 
development opportunities through our IMI accredited Academy 
of learning where we can deliver a range of both Technical and 
Management qualifications from foundation level voluntary 
qualifications through to degree equivalents.
Diversity 
Halfords has an Equal Opportunities Policy which outlines 
regulatory requirements as well as the organisation’s 
commitments regarding diversity and expectations of staff. The 
current workforce in store may not be reflective of the 
community base but we feel that it does reflect customer use. 
More women than men are employed at our Redditch Head 
Office location and in January 2011 we appointed our first 
woman Director to the Group Board. During the year to the date 
of this report we have worked with the Employers Forum on 
Disability to overcome issues surrounding the implications of the 
Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) regarding entrance to stores 
and engaged the EFD to provide disability awareness training to 
our Customer Services team and Store Managers.

Health and Safety management
Halfords is committed to high standards of occupational health 
and safety to minimise the risk of injuries and ill health to 
employees, contractors, customers, visitors and others who 
come into contact with the business. The Group believes that 
effective occupational health and safety management is 
fundamental to a successful business and we constantly review 
our procedures and risk management standards to identify 
opportunities for further improvement. Over the last few years 
safety training has been delivered to both Head Office managers 
and the Autocentre manager population.
We monitor our safety performance on a range of indicators 
including our reportable accident statistics and accident rates 
arising from our “focus hazards”. Our overall annual injury 
incident rate remains below the industry benchmark in both our 
businesses; in the retail business 210 per 100,000 employees 
(2010: 190) and in the Autocentres 533 per 100,000 employees 
(2010: 666).
Stores & customer service
We market high quality products that we believe meet or exceed 
the requirements of appropriate legislation, international 
conventions and codes of practice. Where external guidance 
does not exist, we apply our own exacting standards. With a 
complex product range of over 14,000 items, we talk with our 
customers every day to ensure that our range meets their 
requirements and that they understand how to use our products 
safely. Halfords has a large number of regular customers who 
see their key drivers of satisfaction being choice of products and 
brands, store environments and ease of shopping, 
knowledgeable staff with a “will-do” helpful attitude and 
competitive, value-for-money pricing. Surveys are regularly 
carried out across our customer base and in 2010/11, 59% of 
customers asked said they were very likely to recommend 
Halfords to friends.
Our store network is extensive and we endeavour to locate a 
Halfords store within 20 miles of any UK customer. At the time of 
writing 99% of the UK population live within 20 (straight-line) 
miles of a Halfords store and 90.4% live within a 20 minute drive 
of a store. Our store portfolio continues to grow in quality and 
quantity. 
This network is fully supported by a dedicated Customer Service 
team based at our Head Office in Redditch where our customers 
are able to contact us by phone, email, letter or fax. The 
consolidation of our web and store contact centres gives our 
customers and stores the opportunity to contact us through one 
single phone number and email address. This has enabled us to 
offer increased support to our store colleagues and be more 
flexible to our customers’ needs.
Our Autocentres provide value added services to both the 
general public and large fleet providers alike, and carry out 
manufacturer based servicing which meets the needs of vehicles 
still covered under warranty as well as our own menu based 
servicing options, typically reducing the cost of motoring yet 
maintaining quality. The parts that we fit meet OE standards, 
ensuring that warranties are never compromised and that 
legislative requirements are met. We are the UK’s largest 
supporter of the Automotive Technician Accreditation (ATA) 
scheme and we work proactively to ensure that our technicians 
are up to date and technically competent. 
As well as being monitored by external organisations such as 
VOSA and Trading Standards, we apply our own quality control 
systems and mystery shopper programme to ensure that our 
customers receive the very best service experience. Autocentres 
survey up to 13,500 customers every six-months which drives 
detailed feedback on the service standards, quality of work and 
views on value for money. Every centre has a Net Promoter 
Score and this allows management to closely monitor service 
delivery and the actions of centre staff.
Autocentres also call customers two days after service has been 
delivered to check customer satisfaction and to follow up on 
items that require scheduled replacement. In addition, mailers are 
sent to customers when these items should be replaced and 
Centre managers also call customers to enquire on the service 
they have received. This gives us a quality feedback loop and 
also a means to track how customers’ cars are performing.
Products
We continually assess the lifestyle and environmental impacts of 
our products, packaging, procedures and services at all 
appropriate stages, i.e. design, procurement, supply, sale, use 
and disposal. As our business is strongly influenced by consumer 
choice, we promote good practice in the provision of 
environmental communication to customers and colleagues. 
We also ensure that, where possible, customers can contribute 
to product recycling. As an example, customers returning old car 
batteries to our stores for recycling by us are offered a £2 
voucher to be spent in the store to encourage recycling. In the 
period to 1 April 2011 our customers returned 118,067 batteries, 
an increase of 31.1% on 2010.

At a time when the issues surrounding health and obesity have 
become increasingly important, Halfords, as the largest retailer of 
cycling products, actively encourages people to participate in this 
outdoor activity. We currently stock 179 different models of 
bicycles, of which 77 are aimed at children between three and 
eight years of age. We design these bikes with the customer in 
mind and our children’s bikes are specifically designed for the 
measurements and stature of a child, as the relative dimensions 
of the bike are very different from those of an adult. In the year to 
1 April 2011, we sold nearly a million bikes, approximately 1 out 
of 3 of all bikes sold in the UK. 
We continue to market “Cycle 2 Work” schemes that allow 
employers to offer to their employees the use of a bicycle for 
work. The scheme offers significant savings, making use of the 
Government backed initiative to increase more sustainable 
means of transport to work. Over the last four years, we have 
increased the number of schemes that we manage on behalf of 
employers by five times, thereby allowing their employees the 
opportunity to embrace a healthy, keep-fit lifestyle.

We continue to monitor the airfreighting of our products from 
suppliers, and only do so in cases of extreme urgency. 
Whilst we do our best to reduce the weight of products shipped 
in this way, there are occasions that necessitate the use of 
airfreight as an efficient and fast means of delivery to ensure 
products are always available to our customers. However, during 
the period we airfreighted 177 tonnes of product as we 
experienced problems in meeting our orders. This was 
significantly more than in 2009/10 but still 5% down on 2007 
when we first started measuring this KPI. The problems arose 
because, following the Chinese New Year, many Suppliers in 
China found it difficult to return to normal levels of manufacturing 
output as many of the staff that worked in the factories travelled 
back home to visit their families and did not return to work. This, 
in turn, caused production delays to orders and there was 
consequential pressure on meeting our customers’ demands for 
product. We have mitigated this risk in 2011/12 by requiring our 
suppliers to manufacture products ahead of the Chinese  
New Year.

Generally, we concentrate on ensuring that containers that are 
delivered into our distribution centres (“DCs”) are done so via sea 
deliveries for onward transportation via road or rail. We work hard 
each year to reduce our reliance on road transportation and, in 
2010/11, 61% of all containers delivered were moved by rail to a 
hub in the Midlands for onward transportation to our DCs.

Our products, stores, offices, and fleet of delivery vehicles have 
direct impacts on the environment. We also understand that 
there are indirect impacts caused by the production and use of 
our products. Our commitment is to understand and to 
continually improve the performance and management of our 
environmental impact throughout the Halfords supply chain. 
In managing our environmental responsibilities, our overall 
objectives relate to the following key areas: 
Natural Resources
We place emphasis on resource use, in order to understand and 
improve the efficiency of our use of raw materials, energy and 
water throughout Halfords’ operations. Our goal is to minimise 
our potential for causing pollution to air, water and land. 
We aim to prevent waste generation in our activities, including 
product and packaging design, warehousing, distribution and 
sale and reuse of materials, and to maximise recovery and 
recycling of waste prior to disposal. We achieve this by 
increasing the quantity of cardboard, paper and plastic waste we 
recycle in the business and reducing our use of landfill sites.
As a result, the volumes of waste material recycled versus that 
sent to landfill increased from 56.4% in 2007 to 78.7% in 2011.
As motor vehicle servicing centres, our Autocentres are 
continually disposing of “motor vehicle” related waste. In 
2010/11 as well as recycling car batteries, we put 755,000 litres 
of oil, 126,000 tyre casings and a range of other waste materials 
into the recycling chain through our waste management 
programme.
We continue to improve our water usage and over the years have 
invested in “smart” water meters, which help us to identify water 
leaks at an early stage. In 2011 we maintained our proud record 
of reducing water usage year on year with a further 1.5% 
reduction.

Energy and reducing CO
2
 emissions
As we have continued to open new stores and autocentres, our 
overall use of gas and electricity has improved as we have added 
energy management systems to our stores and implemented 
specific action plans around voltage reduction. This year’s 
increase in energy usage was a result of the prolonged winter 
weather through the winter of 2010/2011. In 2007 we set 
ourselves the target of reducing our energy usage per store by 
between 15% and 20% and gave ourselves three years to 
achieve this reduction. In 2010 we had reduced energy usage by 
22% and even with the increased usage in 2011, this represents 
a 17% reduction on our 2007 base. 
Our efforts do not stop there; we shall continue to monitor 
energy usage in our retails stores and following the inclusion of 
the 240 Autocentres we shall rebase our usage and target a 
further reduction across the Group as a whole.
The following graph represents the energy used by our stores, 
autocentres, head offices and distribution centres.

Fuel and transport fleet efficiency 
In line with European Emissions Directives, Euro 4 emission 
standards for commercial vehicles were introduced in October 
2006. This aims to improve the levels of Carbon Monoxide, 
Hydrocarbon, Nitrogen Oxide and particulate emissions that 
cause harm to the environment. Working with DHL, our carrier, 
we ensure that all of the Halfords fleet complies with Euro 3 
emissions standard (introduced in October 2003), and new 
vehicles delivered from September 2006 conform to the new 
Euro 4 standards.
To more fully understand our impact on Greenhouse Gas 
(“GHG”) emissions, we have converted the transport fleet fuel 
usage to total CO
2
 emissions. In 2010/11, DHL drove, on our 
behalf, 9,151,216 kilometres, a reduction of 2.5% on 2010, 
following a reduction of 2% last year and we used 103,487 less 
litres of diesel. The CO
2
 equivalent usage, calculated based on 
DEFRA’s 2010 Freight Transport conversion factor, shows a 
3.6% improvement year on year. This has all been achieved 
against the backdrop of increased cross-over activity as we 
continued to operate from three distribution centres rather than 
the current operating model of two. As we consolidate our new 
DC in Coventry we will be looking to further reduce our CO
2
 
emissions.

Accessibility
Our stores serve their local communities with our products and 
expert services and we are conscious that all, irrespective of 
disability, should be able to access both our stores and our 
online offering. We treat our responsibilities under the Disability 
Discrimination Act (“DDA”) very seriously and we are committed 
to ensuring that all of our customers are able to access our 
products and services with the minimum of effort. As part of the 
refurbishment and rebranding of our Halfords Autocentres we 
have altered our reception areas and made them much more 
accessible. Following last year’s launch of mobility products, we 
have partnered with AgeUK to deliver their branded mobility 
products to our customers.
We are committed to ensuring that both customers and 
colleagues have access to our stores and we have taken various 
actions in order to help us to fulfil our responsibilities, and in 
2011 we worked with The Employers Forum for Disability to 
deliver training to some of our Head Office and store colleagues. 
In 2009 we committed to annual audits of all of our stores to 
ensure consistent levels of accessibility. The most recent results 
are shown below.

Ethical trading
We place great importance on the selection of our suppliers and 
how they interact within their own local communities and, where 
appropriate, we will visit manufacturing sources to verify that 
effective quality procedures are in place and that supply chain 
costs are minimised. We are always striving for improvement and 
we believe it is important that our suppliers are responsive to 
feedback from our customers and store colleagues. Halfords 
recognises that the development of close supplier partnerships is 
essential for the ongoing provision of an innovative and “value-
for-money” product offer. Halfords has a Sourcing Code of 
Conduct (“the Code”), which can be viewed on the Company’s 
website (halfordscompany.com). This is sent to all potential new 
suppliers as part of the Supplier Questionnaire, before orders are 
placed with the supplier. Compliance with the Code is 
independently audited. The response to the questionnaire is 
reviewed and, if the supplier does not provide an acceptable 
alternative assessment report, an audit by an independent 
auditor such as Bureau Veritas, is arranged. Over the last few 
years we have substantially increased the supplier audit coverage 
in the Far East where a significant amount of our products are 
now sourced. This ensures that the majority of our sourced 
products are covered by such audits, both in line with the growth 
of our business and our demand for greater compliance.

Charity of the year
Our policy on charitable giving is to concentrate on supporting 
one main charity and, in the year to 1 April 2011, we have 
worked with Macmillan Cancer Support. We have supported a 
number of their initiatives including the Macmillan Coffee Morning 
and the Macmillan Big Picnic, as well as creating our own fund-
raising activities. The biggest event was a Halfords/Macmillan 
Cycle challenge, which saw c.400 colleagues take part in a Cycle 
Relay linking our store in Elgin with our store in Penzance via 50 
of our stores raising c.£45,000 in the process. In total during the 
18-month partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support we have 
raised in excess of £134,000. We are also committed to 
supporting the communities we serve and individual stores also 
support local initiatives. From 2 April 2011 we have entered into 
a two-year partnership with Cancer Research.
Apprenticeships
The Group is aware of the need to provide employment 
opportunities within local communities and our Autocentres have 
the largest independent Apprentice Scheme in the motor 
industry. The scheme has been in operation for more than 20 
years and we plan to grow it significantly to meet the needs of 
our business, our local communities and our growth strategy. 
Our apprentice retention rates are excellent and to date we have 
never failed to offer employment to apprentices who complete 
the three-year scheme. We have also worked with the probation 
service, where we provided work experience places, which for 
some led to full-time jobs and with the prison service where we 
helped a local prison deliver a Motor Vehicle Repair course aimed 
at equipping offenders with the skills to get a job when released.
Industry forums
Halfords values opportunities to work closely with trade 
associations, research institutes, standards authorities, 
universities and government organisations to improve 
performance standards and safety. Representatives from the 
Halfords Quality department are members of British and 
International standards technical committees associated with 
automotive accessories and cycles and representatives of 
Halfords Autocentres are involved in SkillAuto, the organisation 
responsible for ensuring that the UK motor sector is represented 
at the European and World skills championships, with the IMI 
Awards National Advisory Forum who review and develop 
industry qualifications and with the Vehicle Operator Services 
Agency. Most recently we have led an initiative backed by the 
plain English society to reduce the use of technical jargon by 
garages. The guide, believed to be an industry first, has been 
awarded the “Crystal Mark” by the Plain English Campaign, 
which praised Halfords Autocentres for the initiative. This can be 
found at halfordsautocentres.com/GarageSpeak. Senior 
managers from Halfords Autocentres are also in debate with 
Government departments over changes to the current MoT 
regime.
In the future
Halfords will continue to work towards improving its management 
of the social, environmental and economic issues that are within 
its control and will continue to work with BiTC to ensure that we 
focus on the core areas of Corporate Responsibility whilst at the 
same time being proud custodians of the Halfords brand and its 
impact on its stakeholders. It makes good business sense that 
we ensure the right and proper interaction between our 
Company, our stores and our products, and our customers, their 
communities and their environment and, as highlighted by the 
BITC report, we intend to implement a community programme 
during 2011 and will report on its activities next year.  Resources

The Halfords Brand
Growth and leverage of a trusted high street brand 
for 109 years.
Branding and Marketing
Retail product positioning has always been a complex operation of understanding the target 
audience needs and sensitivities. Halfords continues to build techniques for the capture of market 
information from store and online channels and to use this in the design of new ranges.
Whilst half of the story is to create products to meet demand, the other half is to ensure there is 
shareholder value to be had from the margins achieved. Own brands can frequently be used to 
meet price points in the market whilst allowing our skilled sourcing teams to buy competitively.
As the Internet has empowered consumers’ research capability, Halfords’ own brands have 
successfully differentiated product and met price and specification expectations. The creation of 
the Pampero child car seat brand is an example. Child seats have a higher than average level of 
sales online, they are frequently researched prior to purchase, and comparison of known brands 
and models is easy to do online. Pampero was created to compete with premium brands whilst 
offering exceptional specification and can only be purchased through Halfords.
The skill of knowing when to use an existing brand 
and when to create a new one.
The Halfords brand is distinct and unique . . . there is nowhere quite like Halfords. In many 
categories Halfords products are consistently the UK’s No.1 choice, testament to the trust the 
brand has earned through the long-term delivery of good value.
The Halfords brand embodies our “life on the move” product and service range principles, it is the  
central aspect of our Group strategy of “single face to the customer” and its marketing value has 
leveraged our strategic aim to grow both the Retail and Autocentres multichannel business.
Through the use of TV, radio, direct mail and online campaigns the brand has engaged old and 
new target audiences using the “Helpful” personality, whilst reinforcing our value, quality and 
service advantage.
The 240 Halfords branded Autocentres now add significant national brand visibility whilst 
extending the store based services to a whole new level of trusted support for customers.

Systems
Halfords is online with upgraded warehousing, enterprise resource and web systems to cope with 
our efficient store logistics and successful multichannel offer. Investments have helped to drive up 
capacity and business intelligence whilst meeting our Group strategy of “least cost back-office”.
Halfords is one of the few true “bricks and clicks” operations and has delivered large scale 
leverage to our customer offer through the “Reserve & Collect” and “Order & Collect” services. 
These services integrate our website with store and DC inventories and increase the footfall to 
stores with particular range increasing opportunities for the smaller formats.
During the year Halfords launched a dedicated mobile website and it has seen consistent growth 
in volume.
Looking to the future Halfords now has the capability to enhance the customer experience and 
empower our “Helpful” culture with more functional applications for colleagues and customers.
The integration and roll-out of updates to many 
systems has put Halfords in a strong position.
Colleagues
Halfords people are central to our Group strategies of “Operational Specialisation” and “Least 
Cost Back-Office”; their talent and passion for service on the frontline ensures a great customer 
experience and the skill and dedication to efficiency and effectiveness ensure all back-office 
services improve year in year out. 
2011 is the beginning of an expanded culture of service delivery. Our “that’s helpful, that’s 
halfords” campaign is being rolled out as much within the business as with customers; indeed, 
there is a dependency on the former being delivered. Read more on page 22 about our “Helpful” 
culture development plans.
Our evolving training techniques and their consistent application continue to drive performance. 
Training is a key element in delivering a memorable service experience, including from a 
competence framework across the business to nationally recognised and accredited training 
programmes for Retail and Autocentres colleagues helping Halfords achieve customer loyalty and 
growth.

by the courteous and knowledgeable advice I 
received from the Sales Assistant in the Bicycle 
Department.
I was looking for a Schrader valve inner tube 
and a 28˝ tyre and the assistant, who was also a

pick the items for me.
Usually, I am lost when I go into large stores, but 
the help shown by your member of staff today 
has confirmed that I shall be using Halfords in

Distribution
Having come fully on stream in June 2010 the new Coventry distribution centre was a successful 
project as part of our “least cost back-office” Group strategy. In both financial and economic 
measures the new site has delivered the budgeted savings whilst giving the Group further growth 
potential. A net reduction of 240,000 km travelled was seen and with additional economies in 
vehicle fuel consumption Halfords will have delivered a saving of over 270,000 kg of CO
2
.
Within the distribution centres, many of the envisioned efficiencies have been achieved and the 
management of a multi-million pound rationalisation plan was carried out to a high standard. In 
practical terms the pick rate on bulk items has grown by 25% and on small items by 35%. In 
addition, the reliability of new automated warehouse systems has been excellent.
Going forward the logistics operations have an ambitious programme of improvements. First is 
in optimising the economics, second in supporting the internal aspects of “Helpful” by improving 
customer service and third with a colleague engagement programme for the recent recruits.
Having completed the distribution centre move the 
focus moves to operational efficiencies.
Sourcing
Our successful retail strategy of strong own brands has increased the need to source large 
quantities of own-brand products at a price structure and quality level to meet customer 
expectations and brand positioning. The majority of products are sourced through our UK-based 
buying teams with mutually beneficial relationships across manufacturers and distributors.
The Far East — A growing source of value has been our ability to deal more directly with the 
Far East as an economic supply region. Our new offices in China have proven invaluable, in 
investigating new sources of supply in inland China, compared with our historic sourcing in 
southern China. 
Ethics and quality — We have introduced our own code of conduct based upon established 
international standards which are regularly audited. In addition, most of the products are 
manufactured to EN, BS and ISO standards like ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 which are likewise 
audited by the international quality audit company BVQI.
Domestic growth in the Far East has at times 
introduced new challenges we have risen to well.

Market
To keep “life on the move” our customers need products and services which will keep their car, 
van or motorcycle roadworthy. As such, this category is less exposed to changes in disposable 
income. The current economic climate is expected to keep consumers’ minds focused on cost 
saving and therefore the Halfords approach to value remains attractive.
Value for motorists is a combination of price, quality and service and Halfords competes strongly 
in each aspect. Our range strategy offers options to meet all budgets and performance needs 
whilst the wefit store service can get the product professionally fitted both economically and 
conveniently by store colleagues.
Competition is fragmented with no nationally equivalent service provider. Geographically the 
supermarkets have a national network of outlets but have limited product scope and usually no 
service offering. Competing smaller car parts suppliers lack our brand strength and national 
accessibility, providing us with significant competitive advantage. 
Sustainability
The evolution of vehicle maintenance and complexity of repair in modern vehicles has meant the 
reduced long-term demand for heavy parts where consumers are driven to use service agents. 
These trends have also allowed us to build a service backed product range to meet the demand 
for the more consumable items. Evidence of these trends is seen in the growing proportion of 
sales now taken with a fitting services (23.5% of 3Bs in 2011).
Offer
Using our retailing competences, our large ranges follow a good, better, best positioning strategy 
and in particular our 3Bs (bulbs, blades and batteries) continues to perform well. Clearly labelled 
benefits allow customers to select upgraded product performance, and attachment rates for 
services are also growing.

Market
The market for enhancing “life on the move” is more exposed to changes in discretionary 
spend given its optional nature. In order to stay ahead in these product led categories Halfords 
have processes to capture both consumer buying tends and gain insight to broader market 
developments to select and update ranges. 
DAB digital radio is one of the market trends which has both an aspect of enhancement in that it 
has more channels and the sound quality is improved as well as macroeconomic shifts towards 
digital broadcasting that are driving uptake. Whilst the market is still in development there are an 
estimated 20 million cars in the UK that don’t currently have DAB radio, and Halfords is at the 
forefront of product ranges, availability and fitting capability to capture the opportunity.
Sustainability
Technological innovation creates constant streams of sales opportunities and lifestyle challenges. 
The evolution of products and features in core markets like CD Audio and Sat Nav provide 
upgrade sales well before products mature in a traditional sense. This is countered, however, by 
increased competition in some ranges where online price comparison can become the norm. 
We have developed a series of responses to these market challenges, learning fast and adapting 
ranges and services.
Offer
Product led categories like car enhancement inherently get more space in most of our advertising 
media. In stores we have comprehensive range displays and fully trained colleagues to ensure 
customers get the product they need and the opportunity to see the product and for many 
technology items be able to see them perform prior to purchase. 
Online provides an ideal opportunity to present both our detailed product information and to drive 
sales through our “Reserve & Collect” and “Order & Collect”.  Resources

Market
The Leisure category comprises two core groups, cycles and travel solutions. In cycling we hold 
the number one position selling one in three of all bikes in the UK. 
For those wanting “life on the move” to have a more social, health and environmental slant, 
cycling hits the mark. For commuting cycling offers the added bonus of economy to an already 
attractive proposition. Changes in the HMRC Cycle2Work scheme still provide a persuasive  
incentive for employers to provide tax efficient benefit to staff. Halfords has worked hard to  
clarify the options available and take-up is now stable; more information is available from  
www.cycle2work.info
Sustainability
Underlying consumer trends towards health, leisure and environmental concerns make cycling 
a category with potential to not only sustain into the medium term but offer attractive growth 
potential. Halfords’ multichannel competences have enabled changes in purchasing patterns to 
be dealt with effectively.
Offer
Participation in the cycle market by an increasingly wide range of competitors from the grocers to 
online “pure-play” companies has driven innovation in range attributes and service offers. At the 
low cost end the Trax range offers a boxed adult bike to compete with online price comparison 
whilst Apollo, Carrera, Voodoo and Boardman offer distinct value options right through to the 
premium end of the market. For every child and adult bike Halfords offer innovative “bundle” 
pricing deals including popular cycle accessories and services that differentiate our offer.

Market
The Travel Solutions division within the Leisure category includes product ranges to facilitate 
journeys, camping, child travel solutions and mobility products.
Our “life on the move” focus in travel solutions encompasses products which increase the 
capacity of carrying goods (like roof boxes and trailers), increase the safety of the journey (like 
child seats and safety vests) and provide service at destination or en route (like tents and camping 
equipment).
Many of these ranges have appeal to different segments of the UK audience at different times  
but certainly many facilitate the ability to holiday more cost-effectively and spend leisure time  
with family. In short there is balanced portfolio of product demand at different points in the 
economic cycle.
Sustainability
The long-term consumer trends towards leisure, safety and economy make our Travel Solutions 
ranges a category with attractive growth potential. Our growing brand association with leisure 
products continues to grow from the traditional core products like roof boxes and cycle carriers, 
to the expanding camping and mobility offer.
Offer
Travel Solutions is heavily promoted through our multichannel offer and on the more price 
competitive ranges we have created new products to drive margin. One example is the Pampero 
child seat range — it offers equivalent quality and performance at a lower price point whilst 
maintaining margins. The Halfords offer also has the benefit of a professional fitting service.  Resources

wecheck is a service most 
commonly provided free of charge 
which allows all customers to 
ensure the part required is not only in need of replacement, but 
also to ensure the correct part is supplied. It also performs a 
wider role in expanding the audience we see visiting our stores. 
The increased audience from a wider family group are reassured 
in the knowledge that our colleagues help them every step of the 
way; whether checking screenwash or oil level, we help facilitate 
“life on the move”. 
Our werepair offer is perhaps the 
most under-utilised area of 
service, but one which has 
potential to grow significantly as customers become more aware 
of what can be delivered by our store colleagues. From cycle 
repairs and maintenance to the car scratch and dent service 
many of our colleagues have been trained to deliver to high 
standards of quality and safety.
Cycles has seen the most 
significant implementation of 
our maintenance offer. When 
purchasing a cycle or at the free six week check stage, 
customers can purchase a plan to have the labour element of 
regular maintenance covered (a bike care plan). Policies are 
issued lasting between one and three years. The customer gets 
peace of mind and a higher level of safety, while our stores get 
increased footfall, sales of the consumable items used and 
improved customer loyalty. It is also a service not offered by 
online and supermarket competitors so has growth and 
defensive potential.
Year on year we have seen significant growth 
in the wefit offer. The offer enables us to 
deliver the following benefits:
•	impr oved	customer	service 
•	impr oved	safety	with	pr ofessional	fitting 
•	incr eased	loyalty	to	the	brand 
•	cr oss-selling,	up-selling	and	attachment	opportunities
The demonstration and fitting of our child safety products, for 
example, provides peace of mind to parents and ensures best 
practice is followed for fit and general operation. 
The build and 
assembly of products 
is another key 
differentiator, especially where safety and complexity is 
concerned. Cycles and trailers are examples of product groups 
where the assembly and testing service enhances the customer 
experience and builds customer loyalty.
Resources and Capabilities continued
In-store Services
In-store services continue to be a success story 
driven by a high value service meeting a growing 
market demand. Our fitting services are central to

Our compelling service offers are designed for the growing “do it for me” audience and meet the 
level of support and service provision required by the customer.
Each service varies according to customer competence, confidence and desire to get involved 
and by the product complexity and safety needs. We continue to develop a compelling and 
comprehensive range of support services which make us the natural destination to facilitate “life 
on the move” and creates for Halfords a sustainable competitive advantage.
Our service innovations have secured not only increased transaction values but has attracted 
new consumer groups to Halfords. The offer is both a strategic defence and a growth driver 
differentiating us with check, assembly, repair and fitting services.

Halfords operates 466 stores which include 402 superstores, 29 compact stores and 35 metro 
stores. Our stores are within 20 minutes’ travelling time for 90% of the UK population and are 
increasingly optimised in layout and range which is specific to local demographics.
Halfords’ large store network not only allows us to present goods in prime locations but also to 
serve as a consolidation point drawing in web customers with the “Reserve & Collect” and “Order 
& Collect” online offer. They also facilitate the delivery of our range of retail services which include 
checking, building and fitting products.
Of the five factors affecting stores business performance — Value, Stock, Expertise, Range 
and Service — a good deal of work on several fronts has furthered the Retail strategic aims of 
“Extending range and service” and “Investing in the store portfolio”. 
Improvement in colleague work patterns has optimised the availability on the shop floor of the 
right people at the right time to improve the customer experience of helpfulness. Ongoing store 
refreshment has improved layout and promotion and continues to show good returns.
The pervasive use and uptake of mobile technology which has helped Halfords see impressive 
growth from the mobile website and provides many potential options for assisting customers in-
store. The potential to leverage PC tablets in particular for smaller format stores to showcase our 
14,000+ product lines also remains an area of investigation.
New store formats are also being investigated in highly populated urban locations where very 
significant range and layout changes are based upon local demographics. Halfords has pilot 
stores in London where as much as 60% of range is focused on cycles and accessories.  Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

The Halfords multichannel strategy has grown significantly year on year and combined with the 
Halfords store network offers a compelling array of services which meet the changing buyer 
behaviour as online becomes further embedded in everyday life.
Competition online stems from either the “pure play” internet only companies or organisations 
which also have a “bricks and mortar” store network. Each of the competitor types has strengths 
and weaknesses to which Halfords has developed strong competitive responses to. As a result 
the multichannel offer continues to outperform the average industry growth rates with online sales 
growing by over 36.4%.
To take advantage of the macroeconomic trend to buy online and increasingly through mobile 
devices, Halfords has continued to strengthen the multichannel teams and further integrate 
techniques and knowledge with the core retail business. During the year additional members 
joined as specialists in retail trading, digital marketing, search analysis and analytics which has 
served to inform a range of new buying and trading strategies.
Online product selection and targeting has also been refined, whilst the product range is in total 
only around 45% larger than our superstores. In selective categories where we have identified 
higher levels of online participation, the ranges offered can be up to 600% larger than a store to 
best capture online buying behaviour. 
Our “Reserve & Collect” and “Order & Collect” continue to be effective in getting customers into 
store which is our preferred option, this allows us to improve attachment rates through upgrades 
and accessorisation. In addition, we provide our build and fit services to ensure safe and 
appropriate product usage. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

The first full year as part of Halfords has seen all 224

Halfords Autocentres is the largest car service network in the UK with currently around 1% market 
share of the estimate £9bn car aftercare market. The addition of full service capability means the 
Halfords customer offer runs from the DIY with retail parts sales, through “Do it for me” with the 
in-store wefit service to the complete vehicle maintenance package.
The car maintenance market has by virtue of its needs driven nature some insulation from 
economic cycles although can be exposed to owners choosing to extend service cycles. The 
Halfords offer in car servicing has developed a series of strategies to optimise capture of new 
business both by harnessing the Halfords brand as well as operational improvements.
The service market consists of three broad segments. At one extreme are the franchised dealers: 
slick, credible and trusted but generally costly. At the other extreme are the small private garages 
and mechanics, a generally less polished experience and frequently without the security of a large 
organisation’s resources, but the costs are lower. In the middle ground Halfords Autocentres 
offer the best of both, a cost structure which is competitive but a service which also delivers high 
standards and does not compromise manufacturers warranties’, the backing of a large group and 
the latest technology and training.
This balance of franchise quality service and competitive price is attractive to both retail 
customers and fleet operators alike and we deal very effectively with a number of very large fleets.
During the year brand testing was carried out at test centres during May to July which 
encompassed comprehensive research from consumers on the service offer. From August the full 
224 Autocentres were rebranded in seven months with over 30 centres rebranded every month 
and included a full refresh of marketing materials and website. The programme was completed on 
time, to budget and, based on the broad feedback received, to a high standard.
On 28 February 2011, Halfords Autocentres launched its first national above the line advertising 
campaign. This featured radio commercials with the new “that’s helpful, that’s halfords” 
campaign, and we ran the first phase in the spring of 2011.
With a growing and ageing car parc and cars lasting longer than ever, the need for car service 
is assured in the medium to long term. We are experienced at consolidating the requirements in 
fragmented markets and with a long heritage of dealing with retail customers, we are uniquely 
aligned to take advantage.

£109.7m) and the profit after tax amounted to £85.5m (2010: £77.0m).
The Directors propose that a final dividend of 14p per ordinary share be 
paid on 5 August 2011 to shareholders whose names are on the 
register of members at the close of business on 1 July 2011. This 
payment, together with the interim dividend of 8p per ordinary share 
paid on 24 January 2011, makes a total for the year of 22p per ordinary 
share. The total final dividend payable to shareholders for the year is 
estimated to be £29.5m. Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust Limited, trustee of 
the Halfords Employee Share Trust, has waived its entitlement to 
dividends.
Performance monitoring
The delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives is monitored by the 
Board through Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) and the periodic 
review of various aspects of the Group’s operations. The Board 
considers the KPIs listed on pages 16, 17, 20 and 21 are appropriate 
measures for the delivery of the strategy of the Group and its two 
divisions — Retail and Autocentres.
Donations 
During the year the Group contributed £73,000 (2010: £82,800) to 
Charities in the UK, including donations to BEN, a charity supporting 
individuals and families linked to the motor industry and associated 
trades. 
In 2009 Halfords commenced a two-year partnership with Macmillan 
Cancer Support which ended on 31 March 2011. During the course of 
the partnership the Company raised over £134,000 for the charity with 
stores selling carrier bags and sweets, holding events and individual 
employees undertaking fund-raising events ranging from running 
marathons to holding charity auctions, together with head office and 
store colleagues participating in relay bike ride.
The Group’s policy is not to make any donations for political purposes. 
However, the Companies Act 2006 defines the term “donations” very 
widely and, as a result, certain expenses legitimately incurred as part of 
the process of talking to Government at all levels and making the 
Group’s position known, are now reportable. Although during the year 
no such expenditure or political donations were made, resolutions were 
passed at the 2010 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) that provided for 
limited authority for such expenditure, such authority remaining valid 
until the earlier of 4 October 2011 or the conclusion of the AGM to be 
held in 2011, and as such the Company will be asking for this limited 
authority to be renewed at the AGM to be held on 2 August 2011.
Colleagues
The Board seeks to instill high standards of customer care and service 
in the Group and the commitment of every colleague to this business 
requirement is considered to be critical. The Group has established a 
framework of communication for colleagues concerning business 
performance and Company benefits. Group-wide training reinforces the 
Group’s commitment to colleague involvement and development.
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in 
employment and to ensuring that no applicant or colleague receives 
less favourable treatment on the grounds of gender, marital status, 
race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, sexuality, age, or is disadvantaged 
by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown to be justified. 
The Group applies employment policies which are fair and equitable 
and which seek to promote entry into and progression within the 
Group. Appointments are determined solely by application of job 
criteria, personal ability and competency.
The Group gives full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities, wherever suitable opportunities exist, 
and training and career development support are provided, where 
appropriate. Should a colleague become disabled when working for the 
Group, efforts are made to continue their employment and retraining is 
provided, if necessary.
The Directors present their report and the audited financial statements  
of Halfords Group plc (the “Company”) together with its subsidiary 
undertakings (the “Group”) for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011.

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
A “whistle-blowing” policy and procedure is in place and has been 
notified to all Retail and Autocentre colleagues. The policy enables them 
to report any concerns on matters affecting the Group or their 
employment, without fear of recrimination, and reduces the risk of 
things going wrong or of malpractice taking place and remaining 
unreported. In addition, the Group takes a zero-tolerance approach to 
matters of discrimination, harassment and bullying in all aspects of its 
business operations, whether they relate to sex, race, national origin, 
disability, age, religion or sexual orientation, and policies and 
procedures are also in place for reporting and dealing with these 
matters.
Owning shares in the Company is an important way of strengthening 
colleagues’ involvement in the development of the Group’s business 
and bringing together their and shareholders’ interests. The Group 
therefore encourages the Group’s colleagues to participate in its 
Sharesave Scheme.

positions as directors of the company on 1 April 2011, will offer 
themselves for re-election at that the company’s AGM on 2 August 
2010. 
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in shares and options over shares in the 
Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 
84 to 93. 
In response to the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 introduced 
in October 2008, each Director has notified the Company of any 
situation in which he or she has, or can have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the 
Company (a situational conflict). These interests were considered and 
approved by the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Association and each Director was informed of the authorisation and 
the terms on which it was given. 
Directors’ indemnities 
Article 136 the Company’s Articles of Association provides that every 
Director is entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the Company 
against all costs and liabilities incurred by him in the execution of his 
duties or the exercise of his powers or otherwise in connection with his 
duties, powers or office including any liability incurred by him in 
defending any proceedings, civil or criminal, which relate to anything 
done or omitted to have been done or omitted by him as an officer of 
the Company and in which judgement is given in his favour or in which 
he is acquitted.
During the year the Company maintained liability insurance for its 
Directors and officers. The Directors of the Company, and the Directors 
of each of the Company’s subsidiaries, have the benefit of an indemnity 
provision in the Company’s Articles of Association. The indemnity 
provision, which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision as 
defined by section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, has been in force 
throughout the year.
Directors’ responsibilities
The statement of Directors’ responsibilities in preparing the Annual 
Report and the Financial Statements can be found on page 96 of the 
Annual Report.
Disclosure of information to Auditors
The Directors of the Group have taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any 
information needed by the Group’s Auditors in connection with 
preparing their report and to establish that the Auditors are aware of 
that information and so far as the Directors are aware there is no such 
information of which the Group’s Auditors are unaware. The Directors 
are responsible for maintaining the integrity of financial information 
which includes the Annual Report, together with other financial 
statements, presentations and announcements on the Group’s website 
halfordscompany.com. Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
Supplier payment policy
The Group does not follow any formal code or standard on payment 
practice, but agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions 
when orders for goods and services are placed, and includes the 
relevant terms in contracts, where appropriate. These arrangements are 
adhered to when making payments, subject to the terms and 
conditions being met by suppliers. The number of trade creditor days 
outstanding at the period end for the Group was 59 days (2010: 49 
days). The Company is a holding company and had no trade creditors 
at the end of the financial year.
Contractual or other arrangements
The Directors consider that there are no contractual or other 
arrangements, such as those with major suppliers, which are likely to 
influence, directly or indirectly, the performance of the business and its 
value.  Governance

Major Shareholders
At 3 June 2011, the Company’s share register of substantial 
shareholdings showed the following interests in three per cent or more 
of the Company’s issued ordinary shares:
 
Holder
Number of 
shares
% of issued 
shares
Artemis Investment Mgt Ltd 12,154,298 5.7
Capital (Institutional Grp) 11,724,908 5.5

L&G Investment Management 7,721,079 3.6
F&C Asset Management 7,306,885 3.4
M&C Investments 6,419,454 3.0
The Takeover Directive
As at 1 April 2011 and 2 April 2010, the Company’s authorised share 
capital was £2,950,000 divided into 295,000,000 ordinary shares of 1p 
each nominal value (“ordinary shares”). On 1 April 2011 there were 
211,985,998 (2010: 210,710,960) ordinary shares in issue. These 
ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
All ordinary shares rank equally with respect to voting rights and the 
rights to receive dividends. Shares acquired through Company share 
schemes and plans rank pari passu with the shares in issue and have 
no special rights.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s 
Annual report and financial statements; to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company; to appoint proxies and to exercise voting 
rights.
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of any 
class of shares and no requirements for prior approval of any transfers. 
None of the shares carry any special rights with regard to control of the 
Company.
There are no known arrangements under which the financial rights are 
held by a person other than the holder of the shares and no known 
agreements on restrictions on share transfers or on voting rights.
The rules about the appointment and replacement of Directors are 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. Following the 
publication of a revised Combined Code on 28 May 2010, the Board 
has agreed that all Directors will stand for re-election on an annual basis 
and this requirement was adopted into the Company’s Articles of 
Association on 27 July 2010.
Changes to the Articles of Association must be approved by the 
shareholders in accordance with the legislation in force from time to 
time.
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or 
employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and plan may cause options and awards 
granted to employees under such schemes and plans to vest on a 
takeover.
The Company has Term and Revolving facilities and under the terms of 
these credit facilities, the Company is required, in the event of a change 
of control, to give notification to the facility agent and if so required by 
the majority lenders the facilities may be cancelled.
Authority to purchase shares
At the AGM on 27 July 2010 shareholders approved a special 
resolution authorising the Company to purchase a maximum of 
21,101,923 shares, representing 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital at 18 June 2010, such authority expiring at the conclusion of the 
AGM to be held in 2011. The Directors intend to optimise the Group’s 
balance sheet to enhance shareholder returns and on 7 April 2011 
commenced a £75m share buyback programme. In the 52 weeks to  
1 April 2011 the Company purchased Nil shares (2010: Nil), 
representing a nominal value of £Nil (2010: £Nil).
Auditors
At the AGM held on 27 July 2010 KPMG Audit Plc were appointed as 
the Company’s external Auditors. KPMG Audit Plc has indicated its 
willingness to accept reappointment as the external Auditor of the 
Company. A resolution proposing its reappointment is contained in the 
Notice of the AGM and will be put to shareholders at the meeting.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Business Review on pages 12 to 49. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Finance Director’s Review on pages 32 to 37. In 
addition, note 20 to the Group financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
With effect from 5 November 2010 the Group secured a four-year 
£300m revolving credit facility (extendable by a further year) and at  
1 April 2011 the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of £211m.  
The Group’s previous and current committed borrowing facilities contain 
certain financial covenants, which have been met throughout the 
period.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should 
be able to operate within the level of its borrowing facilities and 
covenants for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, the directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

term direction and strategy of the Group in a framework of sound and 
robust corporate governance. The Board is committed to high

Operation of the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board, 
which it has reviewed during the year and considered fit for purpose. 
The Board’s primary role is to determine the long-term direction and 
strategy of the Group, create value for shareholders, monitor the 
achievement of business objectives, monitor risk and ensure that good 
corporate governance is practised and that the Group meets all 
responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, employees and other 
stakeholders. 
The Board is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate processes 
are in place in respect of succession planning for appointments to the 
Board and to key senior management positions and to establish and 
monitor the Group’s policies and performance in the area of corporate 
social responsibility.
To enable the Board to function effectively and assist Directors to 
discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all 
relevant information. In the case of Board meetings, this consists of a 
comprehensive set of papers, including regular business progress 
reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters. In 
addition, individual non-executive directors meet with senior 
management and make periodic site visits. Senior managers are 
regularly invited to Board meetings and make business presentations. 
The Chairman, supported by the Company Secretary, maintains a 
rolling twelve-month agenda for Board meetings to ensure all relevant 
matters are planned into the cycle of meetings and considered at the 
appropriate time.
Where a Director has a concern over any unresolved business he is 
entitled to require the Company Secretary to minute that concern. 
Should that Director later resign over this issue, the Chairman will bring 
it to the attention of the Board.
The Group is supportive of executive Directors who wish to take on a 
non-executive directorship with a company outside the Group, as 
exposure to such duties can broaden experience and knowledge, 
which will be to the benefit of the Group. Executive Directors may retain 
any fees they receive. On 7 March 2011 David Wild was appointed a 
non-executive director to the Board of Premier Foods plc and, until his 
resignation on 30 November 2010, Nick Wharton was a non-executive 
director on the Board of Dunelm Group plc where he also chaired the 
Audit Committee.
The Board had nine scheduled meetings this year and others as 
required. During 2010 five additional Board meetings were held to 
consider business outside the normal calendar of agendas. Whilst the 
Board has specific responsibility for those matters reserved for its 
consideration, in certain areas, specific responsibility is delegated to 
committees of the Board within defined terms of reference.
During the year the Board committees, Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration, scheduled four, seven and six meetings respectively 
additional meetings were held where appropriate. Individual Director 
attendance is shown below.

Directors and their interests
During the period there have been a number of changes to the 
composition of the Board including the resignation as Finance Director 
of Nick Wharton on 30 November 2010 and the appointment of 
Andrew Findlay as Finance Director on 1 February 2011. Non-Executive 
Director changes include the appointments of Claudia Arney on 25 
January 2011 and David Adams on 1 March 2011 and the resignation 
of Nigel Wilson on 31 March 2011. From 2 April 2010 until his 
resignation Nigel Wilson was the Company’s Senior Independent 
Director. Bill Ronald has held the position since 1 April 2011.
Dennis Millard was appointed Chairman on 28 May 2009, and was 
considered on appointment to meet the independence criteria as set 
out in paragraph A.3.1 and B.1.1 of the Code and continued with his 
existing commitments (as disclosed on page 72).
The other non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and within the definition of the 
Code. Accordingly, no individual or group of individuals dominates the 
Board’s decision-making and the requirements of paragraph B.1.2 of 
the Code that at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) should 
comprise independent non-executive Directors is satisfied. At the same 
time in accordance with the Combined Code, separate individuals have 
been appointed to the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive 
respectively as described above and job descriptions delineating a clear 
division of responsibilities between the two have been compiled and 
issued. 
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors contribute external 
expertise and experience in areas of importance to the Group such as 
marketing, customer and consumer focus, multichannel trading, 
retailing, corporate finance, general finance and corporate governance. 
They also contribute independent challenge and rigour to the Board’s 
deliberations, and assist in the development of the Company’s strategy, 
scrutiny of the performance of management in meeting agreed goals 
and targets and satisfying themselves of the integrity of the Company’s 
internal controls and risk management systems. The Board believes 
that all of the Directors devote sufficient time and attention as is 
necessary in order to perform their duties.  Governance

Corporate Governance continued
Non-executive Directors are appointed for specified terms (normally 
three years) and their Terms and Conditions of Appointment are 
available on the Group’s website halfordscompany.com. They are 
subject to reappointment under the Company’s Articles of Association 
and subject to the Companies Act provisions relating to the removal of 
a Director. 
The Board has formally adopted an induction programme for new 
Directors, which will be tailored to each new Director who joins the 
Board and includes briefings regarding the activities of the Group and 
visits to operational sites. Documentation and training on their duties as 
Directors are also available to all Directors. All Directors are members of 
the Deloitte Academy, a training resource that provides support and 
guidance to boards, individual directors and company secretaries. In 
addition, Directors are also informed regularly on relevant material 
changes to laws and regulations affecting the Group’s business. All 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, who is also responsible for advising the Board on all 
governance matters.
Following the guidelines of the UK Corporate Governance Code that all 
directors should retire and seek re-election on an annual basis, the 
Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the Company’s 
last Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) to mirror these guidelines 
Consequently, all Directors on the Board on 1 April 2011 will seek 
election or re-election at the Company’s AGM on 2 August 2011.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests of 
the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of the 
Company and options to subscribe for shares in the Company are 
shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 93. The 
Directors have wide experience and expertise and their biographical 
details are given on pages 72 to 73.
In response to the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she 
has, or can have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational conflict). 
These interests were considered and approved by the Board in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and each 
Director was informed of the authorisation and the terms on which it 
was given. All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the 
Company Secretary regarding any further possible situational conflict 
that may arise so that prior consideration can be given by the Board as 
to whether or not such conflict will be approved.
Evaluation of the Board and its committees
The Board has established a formal process for the annual evaluation of 
the performance of the Board, its principal committees and individual 
Directors. The process for 2010 identified the following actions:
■ ■ To align the Company with the recommendations made by the 
Financial Reporting Council as a result of its review of the 
Combined Code, the Board felt that the process for identifying, 
reviewing and monitoring risk could be made more dynamic and 
the Board’s “risk appetite” should be defined. A review of the 
process was carried out and a more dynamic, bottom-up/top-
down basis was adopted. 
■ ■ Given the Company’s strategic objective of leveraging the Halfords 
brand within its multichannel offer, it was felt that the Board would 
benefit from greater exposure to trends within this fast-moving 
environment. Claudia Arney, who has extensive multichannel 
experience, has been appointed to the board.
Given the number of changes to the Board towards the end of the year, 
it was decided to postpone the 2011 board evaluation process until 
each of the three new board members had settled in to their roles. 
Furthermore, it was decided to include in the process one-on-one 
meetings between the Chairman and each board member to 
supplement questionnaires that were issued for the evaluation of each 
committee. The interview process was carried out in May 2011 and 
covered such topics as the board agenda, meeting process, 
composition, succession plans, relationships between board members, 
their individual performance and the board’s role in the formulation of 
group strategy and policy. The Senior Independent Director also 
discussed the performance of the Chairman with each board member.
 A review of these responses by the Board or by the appropriate 
Committee, is underway and appropriate action will be taken to ensure 
that the performance of the Board as a whole, its principal committees 
and individual Directors is such that each can perform at the optimum 
level for the benefit of the Company. A full report back will be provided 
in the 2012 Annual Report. 
Board Committees
The Board has established an effective Committee structure to assist in 
the discharge of its responsibilities. The terms of reference of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees comply with the provisions 
of the Combined Code and are available for inspection on the 
Company’s website, halfordscompany.com.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees. Only the members of each Committee are 
entitled to attend its meetings, although other Directors, professional 
advisers and members of the senior management team attend when 
invited to do so. The Audit Committee will invite the external Auditor to 
certain of its meetings. In the cases of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, no member is present when business 
pertinent to them is under discussion. A Treasury Committee, 
composed of senior members of the finance and treasury teams and 
chaired by the Finance Director, has been established to manage the 
day-to-day treasury needs of the Group. 
When the need arises, separate ad hoc committees may be set up by 
the Board to consider specific issues. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Remuneration Committee
For the financial period to 1 April 2011, the Remuneration Committee 
comprised Keith Harris (Chairman), Nigel Wilson, Bill Ronald, Dennis 
Millard and, following their appointments on 25 January 2011 and  
1 March 2011, Claudia Arney and David Adams. All are considered to 
be independent non-executive Directors.
Executive Directors attend Remuneration Committee meetings at the 
invitation of the Committee Chairman. 
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on 
remuneration of executive Directors, the Company Secretary and senior 
managers and its Chairman, Keith Harris, takes this responsibility very 
seriously, stating that “Within the general framework of corporate 
governance, remuneration committees have the key responsibility of 
balancing management’s expectations with the interests of all 
stakeholders. A key role of the committee is to attract and retain 
executives of the highest quality, and to motivate them to deliver 
shareholder value. They must set targets for management that are 
stretching yet attainable but not so far reaching as to encourage 
excessive risk taking. To function effectively such committees must 
have authority and independence of thought; never more than in 
today’s challenging environment is the work of remuneration 
committees so carefully scrutinised.”
The Committee determines, within agreed terms of reference, specific 
remuneration packages for each of the Chairman, the executive 
Directors and Company Secretary of the Company and such members 
of senior management as it is delegated to consider. This includes 
pension rights; any compensation payments; and the implementation of 
executive incentive schemes. In accordance with the Committee’s 
terms of reference, no Director may participate in discussions relating to 
their own terms and conditions of service or remuneration.
Further information on the activities of the Remuneration Committee is 
set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 84 to 93. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the status of the Company’s 
compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code with regard to remuneration matters and includes a statement on 
the Company’s policy on Directors and senior managers’ remuneration, 
benefits, share scheme entitlements and pension arrangements. A 
resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration report will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Company’s Chairman 
Dennis Millard, who believes that “The composition of the Board and 
the senior management team as well as well-defined succession plans 
for each are critical to the success of Halfords, as with any company. 
During this year, the Committee was particularly actively engaged with 
the appointment of three new Board members and with the 
appointment of a number of senior executives. In doing so, emphasis 
was placed on securing candidates that not only fit the role 
specification but also on how well they would interact with the team as 
well as the fresh and challenging approach we believed they could, and 
should bring. We believe that this has been achieved.” During the year 
the Committee also included Keith Harris, Bill Ronald, Nigel Wilson, 
David Wild and, following their appointments on 25 January 2011 and 1 
March 2011, Claudia Arney and David Adams. All are considered to be 
independent non-executive Directors. The Code states that the test of 
independence is not appropriate in relation to the Chairman after his 
appointment and the Board feels it is appropriate, as all non-executive 
Directors sit on the committee, that the committee should be chaired 
by the Chairman of the Group. Senior members of management and 
advisers are invited to attend meetings as appropriate.
The Committee has responsibility for considering the size, structure and 
composition of the Board of the Company, for reviewing senior 
management succession plans, retirements and appointments of 
additional and replacement Directors and making appropriate 
recommendations so as to maintain an appropriate balance of skills 
and experience on the Board.
The Nomination Committee has established a process for Board 
appointments that it considers to be formal, rigorous and transparent 
and involves the use of external executive recruitment agencies. This 
process includes a review of the skills, experience and knowledge of 
the existing Directors, to assess which of the potential shortlisted 
candidates would most benefit the balance of the Board having regard 
also to the need for succession planning. During the search for a new 
Finance Director and for new non-executive Directors, the committee 
used the services of the executive recruitment agency Egon Zehnder. 
Egon Zehnder has no other connection with the Company.
In recommending Claudia Arney and David Adams to be appointed 
non-executive Directors of the Group, the Nomination Committee 
assessed the time commitment required by the position and in 
approving these appointment the Board took this into account and also 
considered Claudia and David’s other commitments. The Board 
concluded that they both had enough time to fulfil their commitments to 
the Group and their other commitments would not affect their ability to 
carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively for the Group.
Audit Committee
For the financial period to 1 April 2011, the Audit Committee comprised 
Nigel Wilson, Keith Harris and Bill Ronald and, following their 
appointments on 25 January 2011 and 1 March 2011, Claudia Arney 
and David Adams, all of whom are independent non-executive 
Directors. Until his resignation on 31 March 2011 the Committee 
chairman was Nigel Wilson, who, as Chief Financial Officer of Legal & 
General plc, was considered by the Board to have recent and relevant 
financial experience. From 1 April 2011 David Adams was appointed 
Chairman of the Committee. David has been the Deputy Chief 
Executive and Finance Director of the House of Fraser Plc and as such 
is also considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial 
experience. David believes that “The work of the audit committee is key 
to securing stakeholder confidence in the financial statements of the 
Company. The constant process of review of the processes involved in 
the production of these statements, covering assessment of risk, review 
of controls, and awareness of a regulatory framework that is constantly 
evolving, is fundamental to the committee’s exercise of its 
responsibilities. In addition, the committee manages the relationship 
with the internal auditors to ensure independence , and works with the 
external auditors and the Board to set the planned activity for the 
internal audit function.”
Each of the other independent non-executive Directors on the 
Committee has, through their other business activities, significant 
experience in financial matters. The Chairman, senior members of 
management and advisers are invited to attend meetings as 
appropriate.  Governance
82
18559 17/06/2011 Proof 5
The Audit Committee meets according to the requirements of the 
Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the Audit Committee 
also provide the opportunity for the independent non-executive 
Directors to meet without the executive Directors present and also the 
opportunity to raise any issues of concern with the Company’s external 
Auditor.
The Audit Committee is responsible for making recommendations to 
the Board on the appointment of the external Auditor and their 
remuneration, for reviewing the accounting principles, policies and 
practices adopted in the preparation of the Interim Report and Annual 
Report and Financial Statement and reviewing the scope and findings 
of the audit. The Committee assists the Board in achieving its 
obligations under the Code in areas of risk management and internal 
control, focusing particularly on compliance with legal requirements, 
accounting standards and the Listing Rules, and ensures that an 
effective system of internal financial and non-financial controls is 
maintained. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
Annual Report and Financial Statements remains with the Board. 
The Committee will keep under review the external Auditor’s 
independence including any non-audit services that are to be provided 
by the external Auditor. The Auditor is also requested to confirm their 
independence at least annually. During the year a policy which ensured 
that the nature of the advice to be provided could not impair the 
objectivity of the external Auditor’s opinion on the Group’s financial 
statements was followed. The policy incorporated a fee limit of 
£25,000, above which a formal tender process must be undertaken 
and approval of the Committee obtained prior to any proposed 
appointment. This policy was reviewed in June 2011 and in future all 
non-audit work conducted by the external Auditor must have prior 
approval from the Audit Committee.
The Committee has approved a formal whistle-blowing policy whereby 
staff may, in confidence, disclose issues of concern about possible 
malpractice or wrongdoings by any of the Group’s businesses or any of 
its employees without fear of reprisal. This includes arrangements to 
investigate such matters and for appropriate follow-up action, and the 
roll-out to our Autocentre colleagues.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout the Group and ensuring 
that there is a process in accordance with the guidelines laid down by 
the Turnbull Report to identify, evaluate and manage any significant 
risks that may affect the achievement of the Group’s strategic 
objectives. 
The assessment of effectiveness has been carried out this year. The 
system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Board and the Audit Committee have reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal control and risk 
management in accordance with the Code for the financial period to  
1 April 2011, and up to the date of approving the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
The internal audit function provides internal audit reports to the Board, 
via the Audit Committee. Whilst directed by Andrew Findlay and 
previously Nick Wharton, the Company’s Finance Directors, it is 
independent in action and reporting, and has a direct line of 
communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. The principal role in 
fulfilling the internal audit function is to review the effectiveness of the 
controls operating within the business by undertaking an agreed 
schedule of independent audits each year. The nature and scope of this 
annual audit programme is determined by the Audit Committee at the 
beginning of each calendar year and may be revised from time to time 
according to changing business circumstances and requirements. 
The findings of these audits are reported initially to executive 
management and any necessary corrective actions are agreed. 
Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed with, the 
Audit Committee along with details of progress against action  
plans as appropriate.
The Board considers risk assessment and control to be fundamental to 
achieving its corporate objectives within an acceptable risk/reward 
profile and there is an ongoing process for identifying and evaluating the 
significant risks faced by the Group and the effectiveness of related 
controls. The key elements of this process are:
■ ■ a comprehensive system of monthly reporting from key executives, 
identifying performance against budget, analysis of variances, major 
business issues, key performance indicators and regular 
forecasting;
■ ■ well-defined policies governing appraisal and approval of capital 
expenditure and treasury operations;
■ ■ reviews of key business risks and of management’s controls and 
plans to mitigate these risks; and
■ ■ an annual corporate governance confirmation made to the Board 
by all senior executives on the effectiveness of the identification of 
major risks and of the monitoring of internal controls within their 
areas of responsibility. 
As part of the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the key business risks faced by the Group, the Board has established a 
Risk Management Group to oversee the implementation of the risk 
management framework, co-ordinate risk management activities 
throughout the business and to report to the Board and Audit 
Committee on risk issues. The Risk Management Group is chaired by 
the Company Secretary and includes senior managers from Store 
Operations, Business Systems, Health and Safety, Human Resources, 
Finance, Store Assurance, Business Services, Multichannel, Logistics, 
and Supply Chain functions. During the financial period to 1 April 2011 
and up to the date of this report the Group considered the Company’s 
Risk Register and its alignment with the Company’s key strategic 
objectives and reported its findings to the Board. The Board considered 
its appetite for risk in relation to the top 30 risks and determined that 
the risks and mitigating actions were appropriate to the level of risk that 
was both acceptable to and incumbent within a FTSE 250 business. 
More information on the Company’s key risks and uncertainties are 
shown on pages 38 to 41.

Relationships with shareholders
Nigel Wilson was the Senior Independent Director until his resignation 
on 31 March 2011 and Bill Ronald was appointed Senior Independent 
Director on 1 April 2011 following this resignation. The Senior 
Independent Director is available to meet shareholders upon request if 
they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the 
Chairman or the executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which 
such contact is inappropriate.
The Board recognises the importance of establishing and maintaining 
good relationships with all of the Company’s shareholders and Bill 
Ronald has indicated his willingness to meet with any shareholders as 
they request. During the period under review the Chief Executive, 
Finance Director, Chairman and Remuneration Committee Chairman 
have met with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of significant developments and report to the Board 
accordingly on the views of these stakeholders. 
Each of the other non-executive Directors is also offered the opportunity 
to attend meetings with major shareholders and would do so if 
requested by any major shareholder. The Company’s investor relations 
programme includes formal presentations of full year and interim results 
and meetings with individual investors as appropriate. Independent 
feedback from these meetings is provided to the Board. The Company 
Secretary is also charged with bringing to the attention of the Board any 
material matters of concern raised by the Company’s shareholders, 
including private investors.
The Interim Report and the Annual Report and Financial Statements are 
the primary means used by the Board for communicating during the 
year with all of the Company’s shareholders. The Board also recognises 
the importance of the internet as a means of communicating widely, 
quickly and cost-effectively and an investor relations website 
(halfordscompany.com) has been developed to facilitate 
communications with shareholders. Information available online includes 
copies of the full and half-year financial statements, press releases and 
Company news, corporate governance information and statements and 
the terms of reference for the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. 
The Board is committed to the constructive use of the AGM as a forum 
to meet with shareholders and to hear their views and answer their 
questions about the Group and its business. The AGM of the Group is 
to be held on Tuesday 2 August 2011 at the Hyatt Hotel, Bridge Road, 
Birmingham. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Nomination and Audit 
Committees will normally attend the meeting and will answer questions 
that may be relevant to the work of those Committees. If they are 
unable to attend they will appoint a deputy to attend in their place. It is 
the Company’s practice to propose separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue at the AGM. The Chairman will advise 
shareholders on the proxy voting details at the meeting.
The Company’s financial calendar is set out on page 146.

with the June 2008 Combined Code, Schedules 5 and 8 of the Large 
and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The report has been approved both by the Remuneration Committee 
and by the Board, and a resolution to approve the report will be

Remuneration Committee 
Membership
The Committee comprised the following non-executive Directors during 
the financial period to 1 April 2011:
Keith Harris (Committee Chairman) 
David Adams (appointed 1 March 2011) 
Claudia Arney (appointed 25 January 2011) 
Dennis Millard 
Bill Ronald 
Nigel Wilson (resigned 31 March 2011)
Details of non-executive Directors’ experience and their other roles are 
set out in the Directors’ biography section on page 72 to 73. The Board 
believes that these Directors have suitable experience to serve on the 
Remuneration Committee.
Meetings 
During the financial period to 1 April 2011 the Committee met on six 
occasions. The executive Directors are invited to attend the 
Committee’s meetings, when appropriate, but are not present when 
their own remuneration is discussed. The Company Secretary is the 
secretary to the Committee.
Role
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility 
for reviewing and recommending the pay and benefits and contractual 
arrangements of the Chairman, executive Directors and the Company 
Secretary and such other senior managers as the Board may designate 
and for overseeing the operation of the Group’s share schemes.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to principles of 
accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration 
arrangements demonstrate a clear link between reward and 
performance. In its work, the Committee considers fully the principles 
and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and its terms of 
reference are available on the Group’s website halfordscompany.com.
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee’s core responsibilities include:
■ ■ Reviewing and recommending the remuneration policy of executive 
Directors and senior managers;
■ ■ Within this policy agreeing individual remuneration packages for the 
Chairman, executive Directors and senior executive managers, 
including the Company Secretary;
■ ■ Monitoring the relationship between the remuneration of executive 
Directors and senior executive managers and the pay arrangements 
throughout the Group to ensure that it remains appropriate;
■ ■ Reviewing and recommending the terms and conditions to be 
included in service agreements for executive Directors and senior 
executive managers;
■ ■ Reviewing and recommending any employee share-based incentive 
schemes and any changes to the rules of such schemes; 
■ ■ Reviewing and recommending appropriate performance conditions 
and targets for the variable element of remuneration packages for 
the executive Directors and senior executive managers; and
■ ■ Reviewing annual and long-term performance against targets to 
determine the level of reward that should be delivered to executive 
Directors and senior executive managers.
During the year the Committee conducted an internal effectiveness 
review. Following this review the Secretary to the Committee was 
requested to ensure that the Company’s new Director of Human 
Resources and the Committee’s advisers be invited to attend 
Committee meetings on a more regular basis. The Committee will 
continue to review effectiveness on an annual basis and take steps to 
improve this where appropriate.
Advisers 
During the year the Hay Group have continued to provide advice to the 
Committee on matters relating to remuneration, including market 
comparison data and best practice. Hay Group does not provide any 
other services to the Group. The Committee also received advice from 
Deloitte LLP on the design of the share-based long-term incentive plans 
and other remuneration matters. Deloitte also provide unrelated 
advisory and tax services to the Group. The Committee is satisfied that 
the advice received by Hay and Deloitte is independent. 
During the year the Committee also consulted with the Chief Executive 
and was supported by the Company Secretary (who is secretary to the 
Committee). Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
Remuneration policy 
The remuneration policy of the Committee and of the Board is to 
provide remuneration packages for executive Directors and other senior 
managers in the Group which:
■ ■ Align management’s interests with those of shareholders by 
incentivising management to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy 
and enhance shareholder value.
■ ■ Provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive 
remuneration through variable based pay. 
■ ■ Provide upper quartile rewards compared to other general retail 
companies of a similar size, but only if above upper quartile 
performance is delivered.
■ ■ Enable the Group to attract and retain management of the calibre 
required to run the business and drive exceptional shareholder 
value creation.
The Board reviews this policy and whether remuneration arrangements 
appropriately reflect this policy annually. During the period the 
Committee worked with Deloitte LLP to review the remuneration 
arrangements to ensure that they reflected this policy and our long-term 
business strategy. The Committee concluded that, while a number of 
elements of the remuneration arrangements remained appropriate, the 
structures in place at the time were not aligned with the philosophy of 
delivering upper quartile remuneration to executives if they achieve 
above upper quartile performance for our shareholders. A review of 
market practice also indicated that the maximum total compensation 
opportunity was not fully competitive, particularly at maximum levels, 
when compared to our key retail comparators.  
In this context, and following discussions with major shareholders, an 
award “multiplier” was introduced to the Performance Share Plan 
(“PSP”) and the revised plan rules were adopted at the Company’s 
AGM in July 2010. The revised scheme allows executives to earn an 
incremental reward if performance is above upper quartile levels. The 
Company is at an important stage in its development and is committed 
to achieving growth and to generating shareholder value in the future. In 
this context, the Committee believes that the policy of upper quartile 
pay for upper quartile performance remains appropriate. This is 
explained in more detail in the section relating to the Performance Share 
Plan on page 88. The Committee continued to monitor remuneration 
arrangements during the year and concluded that they remain 
appropriate and no further changes were required. 
The Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy and 
remuneration arrangements to ensure that the structure and associated 
performance measures remain appropriately aligned with the 
Company’s strategic objectives. 
In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive Directors, 
the Committee considers the pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary 
increases.
Balance of fixed vs. variable remuneration
It is the Company’s policy that a substantial proportion of the executive 
Directors’ remuneration should be variable and performance related in 
order to encourage and reward superior business performance and 
shareholder returns and that remuneration should be linked to both 
individual and Company performance. The following illustrates the 
balance between fixed and variable remuneration based on the 
remuneration policy for 2011/12:

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
Base salaries
Basic salary for executive Directors takes into account the individual’s 
experience, roles, responsibilities and performance. This is normally 
reviewed annually unless responsibilities change. For an executive 
Director who is experienced and fully effective in his role, basic salary is 
targeted at the market median at other retail companies for comparable 
roles. 
During the year the Committee undertook a benchmarking exercise and 
decided to defer the annual salary review from the normal time in 
October 2010 to March 2011. No further benchmarking was 
undertaken. In March 2011 the following executives’ salaries were 
approved with effect from 1 April 2011.
Role Salary (with effect from 1 April 2011)
Chief Executive £507,500 (nil increase)
Finance Director £275,000 (new appointment)
Commercial Director £290,700 (2% increase)
The Committee recognises that in the current economic environment 
salary increases should be kept to a minimum and be in line with salary 
increases elsewhere in the Group. Average salary increases throughout 
the Group for 2011 were c.2%. The Committee considers that salaries 
remain approximately at the median when compared to other retailers 
of similar size and complexity. Following the six-month deferral in 2010, 
base salaries will next be reviewed in October 2011.
Annual bonus 
Executive Directors may earn up to an additional 100% of their basic 
salaries (150% of base salary for the CEO) as a performance bonus. 
80% of the entitlement is dependent upon Earnings Before Tax (“EBT”) 
targets and 20% is dependent upon Earnings per Share (“EPS”) 
targets. The Committee believes that these two measures strike a good 
balance between providing line of sight for executives and alignment 
with shareholder value creation. The target entry point for the annual 
bonus is 97% of target, which will elicit zero bonus payment, with a 
straight-line determination to full payment at 106%. The Committee 
calibrates targets to ensure that they are very stretching and 
demanding, with the maximum bonus only being achievable for 
exceptional performance. Bonuses are not pensionable. 
Bonuses for the Finance Director and the Commercial Director are 
payable in cash. The CEO’s bonus is payable two-thirds in cash 
following the year end with one-third of any bonus earned being 
delivered in Halfords shares. These shares are deferred for a period of 
three years from the date of the award subject to continued 
employment and other applicable terms. The Committee believes that 
this deferral is important to incentivise the CEO to deliver annual 
performance while managing risk and creating long-term alignment with 
shareholders. 
Remuneration for senior managers
As for executive Directors, it is the Company’s policy that a substantial 
proportion of remuneration should be performance related in order to 
encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder 
returns and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and 
Company performance. Basic salary is targeted at the retail market 
median for comparable roles and is benchmarked on a regular basis. 
Bonuses of up to 100% of salary can be earned on the same basis as 
the executive Directors. 
Senior executives immediately below the Board also benefit from 
participation in the PSP , with other key senior managers participating in 
the CSOS. 
Share plans
The Company has adopted three share plans. In May 2004 the 
Company adopted the Halfords Company Share Option Scheme 
(“CSOS”), a market value share option plan, and the Halfords 
Sharesave Scheme and in July 2005 the Company adopted the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). The PSP is intended to be the main 
incentive vehicle for executive Directors and senior executives 
immediately below the Board, with awards generally made on an annual 
basis. CSOS is used to reward employees below the Board and it is not 
the current intention to grant awards under the CSOS to executive 
Directors (other than in exceptional circumstances). The executive 
Directors are also eligible to participate in the Halfords Sharesave 
Scheme, an all-employee SAYE scheme.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related 
remuneration as a means of aligning Directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders’ concerns on 
dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. 
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. 
Halfords intends to comply with the ABI guidelines relating to the issue 
of new shares for equity incentive plans. The current ten year 
shareholder dilution is 4.31%.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme
Options are granted at an exercise price not less than market value at 
the date of grant and may normally only be exercised if performance 
conditions set at the time of grant have been achieved. These 
performance conditions require EPS for the financial year last preceding 
the third anniversary of the grant date to equal or exceed the 
percentage growth in Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus an additional 
percentage determined as appropriate at the time of the grant. For the 
last four annual awards the EPS target has been RPI + 3.5%. The 
Committee believes that EPS is an appropriate performance target as it 
incentivises senior executives to drive earnings performance.
As noted above, as the executive Directors primarily participate in the 
PSP , it is currently intended that no further awards are made to them 
under the Company Share Option Scheme. In the event that awards 
are made under the CSOS to executive Directors, the Committee would 
review the performance measures and would set targets which are 
suitably stretching.
Halfords Sharesave Scheme
During the year the Committee considered the principles behind the 
establishment of the SAYE scheme in 2010 and concluded that the   Governance
88
18559 17/06/2011 Proof 5
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
current scheme remains appropriate. Options are granted at an 
exercise price not less than 80% of market value at the date of grant. 
Options may not normally be exercised until the option holder has 
completed his or her savings contract (normally three or five years) from 
the date of commencement of the savings contract. Executive Directors 
may also join the Halfords Sharesave Scheme. During the year awards 
were granted under the SAYE to participating eligible employees in the 
United Kingdom, Ireland and Hong Kong.
Performance Share Plan
Under the PSP , conditional rights to receive shares or nil cost options 
over shares are awarded to participants. PSP Awards have been made 
in every year since 2005.
Awards under the PSP vest subject to the achievement of stretching 
earnings per share (“EPS”) and total shareholder return (“TSR”) targets. 
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Group’s 
relative TSR performance when measured against a general retailers 
comparator group chosen from the FTSE 350. The vesting of the other 
50% will be determined by the Group’s absolute EPS growth 
performance against RPI. The Committee believes that total 
shareholder return and earnings per share remain appropriate measures 
for the PSP as they are strongly aligned with shareholder interests.
Following the review of remuneration arrangements and having received 
shareholder approval at the AGM in July 2010, for awards granted in 
2010 onwards, the core award for all executive Directors will be 150% 
of base salary. In addition, there will be a vesting multiplier of up to 1.5 
× which will be applied to the TSR and EPS elements of awards. The 
maximum multiplier will only apply if performance is at upper decile 
levels. The maximum possible award that can be earned will therefore 
be 225% of base salary.
For the core award, 30% of the awards vests for achieving median TSR 
performance compared to the comparator group described below and 
EPS growth of RPI plus 4% per annum. The full core award vests for 
achieving upper quartile TSR and EPS growth of RPI plus 11% per 
annum. For the award multiplier, the TSR element will only vest if TSR 
performance is between upper quartile and upper decile. For the EPS 
element the multiplier will only apply if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 
11% per annum, with the maximum multiplier only being achieved if 
EPS growth equals RPI plus 16% per annum. For the core award and 
the multiplier straight-line vesting applies between each of these points. 
These targets are considered to be very challenging and the Committee 
believes that these targets represent an appropriate level of stretch. The 
targets are summarised in the table below:
TSR Performance 
Element 
(50% of award)
EPS Performance 
Element 
(50% of award)
Award “Multiplier” 
(up to 1.5 × initial award)
1.5 × initial award vesting Upper Decile performance 16% growth p.a. above RPI
Straight-line vesting Between Upper Quartile and  
Upper Decile
Between 11% growth p.a. and  
16% growth p.a. above RPI
Core Award 
(150% of salary)
100% vesting Upper Quartile performance 11% growth p.a. above RPI
Straight-line vesting Between Median and Upper Quartile Between 4% growth p.a. and  
11% growth p.a. above RPI
30% vesting Median 4% growth p.a. above RPI
0% vesting Below Median Below 4% growth p.a. above RPI
TSR and EPS performance will be assessed on an independent basis. 
However, to ensure that the PSP continues to support sustainable 
performance, the multiplier for one measure will only be applied if 
performance is at least at the threshold level for the other measure. For 
example, if TSR was above upper quartile the TSR multiplier would 
generally only apply if EPS growth exceeded RPI plus 4% per annum, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determined otherwise.
The companies included in the TSR comparator group for awards 
granted in 2010 are as follows:
■ ■ Brown Group ■ ■ Game Group ■ ■ Morrison
■ ■ Carpetright ■ ■ Greggs ■ ■ Mothercare
■ ■ Carphone 
Warehouse
■ ■ HMV Group ■ ■ Next
■ ■ Debenhams ■ ■ Home Retail Group ■ ■ Sainsbury’s
■ ■ Dignity ■ ■ Kesa Eletricals ■ ■ Sports Direct
■ ■ DSG International ■ ■ Kingfisher ■ ■ Tesco
■ ■ Dunelm Group ■ ■ Marks & Spencer ■ ■ WH Smith 
The comparator group for awards pre-2010 (which did not include the 
performance multiplier) was similar to the above group but did not 
include food retailers.
The Committee believes that the operation of the PSP is appropriate to 
continue to effectively incentivise and retain key executives in a way 
which is aligned with our long-term strategy and the creation of 
shareholder value. The Committee recognises that a plan that 
incentivises higher levels of performance involves a larger degree of 
inherent risk; however, the Committee believes that the Board’s 
decision-making process provides appropriate safeguards to ensure 
that this structure does not incentivise executives to take an 
inappropriate level of risk.
Details of awards granted to executive Directors are set out on  
page 93.
In 2008 and 2009 (the first two years of his tenure) the Chief Executive 
Officer received awards under the PSP of 200% of base salary (these 
awards are not subject to the performance multiplier).  
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee also recommended the 
reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares. This is in line with 
best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Shareholding
The shareholding guidelines require executive Directors to acquire and 
retain shares to a value equal to 100% of their basic annual salary. 
Newly appointed executive Directors will be required to retain shares to 
a value equal to 100% of their basic salary over a five-year period 
following their appointment to the Board. The executive Directors’ 
shareholding at 1 April 2011 is shown below. 
Remuneration delivered in respect of performance in 2010/11 
Halfords has had a challenging year and the Remuneration Committee 
has recommended that no annual performance bonuses are paid out in 
respect of FY11 as the targets of EBT and EPS had not been achieved. 
Other Bonus payments made in respect of 2010/11 are set out on 
page 91. 
Performance for PSP awards granted in 2008 were tested in respect of 
the financial years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Halfords were ranked 5th 
when compared to the comparator group of selected other retail 
companies and EPS growth over the three-year performance period of 
38.8% exceeded RPI plus 11% per annum. Consequently 99.01% of 
the awards granted in 2008 will vest in August 2011.
Performance for CSOS awards granted in 2008 to below Board 
employees was also tested in respect of the financial years 2009, 2010 
and 2011. The EPS growth target attached to this award was met and 
the options vested in full. Participants will have a further seven years in 
which to exercise these options.
Performance graph 
The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company since 
April 2006, against the FTSE 350 General Retailers (which was chosen 
because it represents a broad equity market index of which the 
Company is a constituent). 
TSR was calculated by reference to the growth in share price, as 
adjusted for reinvested dividends.
Directors’ interests in ordinary shares 
The beneficial interests of Directors, serving at the end of the financial 
period, in shares in Halfords Group plc were:

Bill Ronald 11,538 11,538
Directors’ share interests include the interests of their spouses, civil 
partners and infant children, or stepchildren as required by Section 822 
of the Companies Act 2006. There were no changes in the beneficial 
interests of the Directors in the Company’s shares between 1 April 2011 
and 8 June 2011.
Pensions 
During 2008/9 the Company changed its pension arrangements to 
prepare for the Government’s introduction of Personal Accounts. The 
Halfords Pension Plan moved from a defined contribution scheme to a 
contract-based plan, where each member has their own individual 
pension policy which they monitor independently, each member could 
also benefit from salary sacrifice arrangements. Both schemes were 
open to the executive Directors, who each receive a pension 
contribution of 15% of base salary per annum. Nick Wharton, the 
previous Finance Director, received a pension contribution of 26.25% of 
base salary per annum reflecting his legacy contractual entitlements. 
The Group’s contributions during the year are shown in the table on 
page 91.
Other benefits 
Executive Directors are entitled to be provided with a company car or 
an equivalent allowance, contribution to a personal pension scheme, 
permanent health insurance, life assurance cover, membership of a 
private medical insurance scheme and travelling and other expenses. 
Other Directorships 
The Group is supportive of executive Directors who wish to take on a 
non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order to 
broaden their experience and they are entitled to retain any fees they 
may receive. David Wild was appointed as a non-executive director of 
Premier Foods on 7 March 2011 for which he received a fee of £4,750. 
During the year, up until his resignation, Nick Wharton served as a non-
executive director of Dunelm Group plc, where he was also Chairman 
of the Audit Committee for which he received a fee of £27,500.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Service agreements
The Company’s policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, 
and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, 
the Company and shareholders. Failure should not be rewarded and 
the departing executive’s duty to mitigate loss should be fully 
recognised. The Committee periodically reviews the Group’s policy on 
the duration of Directors’ service agreements, and the notice periods 
and termination provisions contained in those agreements. Whilst the 
Company is aware that companies are encouraged to consider notice 
periods of less than 12 months, the Committee believes that the current 
policy, whereby notice periods contained in executive Directors’ service 
contracts should be limited to 12 months (other than in exceptional 
circumstances, such as for the purposes of recruitment) is more in line 
with the Company’s overall remuneration policy that is designed to 
attract and retain high calibre executives.

Andrew Findlay was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2011 and 
his Service Agreement was effective from that date.
The Company may terminate any of the above service agreements by 
giving not less than 12 months’ notice. In the event of early termination 
(other than for a reason justifying summary termination in accordance 
with the terms of the service agreement) the Company may (but is not 
obliged to) pay to the executive Director, in lieu of notice, a sum equal 
to the annual value of the executive Director’s then salary, benefits, 
pension contributions and on-target bonus (calculated on a pro rata 
daily basis) which he would have received during the contractual notice 
period, the sum of which shall be payable in 12 monthly instalments. In 
such instances the executive Director shall use their best endeavours to 
secure an alternative source of remuneration, thus mitigating any loss to 
the Company, via the provision of his services as expediently as 
possible in the prevailing circumstances and shall provide the Board 
with evidence of such endeavours upon their reasonable request. If the 
Director fails to provide such evidence the Board may cease all further 
payments of compensation. To the extent that the executive Director 
receives any sums as a result of alternative employment or provision of 
services while he is receiving such payments from the Company, the 
payments shall be reduced by the amount of such sums. 
No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to be 
terminated by notice from an executive Director or for lawful early 
termination by the Company.
The service contracts of executive Directors do not provide for any 
enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the 
Company. 
Details of individual Directors’ remuneration and share incentives are set 
out on pages 91 and 93.
Nick Wharton resigned from the role of Finance Director on  
30 November 2010. He received no payment upon his resignation in 
accordance with the terms of his contract. He did not receive an award 
under the LTIP in 2010 and outstanding awards granted to him under 
the share incentive plans lapsed upon his cessation of employment.
Non-executive Directors
The Board as a whole, following a recommendation by the Chief 
Executive Officer, determines the fees of the non-executive Directors. 
None of the non-executive Directors has an employment contract with 
the Company. However, each has entered into a letter of appointment 
with the Company confirming their appointment for a period of three 
years, unless terminated by either party giving the other not less than 
three months’ notice or by the Company on payment of fees in lieu of 
notice. The appointments are subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act 1985 and 2006 and the Company’s Articles of 
Association and in particular the need for periodic re-election. 
Continuation of an individual non-executive Director’s appointment is 
also contingent on that non-executive Director’s satisfactory 
performance, which will be evaluated annually. No compensation would 
be payable to a non-executive Director if his engagement were 
terminated as a result of him retiring by rotation at an Annual General 
Meeting, not being elected or re-elected at an Annual General Meeting 
or otherwise ceasing to hold office under the provisions of the Articles 
of Association of the Company. 
In May 2010 fees for the Chairman and non-executive Directors were 
reviewed and it was agreed that there would be no increases. Halfords’ 
policy in relation to non-executive Director fees is as follows:
Role Fees
Chairman £165,000
Senior Independent Director £60,000
Basic Fee £45,000
Additional fee for Chairmanship of the 
Audit and Remuneration Committee £5,000
There are no provisions for compensation being payable upon early 
termination of an appointment of a non-executive Director. 
The Chairman and the other non-executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in the Company’s bonus arrangements, share incentive 
plans or pension arrangements. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
group and parent company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they 
are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or 
loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
■ ■ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
■ ■ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
■ ■ for the group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
■ ■ ■ for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
■ ■ ■ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those 
regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials
We have audited the financial statements of Halfords Group plc 
for the period ended 1 April 2011 set out on pages 98 to 144. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the group financial statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and UK 
Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members, as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on page 96, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for 
Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided 
on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/private.cfm.

Accounting Policies
General information
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the period 
ended 1 April 2011 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
Statement of compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(“adopted IFRSs”).
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going concern 
basis for the reasons set out in the Directors Report on page 76, and under the historical cost convention, except where International Financial 
Reporting Standards require an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition 
and measurement’) and share-based payments (IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’). 
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements for the 
current period cover the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 2 April 2010. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the use of accounting 
estimates and management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. These judgements and estimates 
are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions under review and the actual results may 
ultimately differ from these estimates. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the consolidated financial statements, are, where necessary, disclosed separately.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings 
Subsidiary undertakings are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They cease to be consolidated from the 
date that the Group no longer has control. All subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. 
The principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 1 April 2011 are as follows:

Revenue recognition
Retail 
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions and 
returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and 
the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery and on services 
when those services have been rendered.
Car Servicing
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered. 
Promotions and Returns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail price. 
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold during 
the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced by the value of sales 
returns provided for during the year.
Non-recurring items
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management considers that these items 
should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for 
own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options 
granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation of this 
alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency and are rounded to the nearest 
hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial statements of 
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation 
differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash 
flow hedges.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate at the date 
that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising 
on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income 
and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss.
Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. The amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are 
expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and 
non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision of 
original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income, over the remaining 
vesting period.  Financials

Accounting Policies continued
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim equity 
dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful economic 
lives as follows:
■ ■ Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
■ ■ Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
■ ■ Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
■ ■ Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
■ ■ Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
■ ■ Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the net fair value of the identifiable net assets of a 
subsidiary undertaking acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair value is attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of 
acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is included in intangible assets. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not 
amortised but is tested annually for impairment. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds 
its recoverable amount.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when calculating 
goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each reporting date until the 
consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of ‘Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)’. For these acquisitions transaction costs, 
other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration payable will be 
recognised in profit or loss.
The Group has significant carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets, such as brands, customer relationships and favourable leases 
following the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres. Amortised intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment where events show an 
indication of impairment. The impairment test involves estimation of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate. This requires an 
estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible assets are allocated.
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits 
beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. 
Amortisation is calculated based on the cost of the asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value and is expensed to the income 
statement within operating expenses.
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the 
date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
■ ■ Brand names and trademarks 2 years;
■ ■ Customer relationships 5 to 15 years; 
■ ■ Favourable leases over the term of the lease; and
■ ■ Software 3 to 5 years.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets. Such 
assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase of  Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

overseas sourced products. The Group uses the derivatives to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are 
designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception stage, as well as its risk management 
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an 
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are expected to be “highly effective” in offsetting changes in fair value 
or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated and whether the actual results of each hedge are 
within a range of 80%–125%. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit 
or loss (for instance when the forecast purchase that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the 
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from other comprehensive income and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets 
the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive 
income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve 
months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months. 
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The amortised cost less 
any impairment losses of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses. 
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location. 
Impairment of assets
Intangible assets that are attributed an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Other tangible and 
intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original  
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are  
as defined above.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Finance income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest rate 
method. Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. 
In respect of borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets, the Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest 
method.  Financials

Basis of charge for taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, at 
the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an entity when 
it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. In 
the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the revenue that will 
not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not 
accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is realised or the deferred 
taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of 
the discount is recognised as finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 18.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain.
Provision is also made for loss-making stores and autocentres which management do not expect to become profitable.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance 
outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other payables. The interest element of the rental is charged 
to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each 
period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term. 
In determining whether a lease is a finance lease, the building and land elements of the lease are reviewed separately.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit of incentives from 
lessors are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Landlord surrender payments
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group, that do not represent an 
incentive for future rental commitments are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further substantial 
acts to complete.
Sublease income
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised by 
offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement. 
Pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor independently. 
The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of contributions to the scheme are 
charged to the income statement in the period that they arise. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
the estimates.
The judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are 
detailed below:
Impairment of assets
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which includes 
management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill and other 
assets are explained in note 11.
Allowances against the carrying value of inventories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future demand 
requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to the timing and success 
of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall allowances.
Provisions
Provisions include residual amounts for the Central Europe exit, property related liabilities and other trading liabilities. These provisions are estimates 
of the actual costs of future cash flows and are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be 
accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Assumptions made are detailed in note 18. 
Intangible asset valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set out in IAS 38, 
the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual intangible assets. The 
useful lives of intangibles assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates applicable. 
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 111 to 137.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in 2011 as they are mandatory for the year ended  
1 April 2011.
■ ■ Revised IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations (2009)’ — incorporates the following changes that are likely to be relevant to the Group’s operations:
 ■ The definition of a business has been broadened, which is likely to result in more acquisitions being treated as a business combination.
 ■■■ Contingent consideration will be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes therein recognised in profit or loss.
■ ■■■ Transaction costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred.
 ■■■ Any pre-existing interest in the acquiree will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
 ■■■■ Any non-controlling (minority) interest will be measured at either fair value, or at its proportionate interest in the identifiable assets and liabilities 
of the acquiree, on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
 ■■■■ Since there have been no acquisitions in the year, there has been no impact on profit or loss or net assets.
■ ■ IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (2009)’ — requires accounting for changes in ownership interests by the Group in 
a subsidiary, while maintaining control, to be recognised as an equity transaction. When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest 
retained in the former subsidiary will be measured at fair value with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. This amendment has not had a 
material impact on the Group’s 2011 consolidated financial statements.
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement: Eligible Hedged Items’ — clarifies how to apply existing principles 
in determining eligible hedged risks and portions. This amendment has not had a material impact on the Group’s 2011 consolidated financial 
statements.
■ ■ Amendments to IFRIC 9 and IAS 39 ‘Embedded Derivatives’ — requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative is required to be 
separated from a host contract when the entity reclassifies a hybrid financial asset out of the fair value through the profit and loss category. This 
amendment has not had a material impact on the Group’s 2011 consolidated financial statements.
■ ■ Amendments to IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ — removes the requirement to present segment information for total assets unless regularly   Financials
110
18559 20/06/2011 Proof 6
Accounting Policies continued
reported to the chief operating decision-maker. Since the changes are presentational only there has been no impact on profit or net assets. 
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 17 ‘Leases’ — allows a lease of land with an indefinite economic life to be classified as a finance lease when relevant criteria 
are met. This amendment has not had any impact on the Group’s 2011 consolidated financial statements.
■ ■ Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Classification of Rights Issues’ — requires that rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own 
equity instruments for a fixed amount of any currency are equity instruments if the entity offers the rights options or warrants pro rata to all of its 
existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. This amendment has not had any impact on the Group’s 2011 
consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are mandatory for the year 
ended 1 April 2011, have been adopted in the year. None of these amendments have had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements.
■ ■ IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ — deals with how entities should measure equity instruments issued in a debt 
for equity swap. Application of this standard is required for periods starting on or after 1 July 2010. The amendments are not expected to have a 
material impact and will become mandatory for the Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements.
■ ■ IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures (revised 2009)’ — makes changes to the definition of a related party. Application of this standard is required 
for periods starting on or after 1 January 2011. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact and will become mandatory for the 
Group’s 2012 consolidated financial statements. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

1. Operating segments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units offer 
different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies. 
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believes 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions. 
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements. 
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

  A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in the year. This expense relates to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities 
arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989. An estimate of the potential liability relating to these guarantees was 
previously disclosed as a contingent liability in the Interim financial statements. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased 
by Payless DIY (now part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under the ownership of the Ward White Group. Focus DIY 
entered into administration in May 2011.

  Exit costs associated with the closure of all seven stores in Central Europe. Results for Central Europe for the period was £1.9m (2010:

(3)
  This represents the tax credit at 28% on these non-recurring costs; in 2010 this credit was lower than the UK corporation tax standard rate of 
28% due to the non-deductibility of certain legal expenses and depreciation associated with store infrastructure.

On 22 June 2010 the Chancellor announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011. 
This tax change became substantively enacted in July 2010 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction on the deferred tax balances as at 
1 April 2011 has been included in the figures above. On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced a further reduction in the main rate of UK 
corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011. This change became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of 
the rate reduction has been reflected in the figures above as it was substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date. 
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but 
these changes have not yet been substantively enacted. It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of this further 3% 
rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Group’s future current tax charge and reduce the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
accordingly.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 28% (2010: 28%). 
The effective tax rate of 27.6% (2010: 29.8%) differs from the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure, the reassessment of anticipated future tax deductions from employee share schemes and the reassessment of 
historic tax provisions required against tax uncertainties.
The tax charge of £32.6m (2010: £32.7m) includes a credit of £2.1m (2010: £1.4m) in respect of the tax on non-recurring costs, as detailed 
in note 5. 
An income tax credit of £1.1m (2010: £0.6m charge) on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts 
outstanding at the year end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact. Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 1 April 2011 of 14.00p per share (2010: 14.00p 
per share), which will absorb an estimated £29.5m (2010: £29.3m) of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 6 August 2011 to shareholders who 
are on the register of members on 1 July 2011.
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 21) and 
has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011.

10.  Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking in prior year
On 17 February 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Nationwide Autocentres Holdings Limited and subsidiary 
undertakings (“Nationwide Autocentres”) for cash consideration of £74.9m (including transaction costs of £2.6m). Nationwide Autocentres, now 
Halfords Autocentres, is a group of companies involved in car servicing and repair. This transaction was accounted for by the purchase method 
of accounting.

 Contingent consideration
The cash consideration payable for the acquisition was reduced by £1.7m to reflect additional cash consideration payable to certain 
shareholders remaining as Directors, contingent on their remaining as employees of the Group as of the first and second anniversary of the 
acquisition or, in the event of any of them having terminated their employment, said employment having been terminated in circumstances of 
being a “good leaver”. 
£1.0m of the additional cash consideration was payable on 17 February 2011 and was settled on that date. The remaining £0.7m is payable on  
17 February 2012.
The deferred consideration of £0.9m has been settled in the year.  Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

Included in computer software are internally generated assets of £0.3m (2010: £0.4m). Product rights of £0.2m, which are fully amortised, have 
been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of £253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the 
Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-
generating units. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the car 
servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of 
cash-generating units being Car Servicing. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships, b) the Nationwide workforce, c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets and d) operating 
synergies. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, 
being Retail and Car Servicing. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all 
available information and expectations for future market developments. 
The key assumptions, to which the Group of cash-generating units recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use of 
goodwill held at 1 April 2011 and 2 April 2010 are as follows:
       Retail              Car Servicing
Notes 2011 2010 2011 2010
Discount rate 1 14.2% 12.2% 14.9% 13.9%

Notes: 
1. Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections. 
2. Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the 
recoverable amounts.   Financials

The above borrowings are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £3.2m (2010: £nil).
The Group has renegotiated its debt facility with effect from 5 November 2010 and secured a four-year £300m revolving credit facility from that 
date (with an option to extend by a further year). While variable in line with the level of Group debt, at the Group’s optimal gearing level of 1.5× 
EBITDA, the facility carries an interest margin of approximately 200bps.
With revised facilities in place the Board has determined that it has sufficient working capital and undrawn financing facilities to service its 
operating activities and ongoing capital investments following the signing. The Board retains its preference for financial flexibility and lower 
gearing whilst pursuing high return investments. Accordingly the Group’s pro forma gearing at the end of the period was 0.7× EBITDA.

The Central Europe exit provision represents the costs associated with the closure of all seven stores trading in the Czech Republic and Poland. 
The distribution reorganisation provision represents the costs associated with the re-configuration and consolidation of the Group’s distribution 
and warehousing infrastructure.
Property related provisions consist of costs associated with vacant property, rent reviews and dilapidations. Also included in the current period 
are £7.5m of non-recurring costs (note 5) relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into 
administration subsequent to the period end.
Other trading provisions comprises a sales returns provision and a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone cycle 
concept, including closure of stores where necessary.
 Restructuring provisions
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.
Key assumptions within the Central Europe exit and Distribution reorganisation provisions were the timing of the exit from leases that were 
contracted into, the timing of redundancies and the extent of dilapidation costs. The sensitivities to these assumptions were not considered 
material due to the time value of money being minimal over the period over which the costs would be incurred.
 Property related provisions
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost 
of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises 
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and the time value 
of money has been incorporated into the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
A rent review provision is recognised when there is expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the 
Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the rent 
payable after the review. 
Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material 
to the provision in total.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties 
arising from events such as lease renewals or terminations.
Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due. Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material to the provision in total.   Financials

 Treasury policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
■ ■ Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
■ ■ Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
■ ■ Invest surplus cash; 
■ ■ Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
■ ■ Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows. 
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director (“FD”). The FD controls policy and performance through the line 
management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor 
the performance of the Treasury function. Monthly Treasury Reports provide management information relating to treasury activity. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a 
competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. The Group has a syndicated four-year revolving credit facility 
totalling £300m that provides the Group with committed bank facilities until November 2014, which are extendable by a further year. See note 
16.
The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is 
dependent upon the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the strength of the balance sheet.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
 Market risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials whose prices fluctuate. The Group 
mitigates this risk through, for example, transferring the risk to suppliers by negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the 
specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
 Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market. 
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

2010
Carrying

Finance leases 11.8 12.0
Variable rate instruments 90.0 180.0
101.8 192.0
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; therefore, a change in interest 
rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity.
The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to interest rates changes:

A 1% decrease in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movement in the income statement reflects the effect on finance costs on the unhedged borrowings of the Group as shown in the table. 
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not 
present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.   Financials

 Foreign currency risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between

A strengthening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 1 April 2011 would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by the 
amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible 
at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement. The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Group’s forward 
contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.  Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

 Credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting  
date was:

Total financial assets 15.5 55.0
The £12.5m (2010: £15.5m) maximum exposure to credit risk, at the reporting date for loans and receivables related to the UK.
The Group does not have any individually significant customers.
The following table shows the age of such financial assets that are past due and for which no provision for bad or doubtful debts has been 
raised:
2011

2010

Not past due 10.0 12.7
Past due by 1–30 days 0.9 1.4
Past due by 31–90 days 1.3 0.6
Past due by 91–180 days 0.3 0.8
12.5 15.5
The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectable, based on historic payment 
behaviour and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings. Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that, apart from 
the above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
 Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30.0m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be £270m of the £300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, 
the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A’ credit rating at the time of refinancing (November 
2010). Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group. At the time of the drawdown of the bank facility 
in November 2010 all banks within the club were ‘A’ grade. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to 
the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to 
meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead 
to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Club bank agent. Reporting on covenant compliance forms part of the 
Treasury Report. There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.  Financials

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts. 
Liquidity risk is managed through regular review of the forthcoming cash requirements, and use of the available borrowing facilities when needed.
 Fair value disclosures
The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and finance 
lease obligations, short-term deposits and 
borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity 
of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease 
obligations. 
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value 
reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments 
are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year. 
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the closing spot rate at the balance sheet date 
and the outright contract rate.

  Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
■ ■ Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
■ ■  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
■ ■ Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
 Cash flow hedges
 Forward currency contracts
Forward dated foreign exchange contracts are undertaken to hedge known exposure to foreign purchases in US dollars. The fair value of such 
derivatives is shown in the table on page 128.
 Borrowing facilities
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available during the period in respect of which all conditions precedent had 
been met at that date:

Expiring between 1 and 2 years — 120.0
Expiring between 2 and 5 years 210.0 —
211.0 121.0
The facilities expiring within one year were annual facilities subject to review at various dates during the period. The facility of £210.0m relates to 
the Group’s revolving credit facility. All these facilities incurred commitment fees at market rates.
 Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns  
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Between June 2006 and September 2009, the Group managed its capital 
structure partly through a share buy-back scheme and a new share buy-back scheme was initiated on 7 April 2011.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and fixed charge cover. Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases  
capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges. Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus 
operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges. As a result of the current economic conditions and the attitude 
towards debt the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and operates favourably to these target metrics.

22.  Share-based payments
The Group has three share award plans:
1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme (“CSOS”) 
2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme (“SAYE”) 
3. Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
 1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal 
to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three-year performance 
condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share (“EPS”) over the period 
is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted subsequently. 
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per 
year. Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment. 
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the average 
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations. The 
fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations were as follows:

 2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes  
his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early exercise in the case 
of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the 
Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.

 3. Performance Share Plan
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 
general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted. 
The TSR element of the options granted under the 2007 scheme has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model  
uses the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche 
rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a  
Monte Carlo model. For the 2006 scheme the TSR element of the options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.  
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows:

As the PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and therefore is 
excluded from the above table.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest 
in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2009 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends of 14p  
per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.81 per share. Shares awarded in both 2009 and 2010 under the PSP earned interim 
dividends of 8p per share and were reinvested in shares at cost of £4.10 per share Introduction Business Review Resources Governance Financials

 Share buyback programme
Following a review by the Board of the Group’s capital structure and cash generation capabilities, with effect from 7 April 2011, the Group 
commenced a share buyback programme, returning up to £75m of cash to Shareholders over the following twelve months. As at 3 June 2011 
approximately £20.7m of buyback has taken place via the purchase of 5.3 million shares.
 Lease guarantee provision
A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in the year. This expense relates to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising 
from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989. An estimate of the potential liability relating to these guarantees was previously 
disclosed as a contingent liability in the Interim financial statements. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless 
DIY (now part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under the ownership of the Ward White Group. Focus DIY entered into 
administration in May 2011.  Financials

Basis of preparation
The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements 
for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 2 April 2010. The accounts are 
prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards requires an alternative treatment in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. The principal variation to the historical 
cost convention relates to share-based payments.
A consolidated cash flow statement has been included in the Halfords Group plc consolidated accounts. The Company has therefore taken 
advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash flow statements’ not to produce a cash flow statement. 
The Company has taken the available exemption not to provide disclosures required by FRS 29 ‘Financial instruments: disclosures’.
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s subsidiary 
undertakings.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 44 ‘FRS 20 (IFRS 2) — Group and treasury share transactions’ the fair value of the employee services received 
under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertaking’s financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. The 
Company has recognised the fair value of the share-based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for 
which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is 
based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the remaining vesting 
period. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion of the 
directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.

Chairman’s statement
Christopher Knight Chairman
This has been a year of 
significant progress in which 
we have continued to invest in 
the Group’s future, increased 
our profits and grown our 
funds under management.
Underlying pre-tax profits for the year were 
£15 . 1m (2014: £13 . 3m), a rise of 13 . 5%, 
and underlying earnings per share have 
risen to 91 . 33p (2014: 86 . 24p) .
The board is recommending a final dividend 
of 20 . 5p per share which, if approved by 
shareholders, will result in total dividends 
for the year of 30 . 5p . This represents an 
increase of 17% over the total dividends 
paid the previous year of 26 . 0p per share . 
The final dividend will be paid on 28 October 
2015 to shareholders who are on the register 
at the close of business on 25 September 
2015 . We remain cash generative as a 
business and your board will continue  
its progressive dividend policy .
Our discretionary funds under management 
grew strongly over the year and as at 30 June 
2015 totalled £7 . 41bn (2014: £6 . 55bn), a 
rise of 13 . 13% . This compares favourably  
to the growth of the WMA index of 3 . 75% . 
In August we were pleased to announce 
the appointment of Andrew Shepherd  
as the Group’s Deputy Chief Executive . 
Andrew joined Brooks Macdonald in 2002 
and for the last seven years has been joint 
managing director of Brooks Macdonald 
Asset Management (‘BMAM’) . At the  
same time Nick Holmes was appointed  
the sole Managing Director of BMAM . 
These appointments broaden the senior 
management team and will provide Chris 
Macdonald with more time to focus on 
delivering the Group’s growth ambitions .
The Group has continued to change  
and develop over the last year . We are 
undertaking a complete IT upgrade for  
all our investment businesses, we continue 
to invest in regulatory oversight, our 
investment performance remains strong 
and we remain focused on delivering high 
performance and service standards for  
our clients . We have grown the business 
organically over the last year and with  
the continued changes to the regulatory 
landscape we are pleased with the progress 
we have made .

Chief Executive’s review
Chris Macdonald Chief Executive
Introduction
I would like to start by thanking all our 
staff for their hard work for the Group 
over the last 12 months . In an industry  
that is highly dynamic, from a regulatory, 
distribution and market perspective, the 
Group has made significant progress and 
this is only possible with their commitment .
Over the year we achieved double digit 
growth in underlying pre-tax profits, 
continued to increase our discretionary 
funds under management, improved our 
distribution both on and offshore and 
continued to invest in infrastructure, 
governance and IT, as well as remaining 
one of the Sunday Times Best 100 
companies to work for . 
We also successfully moved our London 
head office in May to new West End 
premises; this will facilitate further 
expansion and underlines our growth 
ambitions for the future . We have also 
broadened the senior management  
team and, coupled with our continued 
investment programme, these developments 
have the objective of ensuring we continue 
to grow in a highly disciplined manner .
Funds under management
Our discretionary funds under management 
rose to over £7 . 4bn, an increase of over 
£860m over the year . This represents an 
increase of 13 . 1% supported by investment 
markets; investment performance across 
the Group accounted for £218m and net 
new business for £645m . Across the 
business we have three avenues for growth 
in our discretionary funds; our Bespoke 
Portfolio Service (‘BPS’), Managed Portfolio 
Services (‘MPS’) and Funds . In all cases  
we work closely with institutions and 
professional intermediaries to introduce 
business and I am delighted that we now 
work with over 770 firms both in the  
UK and offshore . We remain firmly 
committed to working closely with  
these firms and are grateful for their 
ongoing and growing support .
Our core offering, BPS, which targets 
individuals with £200,000 or more to 
invest, continues to attract funds and our 
service is split between the management  
of pension funds (largely Self Invested 
Personal Pensions –‘SIPPs’) private  
portfolios and charities and trusts . The 
dynamics behind all three areas constantly 
evolve . Pension legislation changes continue 
to make SIPPs more attractive but at the 
same time ‘lifetime caps’ now restrict the 
size of individual pension funds . Private 
portfolios remain a significant area of 
growth, which is supported by the backdrop 
of a low interest rate environment, and we 
are also seeing growth in our trust remits, 
most notably offshore .
MPS, which is a discretionary service 
targeted at those with £20,000 or more  
to invest, has three areas of growth .  
The first two relate to smaller investment 
clients, firstly those portfolios that we 
administer and secondly, portfolios  
that are held on external administrative 
platforms . In both cases there have been 
pricing pressures over the last few years 
that have now plateaued .
This has been a year of substantive progress for the group. 
We have continued to grow funds under management and 
increase profits whilst making considerable progress on our 
IT development, our distribution, improving our governance, 
completing two strategic alliances, broadening the senior 
management team and moving our head office. 04  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Chief Executive’s review 
continued
Funds under management 
continued
The third area of growth for MPS is the 
multi-asset funds which sit within our 
Funds business . The growth of our Funds 
business, which now has £663m under 
management (2014: £518m), stems  
from our specialist funds as well as  
the multi-asset funds within MPS . 
In our Channel Islands business there  
have been some management changes  
as well as increased collaboration with 
professional intermediaries overseas . The 
business is now more integrated into the 
Group . Funds under management have 
now grown to £1 . 16bn .
In all cases we manage money on a team 
and risk based approach, working off  
a centralised investment process . This 
continues to deliver strong risk adjusted 
returns for our clients and allows the 
business to publish its performance data, 
ensuring a robust and scalable investment 
management proposition .
Braemar Estates, our specialist property 
manager, had a tough year . Whilst  
assets under administration are broadly 
unchanged, new business in the first half 
was slower than we had hoped for . This 
has been addressed in the second half 
with mandate wins that will benefit the 
second half of the new financial year .
Financial planning has had a mixed year; 
our consulting business was ahead of 
expectations but employee benefits proved 
more challenging than we had hoped,  
not assisted by the substantive changes 
required to deliver an auto enrol solution 
to businesses in a profitable manner . This 
is an area where we are looking to dovetail 
more work with our Asset Management 
business and I expect progress here over 
the next six months and beyond .
Industry background
The amount of change in the sector and 
industry does not slow down . In the sector 
we continue to see consolidation and  
I believe this trend will continue largely  
due to the growth of wealth management 
as an industry and the high cost base 
required to be able to manage and 
administer client assets .
Regulatory costs have been high over  
the past two years with the required 
repapering of all clients, the Retail 
Distribution Review (‘RDR’), FATCA and 
the like, but we believe these have now 
stabilised . However, MiFID II, which will 
impact in January 2017 will bring further 
business requirements and additional 
costs . We are sheltered to some degree  
as we are undertaking a full IT system 
upgrade, which is due to be completed  
in the final calendar quarter of 2016 .  
We have built in as many of the known 
requirements of MiFID II as possible into 
the system specifications to enable us to 
comply with this new European legislation .
Strategies for growth
We continue to focus on our core 
strategies for growth: organic, service  
and performance development and 
on-going investment in the business .
Our main strategic focus remains working 
with quality professional advisers . We have 
seen this sector grow in the UK over the 
last 12 months and the opportunities to 
work with more firms across all of our 
regional offices is greater today than 
before the implementation of RDR in  
2012 . Offshore, we are focussing on  
three principal areas: South Africa, where 
we have recently obtained regulatory 
permissions to market our services to 
intermediaries and clients alike; the Far 
East (mainly MPS funds); and the Middle 
East working with intermediaries .
We continue to grow the number of firms 
where we have strategic relationships  
and I am pleased that this has grown  
to 17 during the past financial year .
In addition to organic opportunities we 
always look to recruit quality experienced 
staff across the Group and we will continue 
with our successful trainee programme .
Summary and outlook
This has been a year of substantive progress 
for the business . We have continued to 
grow funds under management and 
increase profits whilst making considerable 
progress on our IT development, our 
distribution, improving our governance, 
completing two strategic alliances, 
broadening the senior management  
team and moving our head office . 
Over the coming year we will look to 
continue with the progress made and  
look to drive performance, service and  
new business . Investment markets remain 
volatile and this is clearly a headwind for 
the industry as a whole, but encouragingly 
our new business has been strong for the 
first quarter of the new financial year .

revenue by 12% to £77 . 69m (2014: £69 . 13m) . Underlying profits before tax have increased by 13% to £15 . 08m (2014: £13 . 31m) and profit

Underlying operating expenses
The major part of the underlying operating expenses of the Group are staff costs comprising 66% (2014: 65%) and of the total staff costs, 
37% (2014: 38%) were variable costs . During the year the Group continued to invest into enhanced IT systems in order to improve the 
services we offer clients and to realise operational efficiencies across the business as a whole .
In May 2015, on the expiry of the leases on our offices, we moved into new head office premises in the West End giving the Group further 
room for expansion and the benefits of locating all staff on one floor . The additional costs of this new property are estimated at £0 . 7m in a 
full year .
In line with the increasing regulatory requirements of the financial services industry generally we are also investing further in our corporate 
governance, risk and compliance departments and we have incurred an increase in the levies from the FSCS to £0 . 5m (2014: £0 . 3m) .
Underlying profit before tax 
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share are non GAAP alternative performance measures, considered by the board to 
be a better reflection of true business performance than looking at the Group’s results on a statutory basis only . These measures are widely 
used by research analysts covering the company . Underlying results exclude expenditure falling into the categories explained below and a 
full reconciliation between underlying profit and the profit attributable to shareholders is provided in the following table .  Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  07

Amortisation of client relationships and software (note 14)
As explained in notes 2(d) and 2(m), client relationship intangible assets are created in the course of acquiring funds under management . 
The amortisation charge associated with these assets and software represents a significant non-cash item and it has therefore been 
excluded from underlying profit, which represents largely cash-based earnings .
Finance costs and changes in fair value of deferred consideration
When the Group makes acquisitions of both corporate entities and teams of fund managers in the course of acquiring funds under management 
the typical structure of the acquisition, in order to continue to incentivise and motivate the vendors, is to make deferred payments over a period  
of time based on the retention and growth in funds under management . The initial estimated fair value of the deferred payments will be based on 
future projections of funds under management and where the actual payment is different from the original estimates then charges or credits will 
be made in arriving at the profit before tax . The directors consider that the effect of these changes to the original projected payments can distort 
the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded them from underlying profit . 
Initial estimates of the deferred cash payments are recognised in the financial statements at their present value based on an inherent rate of 
implied interest . The difference between the discounted present value of deferred consideration and the estimated future cash payment is 
recognised as a charge over the duration of the deferral period in arriving at profit before tax . The directors consider that this charge, which  
is a non-cash item can distort the results of a particular period and have therefore excluded the charge from underlying profit .
Acquisition costs
The acquisition cost in the year were incurred in relation to the purchase of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited .
Cash resources and regulatory capital
The Group is cash generative and cash flow from operating activities as detailed in note 26 increased to £20 . 1m (2014: £13 . 7m) . During the year, 
as detailed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 27, deferred consideration payments in respect of acquisitions increased by 
£6 . 6m over the previous year which, together with increased payments for intangible assets and dividends paid to shareholders, resulted in an 
increase in cash resources at the year end of £1 . 2m to £19 . 3m (2014: £18 . 1m) . The Group had no borrowings at 30 June 2015 (2014: £nil) .
As required under Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) rules and both Jersey and Guernsey Financial Services Commissions we perform a regular 
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Adjusted Net Liquid Asset (ANLA) calculation which includes performing a range of 
stress tests to determine the appropriate level of regulatory capital and liquidity that the Group needs to hold . Surplus levels of capital are forecast 
taking into account investment requirements and proposed dividends to ensure that appropriate buffers are maintained . The Group’s Pillar 3 
disclosures are published annually on our website (www . brooksmacdonald . com) .
Segmental review
The Group reports its results in four key operating segments; Investment management, Financial planning Fund and property management 
and Channel Islands . The principal activities of the Group are described in detail above on page 5 . 
Strategic report 
continued 08  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Segmental review continued
One of the key performance indicators is the growth in discretionary funds under management in total across all parts of the Group which 
are reported on a quarterly basis throughout the year . The increase in the year is analysed in the table below .
Funds under 
management (£m) 
At 1 July 2014 6,550
Inflows – net new discretionary business* 645
– acquisitions –
– investment growth 218
At 30 June 2015 7,413
Organic growth net of markets 9 . 8%
Total net growth 13 . 2%
*  Includes clients leaving and capital or income withdrawals of larger than £50,000 for Bespoke Portfolio Service (‘BPS’) and larger than £20,000 for Managed Portfolio 
Service (‘MPS’) .
A large proportion of the net new discretionary business comes from professional intermediaries with whom we have worked over a 
number of years . As well as introducing discretionary management funds they also introduce to other parts of the Group and the number  
of introducing firms has increased to 770 (2014: 670) at 30 June 2015 .
Investment management 
The investment management service is the core part of the Group contributing 70% (2014: 71%) of the Group turnover and delivering  
96% (2014: 85%) of the Group profit on a segmental basis as detailed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements . Investment 
management principally provides discretionary investment management to private investors, charities and trusts through BPS and MPS . 
Despite considerable changes within the industry and volatility within the financial markets we have continued to grow funds under 
management (‘FUM’) as shown in the table above . 
Financial planning
The financial planning business delivers both fee based financial planning to high net-worth individuals and employee benefits consultancy 
to small and medium sized employers throughout the UK and remains a major introducer of new investment management to the Group . 
During the year there was further revenue growth to £4 . 2m (2014: £4 . 0m) as the business continued to invest in additional staff and 
systems, particularly as part of the employment benefits consultancy resulting in a small loss for the year of £0 . 1m (loss 2014: £0 . 1m) .  
The Board believes that the business is now positioned to return to profitability in the next financial year . 
Fund and property management
It has been another year of considerable growth for Brooks Macdonald Funds, as part of the increase in the table shown above, with  
total FUM increasing by 28% to £663m (2014: £518m) at 30 June 2015 . This growth was achieved both organically through the net new 
investment in the existing seven funds, as well as by the investment in North Row Capital LLP, which manages the Liquid Property Fund that 
was launched in February 2014 and has contributed £30m to the year end total of FUM . The Group exercised its option to acquire Levitas 
on 31 July 2014 with FUM of £89m and at 30 June 2015 this had increased to £114m .
Brooks Macdonald Funds has broken even for this financial year and given the current level of FUM and projected growth it is expected to 
make a net contribution to the Group in the year ending 30 June 2016 .
Braemar Estates has had particularly difficult year with assets under administration broadly unchanged at £1 . 14bn (2014: £1 . 13bn) against an 
increased cost base and the loss of a number of mandates . New business instructions were slower in the first half of the financial year than 
anticipated although this has improved and the benefits of this will be seen in the second half of the new financial year . Since the year end a 
strategic review of the business had been undertaken resulting in a number of changes to the board of Braemar Estates which the directors 
believe will result in an improved performance in the forthcoming year .

Channel Islands
Our Channel Islands business as detailed above comprises BMI and BMRSI both operating in Jersey and Guernsey and results from the 
acquisition of Spearpoint Limited in November 2012 and DPZ Capital Limited (‘DPZ’) in April 2014 . 
During the year both businesses have undergone significant changes in personnel and integration costs following the acquisition of DPZ  
and during the year the both the chief executives of BMI and BMRSI left the Group resulting in some one-off costs . Darren Zaman has been 
appointed as CEO and has led a reorganisation of the structure of the businesses and the services offered, including the initiation of an 
international MPS and the development of links with professional intermediaries overseas focussing on three principal areas: South Africa, where 
we have recently obtained regulatory permissions to market our services to intermediaries and clients alike; the Far East; and the Middle East .
The profits from the Channel Islands as shown in the segmental analysis on page 35 have reduced in the year to £1 . 3m (2014: £2 . 4m) as a 
result of the increased costs and a reduction in some of the higher margin but more transactional revenues . With a number of opportunities 
that we are pursuing internationally, the directors believe there will be an improvement in profitability in year to 30 June 2016 .
Corporate governance
The principal board committees are the Audit, Remuneration and Risk and Compliance committees, all of which have specific terms of 
reference which are periodically reviewed and approved by the Board . These terms of reference are available on the Group website .
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are three of the non-executive directors: Richard Price (Chairman), Christopher Knight and Colin 
Harris . Richard Price became a member of the committee from the date of his appointment to the board, 1 August 2014, and was 
appointed Chairman on 8 September 2014 in succession to Christopher Knight . The board is satisfied that all members of the committee 
have recent and relevant financial experience .
The committee met four times during the year ended 30 June 2015 . As well as being responsible for reviewing the external audit 
arrangements with regard to compensation, scope and period of office, the committee also considers the accounting policies of the  
Group and the significant issues and judgements in connection with statutory financial reporting .
The committee reviews the audit control memorandum and the audit engagement letters and has discussions with the auditor without 
management present .
Risk and Compliance Committee
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to ensure risks are identified, reported and managed at every level of the corporate 
structure . Individual business units follow documented processes and procedures and their activities are monitored on an ongoing basis . 
Monitoring output is reported to business managers and identified risks are reported to business-level risk committees . Each risk committee  
is responsible for reviewing identified risks and implementing procedure reviews and mitigating action as necessary . Identified risks are 
ranked according to potential impact and reported up through the risk management framework according to the Group’s escalation policy . 
Business-level risk committees report to a Group Risk Committee and, ultimately, to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Group 
Board .
The membership of the Risk and Compliance Committee is made up of the Group’s four non-executive directors and is chaired by Colin Harris . 
Business managers and representatives from the legal, risk and compliance functions attend committee meetings as necessary to report on 
identified risks and mitigating action .
During the year ended 30 June 2015 the committee met on seven occasions . Its principal responsibilities include monitoring identified risks 
and the effectiveness of mitigating action, keeping risk assessment processes under review, assessing material breaches of risk limits and 
reviewing client complaints .
The Group’s risk management framework is subject to ongoing review .
The principal risks identified as having a potential material impact on the Group are detailed below, together with the principal means  
of mitigation .
Financial risks
The Group’s principal financial risks relate to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk and the measures and policies for the management of 
those risks are set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements . Further details on capital management processes can be found  
in note 33 .

Non-financial risks
The significant non-financial risks faced by Group have been reviewed by the committee, which believes they remain broadly the same  
as in previous years and are as follows:
Reputational risk
Impact
The Group has a growing reputation as a provider of high quality 
investment and wealth management services . There is a risk that 
significant damage to reputation could lead to the loss of existing 
clients as well as impacting on the ability to gain new clients, which 
would lead to a fall in financial income . Such risk could arise from 
events such as poor investment performance, poor client service  
or regulatory censure .
Mitigation
This risk is minimised by ensuring the Group maintains a culture  
of high ethical and professional standards whilst focussing on 
delivering a first class service to all of our clients . The Group 
maintains separate, independent risk and compliance departments, 
which ensures conformity with the regulations of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, as well as relevant statutes, in all of our  
dealings with our clients .
Regulatory risk
Impact
The sector in which the Group operates is heavily regulated and  
any breach of regulations could lead to fines or disciplinary action 
against the Group or its staff .
Mitigation
The Group monitors compliance with existing law and regulations 
and keeps abreast of future changes to assess likely business impact 
and to ensure that the Group has sufficient resources to implement 
any necessary changes .
People risk
Impact
Our business is dependent on client relationships with our staff . 
Operating in a competitive market there is a risk of loss of existing 
clients due to poor performance or service, a failure to respond  
to changes in the market place, or the loss of key investment 
professionals .
Mitigation
To minimise this risk, the Group continues to invest in its employees 
and monitors developments in the marketplace in which it operates 
to ensure that the Group continues to offer a wide range of services . 
Recruitment policies are designed to attract high quality staff and 
the Group regularly reviews and benchmarks its remuneration 
packages and contractual arrangements and motivation is measured 
through a sentiment index . Structured training is provided by the 
Group’s Learning & Development team .
Technology risk
Impact
A key part of the high quality service delivered to clients is  
facilitated by a flexible and robust internal ICT infrastructure .
Mitigation
New ICT projects are regularly reviewed and appraised at board 
meetings in order to ensure that the Group continues to develop 
and maintain its ICT capabilities . Business continuity is assured 
through our network of offices and our remote working capabilities .

Non-financial risks continued
Operational risk
Impact
Operational risk is the risk that the Group suffers a loss of business 
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people  
and systems or from the failure of outsourcing partners or  
external suppliers .
Mitigation
Due diligence takes place prior to the commencement of any 
outsourcing or supply, to maintain a robust procurement process 
and good contract governance . We keep our key outsourcing 
partners under review and have in place procedures to regularly 
assess the performance of such suppliers as well as identifying 
suitable and viable alternatives .
Investment performance risk
Impact
There is a risk that portfolios will not meet their investment 
objectives which could result in the Group suffering loss of business . 
There is a risk on the suitability of portfolios for clients and where 
the suitability responsibility lies between a professional introducing 
the client and the group company .
Mitigation
Portfolio performance, valuations and risk profiles are monitored 
by management, allowing issues to be identified and mitigated  
as they arise . The Group has in place BITA Monitor portfolio risk 
oversight tools to assist with supervising portfolio management . 
The Group keeps its client documentation under review and 
updates it regularly to ensure clients are properly informed  
about investment policy and risks .
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Diane Seymour-Williams (Chair), Christopher Knight and Colin Harris . The committee (in 
consultation with the Chief Executive) determines the specific remuneration packages for each executive director and certain senior 
executives including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, benefits and terms of employment . The committee is also responsible 
for setting the broad parameters for the annual base salary review for all staff across the Group and reviews all awards made under various 
long-term incentive schemes operated by the Group . 
Remuneration policy
Brooks Macdonald recognises the importance of its employees to the success of the Group and consequently the remuneration policy  
is designed to be market competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre individuals . External third party data is used  
to validate rather than to benchmark the total reward .
The remuneration policy, which applies to directors and employees of the Group, is based on the following key principles:
• designed to encourage the retention of staff through deferred variable compensation, where appropriate; 
• the need to provide a market competitive balanced package of benefits;
• inclusion of both annual and long term elements;
• differentiation by merit and performance;
• an emphasis on variable, performance driven remuneration bonus payments funded from retained profits;
• compliant with financial services rules and regulations; 
• alignment with shareholders’ interests with significant long term equity participation; and 
• clarity, transparency and fairness of process .
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit related bonus, 
long-term equity based incentives and pension . The total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable pay with an element  
of deferral .

together with any additional awards made on similar terms . The awards satisfied the performance conditions requiring an increase in the diluted earnings per share of 
the Company of at least 2% per annum more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which the date of the 
grant falls and ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of the grant falls . The vesting date was 27 October 2013 and the market price on 
that date was £14 . 02 .
Notes to the single total figure of remuneration for each director table
Basic salary
Basic salary is paid monthly in cash through payroll determined by the committee and any changes are implemented from 1 July each year 
or when an individual changes position or responsibility . In deciding appropriate levels the committee considers salaries throughout the 
group and information on comparable companies of a similar size and complexity, provided by advisers to the committee . The views of the 
Chief Executive are taken into consideration when setting the salary of other directors . The base salaries of executive directors were 
increased on 1 July 2014 by a total of 2 . 6% compared to an overall average increase for all employees of 3 . 7% .

Non-executive directors’ fees
The non-executive directors’ salaries were similarly reviewed and increased on average by 9 . 3% with the approval of the board to reflect 
their additional responsibilities and commitments as the Group grows . 
The Chairman’s fee was increased from £75,000 to £90,000 on 1 September 2014 and the basic non-executive director’s fee was increased 
from £36,000 to £40,000 on 1 July 2014 .
Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits are the provision of private medical insurance for the executive directors and their dependents and the provision of interest-
free season ticket loans as disclosed in note 35 to the consolidated financial statements . 
Annual bonus
Awards to executive directors and some other senior employees of the Group of profit related bonuses are made from a pool of profits in 
the region of 10-20% of the Group pre-tax profit after the payment of all bonuses to all other staff . The committee determines the overall 
size of the pool based on the performance of the Group against a number of key performance indicators including the growth in profits, 
the movement in funds under management, various internal client service metrics and the performance against budget of each of the 
operating divisions . 
The total payment to executive directors, including the amounts deferred into shares, represented 10 . 0% (2013: 10 . 9%) of Group pre-tax 
profit . The total bonus payment to all senior employees who participate in this scheme was 11 . 9% (2014: 12 . 1%) .
Awards to individual executive directors are determined by the committee following recommendations from the Chief Executive, taking  
into account a number of financial and non-financial factors . These are intended to give a broad assessment of the annual performance 
objectives of each director, including the results of the business, investment performance, net new business, management of risks facing  
the Group and cost control within each individual’s area of responsibility . 
The Remuneration Committee has decided that 20% of the bonus awarded will be made in shares deferred for a period of three years 
under a Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) . In addition, directors may choose to defer a further amount of any bonus awarded, up to  
a maximum of 20%, making 40% in total, into shares under the LTIS . 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The Group established an EBT on 3 December 2010 . The Trust was established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company in connection 
with the deferred share element of the profit related bonus under the LTIS as detailed above . The EBT is also used for other long-term 
awards to members of the Board and to other senior employees .
The Remuneration Committee has made additional awards under the LTIS to certain executive directors and other senior employees .  
The conditional awards are subject to the same performance and other conditions as those applying to the deferred profit related bonus  
share options .
The LTIS awards reported are the historic awards vesting at the end of the three year cycle valued using the share price on the date of the 
vesting . In addition to the deferred element of the annual bonus described above the executive directors are awarded rights to acquire 
ordinary shares . The scheme has performance conditions attached to the deferred award, requiring a minimum growth in the diluted 
earnings per share of the Group of 2% per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) over the three year period .
Pensions
Executive directors may participate in the pension arrangements of the Group or receive cash in lieu of pension on the same basis as other 
employees . The Group’s contributions are currently 15% of base salary .

Sharesave Scheme (‘Sharesave’)
All directors are entitled to take part in the HMRC approved Brooks Macdonald Group Sharesave Scheme (‘Sharesave’) on the same terms 
as all other employees . Annual invitations to participate in the scheme, which commences each year on 1 June, are sent to directors and 
option grants are made at 80% of the closing mid-market price on the day of the offer .
Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI’) 
The Brooks Macdonald Group Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (‘EMI’) was adopted by the shareholders of the Company on  
11 February 2005 . 
Options granted can be exercised if there has been an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of at least 2% per annum 
more than the increase in the RPI over the period of three financial years starting with the financial year in which the date of grant falls  
and ending with the financial year in which the third anniversary of the date of grant falls .
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of the grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of the 
grant . Due to the increase in the size of the Company it is no longer eligible under HMRC rules to grant options under this EMI scheme  
and the last options were awarded to directors under this scheme on 17 October 2007 .

Remuneration Committee continued
Company Share Option Plan (‘CSOP’)
Following discussions regarding remuneration structures and incentives schemes for senior employees and directors the Company decided  
to set up a CSOP which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 17 October 2013 and by HMRC on 21 November 
2013 .
The scheme is a discretionary scheme whereby employees or directors are granted an option to purchase the Company’s shares in the  
future at a price set on the date of the grant . The maximum award under the terms of the scheme for an individual is a total market value of 
£30,000 . There are performance conditions attaching to the scheme similar to those in place for the EMI Scheme above whereby there must 
be an increase in the diluted earnings per share of the Company of 2% more than the increase in the RPI over the three years starting with 
the financial year in which the option is granted .
Dilution
Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (adjusted for bonus and rights issues) will be issued for all EMI and 
share incentive schemes operated by the Company in any ten year rolling period . The Company satisfies the various equity-based schemes  
it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares .
Service contracts for executive directors
The Company has service contracts with its executive directors with a notice period of 12 months and it is company policy that such 
contracts should not normally contain periods of more than 12 months . 
External appointments
Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with any fees in excess of £15,000 per annum paid to the Company .
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of employment but as with other directors are now required to stand for re-election .  
The executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors who do not receive pension or other  
benefits from the Group and do not participate in any Group incentive schemes .
Strategic report 
continued 18  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The directors present herewith their annual 
report, together with the audited financial 
statements of the Group for the year 
ended 30 June 2015 .
Results and dividends
The profit before taxation for the year 
ended 30 June 2015 was £11,420,000 
(2014: £10,568,000) and the profit after 
taxation was £9,151,000 (2014: £9,056,000) .
The Company paid an interim dividend 
during the year of 10 . 0p (2014: 7 . 0p) per 
share . The directors recommend a final 
dividend of 20 . 5p (2014: 19 . 0p) per  
share . This results in total dividends for 
the year of 30 . 5p (2014: 26 . 0p) per 
ordinary share . These dividends amount 
to a total distribution to shareholders  
of £4,102,000 (2014: £3,453,000)  
in the year .
Retirement and  
re-appointment of directors
Andrew Shepherd, Nick Holmes and Simon 
Wombwell will retire by rotation at the 
annual general meeting and are eligible  
to nominate themselves for re-election .
Directors’ indemnities 
The Company has made qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions for the benefit 
of its directors and these remain in force  
at the date of the report .
Employment policies 
Employees are encouraged to identify  
and become involved with the financial 
performance of the Group and are 
rewarded by involvement in profit sharing 
arrangements . Employees also have the 
opportunity to participate in the Group’s 
share incentive plans .

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations .
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year . Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the 
parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law) . Under company law the 
directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period . In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and parent company 
financial statements respectively;
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business .
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 . They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities .
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Group’s 
website . Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions . Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  21

Report on the group  
financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Brooks Macdonald Group 
plc’s group financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’):
• give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s affairs as at 30 June 2015 
and of its profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 .
What we have audited
The financial statements comprise:
• the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as at 30 June 2015;
• the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year 
then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows for the year then ended;
• the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other 
explanatory information .
The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the 
financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union .
In applying the financial reporting 
framework, the directors have made  
a number of subjective judgements,  
for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates . In making such 
estimates, they have made assumptions 
and considered future events .
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in 
the Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements .
Other matters on which  
we are required to report  
by exception
Adequacy of information and 
explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit . 
We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility . 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made . We have no exceptions to report 
arising from this responsibility . 
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements  
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those  
of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on 
page 20, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view .
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) . 
Those standards require us to comply  
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors .
This report, including the opinions,  
has been prepared for and only for  
the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16  
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose . We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing . Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  23
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc | continued
What an audit of financial  
statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with ISAs (UK & Ireland) . An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance  
that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error . This includes an 
assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial 
statements . 
We primarily focus our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the 
disclosures in the financial statements .
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques,  
to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw 
conclusions . We obtain audit evidence 
through testing the effectiveness  
of controls, substantive procedures  
or a combination of both .
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit . If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report .
Other matter
We have reported separately on the 
parent company financial statements  
of Brooks Macdonald Group plc for  
the year ended 30 June 2015 .

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. General information
Brooks Macdonald Group plc (‘the Company’) is the parent company of a group of companies (‘the Group’), which offers a range of 
investment management services and related professional advice to private high net worth individuals, charities and trusts . The Group also 
provides financial planning as well as offshore fund management and administration services and acts as fund manager to regulated OEICs, 
providing specialist funds in the property and structured return sectors and managing property assets on behalf of these funds and other clients .
The Company is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on 
AIM . The address of its registered office is 72 Welbeck Street, London, W1G 0AY .
2. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below . These policies have been applied 
consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated .
a) Basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  
and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable  
to companies reporting under IFRS . The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of 
available for sale financial assets such that they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements .
b) Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements are a consolidation of the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries . The underlying financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies . Subsidiaries 
(including structured entities) are all entities controlled by the Company, deemed to exist where the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity . The financial 
statements of the subsidiaries are included from the date on which control is transferred to the Group to the date that control ceases .
All intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation .
The Group has disclosed all of its subsidiary undertakings in note 41 in the parent company’s financial statements .
c) Changes in accounting policies
The Group’s accounting policies applied to these financial statements are consistent with those disclosed within the financial statements  
for the year ended 30 June 2014 .
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in the year
In the year ended 30 June 2015 the Group did not adopt any new standards or amendments issued by the IASB or interpretations issued  
by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) that have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements . 
Other new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted, that have not had a material impact on the amounts reported in these 
financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements, were:
Standard, amendment or interpretation Effective date
Consolidation of investment entities (amendments to IFRS 10, 12 and IAS 27) 1 January 2014
Recoverable amount disclosures for non-financial assets (amendments to IAS 36) 1 January 2014
Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities (amendments to IAS 32) 1 January 2014
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’ 17 June 2014
Contributions to defined benefit plans (amendments to IAS 19) 1 July 2014
IFRS3 clarifications relating to business combinations 1 July 2014
IFRS 13 amendment of  the treatment of short term receivables and payables 1 July 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  29
2. Principal accounting policies continued
c) Changes in accounting policies continued
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2015 | continued
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted 
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations, which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements, have 
been issued and are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after 1 July 2015:
Standard, amendment or interpretation Effective date
Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (IFRS15) 1 January 2017
Financial Instruments  (amendments to IFRS 9) 1 January 2018
IFRS 11 amendments for accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations 1 January 2016
IAS16 and IAS38 clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 1 January 2016
These changes are currently being assessed but none are expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s future consolidated 
financial statements .
d) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial information requires the use of assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions . Use of 
currently available information and application of judgement are inherent in the formation of estimates . Actual results in the future may 
differ from those reported . In this regard, the directors believe that the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are those 
that relate to the measurement of intangible assets, deferred consideration, the estimation of the fair value of share-based payments and 
client compensation provisions .
The underlying assumptions made are reviewed on an ongoing basis . Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised only if the revision affects both current and future periods .
Further information about key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below .
Intangible assets
The Group has acquired client relationships and the associated investment management contracts as part of business combinations 
(as described in note 13), through separate purchase and purchased with newly employed teams of fund managers (as described in note 
14) . In assessing the fair value of these assets the Group has estimated their finite life based on information about the typical length of 
existing client relationships . Contracts acquired with fund managers and acquired client relationship contracts are amortised on a straight 
line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 20 years .
Goodwill recognised as part of a business combination is reviewed annually for impairment, or when a change in circumstances indicates 
that it might be impaired . The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined by value in use calculations, which require the 
use of estimates to derive the projected future cash flows attributable to each unit . Details of the more significant assumptions are given in 
note 14 .
Deferred consideration
As described in note 22, the Group has a deferred consideration balance in respect of the acquisition of JPAM Limited in July 2012; DPZ in 
April 2014; and Levitas Investment Management Services Limited in July 2015 . Deferred consideration is recognised at its fair value, being  
an estimate of the amount that will ultimately be payable in future periods . This has been calculated allowing for estimated growth in the 
acquired funds, discounted by the estimated cost of capital . The Group considers that reasonably possible changes to these assumptions

Share-based payments
The Group operates various share-based payment schemes in respect of services received from certain employees . Estimating the fair value 
of these share-based payments requires the Group to apply an appropriate valuation model and determine the inputs to that model (notes 
24 and 29) . The charge to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of share-based payments is calculated using 
assumptions about the number of eligible employees that will leave the Group and the number of employees that will satisfy the relevant 
performance conditions . These estimates are reviewed regularly . 
Provisions 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group may receive complaints from clients in relation to the services provided . Complaints are 
assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions are made where it is judged to be likely that compensation will be paid .
e) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed and described separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the underlying financial performance of the Group . These include material items of income or expense that are shown 
separately due to the significance of their nature or amount .
f) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method . The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the 
aggregate amount of the consideration transferred at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest . Acquisition 
costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year of acquisition .
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date . If the business combination is 
achieved in stages, the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest is re-measured at the acquisition date and the difference is 
credited or charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition are 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair value at the date of acquisition .
Any contingent consideration to be paid by the Group to the vendor is recognised at its fair value at the acquisition date . Subsequent 
changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with IAS 39 in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income .
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the acquired company’s net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed . If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is 
recognised as a gain on a bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested annually for impairment . For the purposes of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquisition are assigned to those units . The carrying amount of each 
cash generating unit is compared to its recoverable amount, which is determined using a discounted future cash flow model .
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated  
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation . Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion 
of the cash generating unit retained .
g) Fees, commissions and interest
Portfolio management and other advisory and custody services are billed in arrears but are recognised over the period the service is 
provided . Fees are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the value of the portfolio over the period . Dealing charges are levied at the 
time a deal is placed for a client . Fees are only recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will 
be receivable . Amounts are shown net of rebates paid to significant investors .

g) Fees, commissions and interest continued
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2015 | continued
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance 
measurement periods . They are only recognised, at the end of these performance periods, when a reliable estimate of the fee can be made 
and it is almost certain that it will be received . 
Financial consulting fees are charged to clients using an hourly rate or by a fixed fee arrangement and are recognised over the period the 
service is provided . Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned .
Where amounts due are conditional on the successful completion of fund raising for investment vehicles, revenue is recognised where, in 
the opinion of the directors, there is reasonable certainty that sufficient funds have been raised to enable the successful operation of that 
investment vehicle . Amounts due on an annual basis for the management of third party investment vehicles are recognised on a time 
apportioned basis .
Interest receivable is recognised on an accruals basis .
h) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash in hand and call deposits held with banks . Cash equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid investments, with  
a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition .
i) Share-based payments
Equity-settled schemes 
The Group engages in equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees . The fair 
value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options on the grant date . This cost is then 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity .
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, 
the current share price, the risk free rate of interest, the expected volatility of the Company’s share price over the life of the award and other 
relevant factors .
Cash settled schemes 
The Group engages in cash settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees . On the grant 
date, the liability is measured at its fair value . The liability is subsequently re-measured at the end of each reporting period and on the date 
of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . The cost of the services 
received from employees in respect of this scheme is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with a 
corresponding credit to accruals .
j) Segmental reporting 
The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group Board of 
Directors, which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker . 
k) Fiduciary activities 
The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, 
trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions . These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial 
statements, as they are not assets of the Group .
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the client money rules of the Financial Conduct Authority . Such 
monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not included within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the Group  
is not beneficially entitled thereto .

l) Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment . Costs include the original purchase cost of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into  
a working condition for its intended use .
Provision is made for depreciation to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset, using a straight line method, over its 
expected useful life as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 6 . 67 years
Equipment 5 years
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease
Motor vehicles 4 years
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period . Gains 
and losses arising on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount . These are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income . 
m) Intangible assets
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a 
straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (4 to 20 years) .
Acquired client relationship contracts and contracts acquired with fund managers
Intangible assets are recognised where client relationship contracts are either separately acquired or acquired with investment managers 
who are employed by the Group . These are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over their 
estimated useful economic life . Separately acquired client relationship contracts are amortised over 15 to 20 years and those acquired with 
investment managers over 5 years . Both types of intangible asset are reviewed annually to determine whether there exists an indicator of 
impairment or an indicator that the assumed useful economic life has changed .
Computer software
Computer software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of four years .
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising as part of a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration 
transferred over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
subsidiary at date of acquisition . In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed annually for 
impairment and is therefore stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value . Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and is not subsequently reversed . Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include 
the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold . On acquisition, any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for 
the purposes of impairment testing . If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
n) Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more third 
parties under a contractual agreement . Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost in 
the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
entities . The Group’s share of the results of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
If the Group’s share of the losses of a joint venture equals or exceeds its investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it 
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture . Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  33
2. Principal accounting policies continued
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

o) Financial investments 
The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss; available for sale; loans and receivables;  
and held-to-maturity . The classification is determined by management on initial recognition of the financial asset, which depends on the 
purpose for which it was acquired .
Fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss if they are either held for trading or specifically designated in this 
category on initial recognition . Assets in this category are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured, with gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
Available for sale
Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either specifically designated in this category or are not classified in any of  
the other categories . They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 
12 months of the end of the reporting period . Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 
revalued based on the current bid prices of the assets as quoted in active markets . Changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, 
through the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . The cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income when an available for sale financial asset is derecognised or impaired .
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market . They are 
included in current assets except where they have maturities of more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period, in which case 
they are classified as non-current assets . The Group’s loans and receivables are recognised within ‘trade and other receivables’ .
Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinate payments and fixed maturities that the Group’s 
management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity . Held-to-maturity financial assets are measured at amortised cost .
p) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that it will result in an 
outflow of economic benefits and can be reliably estimated . Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to 
be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the obligation .
Client compensation 
Complaints are assessed on a case-by-case basis and provisions for compensation are made where it is judged necessary .
q) Foreign currency translation
The Group’s functional and presentational currency is the Pound Sterling . Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange 
rate prevailing at the transaction date . At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are 
retranslated at the prevailing rates on that date . Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation of period-end monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
r) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income as they fall due .
s) Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax . Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years .
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the Group’s financial statements . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled based on tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date . 34  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. Principal accounting policies continued
s) Taxation continued
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2015 | continued
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised . 
t) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised and subsequently measured at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts that 
are expected to be uncollectable . Doubtful debts are provided for when the collection of the full amount is no longer probable, whilst bad 
debts are immediately written off when identified .
u) Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers .  
These are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business  
if longer) . Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position .
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method .
v) Operating lease payments 
Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis 
over the term of the lease . Where leases include lease incentives such as rent-free periods, the benefit of these incentives is recognised over 
the lease term as a reduction in the rental expense .
w) Financial instruments 
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity 
instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement . Financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position at fair value when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument .
x) Carried interest receivable 
The Group earns a performance fee, carried interest receivable, on some of the funds it manages on behalf of its investors . Carried interest 
receivable is recognised where, at the reporting date, the performance criteria have been met based on the valuations of the funds . Carried 
interest that has been earned but is not yet due for payment is discounted to its present value . This is included within current liabilities in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position .
y) Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’)
The Company provides finance to an EBT to purchase the Company’s shares on the open market in order to meet its obligation to provide 
shares when an employee exercises certain options or awards made under the Group’s share-based payment schemes . The administration 
and finance costs connected with the EBT are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . The cost of the shares held 
by the EBT is deducted from equity . A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings over the vesting periods of the related 
share options or awards to reflect the ultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise . The trustees have waived their rights to 
receive dividends on the shares .
The EBT is considered to be a Structured Entity, as defined in note 36 . In substance, the activities of the trust are being conducted on behalf 
of the Group according to its specific business needs, in order to obtain benefits from its operation . On this basis, the assets held by the 
trust are consolidated into the Group’s financial statements .
z) Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity . Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds .
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly incremental costs 
(i . e . net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued . 
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received (net of any directly attributable incremental transaction 
costs and the related income tax effects) is included within equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders .

aa) Dividend distribution
The dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividend is authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company . Final dividends are recognised when approved by the Company’s 
shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are recognised when paid . 
3. Segmental information
For management purposes the Group’s activities are organised into four operating divisions: investment management, financial planning, 
fund and property management and the Channel Islands . The Group’s other activity, offering nominee and custody services to clients,  
is included within investment management . These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segmental information .  
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, disclosures are required to reflect the information which the Board uses internally for 
evaluating the performance of its operating segments and allocating resources to those segments . The information presented in this note 
follows the presentation for internal reporting to the Group Board of Directors .
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction . Revenues and expenses that are not directly 
originated by a particular business segment are reported as unallocated . Sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length . Centrally 
incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis . Segmental assets and liabilities comprise operating 
assets and liabilities, those being the majority of the balance sheet .

to profits of the consolidated entities in the UK as follows:
2015
£’000
2014
£’000
Profit on ordinary activities before tax 11,420 10,568
Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of tax in the UK of 20 . 75% 
(2014: 22 . 5%) 2,370 2,378
Tax effect of:
– Lower tax rates in other countries in which the Group operates (255) (618)
– Disallowable expenses 385 77
– Non-taxable income – (1)
– Tax losses unutilised on which no deferred tax is provided – 168
– Change in rate of Corporation Tax applicable to deferred tax – (475)
– Over provision in prior years (231) (17)
Tax charge for the year 2,269 1,512
The deferred tax credits totalling £276,000 (2014: £473,000) represent a charge of £28,000 (2014: £122,000 credit) arising from the share 
option reserve at the balance sheet date, a charge of £117,000 (2014: £10,000 credit) relating to accelerated capital allowances and a credit 
of £421,000 (2014: £341,000) arising from the amortisation of acquired client relationship contracts .
On 1 April 2015, the standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK was reduced from 21% to 20% . As a result the effective rate of 
Corporation Tax applied to the taxable profit for the year ended 30 June 2015 is 20 . 75% (2014: 22 . 5%) .
In addition to the change in the rate of UK Corporation Tax disclosed above, the Finance Bill 2015 (which has yet to be substantively 
enacted) will further reduce the main rate of UK Corporation Tax to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020 . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
calculated at the rate that is expected to be in force when the temporary differences unwind, but limited to the extent that such rates have 
been substantively enacted . Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  41

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

Consequently the tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities remains at 20% (2014: 20%) and will be reviewed when 
the aforementioned legislation has passed through Parliament .

11. Earnings per share
The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provide a truer reflection of the Group’s performance in the year . Underlying 
earnings per share are calculated based on ‘underlying earnings’, which is defined as earnings before acquisition costs, finance costs and 
changes in the fair value of deferred consideration and amortisation of intangible non-current assets . The tax effect of these adjustments 
has also been considered .
Earnings for the year used to calculate earnings per share as reported in these consolidated financial statements were as follows:
2015
£’000
2014
£’000
Earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 9,151 9,056
Acquisition costs (note 7) 120 187
Finance cost of deferred consideration (note 9) 760 349
Changes in fair value of deferred consideration 70 –
Amortisation (note 14) 2,708 2,212
Tax impact of adjustments (571) (486)
Underlying earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders 12,238 11,318
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares  
in issue throughout the year . Diluted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share adjusted for the effect of dilutive potential 
shares issuable on exercise of employee share options under the Group’s share-based payment schemes, weighted for the relevant period .
The weighted average number of shares in issue during the year was as follows:
2015

2015 and is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting . It will be paid on 28 October 2015 to 
shareholders who are on the register at the close of business on 25 September 2015 . In accordance with IAS 10 ‘Events After the Reporting 
Period’, this dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements .
13. Business combinations
On 31 July 2014, the Group exercised its option to acquire the entire share capital of Levitas Investment Management Services Limited 
(‘Levitas’) . Levitas is the sponsor of two funds known as TM Levitas A and TM Levitas B, to which Brooks Macdonald Asset Management 
Limited acts as the investment adviser . The funds were launched in July 2012 and aggregate assets under management on exercise of the 
option were £89m . The Levitas investment proposition uses a blend of the two funds to match investments to a client’s specific risk rating, 
thus simplifying the investment and rebalancing processes while keeping down costs . 
The consideration payable by the Group is dependent on the future assets under management in the Levitas funds, calculated at agreed 
milestones up to 1 November 2018 and payable in a series of instalments, with the final payment date being on or around 8 November 
2020 . Under the terms of the option agreement, the maximum consideration payable will be £24,000,000 . The fair value of the liability  
at the acquisition date was measured at £11,264,000, based on the Levitas business plan and forecasts . This included an initial payment  
of £724,000, which was made to the vendors following the exercise of the option .

a) Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination . The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2015 comprises £3,550,000 in respect of the Braemar Group 
Limited (‘Braemar’) CGU, £21,243,000 in respect of the Brooks Macdonald Asset Management (International) Limited, Brooks Macdonald 
Retirement Services (International) Limited and DPZ (collectively ‘Brooks Macdonald International’) CGU and £11,213,000 in respect of the 
Levitas Investment Management Services Limited (‘Levitas’) CGU .
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment and its recoverability has been assessed at 30 June 2015 by comparing the carrying amount of 
the CGUs to their expected recoverable amount, estimated on a value-in-use basis . The value-in-use of each CGU has been calculated using 
pre-tax discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets approved by the relevant subsidiary boards of directors, covering a 
period of up to five years . Cash flows are then extrapolated beyond the forecast period using an expected long-term growth rate . Brooks Macdonald Group plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015  |  45

14. Intangible assets continued
a) Goodwill continued
Based on the value-in-use calculation, at 30 June 2015 the calculated recoverable amount of the Brooks Macdonald International CGU was 
£35,120,000, indicating that there is no impairment . The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, the short-term 
growth in earnings and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax discount rate of 9 . 25% has been used, based on the Group’s 
assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to Brooks Macdonald International . Annual earnings growth rates of 
between 13% and 32% are forecast over the next five financial years, the period covered by the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic 
actual growth and planned management actions and are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends . The 2% 
long-term growth rate applied is considered prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds, investment 
management and financial planning industries in which the CGU operates .
In relation to the Levitas CGU, based on the value-in-use calculation the calculated recoverable amount at 30 June 2015 was £22,195,000, 
indicating that there is no impairment . The key underlying assumptions of the calculation are the discount rate, the growth in funds under 
management of the Levitas funds and the long-term growth rate of the business . A pre-tax discount rate of 9 . 25% has been used, based on 
the Group’s assessment of the risk-free rate of interest and specific risks relating to Levitas . Annual funds under management growth rates 
of between 16% and 91% are forecast in the next five financial years, the period covered by the most recent forecasts, which reflect historic 
actual growth and planned management activities and are considered to be achievable given current market and industry trends . The 2% 
long-term growth rate applied is considered prudent in the context of the long-term average growth rate for the funds industry in which 
the CGU operates . 
The key assumptions inherent in the value-in-use calculations for the Braemar CGU were similarly a pre-tax discount rate of 9 . 25%, annual 
revenue growth rates ranging from 13% to 28% and a long-term growth rate of 2% . 
Significant headroom exists in the calculations of the respective recoverable amounts of these CGUs over the carrying amounts of the 
goodwill allocated to them . On this basis, the directors have concluded that there is no impairment . The directors consider that no reasonably 
foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, given the margin by which the estimated 
recoverable amounts of the CGUs exceed the carrying amounts of the goodwill allocated to each .
b) Computer software
Software costs are amortised over an estimated useful life of four years on a straight line basis .
c) Acquired client relationship contracts
This asset represents the fair value of future benefits accruing to the Group from acquired client relationship contracts . The amortisation of 
client relationships is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over their estimated useful 
lives (15 to 20 years) .
During the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group acquired client relationship contracts of £nil (2014: £7,875,000) as part of business 
combinations (note 13), which were recognised as separately identifiable intangible assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position . 
d) Contracts acquired with fund managers
This asset represents the fair value of the future benefits accruing to the Group from contracts acquired with fund managers . Payments 
made to acquire such contracts are stated at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of five years .

The Student Accommodation fund is promoted by Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a subsidiary of the Group . Although trading is currently 
suspended on this fund, the fund manager continues to publish a price based on the fair value of the underlying assets of the fund . At 30 June 
2015, based on the most recent valuation, the fair value of the investment was £782,000 (2014: £1,432,000) . An impairment loss of £718,000 
was recognised on this investment in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the year, reflecting the perceived permanent 
diminution of value of the underlying assets of the fund . This included the recycling of the accumulated loss on the revaluation reserve of 
£68,000 as at 30 June 2014 and an additional £650,000 loss from changes in fair value in the current year . In the year ended 30 June 2014,  
a revaluation loss of £150,000 was recognised in other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income .
At 1 July 2014, the Group had an investment of £250,000 in the ordinary shares of SHL, an unlisted company incorporated in the Channel 
Islands . In December 2014 SHL sold its subsidiary company, Sancus Limited, to GLIF for consideration of £17 . 75m, settled through the issue 
of new ordinary GLIF shares . SHL subsequently sold its shareholding in GLIF and distributed the proceeds to its ordinary shareholders, prior 
to being voluntarily liquidated . Through this transaction, the Group realised a gain of £540,000 on its original investment of £250,000 in 
SHL ordinary shares, which is recognised as a realised gain on investment in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income . 
Prior to the sale of Sancus Limited, the Group made an additional investment of £250,000 in SHL zero dividend preference shares increasing 
the Group’s total investment to £750,000 . As part of the transaction, the Group’s entire holding of SHL zero dividend preference shares  
was exchanged for newly issued £1 GLIF zero dividend preference shares . In the opinion of the directors, the market value of the GLIF  
zero dividend preference shares at 30 June 2015 remains £750,000 as the conditions attached to these shares are similar to those of the 
equivalent SHL zero dividend preference shares for which they were exchanged .
The table below provides an analysis of the financial instruments that, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at fair value . These are 
grouped into the following levels within the fair value hierarchy, based on the degree to which the inputs used to determine the fair value  
are observable:
• Level 1 – derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
• Level 2 – derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 
• Level 3 – derived from inputs that are not based on observable market data .

17. Investment in joint venture 
In the year ended 30 June 2014, Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited, a Group company, entered into a new partnership, North Row Capital 
LLP, in which it holds a 60% interest and has joint control . The balance is owned by two individual partners who developed the investment 
approach behind the IFSL North Row Liquid Property Fund, which was launched in February 2014 . The fund offers investors liquid exposure 
to global real estate markets by investing predominantly in property derivatives, as well as property equity and debt, to gain exposure to the 
direct property markets .
The establishment of the partnership and the fund required an initial investment of £135,000 by Brooks Macdonald Funds Limited and 
additional working capital of £400,000 (2014: £225,000) in the year ended 30 June 2015 . The Group’s share of the loss for the year 
reported by North Row Capital LLP was £4,000 (2014: £128,000 loss), which has been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income with a corresponding reduction in the investment in joint venture recognised in the Consolidated Statement  
of Financial Position .

rate of interest of between 0 . 9% and 1 . 0% .

for the year ended 30 June 2015 | continued
b) Market risk
Interest rate risk 
The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in short-term cash deposits with maturity dates not exceeding three months . 
Consequently, the Group has a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing level of market interest rates .
A 1% fall in the average monthly interest rate receivable on the Group’s cash and cash equivalents would have the impact of reducing 
interest receivable and therefore profit before taxation by £190,000 (2014: £180,000) . An increase of 1% would have an equal and 
opposite effect .
Foreign exchange risk
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and therefore no analysis of foreign exchange risk  
is provided .
Price risk
Price risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market prices 
(other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk) . The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity securities 
and other financial assets, which are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (notes 16 and 20) . A 1% fall 
in the value of these financial instruments would have the impact of reducing total comprehensive income by £15,000 (2014: £22,000) and 
profit before tax by £nil (2014: £5,000) . An increase of 1% would have an equal and opposite effect .
c) Credit risk
The Group may elect to invest surplus cash balances in highly liquid money market instruments with maturity dates not exceeding  
three months . The difference between the fair value and the net book value of these instruments is not material . To reduce the risk of a 
counterparty default, the Group deposits the rest of its funds in approved, high quality banks . At 30 June 2015 there was no significant 
concentration of credit risk in any particular counterparty (2014: none) .
Assets exposed to credit risk recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position total £19,274,000 (2014: £18,056,000), being 
the Group’s total cash and cash equivalents .
Trade receivables with a carrying amount of £5,854,000 (2014: £9,653,000) are neither past due nor impaired . Trade receivables have no 
external credit rating as they relate to individual clients, although the value of investments held in each individual client’s portfolio is always  
in excess of the total value of the receivable . All trade receivables fall due within three months (2014: all) .
33. Capital management
Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves of the Company . Total capital at 30 June 
2015 was £74,164,000 (2014: £67,458,000) . Regulatory capital is derived from the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process 
(ICAAP), which is a requirement of the Capital Requirements Directive . The ICAAP draws on the Group’s risk management process which  
is embedded within the individual businesses, function heads and executive committees within the Group .
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to comply with the capital requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority,  
to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits  
for other stakeholders and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the business .
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the Group’s management . The Group’s 2015 ICAAP was 
approved in August 2015 . There have been no capital requirement breaches during the year . Brooks Macdonald Group plc’s Pillar III 
disclosure is presented on our website at www . brooksmacdonald . com .
34. Guarantees and contingent liabilities
The Company has an agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc to guarantee settlement for trading with CREST stock on behalf of 
clients . The Group holds client assets to fund such trading activity .
Additional levies by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may give rise to further obligations based on the Group’s income in the 
current or previous years . Nevertheless, the ultimate cost to the Group of these levies remains uncertain and is dependent upon future 
claims resulting from institutional failures .

The Group manages a number of collective investment funds that are considered related parties . Available for sale financial assets include 
an investment of 1,426,793 . 64 class B ordinary shares in Braemar Group PCC Limited Student Accommodation Cell (note 16) . This 
transaction was conducted on an arms length basis at market value .
The Group has an interest in a joint venture details of which are given in note 17 of these financial statements .
36. Interest in unconsolidated structured entities 
Structured entities are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who 
has control, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of 
contractual arrangements . The Group’s interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities are described below .
The only consolidated structured entity is the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’), details of which are given in note 27 .
The Group has interests in structured entities as a result of contractual arrangements arising from the management of assets on behalf of its 
clients . Assets under management within the Fund and Property management segment, include those managed within structured entities . 
These structured entities consist of unitised vehicles such as Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) which entitle investors to a 
percentage of the vehicle’s net asset value . The structured entities are financed by the purchase of units or shares by investors . As fund 
manager, the Group does not guarantee returns on its funds or commit to financially support its funds . Where external finance is raised, the 
Group does not provide a guarantee for the repayment of any borrowings . The business activity of all structured entities, in which the 
Group has an interest, is the management of assets in order to maximise investment returns for investors from capital appreciation and/or 
investment income . The Group earns a management fee from its structured entities, based on a percentage of the entity’s net asset value . 
The main risk the Group faces from its interest in FUM managed on behalf of external investors is the loss of fee income as a result of the withdrawal 
of funds by clients . Outflows from funds are dependent on market sentiment, asset performance and investor considerations . The assets under 
management for unconsolidated structured entities is £398m (2014: £232m) . Included in revenue on the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income is management fee income of £1,980,000 (2014: £1,324,000) from unconsolidated structured entities managed by the Group .

Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Brooks Macdonald Group plc
Report on the parent company  
financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Brooks Macdonald Group 
plc’s parent company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’):
•  give a true and fair view of the state of the 
parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2015;
• have been properly prepared in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006 .
What we have audited
The financial statements comprise:
•  the Company Balance Sheet  
as at 30 June 2015; and
• the notes to the financial statements, 
which include a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory 
information .
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of 
the financial statements is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice) .
In applying the financial reporting 
framework, the directors have made a 
number of subjective judgements, for 
example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates . In making such estimates, they 
have made assumptions and considered 
future events .
Opinion on other matter 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in 
the Strategic Report and the Report of the 
Directors for the financial year for which 
the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements .
Other matters on which we 
are required to report by 
exception
Adequacy of accounting records and 
information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records 
and returns .
We have no exceptions to report arising  
from this responsibility .
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made . We have  
no exceptions to report arising from  
this responsibility . 
Responsibilities for the 
financial statements and the 
audit
Our responsibilities and those  
of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement  
of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on 
page 20, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view .
Our responsibility is to audit and express  
an opinion on the financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’) . Those 
standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors .
This report, including the opinions, has been 
prepared for and only for the Company’s 
members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006 and for no other purpose . We do not,  
in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown  
or into whose hands it may come save  
where expressly agreed by our prior  
consent in writing .
What an audit of financial  
statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance  
with ISAs (UK & Ireland) . An audit involves 
obtaining evidence about the amounts  
and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance  
that the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the  
financial statements . 
We primarily focus our work in these areas 
by assessing the directors’ judgements 
against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures 
in the financial statements .
We test and examine information, using 
sampling and other auditing techniques, to  
the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions . 
We obtain audit evidence through testing  
the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both . 
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit . If we become aware  
of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report .
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group 
financial statements of Brooks Macdonald 
Group plc for the year ended 30 June 2014 .

Notes to the company financial statements 
38. Principal accounting policies
The general accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below . These policies have been applied 
consistently to all years presented, unless otherwise stated .
a) Basis of preparation
The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the 
United Kingdom . The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investments such 
that they are measured at their fair value .
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future . Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements . As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own Profit and 
Loss Account and Cash Flows Statement for the financial year .
b) Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less provisions for impairment .
c) Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’ and has adopted the requirements of UITF 44 . Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the grant date and the charge to the Profit and Loss Account is recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period in which the related services are provided, based on the number of shares that are expected to vest .
d) Operating lease payments
Rent payments due under operating leases are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease .  
The Company benefited from a rent-free period under the terms of its current property lease . In accordance with UITF 28 ‘Operating Lease 
Incentives’, the benefit is allocated over the shorter of the lease term and the date of the market rent review specified in the lease . During 
the rent-free period a rental charge has been recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and accrued as a liability in the Balance Sheet .
e) Retirement benefit costs
Contributions in respect of the Group’s defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the Profit and Loss Account as they fall due .
f) Employee Benefit Trust
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an Employee Benefit Trust these shares are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ 
equity . Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown as a reduction in the reconciliation of 
movements in shareholders’ funds . No gain or loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account or the Statement of Total Recognised  
Gains or Losses on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of these shares .
g) Other investments
Other quoted investments are designated as available for sale and re-valued each reporting period to their fair value according to the most 
recently available market information .

impairment loss of £718,000 was recognised on this investment in the Profit and Loss account during the year, reflecting the perceived permanent 
diminution of value of the underlying assets of the fund . This included the recycling of the accumulated loss on the revaluation reserve of £68,000

The Group established an Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) on 3 December 2010 to acquire ordinary shares in the Company to satisfy awards 
under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme (‘LTIS’) and other share-based payment schemes (note 29) . All finance and administration 
expenses connected with the Trust are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as and when they accrue .  
The Trust has waived its rights to dividends .
During the year, in respect of the scheme granted in October 2010, the Trust received instructions to exercise 95,215 (2014: 11,376) options . 
The cost of the shares released on exercise of these options amounted to £1,113,000 (2014: £109,000) . At 30 June 2015, the number  
of shares held by the Trust was 207,532 (2014: 249,696) with a market value of £3,668,000 (2014: £3,906,000), acquired for a total 
consideration of £2,803,000 (2014: £3,168,000) . These shares are presented as treasury shares in the Group financial statements and  
their cost is deducted from retained earnings within shareholders’ equity .
The Company has made annual awards under the LTIS to executive directors and other senior executives . The conditional awards,  
which vest three years after the grant date, are subject to the satisfaction of specified performance criteria, measured over a three  
year performance period . All such conditional awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee .

Explanatory notes to the  
Annual General Meeting resolutions 
Enclosed with this document is a notice 
convening the Annual General Meeting  
of the Company for 27 October 2015 . This 
explanatory note gives further information 
on the resolutions set out in the notice  
of annual general meeting .
Resolution 1 – Approval of the Report 
and Accounts
The directors propose that the Company’s 
annual accounts and reports of the directors 
and the auditors for the year ended 30 June 
2015 be received and considered .
Resolution 2 – Approval of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
While it is not a strict requirement for the 
Company, as a matter of good corporate 
governance the directors have decided to 
propose an ordinary resolution to approve 
the directors’ remuneration report for the 
year ended 30 June 2015 . The directors’ 
remuneration report can be found on pages 
11 to 17 of the Annual Report and Accounts . 
Resolution 3 – To declare a final dividend
The directors recommend a final dividend 
of 20 . 5 pence per ordinary share . Subject 
to approval by shareholders, the final 
dividend will be paid on 28 October  
2015 to shareholders on the register  
on 25 September 2015 . 
Resolutions 4 to 6 – To re-elect certain 
of the directors
The Company’s articles of association  
state that one third of the directors (or the 
nearest whole number closest to one third) 
must retire from office at each annual 
general meeting and offer themselves for 
re-election . In addition, any director who  
has been in office for more than three 
years since their last appointment or 
re-appointment should also retire and  
offer themselves for re-election . Andrew 
Shepherd, Nick Holmes and Simon 
Wombwell are therefore offering 
themselves for re-election on this basis . 
Information on each of the directors 
standing for re-election is set out below . 
The Board confirms that each of the 
directors offering themselves for re-election 
has extensive relevant experience of the 
group and its business . The Board is 
therefore of the opinion that all such 
persons should be re-elected to the Board .
Andrew Shepherd (42) is Deputy Chief 
Executive Officer for Brooks Macdonald 
Group . Andrew joined Brooks Macdonald 
Asset Management in 2002 as an 
investment manager . Since then he has 
been promoted to the role of Investment 
Director and then to joint Managing 
Director, before moving to his current  
role in August 2015 .
Nick Holmes (44) is Managing Director  
of Brooks Macdonald Asset Management 
and is responsible for day-to-day 
management .
Simon Wombwell (54) is Chief Executive 
Officer of Brooks Macdonald Funds which 
was launched in July 2011 . Simon has 
spent his entire career in the financial 
services industry, primarily involved in  
the development, sales and marketing  
of investment products and was a 
non-executive director of the Brooks 
Macdonald Group from 2002 until he  
was appointed as an executive director  
in a full time capacity in February 2011 .
A copy of each service contract is available 
for inspection at the registered office of 
the Company and will be available for 
inspection at the annual general meeting .
Resolution 7 – To re-appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
as auditors
This Resolution proposes that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP should  
be re-appointed as the Company’s auditors  
and authorises the directors to determine 
their remuneration .
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 prevents 
directors from allotting unissued shares 
without the authority of shareholders in 
general meeting . In certain circumstances 
this could be unduly restrictive . The directors’ 
existing authority to allot shares, which 
was granted at the annual general meeting 
held in 2014, will expire at the end of this 
year’s annual general meeting .
Resolution 8 in the notice of annual general 
meeting will be proposed, as an ordinary 
resolution, to authorise the directors to  
allot ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the 
capital of the Company up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £45,079 (i . e . up to 
4,507,900 ordinary shares) representing 
approximately 33% of the ordinary shares 
in issue on 16 September 2015 . The Company 
does not currently hold any shares in treasury . 
The authority conferred by this resolution 
will expire on the date which is fifteen 
months after the passing of this resolution 
or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s 
annual general meeting .
Resolution 9 – To disapply  
pre-emption rights
Unless they are given an appropriate 
authority by shareholders, if the directors 
wish to allot any of the unissued shares  
for cash or grant rights over shares or sell 
treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant 
to an employee share scheme) they must 
first offer them to existing shareholders  
in proportion to their existing holdings .  
This is known as pre-emption rights .
The existing disapplication of these 
statutory pre-emption rights, which was 
granted at the annual general meeting  
held in 2014, will expire at the end of this 
year’s annual general meeting . Accordingly, 
Resolution 9 in the notice of annual general 
meeting will be proposed, as a special 
resolution, to give the directors power  
to allot shares without the application   70  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015
of these statutory pre-emption rights: first,  
in relation to offers of equity securities by 
way of rights issue, open offer or similar 
arrangements; and second, in relation to 
the allotment of equity securities for cash 
up to a maximum aggregate nominal 
amount of £13,660 (i . e . up to 1,366,000 
ordinary shares) representing approximately 
10% of the ordinary shares in issue  
on 16 September 2015 . 
The authority sought and limits set by this 
resolution will also apply to a sale by the 
Company of any shares it holds as treasury 
shares . The Companies Act 2006 allows 
shares purchased by the Company out of 
distributable profits to be held as treasury 
shares, which may then be cancelled, sold 
for cash or used to meet the Company’s 
obligations under its employee share based 
incentive schemes . Any subsequent transfers 
of treasury shares by the Company to satisfy 
the requirements of employee share-based 
incentive schemes will be counted towards 
the anti-dilution limits for such share issues 
to the extent required by the Association  
of British Insurers guidelines .
The power conferred by this resolution  
will expire on the date which falls fifteen 
months after the passing of this resolution 
or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s 
annual general meeting .
Resolution 10 – Company’s authority 
to purchase its own shares
Resolution 10 in the notice of annual 
general meeting, which will be proposed 
as a special resolution, will authorise the 
Company to make market purchases of up 
to 1,366,000 ordinary shares . The existing 
authority to make market purchases of 
ordinary shares, which was granted at the 
annual general meeting held in 2014, will 
expire at the end of this year’s annual 
general meeting .
The number of ordinary shares stated in 
this resolution equals approximately 10% 
of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue 
on 16 September 2015 . The minimum 
price that may be paid is the nominal value 
of an ordinary share (i . e . 1 pence), and  
the maximum price shall not exceed 5% 
above the average of the middle market 
quotations for an ordinary share for the 
five business days before each purchase  
is made (exclusive of expenses) .
The authority conferred by this resolution 
will expire on the date which falls fifteen 
months after the passing of this resolution 
or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s 
annual general meeting .
The directors are committed to managing 
the Company’s capital effectively . 
Although the directors have no plans to 
make such purchases, buying back the 
Company’s ordinary shares is one of the 
options they keep under review . Purchases 
would only be made after considering  
the effect on earnings per share, and  
the benefits for shareholders generally .
The Company may hold in treasury any of 
its own shares that it purchases pursuant 
to the Companies Act 2006 and the 
authority conferred by this resolution . This 
would give the Company the ability to 
re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost 
effectively and would provide the 
Company with greater flexibility in the 
management of its capital base .

To resolve as an ordinary resolution:
8 .  That the directors be generally and 
unconditionally authorised pursuant to 
section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 
(the “Act”) to exercise all the powers of 
the Company to allot shares in the 
Company and to grant rights to 
subscribe for, or to convert any security 
into, shares in the Company (“Relevant

for a period expiring (unless previously 
revoked, varied or renewed) on the date 
which is fifteen months after the 
passing of this resolution or, if sooner, 
the end of the next annual general 
meeting of the Company . However,  
in each case the Company may,  
before such expiry, make an offer  
or agreement which would or might 
require Relevant Securities to be allotted

directors may allot Relevant Securities  
in pursuance of such offer or

  All previous unutilised authorities given

or rights to be granted on or after  
that date .
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
To resolve as a special resolution:
9 .  That, subject to the passing of 
resolution 8 above, the directors

allotment, provided that this power 
shall expire on the date which is 
fifteen months after the passing of this 
resolution or, if sooner, the end of the 
next annual general meeting of the 
Company . This power shall be limited 
to the allotment of equity securities:
 9 . 1  in connection with an offer 
of equity securities (including, 
without limitation, under a 
rights issue, open offer or 
similar arrangement) in favour 
of holders of ordinary shares 
in the capital of the Company 
in proportion (as nearly as may 
be practicable) to their existing 
holdings of ordinary shares  72  |  Brooks Macdonald Group  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2015

or other arrangements as

of any regulatory body or stock 
exchange; and 
 9 . 2  otherwise than pursuant to 
paragraph 9 . 1 up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £13,660; 
   but the Company may, before 
such expiry, make an offer or 
agreement which would or might 
require equity securities to be 
allotted after this power expires 
and the directors may allot equity 
securities in pursuance of such 
offer or agreement as if this 
power had not expired . 
   This power applies in relation 
to a sale of shares which is an 
allotment of equity securities 
by virtue of section 560(2)
(b) of the Act as if in the first 
paragraph of this resolution the 
words “pursuant to the authority 
conferred by resolution 8” were 
omitted .
   All previous unutilised powers 
given to the directors pursuant 
to sections 570 and 573 of the 
Act shall cease to have effect 
at the conclusion of this annual 
general meeting .
Company’s authority to purchase  
its own shares

authorised pursuant to section 701 
of the Act to make market purchases 
(within the meaning of section 693(4) 
of the Act) of its ordinary shares of 
£0 . 01 each on such terms and in 
such manner as the directors shall 
determine, provided that:
 10 . 1  the maximum number  
of ordinary shares hereby 
authorised to be purchased  
is 1,366,000;
 10 . 2  the maximum price which may 
be paid for each ordinary share

of expenses);
 10 . 3  the minimum price which may 
be paid for each ordinary share 
shall be £0 . 01; and
 10 . 4  this authority (unless previously 
revoked, varied or renewed)

is fifteen months after the 
passing of this resolution or,

Company, except in relation to

concluded before such date and 
which will or may be executed 
wholly or partly after such date .

or other authority (if any) under which 
it is signed or a notarially certified (or 
certified by a solicitor with a current

4 .  The return of a completed proxy form 
will not preclude a member from 
attending the annual general meeting 
and voting in person if he or she wishes 
to do so .
Record date
5 .  To be entitled to attend and vote at  
the annual general meeting (and for  
the purpose of the determination by  
the Company of the votes they may  
cast), members must be registered in  
the register of members of the Company  
at 6 . 00 pm on Sunday 25 October 2015 
(or, in the event of any adjournment, 
48 hours before the time of the  
adjourned meeting) . Changes to the

determining the right of any person  
to attend and vote at the meeting .

has the right to ask questions . The 
Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the 
business being dealt with at the

unduly with the preparation for the 
meeting or involve the disclosure of 
confidential information, (b) the answer 
has already been given on a website in 
the form of an answer to a question, 
or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of 
the Company or the good order of the

which may properly come before the meeting.
7.  The “vote withheld” option is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a “vote withheld” is not a vote in law and will not be counted

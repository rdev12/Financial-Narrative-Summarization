PARTNERSHIP
Companies in the Phoenix Group provide
managed IT infrastructure support services,
including systems management, communications,
remote telephone support, high-touch field
services, project and consultancy services and
business continuity.
Phoenix’s support services are increasingly sold and delivered
as a managed service. In addition to providing individual
support service solutions, Phoenix collaborates with Partners to
manage the End User’s entire IT infrastructure.

service solutions predominantly for the SME market, joined the
Phoenix Group enhancing both the portfolio of services and the
market reach of the Group.

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Phoenix Group companies understand the
importance of partnerships with customers,
Shareholders, staff, suppliers and the wider
environment in which they operate. The Group
provides a wide range of IT services through two
complementary routes to market: Phoenix IT
Services works exclusively with Partners to
provide the managed IT services solutions that
complement Partners’ own service offerings,
helping Partners win more business; NDR and
Servo provide their services predominantly
directly to the SME market.
A flexible approach to service delivery, tailored to the
requirements of both the Partner and the End User, enables
the Group to deliver services in four key ways:
THE PHOENIX APPROACH TO MANAGED IT SOLUTIONS
As a MANAGED SERVICE, where all or
part of the IT infrastructure of an End
User’s business is managed by Phoenix
in conjunction with a Partner.
As a SUBCONTRACT, where Phoenix
provides individual support services as part
of the range of services delivered by the
Partner to the End User.
As a DIRECT CONTRACT, where
specific services such as business
continuity and disaster recovery
services are delivered directly to End
User organisations.
As a FULLY OUTSOURCED SERVICE, where
a Partner transfers an entire service delivery
function to Phoenix, including the assets and people
necessary to provide the services across a wide
customer base.

Wipro is among the top 3 Offshore Information Technology
Service Providers in the world, with over 600 global clients
and in excess of 72,000 employees. Phoenix IT Services
and Wipro have formed a strategic partnership to deliver
onshore IT Services to some of Wipro’s UK-based
customers. This helps Wipro to deliver an even more
comprehensive range of Managed Services to its clients.
Phoenix IT Services provides support to Wipro in delivering
‘touch’ services to a growing number of its clients in the UK
which includes, for example, a leading Water Utility
company in the South of England.
Wipro is responsible for the overall engagement and service
provision and covers the 247 Service Desk, Datacenter
Support, Remote Infrastructure and Applications Management
Services. Phoenix complements Wipro’s core services by
delivering the onshore components of the Managed Service
contract providing deskside support, hardware maintenance,
IMAC, data centre hosting and disaster recovery services.
As a result of this strategic partnership with a non-
competitive partner, Wipro is able to deliver a more
complete service to their customers whilst still supporting
their offshore cost model.

the world's number one distributor of heating and plumbing
products to the professional market, and a leading supplier of
building materials and services. Wolseley UK trades as well-
known brands such as Plumb Center, Build Center and
Bathstore with 1,800 branches across the UK, four major
distribution centres and offices at Leamington Spa and Ripon.
After considerable research and planning Wolseley
UK signed a 3 year contract with NDR for Disaster
Recovery Services.
The contract includes many of NDR’s flexible recovery
options that enable the customer to choose the method of
recovery most appropriate for a disaster or failure at the time
it occurs, whether it be power failure to a computer room,
loss of access to premises, hardware failure or any potential
event. These options include mobile recovery units, off-load
of equipment to a customer location, remote connectivity or
relocation to an NDR business recovery centre.
This allows Wolseley UK to be the best prepared it can be
in the event of a disaster. It now has a backup plan that
enables the company to have the reassurance that whatever
occurs, it has the flexibility of a service that has the right
solution at the right time.

OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS CONTINUED
The Phoenix Group strategy is to enter into large outsourcing
contracts while developing niche services for niche markets.
STRATEGIC DIRECTION
STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS
AND BUILDING NEW PARTNER SECTORS: Phoenix is
focused on reinforcing and increasing the depth of its
relationships with key existing Partners, sustaining levels of
repeat revenues from contracts, and extending its portfolio
of contracts with existing Partners, together with developing
the breadth of Partner relationships.
EXPANDING THE RANGE OF
SERVICES: Phoenix continues to
pursue opportunities that offer high
levels of profitable recurring revenue.
Increasing the range of IT support
services in the Phoenix portfolio
enables the development of cross-
selling opportunities, enhancing
relationships with our Partners and
End Users.
THE SME MARKET: The acquisition of
Servo has added a significant business into
the Phoenix Group that is focused on
providing a wide range of IT solutions and
services to a large market of predominantly
small and medium sized organisations
previously not addressed by Phoenix.

With staff operating from its Head Office in Harrow, five
regional offices and 80 plus project sites in the UK, along
with nine mainland European offices and another 40
construction sites, Bovis Lend Lease needed to centralise its
corporate email by upgrading from Exchange 5.5 to
Exchange 2003 and manage the Head Office data lifecycle.
Bovis Lend Lease also faced a second issue of the
management of project information with a particular
requirement to ensure access and availability to
documentation at all times.
Servo’s solution focused on providing the centralised
infrastructure to enable Bovis Lend Lease to migrate existing
Microsoft Exchange 5.5 servers from their many construction
sites. The single high availability Exchange 2003 Cluster
with a Front End Outlook Web Access server farm has
greatly improved data security and significantly reduced
management overheads and complexity of maintaining
project sites and regional centres.
Servo also recommended file archiving technology to
migrate data automatically to lower cost storage in the first
instance and then to NAS storage as data access
requirements diminish. File retention is only maintained for
legal and compliance requirements.
Bovis Lend Lease has made considerable cost savings by
ensuring SAN technology is better utilised for critical data,
while taking advantage of lower cost storage for data that no
longer changes and is accessed less frequently.

PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
PETER BERTRAM
Chairman
“The Group took a major step forward with
the acquisition of Servo Computer Services
Limited in November 2006.”
REVIEW OF THE YEAR
I am pleased to report that 2007 was another
year of continued progress. The Group took a
major step forward with the acquisition of Servo
Computer Services Limited in November 2006.
Servo has greatly broadened the Group’s
customer base and markets served and the Board
is confident that this acquisition will contribute
significantly to the future growth of the Group.
Group revenues increased by 16.3% to
£126.7m (2006: £108.9m) and operating profit
before amortisation of acquired intangibles (see
page 28) increased by 6.0% to £22.7m (2006:
£21.4m). Profit from operations (after
amortisation of acquired intangibles) increased
by 6.8% to £20.7m (2006: £19.4m) and profit
before tax increased by 7.4% to £19.3m (2006:
£17.9m). The Group has continued to be highly
cash generative during the year with the free
cash flow
1
increasing by 8.4% to £23.6m
(2006: £21.7m).
Since the year end the Group has made a
recommended offer for ICM Computer
Group plc.
1
See page 13.
DIVIDEND
In view of the potential acquisition of ICM, the
Group declared a second interim dividend rather
than recommending a final dividend for the year
ended 31 March 2007. This dividend of 3.174p
per share was declared on 27 April 2007 and will
be paid on 15 June 2007 which, together with
the first interim dividend of 1.59p per share paid
on 2 February 2007, makes a total dividend for
the year to 31 March 2007 of 4.764p per share
(2006: 4.14p), an increase of 15.1%.
BOARD CHANGES
During the year we announced the appointment
of Jeremy Stafford as Chief Operating Officer.
Jeremy joined the Board on 24 April 2007 and
we are delighted to welcome him to the Group.
Jeremy’s experience in a range of senior
executive positions within BT will be of immense
value in the future development of the Group.
EMPLOYEES
We are fortunate to have a strong team of
talented and hardworking people in the Group
who have delivered the successful
performance achieved in the year and I thank
them all on behalf of the Board and the
Shareholders. I am also pleased to formally
welcome the management and staff of Servo to
Phoenix IT Group.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the
Group’s registered office, Technology House,
Hunsbury Hill Avenue, Northampton on
Wednesday, 22 August at 10.30 a.m. Formal
notice of this meeting and the necessary proxy
forms are enclosed with these financial
statements.
OUTLOOK
Market conditions and the performance of our
businesses since the year end are in line with
our expectations. The Board is confident that
the Group has the financial and commercial
base to continue its stated strategy of targeting
growth, both organically and by selective
acquisitions, as in the case of Servo. In
addition, the Board believes that the potential
acquisition of ICM would also create value for
Shareholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“In order to increase the added value we generate, we
are continually seeking to increase both the range and
the depth of the services provided to existing customers,
in addition to attracting new customers or addressing
new sectors of the IT services market.”
SUMMARY OF THE GROUP’S ACTIVITIES
As one of the UK’s leading IT service providers,
the Group provides a growing range of
complementary IT infrastructure support
services including systems management,
communications, remote telephone support,
high-touch field services, project and
consultancy services and business continuity
and disaster recovery services. Often these
services are sold and delivered as a managed
service where we manage complex IT
infrastructures to agreed levels of service under
long-term contracts.
The Group differentiates itself by focusing on
niche customer groups and niche markets.
Phoenix IT Services specialises in supporting
major IT services organisations (‘Partners’) in
support of their customers (‘End Users’). This
strategy allows Phoenix IT Services to access
the largest proportion of spending on IT
Services in the UK which we believe could not
be achieved as efficiently by selling direct to the
largest End Users. Servo sells a similar portfolio
of IT services predominately to the small and
medium size enterprise (‘SME’) market, which is
considered to be the fastest growing area of IT
services in the UK. NDR operates in the
business continuity market, which continues to
grow strongly as a result of increased
awareness of terrorism and disaster risks to
commercial centres following events such as
the 2005 London terrorist attacks and the
Buncefield fuel depot explosion, together with
increased awareness of the need for improved
corporate risk management and demands from
insurers.
In order to increase the added value we
generate, we are continually seeking to increase
both the range and the depth of the services
provided to existing customers, in addition to
attracting new customers or addressing new
sectors of the IT services market. This
continuous development of new services has
been one of our key differentiators and success
factors historically and we believe it will
continue to be so in the future.
Alongside large outsourcing contracts, the
Group’s strategy is to develop niche services,
commanding high margins, and to sell these
services into niche markets, a strategy that is
proving successful. The large and growing
UK market offers significant opportunities for
the Group and the Board believes that a
continuing focus on the UK for the foreseeable
future will best maximise the growth potential
of the Group.
PHOENIX IT SERVICES
The underlying performance of the Group’s UK
‘Partner’ business has been encouraging. Despite
the ongoing effect of two significant changes to
contract revenue during the year, the order book
grew strongly year-on-year to £152.7m
representing an 18.9% increase from 2006 and
the annual contract value increased by 8.1% to
£77.1m. Phoenix IT Services won new contracts
throughout the year with significant contract
awards from a wide range of Partners, including
our portfolio of offshore service provider Partners.
It is particularly pleasing to be able to report that
new contracts with key mid-range equipment
vendors were won during the year with one
transferring 96 engineers under TUPE to Phoenix
IT Services, thereby outsourcing its entire field
engineering function. We have continued to
expand in the growing area of Voice over Internet
Protocol Telephony (VoIP), and have entered into
contracts with Partners to provide VoIP-related
services to two major UK organisations. Also, for
the first time, contracts were won supporting
complete data centres. The business continues to
develop its service offerings in these areas.
Service delivery quality remained consistently
high at 98%, providing a solid platform for
growth. Phoenix IT Services became one of
the first businesses in the UK to be accredited
to the new ISO 20000 standard: IT Service
Management Specification. ISO 20000 is an
integrated framework for delivering and
managing IT services to the customer. The

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007

standard is based on the best practice of the
IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the
accreditation is an important platform for the
ongoing maintenance of the high service
standards.
Our small French operation, which focuses on
IT industry partners and the mid-range
equipment areas, has continued to develop over
the period and is both modestly profitable and
cash generative.
NDR
NDR provides consultancy advice, real time data
backup, office and mobile facilities, computer
equipment and support for customers in case of
disaster or major business interruption. NDR
has performed very strongly since its
acquisition in 2005. During the year the
business has successfully developed a strategy
for targeting larger opportunities in addition to
the SME market where it already has an
excellent reputation, resulting in an increase in
the average contract value of new business
wins and a major three-year contract with a
FTSE 100 company. To support this growth and
facilitate further expansion, NDR has made a
number of infrastructure investments during the
year including a new East Midlands disaster
recovery (DR) facility utilising available space in
an existing Phoenix building, the doubling in
size of the City of London DR facility and the
commissioning of a new mobile unit, enabling
service to be provided to the more remote parts
of the UK.
SERVO
Servo was acquired in November 2006 to
enable the Group to sell IT services to the fast
growing SME market. Since acquisition the
management team of this business has been
strengthened by the appointment of a new
Finance Director and a new Sales & Marketing
Director. Servo continues to evolve away from
product sales to services, which accounted for
48% of revenues in the year ended 31 March
2006, and 53% in the year ended 31 March
2007. Servo has met our expectations to date.
RECOMMENDED OFFER FOR ICM
Since the year end the Group has made a
recommended offer for ICM Computer Group plc.
We believe there is a strong strategic logic for
the combination of Phoenix and ICM. In
particular, given the complementary nature of
disaster recovery, business continuity and IT
solutions and support services, we believe that
the combination and integration of the two
businesses will provide the potential to exploit a
significant opportunity in the market for the
provision of IT support and disaster recovery
services. We already have significant experience
in growing the Group both organically and
through acquisition and believe that the
acquisition of ICM will be earnings enhancing
(before amortisation of intangible assets and
one-off integration costs) in the first full
financial year following completion of the
acquisition.
1
As described in the Offer Document posted to
ICM Shareholders on 27 April 2007, the First
Closing Date of the Offer is 3.00 p.m. on
25 May 2007 and an Extraordinary General
Meeting will be held at which approval will be
sought from Phoenix Shareholders for, among
other things, the acquisition. The Extraordinary
General Meeting will be held at 9.00 a.m. on
25 May 2007 at the offices of UBS Limited at
1 Finsbury Avenue, London EC2M 2PP.

This statement regarding earnings enhancement does not constitute a profit forecast nor should it
be interpreted to mean that earnings per share of Phoenix for the current or future years will
necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings per share of Phoenix or ICM.

FINANCIAL REVIEW

13508 18/07/2007 Proof 7
PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
GROUP RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The acquisition of Servo Computer Services
Limited was completed on 3 November 2006
for a total consideration, excluding acquisition
costs of £0.6m, of £30.25m consisting of
£28.0m gross (£25.8m net of cash acquired) in
cash and the issue of 708,103 ordinary shares
in the share capital of Phoenix IT Group plc.
Accordingly, five months’ results from the Servo
business are included in these financial
statements.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS
The Group regards its profit and cash
generation as the most appropriate measures of
its financial performance.
The 2007 results represent another positive year
for the Group. Taking into account the Servo
acquisition, revenues, profit before tax and cash
generation were all at their highest ever levels.
This performance was achieved in an
environment of competitive market conditions,
particularly in the increasingly commoditised
desktop services and networks services markets
where our customers naturally demand the
maintenance of our high service standards
together with market competitive pricing.
REVENUE AND PROFITS
Revenues increased by 16.3% to £126.7m
(2006: £108.9m). Adjusting for the effect of the
acquisition of Servo, the like-for-like increase
was 1.3%.
Phoenix IT Services revenues declined by 1.5%
to £91.5m (2006: £92.9m) as a result of the
increased commoditisation of certain service
lines and the ongoing effect of the two
significant changes in contract revenue
compared to the previous financial year.
However, it is encouraging to be able to report
that the underlying revenues generated by our
UK Partner model business (excluding the effect
of these two significant changes) increased by
9.5% to £79.9m (2006: £73.0m) and that the
forward order book for this business increased
by 18.9% to £152.7m (2006: £128.5m) giving a
strong platform for sustainable growth.
NDR, our business continuity and disaster
recovery business, grew strongly in what
continues to be a buoyant and growing market.
NDR contributed £18.8m of revenues, an
increase of 17.5% on the 2006 revenues of
£16.0m for the period 19 April 2005 to
31 March 2006.
After share option charges of £0.8m (2006:
£0.6m), profit from operations before
amortisation of acquired intangibles increased
by 6.0% to £22.7m (2006: £21.4m). This
includes £1.7m contributed by Servo in the five
months since acquisition. Adjusting for the
effect of the Servo acquisition the like-for-like
profit from operations before amortisation of
acquired intangibles was comparable to that
achieved in the prior year, with strong profit
growth in NDR being offset by declines in the
Phoenix businesses.
Group operating profit margins have remained
strong in a competitive market for IT services.
Group operating profit margin before amortisation
of acquired intangibles reduced to 17.9% (2006:
19.6%) primarily because of the lower operating
margins of Servo compared to the rest of the
Group. Servo’s 10.4% operating margin reflects
the relatively high proportion of low margin
product sales required within the often composite
product and higher margin IT services sales to
the predominately mid-tier market that it serves.
Profit from operations increased by 6.8% to
£20.7m (2006: £19.4m). In accordance with the
requirements of IFRS 3: Business Combinations,
customer relationships intangible assets arising
on both the NDR and Servo acquisitions have
been identified out of the total goodwill arising
on each acquisition. A valuation of £2.1m has
been attributed to the value of the Servo
customer relationships intangible asset,
resulting in an additional £0.4m amortisation
charge in the period.
Profit before tax increased by 7.4% to £19.3m
(2006: £17.9m).
INVESTMENT INCOME AND FINANCE COSTS
Although the Group arranged an additional five-
year term loan for £15.0m immediately prior to
the acquisition of Servo, the strong cash
generation of the Group resulted in the net
financing costs being maintained at £1.4m.
Interest charges on borrowings and overdrafts
totalled £1.3m for the year (2006: £1.4m), and
other finance costs, relating primarily to finance
leases for computer equipment, were £0.4m
(2006: £0.3m). The Group places surplus cash
on deposit as appropriate in order to maximise
the short-term return on cash balances which
generated investment income of £0.2m in the
year (2006: £0.2m).
TAXATION
The effective tax rate for the year was 28.7%
(2006: 29.9%) of profit before tax. The
decrease in the effective tax rate was due
mainly to non-recurring adjustments to prior
year charges, in particular a release of a tax
provision previously held in relation to
exposures now resolved.

BALANCE SHEET
The significant changes to the Group balance
sheet arise as a result of the acquisition of
Servo. A full analysis of the book and
provisional fair values of the identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired is given in note 27 to the
consolidated financial statements.
CASH FLOW
Strong control is exercised over the Group’s
working capital and the conversion of profit into
cash. Consequently, the Group continued to be
highly cash generative. Cash generated by
operations was up 15.9% to £31.0m

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
16
13508 18/07/2007 Proof 7
PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
The Directors present their report together
with the audited financial statements for the
Group and the Company for the year ended
31 March 2007.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY AND REVIEW OF
THE BUSINESS
The Group’s principal activity is the provision of
information technology and business continuity
services. A review of the Group’s performance
and future prospects is provided in the Chief
Executive’s Review and the Financial Review.
DIVIDENDS
A second interim dividend of 3.174p per share
was declared on 27 April 2007 and will be paid
on 15 June 2007 which together with the
interim dividend of 1.59p per share paid on
2 February 2007 made a total dividend for the
year to March 2007 of 4.764p (2006: 4.14p),
an increase of 15.1%.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
There are a number of potential risks and
uncertainties which could have an adverse
impact on the Group’s long-term performance.
However, there are sufficient systems in place
to monitor and control these issues so that they
can be appropriately addressed if they arise.
COMPETITOR RISK
The IT services industry is highly competitive.
Several competitors, including in some cases,
Phoenix’s Partners, have longer operating
histories, higher brand recognition, greater
financial, technical, marketing, personnel and
other resources and a larger established base of
Partners than the Group. The Group’s
competitors have, and other potential
competitors may have, well-established
relationships and current and potential partners
of the Group. As a result, these competitors
may be able to respond more quickly to new or
emerging technology and changes in Partner
requirements, or to devote greater resources to
the development, promotion and sale of their
services, than the Group. In addition, the Group
may experience increased competition from low
cost outsourcing centres, including offshore
centres, and new or existing niche market
participants whose costs, particularly for labour
and for service desk may be lower. Increased
competition could lead to the loss of market
share, loss of material contracts, renegotiation
of price levels or a general reduction in
turnover of the Group.
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS
The section of Phoenix’s business comprised in
Phoenix IT Services has, and is likely to
continue to have, a high degree of reliance on a
limited number of Partners. In any particular
year, a small number of Partners may account
for a majority proportion of turnover. Loss of
turnover from any one of these Partners (either
as a result of external factors such as the
economic environment or other factors such as
performance on contracts or a breakdown of a
Partner relationship) could substantially reduce
the industry credentials Phoenix has in its
markets and its ability to attract new Partners
or retain existing Partners and may adversely
affect Phoenix’s business, results of operations
or financial condition.
If Phoenix’s Partners decide to integrate
vertically, or if Partners consolidate operations
with each other rather than using outsourcing
firms to provide services, Phoenix’s business,
results of operations or financial condition
would be materially adversely affected.
Many of the large, managed service contracts
permit the Partner to terminate the contract
with Phoenix if the contract between the Partner
and the End User has been terminated, which is
beyond Phoenix’s control. Although in most
cases the managed service contracts allow for
payment of early termination fees to Phoenix
which are intended to compensate it for costs
incurred as a result of termination, not all the
contracts compensate Phoenix for profit it
would have received if the contract had not
been terminated. In general, support service
contracts are renewable annually and are
typically terminable by the Partner without
cause, upon short notice periods and without
termination fees.
In addition, Phoenix has derived, and believes it
will continue to derive, the majority of its
turnover in any given year from a limited
number of large contracts. In addition, at any
given time, other contracts are the subject of
ongoing negotiations or amendments regarding
the scope of work to be performed and price. If
these or other contracts are not renewed or are
terminated (including as a result of external
factors such as the Partner’s or End User’s
decision to in-source the services rather than
using outsourcing firms) or if contract
negotiations, amendments or documentation are
not satisfactorily resolved and if Phoenix is not
able to replace lost turnover with new contracts
in a timely manner, Phoenix’s business, results
of operations or financial condition could be
materially adversely affected.
ACQUISITION RISK
The Group is an active acquirer. Acquisitions
can involve risks that might have a material
impact on the Group. Although these risks are
usually mitigated by extensive due diligence
and, where practical, by contractual
representations, warranties and indemnities
from the vendors, there is nevertheless a risk
that a poorly judged or unsuccessful acquisition
could have an adverse effect on the Group.
TECHNOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY CHANGE
Any significant change in the technology or
regulatory environment affecting the markets in
which the Group operates could have an adverse
effect on the Group’s financial performance.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
FINANCIAL KPIs
TURNOVER
Our aim is to increase turnover each year
through a combination of price and volume
growth, organic expansion and acquisitions. For
the year ended 31 March 2007, Group revenues
increased by 16.3% to £126.7m (2006:
£108.9m). Organic growth, excluding the effect
of acquisitions, contributed 1.3%.
OPERATING MARGIN
This represents the Group’s profit from
operations before amortisation of acquired
intangibles divided by Group turnover. For the
year ended 31 March 2007, Group operating
profit margin was 17.9% a reduction on the
prior year margin which was 19.6%. This
reduction was primarily due to the lower
operating profit margins of Servo compared to
the rest of the Group.

Company and its future. Management and
professional and technical expertise are the
Group’s major assets. Investment in developing

of in-house and external training programmes.
The Board recognises the value of effective
communication and consultation with all

and policies of the Group. This is achieved
through formal and informal meetings, briefing
groups and internal newsletters.
It is the Group’s policy to encourage the
recruitment, training and development of
disabled persons on the basis of their aptitude
and ability, and the retention and retraining of
employees who become disabled.
Consistent with the Group’s human resources
policies, the Board encourages staff to identify
with the financial success of the business
through the opportunity to acquire Ordinary
Shares. Staff can participate in the financial
prosperity of the Group through share
ownership. Employee incentive arrangements
include a Performance Share Plan, Share Option
Schemes, and Share Incentive Plan.

PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS
The Group’s operating companies determine
terms and conditions of payment for the supply
of capital and revenue items by agreement with
suppliers. Payment is then made on these
terms, subject to the terms and conditions being
met by the suppliers. As at 31 March 2007,
trade creditors of the Group were equivalent to
41 days (2006: 41 days) and in the Company nil
(2006: nil).
CHARITABLE DONATIONS
The total amount of charitable donations made
during the year was £26,084 (2006: £13,006).
There were no political donations.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have considered detailed profit
and cash flow forecasts and have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate
resources to continue as an operational
business for the foreseeable future. The financial
statements have therefore been prepared on a
going concern basis.
AUDITORS
An ordinary resolution to reappoint Deloitte &
Touche LLP as auditors of the Company is to be
submitted to the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report
and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have elected to
prepare the Group financial statements under
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and
the parent company financial statements under
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards
and applicable law). The financial statements are
also required by law to be properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that
IFRS financial statements present fairly for each
financial year the Company’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects
of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the definitions and recognition
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses
set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and
presentation of financial statements’. In virtually
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be
achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs.
However, Directors are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting
policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
reliable, comparable and understandable
information;
 provide additional disclosures when
compliance with the specific requirements in
IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular
transactions, other events and conditions on
the entity’s financial position and financial
performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
The parent company financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing
these financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the
parent company financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and
financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
Each of the persons who is a Director at the
date of approval of this report confirms that:
(1) so far as the Director is aware, there is
no relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(2) the Director has taken all the steps that
he ought to have taken as a Director in
order to make himself aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish
that the Company’s auditors are aware of
that information.
This confirmation is given and should be
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of
s234ZA of the Companies Act 1985.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting to be
held on 22 August 2007 (together with
explanatory notes) is sent to Shareholders with
this annual report. The special business of the
meeting includes the following resolutions:
AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES
(RESOLUTION 6)
The Directors are seeking authority under
Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (‘the
Act’) to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal
value of £200,908. This amount represents
approximately one-third of the Company’s issued
share capital as at 18 May 2007. The authority
will be in substitution for the previous authority
taken at last year’s Annual General Meeting and
will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the
next Annual General Meeting or 22 November
2008.
The Directors have no present intention to make
any such issue of shares under this authority,
other than in respect of shares that may be
issued pursuant to the Company’s share option
schemes, but consider it is desirable for them to
be given this opportunity by Shareholders.
The allotment of shares relating to the
Company’s recommended offer for ICM

PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
13508 18/07/2007 Proof 7
Computer Group plc will be allotted pursuant
to the resolution proposed at the Extraordinary
General meeting of the Company held on
25 May 2007.
As at 18 May 2007, the Company held no
treasury shares.
DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS
(RESOLUTION 7)
The Directors are seeking authority from
Shareholders to allot Ordinary Shares for cash
other than on a pre-emptive basis (as required
by Section 89 of the Act) in limited
circumstances. The Directors recommend that
Section 89 of the Act should not apply to any
allotment of shares in connection with a rights
issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer in
favour of ordinary Shareholders in accordance
with normal practice in the UK, nor to an issue
for cash of shares up to an aggregate nominal
value of £30,136 which is equivalent to 5% of
the Company’s issued share capital as at 18 May
2007. The authority sought will expire on the
earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting or 22 November 2008.
AUTHORITY TO MAKE MARKET PURCHASES OF
SHARES (RESOLUTION 8)
The Directors are seeking authority to make
market purchases of up to 3,013,624 ordinary
shares which is equivalent to 5% of the
Company’s issued share capital as at 18 May
2007 on such terms and in such manner as the
Directors may determine, provided that the
amount paid for each share (exclusive of
expenses) will not be more than 5% above the
average middle market quotation for Ordinary
shares as derived from the Daily Official List of
the London Stock Exchange plc for the five
business days before the date on which the
contract for the purchase is made and in any
event not less than 1p per ordinary share. The
authority sought will expire on the earlier of the
conclusion of the next annual General Meeting
or 22 November 2008.
The Directors have no present intention to make
any such market purchases but consider it is
desirable for them to be given this opportunity
by Shareholders. The authority will only be
exercised if to do so would result in an increase
in earnings per share and is in the best interests
of Shareholders generally.
As at 18 May 2007, there were a total of
2,206,576 options to subscribe for equity shares
in the Company outstanding, representing 3.7% of
the Company’s issued share capital. If the full
authority sought by this resolution is used, this
number of outstanding options would represent
3.5% of the Company’s issued share capital.
AUTHORITIES REGARDING ELECTRONIC
COMMUNICATIONS (RESOLUTIONS 9 AND 10)
With effect from 20 January 2007, new
companies legislation, which is set out in the
Companies Act 2006, was introduced to facilitate
electronic communications between companies
and their Shareholders. The principal change to
previous legislation in relation to electronic
communications is that a company is now able to
send or supply documents or information to its
Shareholders in electronic form (for example, by
email) or by means of a website provided that
each member has been asked individually by the
company to agree to such method of
communication and the company has not
received a negative response within 28 days of
such a request being made. Resolution 10
proposes that the Company amends its existing
articles of association to allow the Company to
take advantage of the provisions of the
Companies Act 2006 relating to electronic
communication. Details of the proposed
amendments are attached to the Notice of Annual
General Meeting. Resolution 9 seeks general
authority from Shareholders to take advantage of
the new legislation as regards electronic
communications. Shareholders should note that
even where Resolution 9 is passed they will
remain entitled to elect to receive notices and
certain other documents and information from the
Company in hard copy format.
A separate letter, accompanying the Company’s
2007 Report and Accounts, is being sent to
Shareholders giving further details of the
Company’s proposals as regards electronic
communications which all Shareholders are
urged to read.
AMENDMENT TO ARTICLES REGARDING
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION (RESOLUTION 11)
Article 72 of the existing articles of association
of the Company permits the Directors to
determine the ordinary remuneration of a
Director provided that such remuneration shall
not exceed £200,000 per annum or such higher
amount as may from time to time be
determined by ordinary resolution of the
Company. The Board, including the
Remuneration Committee, consider that it is in
the best interests of the Company to have
greater flexibility on determining the level of
ordinary remuneration of Directors and therefore
Resolution 11 seeks the amendment of
Article 72.
The Board of the Company recommends that
ordinary Shareholders vote in favour of the
resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting and is of the opinion that they are in the
best interests of security holders as a whole.
By order of the Board.

PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
The Directors consider that throughout the year
ended 31 March 2007 the Company has been in
compliance with the provisions set out in
Section 1 of the revised Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial
Reporting Council in July 2003. The application
of the principles of the Code, in the composition
and operation of the Board, the remuneration of
the Directors, relations with Shareholders and
procedures for financial reporting and internal
control are described below.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Group is controlled by a Board of Directors
which meets regularly and currently comprises
three Executive and three Non-Executive
Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are Peter
Bertram who is Chairman, John Sussens who is
the Senior Independent Director and Brian
Sellwood, all of whom are considered by the
Board to be independent of management and
free from any business or other relationship
which could materially interfere with the exercise
of their independent judgement. The Non-
Executive Directors regularly meet independently
of management.
The Chairman’s other main commitments are
disclosed on page 14. The roles of Chairman
and Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman
is responsible for leadership of the Board,
ensuring its effectiveness and setting its agenda.
In advance of each meeting the Directors are
provided with or have full and timely access to
information in relation to the matters to be
discussed.
At Board meetings, the Directors receive
presentations from the senior executives on the
implementation of the Company’s strategies and
the Board receives regular updates on changes to
the business, legislative and regulatory
environments.
The Board is responsible to Shareholders for the
proper management of the Group and for its
system of corporate governance. It receives
information on a monthly basis to enable it to
review trading performance, forecasts and
strategy and it has a schedule of matters
specifically reserved for its decision. The most
significant of these are:
 Changes to the structure, size and
composition of the Board;
 Consideration of the independence of Non-
Executive Directors;
 Review of management structure and senior
management responsibilities;
 With the assistance of the Remuneration
Committee, approval of remuneration policies
across the Group;
 Approval of strategic plans, profit plans and
budgets and any material changes to them;
 Oversight of the Group’s operations ensuring
competent and prudent management, sound
planning, an adequate system of internal
control and adequate accounting and other
records;
 Final approval of annual accounts and
accounting policies;
 Approval of the dividend policy;
 Approval of the acquisition or disposal of
subsidiaries and major investments and
capital projects;
 Delegation of the Board’s powers and
authorities, including the division of
responsibilities between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive and other Executive Directors;
and
 Receiving reports on the views of the
Company’s Shareholders.
Operational management of the Group is delegated
to the Chief Executive, the Chief Operating Officer
and the Group Finance Director.
Procedures exist to allow the Directors to seek
independent legal advice in respect of their
duties at the Company’s expense where the
circumstances are appropriate. All Directors
have access to the Company Secretary who is a
qualified Solicitor.
All Directors are required to submit themselves
for re-election at regular intervals and at least
every three years.
During the year the Board undertook an
evaluation of its performance and that of its
committees. Detailed questionnaires were used
for the performance evaluation process. The
Board concluded that overall the Board and its
committees operated effectively. The
performance of each of the Directors was
evaluated while the Senior Independent Director
evaluated the performance of the Chairman.
The Board considered that the evaluation
process was satisfactory and that the use of an
external third party to assist in such evaluation
was not necessary.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The following formally constituted Committees
deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs
in accordance with their written terms of
reference, which have been reviewed in the light
of the Combined Code and are available on
request and on the Group’s website. The
Company Secretary also acts as secretary to
each Committee.
The Audit Committee’s purpose is to assist the
Board in the discharge of its responsibilities for
financial reporting and corporate control and to
provide a forum for reporting by the external
auditors. The Committee, chaired by Brian
Sellwood, comprises the Non-Executive Directors
and meets at least three times a year.
A report on its activities is given on page 23.
The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired
by John Sussens and comprises the Non-
Executive Directors, meets at least twice a year
and additionally as required. It is responsible for
reviewing remuneration arrangements for
members of the Board, and all senior reports of
the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director,
for providing general guidance on aspects of
remuneration policy throughout the Group and
for the Group’s Share Incentive Plans. New
Bridge Street Consultants have been appointed
by the Group to assist and advise the
Remuneration Committee in the performance of
its duties. New Bridge Street Consultants do not
provide any other service to the Group and are
independent of the Group’s auditors.
A report on its activities is given on pages
24 to 26.
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Peter
Bertram and comprises the Non-Executive
Directors. The Committee is responsible for
effective succession planning and proposes
candidates to the Board, having regard to the
balance and structure of the Board. The
Committee determines the terms of reference of
new appointments and uses external advisers to
identify suitable candidates. The process is for
the Committee to interview each candidate with
a view to preparing a shortlist for the Board, for

further interviews to take place as appropriate
and for the Chairman to consult with the Chief
Executive and any external advisers before any
appointment is made.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for establishing and
maintaining the Group’s system of internal
control. Internal control systems are designed to
meet the particular needs of the Group and the
risks to which it is exposed. By their nature,
however, internal control systems are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the internal control system are
described below. These have all been in place
throughout the year and up to the date of this
report and are considered and monitored regularly
by the Board (and once during the year):
 Ongoing procedures to identify, evaluate and
manage significant risks faced by the
business in accordance with the guidance of
the Turnbull Committee on Internal Controls
and procedures to monitor the control
systems in place to reduce these risks to an
acceptable level;
 Clearly defined management structure and
delegation of authority to Committees of the
Board and the Executive Directors;
 Clearly documented internal procedures set
out in the Group’s ISO 9001 accredited
quality manual;
 High recruitment standards and formal career
development and training to ensure the
integrity and competence of staff;
 Regular and comprehensive information
provided to management, covering financial
performance and key performance indicators,
including non-financial measures;
 A detailed budgeting process covering
budgets for the coming year which are
approved by the Board;
 Procedures for the approval of capital
expenditure, investments and acquisitions;
 Monthly monitoring and reforecasting of
results against budget, with major variances
followed up and management action taken
where appropriate;
 Regular internal audits of key processes and
procedures under the Group’s ISO 9001
accredited quality assurance process; and
 Formal consideration of progress made
against significant business risks at monthly
Operating Board meetings, with quarterly
briefings to the Board.
Each year the Audit Committee and the Group
Finance Director formally review the need for an
internal audit function. At the current time a
formal internal audit function is not considered
necessary for a number of reasons: the small
size of the Group; the internal controls currently
in place; the relative simplicity of the nature and
type of transactions entered into by the Group;
and the significant executive involvement in the
Group’s day-to-day business. The Board, with
the assistance of the Audit Committee, is
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of
the Group’s systems of internal control. During
the year, the Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the systems of internal control
and risk management based on a review of
significant risks identified and the results of
quality and other reports from management.
Following the review the Board concluded that
the systems were satisfactory and in accordance
with the Turnbull guidance. The Board seeks to
ensure that steps continue to be taken to try to
embed internal control and risk management
further into the operations of the Group’s
business and to deal with any areas of
improvement which come to its attention.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Company has a formal policy designed to
ensure that the auditors’ independence is not
compromised by their undertaking inappropriate
non-audit work. All significant non-audit work
commissioned from the external auditors
requires the Audit Committee’s formal approval.
The external auditors are only selected to
undertake non-audit work where the nature of
the advice makes it more timely and cost-
effective to select advisers who already have a
good understanding of the Group.
The Audit Committee has undertaken a review of
the nature and amount of non-audit work
undertaken by the external auditors to satisfy
itself that there is no effect on their
independence. The split between audit and non-
audit fees is shown in Note 5 to the
consolidated financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future, a period of
not less that twelve months from the date of
this report. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
COMMUNICATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company values the views of Shareholders
and recognises their interests in the Group’s
strategy and performance. It holds briefings with
institutional fund managers, analysts and other
investors, primarily following the announcement
of interim and preliminary results, as well as at
other times during the year as may be
appropriate. The Company’s programme of
investor relations activities is designed to ensure
that the investing community receives a
balanced and consistent view of the Group’s
performance. All Shareholders are welcome to
attend the Annual General Meeting, at which the
Board of Directors will be available to answer
questions from Shareholders.
Code Provision D.1.1 requires the Senior Non-
Executive Director to meet with major
Shareholders. During the year, this requirement
has been undertaken by the Chairman, who has
met with a range of major Shareholders to
discuss governance and strategy. The Senior
Non-Executive Director has been available for all
such meetings if requested. The views of major
Shareholders are communicated to the Board as
a whole by the Chairman. In addition, the Board
receives reports from the Company’s broker
twice a year that communicate feedback from
major Shareholders. The Board also reviews
analyst coverage of the Company every month.
ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS
The numbers of Board meetings and Committee
meetings attended by each Director in the year
to 31 March 2007 were as follows:

13508 18/07/2007 Proof 7
PHOENIX IT GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises the
Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by John
Sussens.
The Committee determines the remuneration
packages of the Executive Directors and their
senior direct reports and makes
recommendations thereon to the Board within
agreed terms of reference.
The Remuneration Committee has access to
executive remuneration consultants, New Bridge
Street Consultants, to assess comparability to
the IT services marketplace and in particular the
remuneration policies of the Group’s peer
companies.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The policy of the Group on Directors’
remuneration is to provide competitive market-
based packages which reward Group and
individual performance and align the interests of
Directors and Shareholders. Remuneration
packages comprise a basic salary, annual
performance related bonus, pensions and other
benefits and, where appropriate, participation in
the share incentive plans set out below. Salaries
and bonuses are reviewed annually and any
other changes effected from 1 April.
The Group introduced a number of share
incentive schemes on flotation, of which all
members of staff, including the Executive
Directors, are potential beneficiaries. These
include an Employee Share Option Scheme, a
Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior
managers and an All-Employee Share Incentive
Plan (SIP). Since flotation, no further awards
have been granted under the Group’s pre-
flotation share schemes.
The Board determines the remuneration of the
Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors.
Directors are not involved in decisions about
their own remuneration.
Individual components of remuneration packages
and service contracts are discussed below.
BASIC SALARY
Basic salary for each Executive Director is based
on externally benchmarked market data for
comparable companies operating in IT services,
experience and achievement of objectives. In
addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors
receive certain benefits such as a company car
(or equivalent allowance) and private medical
insurance.
The salaries of the Executive Directors who
served during the year (and Jeremy Stafford
who was appointed on 24 April 2007) are given
on page 25. Nick Robinson, David Simpson and
Jeremy Stafford have service agreements
subject to a twelve-month notice period and
include the right for the Company to make a
payment in lieu of salary and benefits for any
unexpired period of notice.
Details of the dates of appointment of Directors
appointed during the year and contract terms
are given in the Directors’ Report on page 17.
PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUSES
For Executive Directors, amounts available for
bonuses are based on financial performance
targets defined and agreed by the Remuneration
Committee.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 the target for
the payment of the maximum bonuses for the
Executive Directors was to increase profit to
£22.9m before tax, pre-share scheme charges
and amortisation of acquired intangibles. This
target included the acquisition of Servo. The
actual profit before tax, pre-share scheme
charges and amortisation of acquired intangibles
was £22.1m.
The bonuses earned for the year ended
31 March 2007 were £nil for Nick Robinson and
£nil for David Simpson.
The maximum potential bonus levels for the
year ending 31 March 2008 are capped at 100%
of basic salary for Nick Robinson, 50% of basic
salary for David Simpson and at 100% of basic
salary for Jeremy Stafford.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
The Executive Directors are also entitled to
receive personal pension contributions of 20%
of basic salary for Nick Robinson, 10% for
David Simpson and 20% for Jeremy Stafford.
SHARE INCENTIVES
The Group’s policy is to award share incentives
to Executive Directors in order to align their
interests with those of the Company’s
Shareholders. The Executive Directors have
participated in the Performance Share Plan
during the financial year. The performance
conditions were selected after consulting
independent share incentive advisers.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
During the year the Company granted awards
over 681,276 shares under the PSP. Nick
Robinson was granted awards over 184,211
shares and David Simpson was granted 61,404.
The awards will vest fully if the Group’s average
annual earnings per share growth over the three
years from grant (measured by reference to EPS
in the year immediately prior to grant) exceeds
20% per annum. If the average annual growth is
5% per annum, the award will vest as to 20%
of the maximum. If average annual earnings per
share grow between 5% and 20%, then the
award will vest on a progressive scale. The
award will not vest at all if average earnings per
share growth is less than 5% per annum.
SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN (SIP)
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are
able to buy shares by deduction of up to £1,500
from their pre-tax salary in each tax year or, if
less, 10% of salary.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the Group financial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of Phoenix IT Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise
the consolidated statement of income, the
consolidated statement of changes in Shareholders’
equity, the consolidated balance sheet, the
consolidated cash flow statement and the related
Notes 1 to 35. These financial statements have
been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the individual
Company financial statements of Phoenix IT
Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s
members, as a body, in accordance with section
235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors’ report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company
and the Company’s members, as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the
annual report, the Directors’ Remuneration
Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom
legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view in
accordance with the relevant financial reporting
framework and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report described as having been audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We report to you whether in our
opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the Group financial
statements. We also report to you if the
Company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Company has not complied with any of the four
Directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of
the Financial Services Authority. These comprise
the amount of each element in the remuneration
package and information on share options,
details of long-term incentive schemes, and
money purchase and defined benefit schemes.
We give a statement, to the extent possible, of
details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance
statement reflects the Company’s compliance with
the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if
it does not. We are not required to consider
whether the Board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control
procedures.
We read the other information contained in the
annual report including the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and we consider
the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report described as
having been audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to
obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report described as having been
audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or
error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
described as having been audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
 the Group financial statements give a true and
fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted
by the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of
its profit for the year then ended;
 the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report described as
having been audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report
is consistent with the Group financial
statements.
SEPARATE OPINION IN RELATION TO IFRS
As explained in Note 2 to the financial statements,
the Group, in addition to complying with its legal
obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union, has also complied with the IFRS
as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board. Accordingly, in our opinion the financial
statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March
2007 and of its profit for the year then ended.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2007

1. General information
Phoenix IT Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is given
on the inside back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Chief Executive’s Review.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group
operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the Financial Statements and
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 34.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where stated below. The principal accounting policies adopted are
set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries)
made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets (including identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill) and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are
measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recognised as goodwill.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit for the period
and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as adopted by the European Union has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP in the year ended 31 March 1999 and
earlier periods has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Other revenues, apart from those falling under maintenance contracts
(shown below), are recorded as earned or as the services are performed after provision for estimated customer credits.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Maintenance Contracts
For fixed-fee maintenance contracts the revenue arising is spread evenly over the term of the contract. Costs incurred under these contracts are
charged to the income statement as they arise.
Leasing
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the
balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate prevailing at
the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity
and transferred to the Group’s profit and loss reserve. Such translation differences will be recognised as income or as expenses in the period in
which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Retirement benefit costs
The principal subsidiary undertakings contribute to a number of Group personal pension plans in respect of certain employees. These plans are
defined contribution plans and the annual charge to the income statement is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between contributions
payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Short-term employee benefits
The cost of short-term accumulating balances is charged to the income statement over the period during which the entitlement is earned, at an
average pay rate plus social security costs. Differences between the entitlement earned and the entitlement actually paid is shown as either accruals
or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Impairment policy
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is immediately recognised as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss (other than goodwill) is
immediately recognised as income.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is
also dealt with in equity.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provisions for impairment.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings, fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and recognised impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line
method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Leasehold property Period of lease
Fixtures and equipment 2 to 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured initially at fair value and are amortised on a systematic basis over their estimated useful lives.
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Service stocks, other than consumable stocks, are systematically provided against over four years so as to reduce their value to nil at the end of the
period. Consumable stocks are expensed as they are purchased.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable
amounts.
Financial liability and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions
Provisions relate to the obligation to reinstate certain properties to their former condition at the end of their leases.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to
all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its fixtures, fittings and equipment under finance leases and hire purchase contracts. The average term is
five years. For the year ended 31 March 2007, the effective borrowing rate was 2.61% (2006: 2.69%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease and hire purchase obligations are denominated in sterling.
There is no material difference between the minimum lease payments and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease and hire purchase obligations approximates their carrying amount.

At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred
tax liabilities have not been recognised was £31,836,630 (2006: £24,429,510). No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will
not reverse in the foreseeable future.

On 3 November 2006 the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Servo Computer Services Limited for a cash consideration of
£28m and the issue of 708,103 shares in Phoenix IT Group plc. The costs of acquisition amounted to £648,000. Servo Computer Services Limited
is the parent company of a group of companies involved in the provision of IT services and equipment. This transaction has been accounted for by
the purchase method of accounting.

27. Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking continued
Details of the fair value adjustments to the book values of the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities are as follows:
(a) Tangible fixed assets were revalued in order to reflect their fair value to the Group.
(b) Intangible assets arising on the acquisition relate to the valuation of the acquired customer relationships expected to endure beyond the
minimum contracted order terms. The intangible asset valuation has been derived using the estimated net present value of the net future after
tax cash flows which are expected to arise from the customer relationships.
(c) Stock was adjusted to reflect the valuation on the date of acquisition.
(d) Trade debtors were revalued by £56,000 to take account of post-acquisition credit notes raised and irrecoverable amounts. Specific provisions
were established after making due allowance for cash received since acquisition.
(e) Other debtors were adjusted to take into account balances arising as a result of the exercise of employee share options.
(f) Other creditors were adjusted to take account of additional liabilities on the date of acquisition.
(g) Provision fair value adjustments comprise dilapidation provisions of £468,000.
(h) Corporation tax was adjusted to take account of the deduction available as a result of the exercise of employee share options.
(i) Deferred tax assets were revalued to take account of the deferred tax liability that arises from the other fair value adjustments and the fact that
the Company would not have a tax liability for the remainder of the period ended 31 March 2007 due to the tax deduction available as a result
of the exercise of employee share options.
(j) The goodwill recognised of £26.3m is attributable to the value of the established workforce and infrastructure, the future growth potential of
the SME IT services market, and the anticipated synergies arising from the acquisition.
Servo Computer Services Limited contributed £16.3m to the Group’s revenue and £1.7m to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between the
date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Servo Computer Services Limited had been on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been
£151,192,000 and the Group profit attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £15,021,000.

Weighted average share price £2.85
Weighted average exercise price Nil
Expected volatility 30%
Expected life 4 years
Weighted average risk-free rate 4.69%
Weighted average dividend yield 0.69%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous six months and by
comparison with comparable companies, due to the limited data available for the Group. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted,
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Other share-based plans
The Company introduced a Share Incentive Plan on flotation. All employees were entitled to apply for free shares up to a value of £1,250
depending on their period of service. The Company issued 259,558 shares in connection with this award.
In addition, employees are able to buy shares by deduction from their pre-tax salary. Under the current SIP legislation this is restricted to
a maximum of £1,500 in each tax year or, if less, 10% of salary.
The Group recognised total expenses of £835,000 relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2007 (2006: £617,000).

32. Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are disclosed in Note
15 to the individual Company financial statements.
During the year the Group sold a motor vehicle to Peter Bertram, Non-Executive Chairman, for £32,190. The sale was at open market value and
there were no amounts outstanding relating to this transaction at the year end.
Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of the Directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories
specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures. Further information about the remuneration of individual Directors is provided in the audited part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

33. Financial risk management
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s policies for these risks are set out below:
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group manages currency exposures by maintaining, where possible, a broadly equivalent revenue and expense stream in the relevant currency.
The Board periodically reviews the net risk and implements strategies as appropriate. During the year the Group has not entered into any
derivatives.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group is funded by equity, bank loans and hire purchase agreements. All borrowing is agreed and monitored by the Board. The Group seeks
to maximise its interest return on surplus funds by investing in short-term deposits at the relevant national bank’s commercial interest rate.
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful debts, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating
agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
(d) Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its liquidity requirements and places surplus funds on short-term deposits. All borrowing is agreed and monitored by
the Board.

34. Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
The principal accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements employed in the preparation of these Financial Statements which could affect the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date are as follows:
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets have been impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to
which they have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-
generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets at the balance
sheet date was £84.1m and £7.1m respectively.
Share-based payments
In valuing the share-based payments realised in the Group’s accounts, the Company has used the Black-Scholes calculation model, which makes
various assumptions on factors outside the Group’s control, such as share price volatility and risk-free interest rates. Details of the options and
assumptions used in deriving the share-based payments are disclosed in Note 31.
Dilapidation provisions
Dilapidation provisions have been derived on the basis of the most recent assessment of likely cost. Many of these obligations will not arise for a
number of years and the costs are difficult to predict accurately. In making these assessments, the Group has sought the aid of independent experts
where appropriate.
35. Standards and Interpretations in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following relevant Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives
IFRIC 10 Interim reporting and impairments
IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on financial instruments when the relevant Standard comes into effect for periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2007.

1. Accounting Policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with the applicable United Kingdom
accounting standards. As permitted by the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions
in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account
in arriving at the operating result.
Group undertakings
Investments are included in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value
at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of shares that will
eventually vest.
2. Staff costs
The Directors were the only employees during the period and they received all of their remuneration, as disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on page 24, from Phoenix IT Services Limited.
3. Profit of parent company
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these
accounts. The Parent Company’s profit before dividends for the financial year amounted to £7,330,000 (2006: £7,130,000).

6. THAT, subject to and in accordance with Article 9.2 of the Articles of Association of the Company, the Directors be generally and unconditionally
authorised in accordance with section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (in substitution for any existing authority to allot relevant securities) to
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within the meaning of section 80 of the Companies Act 1985) up to a
maximum nominal amount of £200,908 (being approximately one-third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 18 May 2007) provided that
such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2008 or 22 November 2008, whichever

this resolution had not expired.
7. THAT, subject to the passing of resolution 6 as set out in the notice of this meeting, and in accordance with Article 9.2 of the Articles of

to be allotted after such expiry, and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the power conferred by
this resolution had not expired.
8. THAT the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised, pursuant to Article 6 of the Articles of Association of the Company and pursuant

Notes:
Any member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a member of the
Company) to attend and, on a poll, to vote instead of the member. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending

power or authority, must reach the Company’s Registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, The Causeway, Worthing, West Sussex, BN99 9DA not less than 48
hours before the time of the meeting or of any adjournment of the meeting.
As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated form must be entered on
the Company’s share register at 6.00 pm on 20 August 2007 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. Such shareholders
may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the relevant register after that time shall be disregarded in determining
the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
Copies of the service contracts of each of the Directors, will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business
hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the

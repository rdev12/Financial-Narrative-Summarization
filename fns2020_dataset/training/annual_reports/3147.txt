DELIVERING 
THE GROWTH
Centamin plc Annual report  2013 Centamin plc is a mineral exploration, development 
and mining company dual listed on the London and 
Toronto Stock Exchanges. 
Centamin’ s principal asset, the Sukari Gold Mine, began 
production in 2009 and is the first large scale modern gold 
mine in Egypt, with an estimated 20 year mine life and 
ramping up production towards a 450,000-500,000 ounce 
per annum target from 2015 onwards. Our development 
and operating experience gives us a significant advantage 
in acquiring and developing other gold projects. 
In 2013 Centamin agreed a recommended all-share 
takeover offer for ASX-listed Ampella Mining Ltd and also 
formed a joint venture with AIM-listed Alecto Minerals plc, 
adding highly prospective licence packages in Burkina 
Faso and Ethiopia respectively. Centamin took control 
of Ampella on 24 February 2014.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Overview
Investment proposition
With a rapid growth profile and a robust balance sheet with 
substantial cash balances, Centamin is uniquely positioned 
among mid‑tier gold producers to generate value for 
shareholders. 
We are focused on driving operational excellence and strong 
profitability in order to deliver on our targets.
Rapid production growth
Centamin is aiming to grow production from the Sukari Gold 
Mine to 450,000‑500,000 ounces of gold per annum. We have 
invested c.US$331 million in the Stage 4 expansion project to 
double the processing plant’s capacity from 5 million tonnes 
per annum (“Mtpa”) to 10Mtpa. Commissioning of Stage 4 
began in Q1 2014.
Exploration potential
Centamin has a large resource and reserve base and through 
the continued exploration of Sukari Hill and the 160km
2
 Sukari 
tenement area there is significant upside potential. The resource 
and reserve statements were published in December 2013 to 
take account of the latest drill results, higher cost environment 
and the timing of the Stage 4 commissioning. 
Our regional exploration is focused in Ethiopia, where in addition 
to our own licences we have a joint venture arrangement with 
AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc, and, through a controlling 
interest in ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, in Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire. Exploration work will continue in all these regions 
during 2014 to drive our growth in the longer term.
First mover advantage
Sukari is the only producing gold mine in Egypt. Our operating 
experience in Egypt gives us significant first‑mover advantage in 
acquiring and developing other gold projects in the prospective 
Arabian‑Nubian shield and beyond.
An experienced team
Centamin’s management team and Board of Directors have 
considerable expertise in the gold mining industry. This ranges 
from the early stage identification of deposits, through to 
project financing, construction and development, and on to the 
operating of large mines. Some of the leadership team have 
been based at Sukari for almost a decade, taking it from an early 
stage exploration project to the operating gold mine it is today.
Financial strength and flexibility
With a robust balance sheet and strong cash flow generation 
from Sukari, we have financial flexibility to grow our business 
both organically as well as through strategic acquisitions. 
Centamin has no debt or hedging and therefore is well 
positioned to benefit from a recovery in the gold price.

Open pit
Open pit ore tonnes mined amounted to 11.7Mt 
in 2013. Mining was predominately from the Stage 
3 area and development work progressed in the 
Gazelle and Eastern Hills area.
Underground
The underground mine delivered a total of 
0.59Mt of ore at 9.66g/t. The expansion of the 
underground mine continued with the further 
development in both the Ptah and Amun declines.
Production
Ore processed was a record year of 5.7Mt (versus 
the nameplate capacity of 5Mtpa). Commissioning 
of the Stage 4 expansion to double capacity to 
nameplate 10 Mtpa tonnes is currently under way.
Exploration
Centamin stepped up its exploration programme 
in Ethiopia through a joint venture with Alecto 
Minerals plc, which has licences in the south and 
west of the country. Centamin is set to expand its 
exploration interests into West Africa in a highly 
prospective region of Burkina Faso and Côte 
d’Ivoire.

Centamin at a glance
Centamin has operations in Egypt and Ethiopia in north‑east 
Africa. Our flagship project, the Sukari Gold Mine, is located 
in the eastern desert of Egypt and production is rapidly 
increasing to 450,000‑500,000 ounces per annum from 
2015 onwards. Sukari Gold Mines is jointly controlled with 
EMRA. Centamin’s portfolio includes exploration in Ethiopia 
and since the year end now includes exploration ground in 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
Sukari
The map shows the location of the Sukari Gold Mine on the 
exploitation lease in the eastern desert of Egypt. 
Sukari Hill – the focus exploration and mining to date 
has been on the Sukari porphyry. Surface drilling in 2013 
continued north through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into 
the northern Pharaoh Zone.
Beyond Sukari Hill – reverse circulation and diamond 
drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz 
Ridge, V‑Shear and Kurdeman prospects to the east, 
north‑east and south of the Sukari Hill, respectively during 
2013. Ongoing drilling to the south at the Kurdeman 
prospect offers the potential to fast‑track near surface 
high grade ore to supplement the existing production. 
Further regional drilling of the exploitation lease is planned 
for 2014. 
Ethiopia 
During 2013, the licence areas developed throughout 
the year were in the northern Tigray region of Ethiopia, 
however, exploration drilling to date has confirmed the 
presence of only low grade mineralisation.
The licence areas to be developed in 2014 are towards 
the south and west of Ethiopia in the Oromiya region and 
Benishangul Gumuz region as part of the joint venture with 
Alecto Minerals plc.
The licences in Burkina Faso form part of the Batie West 
Gold Project which contains the Konkera resource and 
permits along the strike across the border in Côte d’Ivoire. 
These licences are held by Ampella Mining Ltd and 
Centamin gained control of Ampella on 24 February 2014.

Dear shareholders
During 2013, the fourth full year of production at Sukari, your Company built 
further on its track record delivering against targets, whilst maintaining a strong 
control over its cost base. Sukari delivered a record 356,943 ounces of gold at 
a cash cost of production of US$663 per ounce, which was ahead of guidance 
of 320,000 ounces at US$700 per ounce set out in the first quarter of the 
year. The operating environment in Egypt improved markedly in comparison 
with a challenging 2012. I once again take this opportunity to extend my 
congratulations to the team in Egypt for their professionalism, hard work and 
consistent focus on improving productivity, which has resulted in another 
year of exceptional performance for the operation. Shareholders should not 
underestimate these efforts, which allow Centamin to stand out in a sector which 
generally suffers a reputation of missed forecasts and broken promises.
Sukari’s safety performance was also a significant improvement on the previous 
year with a lost time injury frequency rate of 0.36 (0.69 in 2012) per 200,000 
man hours achieved during the period. It was again pleasing to note that no 
significant environmental incidents have taken place.
Construction of the Stage 4 expansion to double the processing plant’s 
nameplate capacity to 10 million tonnes per annum was complete by the end of 
2013, and commissioning is currently under way. This major two‑and‑a‑half year 
expansion project has been completed with minimal cost and timing overruns. 
This would represent a major achievement in itself, but is all the more notable 
given the various external challenges that were faced, particularly during the 
early stages of construction. The capital cost estimate of the Stage 4 expansion is 
US$331.2 million including contingency, with expenditure at the end of 2013 of 
US$327.8 million. 
Commissioning and optimisation of the expanded plant is now a key deliverable 
as Sukari looks towards a further year of growth in 2014, with our annual 
production guidance set at 420,000 ounces at a cash cost of US$700 per ounce. 
Thereafter, we continue to forecast a sustainable output of 450,000 – 500,000 
ounces per annum from 2015 onwards, with scope to exceed the upper limit 
once the new plant is fully optimised and operating at above‑nameplate levels of 
productivity, as demonstrated by the existing plant during 2013.
Sukari is a long‑life asset which is supported by a globally significant resource 
and reserve base. An updated resource and reserve statement was announced 
at the end of the year, with total resources containing 15.4 million ounces 
(“Moz”)
 (1)
 and reserves containing 8.2Moz of gold. With the underground mine 
continuing to ramp‑up in productivity and being a key driver of our substantial 
and low cost production profile, it was of particular encouragement to see the 
underground reserve increase in tonnage by 120% over the previous 2011 
estimate, despite mining depletion during that period. With grades in the 
Proven category of 11.4g/t gold, and with continued good results from ongoing 
drilling into the target high‑grade depth extensions of the ore body, we remain 
confident of further significant underground reserve expansion and longevity of 
the operation.
During 2013, the fourth full year of production at Sukari, 
your Company built further on its track record delivering 
against targets whilst maintaining a strong control over 
its cost base.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
As previously indicated to shareholders, the Company 
significantly progressed its medium and long‑term growth 
strategy during 2013. In September, Centamin entered 
into a joint venture with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc over 
their exploration projects in Ethiopia, thus expanding our 
presence in this important region of focus for the Company. 
The announcement in December of a recommended 
all‑share takeover offer of ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, 
valuing the company at A$40.9 million, saw the Company 
expand its interests into West Africa. This offer represented 
a compelling opportunity to acquire an undervalued suite 
of exploration‑stage licences in highly prospective regions 
of Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. Centamin now has a 
controlling interest in Ampella and is looking forward to 
implementing a systematic exploration programme in 2014, 
aimed at developing the outstanding potential for further 
significant growth of the existing 3.25Moz resource base 
(comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred).
Our financial position remains strong with approximately 
US$142.5 million held in cash, bullion on hand, gold 
sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets. 
The Company also continues to be debt free with no 
hedging arrangements. Revenues of US$503.8 million and 
EBITDA of US$234.2 million in 2013 (including exceptional 
items) continue to demonstrate that Sukari remains a highly 
cash generative operation. With the major Stage 4 capital 
programme now behind us, and therefore the staged 
expansionary “investment phase” nearing completion, 
shareholders can now look forward to a long‑life operation 
which will now start to generate substantial free cash flow. 
Accordingly, during the course of 2014 Centamin will make 
clear its intentions with regard to a policy for returning 
capital to its shareholders.
Our appeal against the 30 October 2012 ruling by the 
Egyptian Administrative Court, on the validity of the 
exploitation lease, remains ongoing. We believe the action 
is misconceived as we have clear evidence that there is a 
valid exploitation lease in existence. Important progress 
was made in March 2013 when the Supreme Administrative 
Court approved our application to suspend enforcement of 
the October 2012 ruling until the conclusion of the appeal 
process. Furthermore, the statement by the court at this 
hearing that the original ruling “was likely to be cancelled 
upon the issuance of a judgment on the merits of the 
case” supports our full confidence in our legal title and 
the strength of our appeal case. We continue to benefit 
from the full support of the Ministry of Petroleum and the 
Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (“EMRA”), both in 
the appeal and at the operational level, to whom I would 
like to extend our thanks for their continued co‑operation 
in helping us to deliver a world class mining operation. 
We look forward to continuing to share the benefits of this 
substantial investment as the operation emerges from its 
initial period of construction and thus sets the stage for a 
new era of gold mining in Egypt. 
This year, the Chairman of the Corporate Governance 
Committee has presented the Corporate Governance 
Report. As Chairman of the Board I agree and endorse both 
this report and the values of good governance reflected in 
it. In my view Board effectiveness has been achieved, in no 
small part, by ensuring that communication channels are 
open between all Board members and regular information is 
presented to the Board allowing all members to contribute 
knowledgeably at Board meetings and in discussions 
between the executives and non executive directors.
I would like to close by thanking all those at Sukari, 
in Alexandria, Ethiopia, Jersey and Perth for their efforts 
in 2013 as Centamin continued on its journey to becoming 
an established gold producer.
Your Company remains well positioned to deliver 
outstanding shareholder returns in the coming years. I look 
forward to updating you further over the course of 2014, 
and would welcome you to join us at our AGM which this 
year will be held in Jersey on 16 May 2014.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Whilst disciplined and sustainable growth on our existing 
projects remains a key focus, we continue to evaluate 
potential opportunities to grow through the acquisition of 
projects which offer the potential for the Company to realise 
strong investment returns. 
2014 will mark the year when the Stage 4 plant expansion is 
commissioned, the Sukari project concludes its investment 
phase and our annual capital expenditure requirements for 
the mine begin to reduce significantly. 
Maintaining our social licence
Maintaining good community relations is a core part of our 
operational strategy and corporate governance standards. 
As the first mining company in Egypt in modern times, we 
strive to set an example of a socially responsible industry 
through adopting a good neighbour policy. We take every 
action to ensure Sukari has the minimum impact on the 
social environment, as well as to deliver positive benefits 
to Egypt and the community as a result of our investment. 
In 2013 we nurtured dialogue, maintained open channels of 
communication and built positive and constructive relations 
with all our stakeholders including the community in areas 
in which we operate. The Board approved principles 
and strategies for the pursuit of corporate sustainable 
development initiatives. 
Our work force is remunerated well above the average for 
Egypt and our career development programmes are highly 
valued. In general we enjoy a very positive and constructive 
relationship with our employees. 
Targets for 2014
Key targets for 2014 include the commissioning of 
the Stage 4 plant, the conclusion of the Sukari project 
investment phase and the significant reduction of our annual 
capital expenditure requirements for the mine. 
For the year 2014, we forecast production of 420,000 
ounces at a cash operating cost of US$700 per ounce, which 
will mark the fourth year of successive growth in output from 
Sukari, and another step on the way to our long‑term target 
for the project of 450,000‑500,000 ounces per annum from 
2015 onwards at an industry‑competitive cost of production. 
The key drivers of production growth this year will be an 
increase of the underground ore tonnes mined to 800,000t, 
as well as commissioning and ramp‑up of the Stage 4 plant 
expansion to double the processing plant’s nameplate 
capacity to 10 Mtpa. 
As part of the implementation of Stage 4, the Company  
is in discussion with EMRA and other government 
departments in relation to increasing the daily usage of 
ammonium nitrate (“AN”) in order to increase open pit 
mining rates to the required level to feed the expanded 
plant. The increase in the daily issue of AN is still 
outstanding, and this has had an impact on the movement 
of waste material compared to the current mining plan. 
However from recent meetings with the relevant authorities, 
we believe government approval is now in its final stages.
The capital expenditure programme for 2013 had 
two key focus areas: completion of the Stage 4 plant 
expansion and the ongoing development of the 
underground mine. The total Stage 4 capital expenditure 
estimate is US$331.2 million including contingency, with 
US$327.8 million spent by the end of 2013. The remaining 
capital expenditure is due in early 2014. The underground 
expansion will continue through 2014 as will the 
underground exploration drilling to test the potential 
for significant resource and reserve expansion and the 
development of multiple production sources.
Based on the Company’s calculation there was no “Net 
Profit Share” due to EMRA as at 30 June 2013, nor is any 
likely to be due as at 30 June 2014. It is expected that there 
will be profit share due to EMRA for the Sukari Gold Mine 
(“SGM”) financial year ending 30 June 2015, based on 
budgeted production, gold price and operating expense 
forecasts. Centamin has elected to make advance payments 
against future profit share during 2013 to the value of 
US$18.95 million, in order to demonstrate goodwill towards 
the Egyptian government.
Centamin’s exploration programme in Ethiopia will prioritise 
progression of the two licences under the joint venture with 
Alecto Minerals plc. The acquisition of Ampella Mining Ltd 
is expected to be completed in early 2014, and Centamin 
will focus on implementing a systematic exploration 
programme in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. The targets 
for 2014 have been considered alongside the principal risks 
affecting the Centamin Group.
Litigation
As detailed in Note 20 to the financial statements, the 
Group’s appeal against the 30 October 2012 ruling by the 
Egyptian Administrative Court remains ongoing. Centamin 
does not currently see the need to take the matter to a 
court outside of Egypt as Centamin remains of the belief 
that the Egyptian court will rule in Centamin’s favour.
The Group continues to benefit from the full support of the 
Ministry of Petroleum and EMRA, both in the appeal and 
at the operational level. As part of our long‑term strategy, 
we look forward to continuing to share the benefits of this 
substantial investment as the operation emerges from its 
initial period of construction and thus sets the stage for a 
new era of gold mining in Egypt.
With the exception of the relationships with EMRA and the 
Egyptian government referred to above, we do not believe 
there are any third party relationships which are critical to 
the Group’s success or which would have a material impact 
upon the Group’s position if the relationship broke down.
This strategic review, progress on strategy, key performance 
indicators and business model, together form the Strategic 
Report which has been approved by the Board of Directors.
By order of the Board for and on behalf of Centamin plc.

Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its project 
pipeline through targeted acquisitions of exploration and 
development prospects in the region and beyond. 
Andrew Pardey 
Chief Operating Officer
Overview 
Centamin’s principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, which is located in the eastern 
desert of Egypt, approximately 700km from Cairo and 25km from the Red Sea. 
For the twelve months ended 31 December 2013, production from Sukari was 
356,943 ounces (2012: 262,828 ounces) of gold at an operating cash cost of 
US$663 per ounce (US$669 per ounce in 2012). 
The first pillar of Centamin’s growth strategy is the expansion of Sukari, which 
includes the growth of Sukari Hill’s resources and reserves, the development of 
the underground mine and the Stage 4 expansion, which will double the plant’s 
processing nameplate capacity from 5Mtpa to 10Mtpa.
Construction of the Stage 4 expansion was steady during the year and whilst 
some commissioning activity commenced in 2013 the bulk of commissioning 
will commence in the first quarter 2014, versus the previously‑expected 
second half of 2013. The temporary suspension of operations in 2012 caused 
by strikes at the ports and the lack of fuel and supplies all contributed to the 
delay in commissioning Stage 4. These unforeseen delays in the critical path 
items, materials and services have meant that the Stage 4 expansion project 
has not met its original targeted date for completion. The expected capital 
cost of the Stage 4 expansion which is funded by PGM out of cost recoveries, 
is US$331.2 million including contingency, with total expenditure at the end of 
2013 of US$327.8 million. 
Capital expenditure during the year saw an increase in non‑current assets 
of US$252.0 million in property, plant and equipment, mainly relating to net 
capitalised work‑in‑progress which comprises:
•	 US$99.3 million for the Stage 4 processing plant;
•	 US$77.4 million for the open pit mining fleet expansion;
•	 US$16.2 million for open pit development;
•	 US$29.5 million for underground development;
•	 US$1.7 million for mine development properties; and
•	 US$27.9 million for other sustaining capital expenditure.
Centamin continued exploration on its tenements in northern Ethiopia 
where exploration drilling confirmed the presence of low grade mineralisation. 
In September 2013 Centamin entered into a joint venture with Alecto Minerals 
plc to pursue existing and new opportunities identified by Alecto in Ethiopia. 
The initial joint venture projects focus on two exploration licences, one in 
Wayu Boda and the other in Aysid Meketel.
A recommended all‑share takeover offer of ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd 
saw Centamin expand its interests into West Africa. Ampella holds exploration 
licences in a highly prospective region of Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. 
In February 2014, Centamin gained a controlling interest in Ampella enabling 
Centamin to expand the operational activity in this region. Centamin intends to 
continue to grow and diversify its project pipeline through targeted acquisitions 
of exploration and development prospects in the region and beyond. 
Operational performance review CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Operational performance review continued
Health and safety
The LTIFR for 2013 was 0.36 per 200,000 man‑hours 
(2012: 0.69 per 200,000 man‑hours), with a total of 
6,702,908 man hours worked during 2013 (2012: 5,819,877). 
Developing the health and safety culture onsite has resulted 
in improved reporting of incidents compared to previous 
years and although there is still room for improvement, 
Centamin views its LTI frequency rate as a solid achievement 
considering Sukari is the first modern gold mine in Egypt.
Open pit
During 2013, open pit mine development has continued the 
staged development to ensure access to the higher grade 
sulphide zones could be maintained. This was combined 
with increased production rates as the mining fleet capacity 
increased during the year. A total of 11.7Mt of ore at 0.81g/t 
Au was mined for the period from Stage 2 and 3 and at an 
average waste to ore ratio of 2.6:1. Mining continued to the 
950RL and development work progressed in the Gazelle 
and Eastern Hills area to the 1100RL. 
Underground mine
The underground mine delivered a total of 587kt of ore 
at 9.66g/t from both stoping and development headings. 
The development of both the Amun and Ptah declines 
continued and 5,808 metres of development was 
completed during 2013.
The project development has advanced a total of 15,766m 
to date, with 9,200m of this total driven through ore.
The Amun decline, which is under the current open pit 
workings, reached the 740 level, 303m below the “portal 
wadi” area. Ore development has been mined from the 905 
to the 770 levels and 283kt of stoping has been mined from 
these levels during the year. A further 303kt of development 
ore was also mined during 2013.
The expansion of the underground mine continued with 
the Ptah decline and ore development taking place on 
the 875RL. A total of 1,404 metres of development was 
completed on the Ptah decline in 2013. The Ptah decline 
will provide both a ventilation intake and haulage way to 
the central and northern portion of Sukari Hill. This will 
give access to ore blocks under the current ultimate pit 
base once the Amun decline is removed by the open 
pit in the coming years. Centamin will then be in a 
position to maintain at least two separate underground 
production areas and also potentially increase the current 
production rates.
Over 29,000 metres of grade control drilling has been 
completed for the underground since start up and four 
deep exploration drilling rigs are currently drilling from 
both the Amun and Ptah declines, to test for high grade 
extensions of the ore body.
Processing
The annual throughput in the Sukari plant was 5.7Mt in 
2013, a 12% increase on 2012 (4.5Mt). Productivity of the 
processing plant averaged 700tph for the year, 12% above 
the nameplate design rate of 625tph, as the operations 
team continued to optimise availability and throughput.
Plant metallurgical recoveries were 88.6% in the year, 
a 2.6% increase on 2012. Continued optimisation of 
operational controls and improved circuit stability resulted 
in the recovery steadily increasing throughout the year. 
Whilst there are ongoing operational improvements, 
recoveries are expected to remain consistent until the new 
carbon regeneration kiln is commissioned in 2014.
The dump leach operation produced 12,382oz in 2013, 
which was a significant increase from 2012.
Stage 4 expansion
The Stage 4 expansion programme continued throughout 
2013, having commenced in late 2011. 
The process plant was 97% completed at the end of 
December 2013. The outstanding work to complete is 
electrical instrumentation and piping work. Commissioning 
of the new conveyor to the crushed ore stock pile took 
place in December 2013 together with direction testing of 
various motors and pumps. 
The estimated capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion, which 
is funded by PGM out of cost recoveries, is US$331.2 million 
including contingency, with expenditure to date of 
US$327.8 million.
The Stage 4 expansion will incorporate additional milling, 
flotation and thickening capabilities to provide a parallel 
processing route, as well as upgrade to the existing regrind 
circuit. Secondary crushed ore with a P80 of 50mm will 
be transferred to a second crushed ore stockpile prior to 
grinding through a new milling circuit. The new milling 
circuit will be a two stage circuit, consisting of a SAG Mill 
and ball mill, with hydrocyclone classification and a pebble 
crushing facility. 
Milled ore with a particle size of 150μm will be sent to a new 
flotation circuit to recover the bulk sulphide concentrate. 
The concentrate will be thickened and discharged to an 
upgraded regrind circuit, capable of treating up to 100tph 
of concentrate to achieve a final milled particle size of 
10μm. The regrind circuit will combine the two concentrate 
streams from each of the separate flotation circuits. 
The regrind product will be treated through the two CIL 
circuits in series to maximise leach circuit residence time. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
16 17
Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
The flotation tails of the new circuit will be thickened and 
discharged to the tailings storage facility. It is expected 
that the ore treated through the new flotation circuit will be 
predominantly sulphide based ore, amenable to recovery 
by flotation. Any ore that may be oxide or transitional in 
nature will be treated through the existing processing circuit 
by adjustment of the crushed ore product splits to each of 
the crushed ore stockpiles.
Exploration activities
Growth of Sukari Hill
The main focus of exploration to date has been on the 
Sukari porphyry. Surface drilling in 2013 continued north 
through the Ra and Gazelle zones and into the northern 
Pharaoh Zone. 
During the second half of the year Underground drilling was 
progressively stepped‑up as new development provided 
improved access from below surface to test potential high 
grade extensions of the deposit. The ore body has not yet 
been closed off by drilling to the north, or at depth.
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place 
during 2014, predominantly from both the Amun and 
Ptah declines.

Regional exploration
The second pillar of Centamin’s growth strategy is regional 
exploration. Seven other prospects besides Sukari Hill have 
been identified on the 160km
2
 Sukari tenement area and 
exploration is being conducted under the principle that 
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing 
processing plant.
Drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz 
Ridge and V‑Shear prospects to the east and north‑east of 
the hill respectively during 2013. Ongoing drilling to the 
south at the Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to 
fast‑track near surface high grade ore to supplement the 
existing production. Further regional drilling of the Sukari 
licence is planned for 2013. 
Exploration beyond Sukari
The third pillar of Centamin’s strategy is growth beyond 
Sukari. Centamin continued exploration on its four 
tenements Una Deriam, Finarwa, Winibo and Shehagne in 
northern Ethiopia, and in total, 11,134 meters were drilled 
over the four tenements. Of these licences only Una Deriam 
remains active, the others having being impaired at the year 
end due to the presence of only low grade mineralisation.
In September 2013 Centamin entered into joint venture 
with Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing and new 
opportunities identified by Alecto in Ethiopia. The initial 
joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences 
Wayu Boda and Aysid Meketel.
A recommended all‑share takeover offer for ASX‑listed 
Ampella Mining Ltd, was announced on 10 December 2013. 
Centamin took control of Ampella on 24 February 2014. 
This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive licence 
holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 
+100km trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso, as well 
as further exploration properties in Côte d’Ivoire. Centamin 
will implement a systematic exploration program, aimed at 
developing the potential for further significant growth of the 
existing resource base (comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 
1.33Moz Inferred).
Centamin intends to continue to grow and diversify its asset 
base through targeted acquisitions in the coming years.

Financial review
Centamin delivered strong operational and financial 
results in 2013, producing 356,943 ounces of gold 
(2012: 262,828 ounces) and generating profit after tax for 
the year of US$184.0 million (including exceptional items) 
2012: US$199.0 million.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 are presented 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies and based on International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”).
Through the Group’s emphasis on maximising productivity and maintaining 
rigorous cost control, Centamin has continued to return strong earnings and 
cash flow generation despite the weaker gold price environment. Now in its 
fifth year of production, the Sukari Gold Mine remains highly cash generative, 
with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) 
of US$234.2 million (including exceptional items) (2012: US$233.3 million), 
and a robust cash and cash equivalents balance of US$106.0 million 
(2012: US$147.1 million) as at 31 December 2013.
Revenue
Revenue from gold and silver sales has increased by 18% to US$503.8 million, 
as a result of a 43% increase in gold sold to 363,576 ounces offset by a 17% 
decrease in the average gold price to US$1,384 per ounce. 
Net profit
The Group recorded a net profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 
2013 of US$184.0 million (2012: US$198.6 million). The decrease is driven 
primarily by the lower gold price which was offset by higher volumes of gold sold 
and lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control. Included within this 
figure is the impairment of available‑ for‑ sale financial assets (US$12.9 million), 
impairment of associates (US$3.6 million) and impairment of exploration and 
evaluation assets (US$6.5 million).
Net cash flows
Net cash flows used in investing activities comprise exploration expenditure 
and capital development expenditures at Sukari including the acquisition of 
financial and mineral assets. These cash flows have decreased year‑ on‑ year by 
US$39.0 million to US$282.8 million. The primary use of the funds during the 
year was for investment in capital work‑in‑progress in relation to the Stage 4 
development and open pit mining fleet. In addition cash used in the purchase of 
available‑for‑sale financial assets was US$2.5 million, offset by proceeds received 
from the available‑for‑sale financial assets of US$0.8 million compared to an 
outflow of US$6.4 million in 2012.

January 2012 (refer to Notes 3 and 6 respectively to the financial statements for further details).
EBITDA
EBITDA (including exceptional items) of US$234.2 million 
(2012: US$233.3 million) reflected a slight increase in 2013. 
The Sukari operation’s strong cash generation was also 
reflected in an 11% increase in “net cash generated by 
operations” of US$245.1 million from US$220.5 million.
Cash
At 31 December 2013, the Group had cash and 
cash equivalents of US$106.0 million compared to 
US$147.1 million at 31 December 2012. The majority of 
funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term 
higher interest money market deposits. 
The decrease in cash position is primarily due to the 
payments for property, plant and equipment together 
with unfavourable gold prices and the inclusion of an 
exceptional provision which represents a payment on 
fuel subsidies reflected in prepayments. Trade payables 
increased by US$23 million and consist mainly of mining 
fleet capital expenditure. 
Cost of production
The cash operating cost of production was US$663 per 
ounce versus US$669 per ounce in 2012.

Corporate social responsibility statement
Statement by the Chairman of the Health, Safety, Environment 
and Sustainability Committee, Bob Bowker
Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report in my capacity as chairman of the HSES Committee, 
a committee of the Board of Centamin.
At Centamin we are committed to responsible mining. We realise that an 
ongoing commitment to sustainable development practices is critical to our 
business. Guided by our company values, we are committed to meeting the 
highest standards of social responsibility by protecting the safety and health 
of our employees, by safeguarding the working environment and creating 
a long‑lasting positive impact on the communities in which we operate. 
We believe that this policy delivers longer term value for our shareholders.
The Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee has worked closely 
throughout the year with the management of the Company to help achieve the 
objectives set by the Committee and management and aiming, where possible, 
to exceed these high standards and targets. We have especially welcomed and 
supported the steps taken in 2013 to improve, still further, the excellent results 
achieved in regard to workplace safety.
In 2013, the Board approved a strategy for the pursuit of Community Social 
Development initiatives and the HSES Committee receives regular reporting from 
management on social and environmental initiatives and projects.
As the first modern mining company to operate in Egypt, Centamin is particularly 
conscious of the role it is playing in developing the expertise of Egyptian 
nationals in the mining sector. We take a great deal of pride in the fact that 
our Egyptian national employees are gaining skills and knowledge and taking 
advantage of opportunities for career progression and promotion.
Highlighted within the report is a case study on one of our highly valued 
supervisors, Mr Nagy Abdou, who is one of a growing number of talented 
Egyptians able to realise their potential and make a significant contribution to the 
growth and success of the Company.
Throughout this report references to HSES policies refer to the Company’s Health 
Safety and Environmental Policy, the Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility 
Policy and certain industry and operational policies in place at Sukari.
Our efforts in this area are guided by the Company’s HSES Policies that aim 
to ensure high standards of safety and wellbeing for the workforce. The HSES 
Policies outline our commitment to educating our employees and contractors 
to apply safe working standards which safeguard all employees and contractors 
and the workplace environment. The HSES Policies also help develop a 
sustainable business where our activities benefit the wider community and 
the Company’s stakeholders.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
We aspire to the highest standard of corporate social 
responsibility and take seriously our duty to ensure safe 
and sustainable operations and growth. 
Health, Safety, Environment 
and Sustainability Committee
The Centamin Board Health, Safety, Environment and 
Sustainability Committee members are Bob Bowker 
(Chairman), Mark Arnesen, Mark Bankes and Kevin 
Tomlinson, all of whom are independent directors of the 
Company. The key functions of the HSES Committee are set 
out in the Committee Charter which can be found on the 
Company’s website.
In summary the Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on all matters in connection 
with issues of the environment, workplace health and safety, 
and the development of sustainable engagement with 
communities and stakeholders.
During the year, the HSES Committee worked closely with 
management to:
•	 Review the steps taken to improve the lost time due to 
injury (“LTI”) frequency rate;
•	 Review monthly and quarterly reporting on corporate 
sustainable development (“CSD”) issues and initiatives;
•	 Review environmental, health, safety and contingency 
planning issues; and 
•	 Receive updates, reports and associated KPIs in 
relation to new and existing initiatives designed to 
support local social and environmental projects.
Health and safety
The Company strives for a harm free, healthy and 
productive work place. We have invested in robust systems, 
procedures and controls to manage occupational health and 
safety risks to an acceptable level. These working practices 
allow us to comply with local legislation, licence and permit 
conditions, as well as international best practice standards. 
In 2013, we have witnessed a considerable improvement 
in the lost time injury frequency rate (“LTIFR”) as compared 
to 2012. This is as a result of the programmes and activities 
we implemented to improve our performance and increase 
the safety levels in our work place. We are pleased to 
report that we have never experienced any safety‑related 
employee fatality. On average, 75% of our injuries in 
2013 required only first aid action with no long‑term 
medical treatment.
Our target in 2014 is to further reduce our lost time injury 
frequency rate from its current level of 0.36 per 200,000 
man hours. Our statistics include both our own employees 
and our contractors.
Safety conscious culture
Safety is the responsibility of each employee and the level of 
safety is a function of the collective behaviour of individuals. 
Accordingly we continuously invest in maintaining a safety 
conscious culture in our work place, encouraging individual 
accountability for working safely.
The following areas highlight the Company’s commitment 
to a comprehensive training programme which we believe 
provides our best means for reducing work place incidents:
(1) a tailored safety induction programme for new 
employees, contractors and visitors;
(2) training modules addressing job hazard analysis, risk 
assessments, incident investigations, work permits, first 
aid, fire extinguishing, and hazard identification; and
(3) technical competence tuition, such as isolation training, 
lifting procedures, confined space entry, hot work and 
working at height.
Full time trainers are available in almost all operational 
departments to provide in‑field training and coaching for 
the work force. Tool box talks before shifts are used to 
address safety issues, tips and lessons learnt. 
Other communication channels are used including weekly 
and ad‑hoc safety meetings within each department 
and safety alerts which are periodically communicated 
throughout the workforce. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Contractor management
Contractors are integrated into the Company’s health and 
safety onsite programme whether for long periods of time 
or for short assignments. Contractor numbers rose in 2013 
due to the expertise and outsourcing required to complete 
Stage 4. The number of contractors onsite averaged 1,030 
individuals during the year.
We require all contractors operating onsite to adhere to 
the Company’s health and safety policies and procedures. 
We ensure they have the same health and safety induction 
training and also have full access to the health services 
available to our employees onsite.
Evaluating safety performance
The evaluation of our safety performance is essential to 
indicate the effectiveness of our systems and controls 
and identify opportunities for continuous improvement. 
The monitoring systems in place address: 
•	 workplace and occupational health parameters; 
•	 fitness to work; and
•	 adherence to procedures and standards.
The performance evaluation is undertaken by an in‑house 
team and reviewed by a third party. Monitoring includes the 
collation of data, medical surveillance, auditing and visual 
inspection, as well as systematic observation of the work 
and behaviour of staff.
Reactive or responsive evaluation is also undertaken to 
investigate and analyse incidents and identify root causes 
to help implement corrective measures.
Employees and contractors are encouraged and expected 
to report all hazards and near‑misses for investigation 
and analysis. This embodies the principles adopted by 
the HSES Policies and procedures where everyone shares 
and contributes in a responsible manner to creating a safe 
working environment.

Proactive approach and 
emergency response planning
Risk assessment is integrated into all operational activities 
onsite and we continuously evaluate potential and actual 
hazards, their probability and likely outcomes to determine 
the level of risk and appropriate risk mitigation and 
safeguards. A variety of different procedures and systems 
have been developed and implemented including the 
Work Permit System and Job Hazard Analysis for new and 
non‑recurrent activities.
Our approach towards emergency preparedness and 
response planning is detailed, rigorous and well‑rehearsed, 
ensuring the mine is fully prepared for any conceivable 
emergency. In 2013, we rehearsed 43 emergency drills 
at Sukari.
The emergency arrangements are supported by an 
infrastructure of fire hydrants, fire control panels and smoke 
detectors throughout the site. A fire truck and crew are in 
service in the event of severe fires. In 2013, we added to 
the infrastructure by establishing a fire extinguisher refilling 
workshop onsite, enabling maintenance and re‑filling of 
existing fire extinguishers.
A medical evacuation scheme is in place which is supported 
by first aid facilities and an equipped clinic. An ambulance is 
onsite to transport casualties to the nearest hospital. 
An inspection programme operates to ensure all emergency 
response equipment is maintained and is fit for purpose at 
all times.
Health and wellbeing 
We minimise health risks to our employees and contractors 
by implementing control and management procedures 
including the protection of employees and contractors from 
exposure to chemicals, dust, noise and other elements that 
might cause health problems. Area‑specific instructions and 
signs are in place regarding additional personal protective 
equipment requirements. These instructions are reiterated 
during pre‑shift meetings. 
Medical tests, including blood analysis, are conducted 
particularly for laboratory personnel and those working with 
chemicals and metals. Health tests are also mandatory for 
people working in the kitchen.
Employees are expected to report for work and remain at 
work in a fit condition to perform their assigned duties free 
from the use, presence, or effects of drugs and alcohol. 
The Company has a zero tolerance policy for use of 
alcohol and drugs. Drug and alcohol tests are undertaken 
randomly or when needed and disciplinary actions are 
taken accordingly.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Our health programme has a special focus on food safety 
and hygiene, given we have a large mess that provides 
meals to about 1,500 employees and contractors per day. 
In 2013, we implemented a programme to improve hygiene 
in the kitchen and dining facilities. The programme included 
periodic inspections and food testing as well as hygiene and 
food preparation training.
Health campaigns in 2013 included a “quit smoking” 
campaign, personal hygiene and “fasting Ramadan” 
campaigns. Within the campaigns we printed alerts on 
the back of pay slips, displayed posters and other notices 
around site as well as our doctor delivering toolbox talks 
about the topic. 
In 2013, the following audits were carried out and the 
outcomes were as follows:
(1) internal environmental audits confirmed the results 
were within acceptable limits;
(2) water quality testing carried out by an external 
laboratory confirmed no major anomalies;
(3) air quality audits conducted by Cairo University 
recorded no anomalies and confirmed that Sukari was 
compliant with required standards; and
(4) emissions were reported to be at safe levels, as 
required by Egyptian law and international standards 
set by the World Bank.
Our employees and contractors 
Our people are core to the success of our business. 
Accordingly, we actively invest in securing the full spectrum 
of skills and competencies needed for effective operations.
The Company’s activities provide direct and indirect 
employment, training and work experience to many 
Egyptian nationals, as well as creating an immediate 
revenue stream for the local economy and the 
Egyptian government.
Our workforce has witnessed considerable growth since we 
started production in 2010, both in terms of the number 
of employees and the range of skills and expertise now 
required by our workforce. 
In Egypt, we employ 1,340 people of whom 93% are 
Egyptian nationals. Approximately 50% of our Egyptian 
nationals are from upper Egypt, the area where Sukari is 
situated, which typically has less economic activity than the 
more prosperous areas around the Nile Delta. 
Only 1% of our Egyptian workforce are women, mainly 
because social conditions in Egypt and in the Middle East in 
general do not encourage the work of female employees in 
remote sites. A greater percentage of women are employed 
throughout the Centamin administrative offices.

Human resources principles
Our Policies set out the Company’s approach and principles 
in regard to human resource management, recruitment and 
retention. Our policies aim to ensure that:
•	 new or current employees are not discriminated against 
by the company due to their religion, nationality or 
political views or background;
•	 all employees have the opportunity for promotion 
based on the ability of a person to perform the relevant 
job, without regard to personal characteristics that are 
unrelated to job requirements;
•	 harassment of employees by anyone and in any way is 
not tolerated;
•	 forced and compulsory labour are not allowed in any 
work related to our activities;
•	 all employees are entitled to a safe, healthy work 
environment, and each employee is accountable for his 
or her HSE performance in the Company;
•	 we are committed to the highest ethical standards and 
behaviour. Our Code of Conduct requires adherence to 
our principles and promotes confidence in the integrity 
of the Company; and
•	 child labour is prohibited, whether in our permanent 
employment or in contractors’ work‑forces. 
Contractors are required by their agreements to abide by 
these requirements, and follow‑up checks are undertaken 
seeking to establish that our conditions are met.
We expect every one of our employees to uphold our 
core value of honesty and integrity whilst maintaining a 
safe working environment. All employees are encouraged 
to treat their fellow colleagues with respect, dignity and 
common courtesy.
Annual performance appraisals are undertaken for all 
employees. The appraisal covers several areas including the 
employee’s job knowledge, skills attained during the year, 
quality of work and initiative and innovation.
The review is undertaken by the immediate supervisor and 
the appraisal performance is agreed with the section head. 
The appraisal process also identifies the need for training 
or coaching, modified responsibilities or opportunities to 
undertake more challenging roles and responsibilities.
Capacity building and development
We strongly encourage and support our employees to be 
self‑motivated and to realise their career potential. We work 
with all our employees closely and encourage those who 
show keenness and desire to develop new personal skills 
and experience. 
We value regular communication and feedback 
with employees which helps enhance the efficiency, 
effectiveness and safety of everyday activities and overall 
operational performance.
Non‑Egyptian foreign experts are required onsite for 
their expertise and experience in the mining industry, 
and to enable their skills and experiences to be shared 
under programmes to further train and develop 
Egyptian nationals.

Resource management 
Systems and procedures are in place to ensure correct and 
safe handling of chemicals and hazardous materials.
Risk assessments are carried out for handling and usage 
of all chemicals and hazardous materials. Controls in 
place include containment, automatic alarm and shut‑off 
systems. Preventative maintenance programs for tanks 
and equipment are also in place. Emergency response 
plans and facilities ranging from spill kits and eye wash 
stations to chemical suits address potential requirements 
for responding to chemical or hazardous waste spillages 
or incidents.
We fully acknowledge the importance of managing 
chemicals in a sound manner so as to minimise harm 
to the environment or the health of employees. Hazard 
communication and chemical management handling is 
a core training programme in our continuous education 
system. The systems in place set safe conditions for the 
transportation, storage, labelling and handling of chemicals.
Water management and groundwater protection 
We recognise responsible water use is a key component for 
our sustainability programme and our policies commit us to 
conserve natural resources.
As a result, we closely monitor our water use, strive to 
reduce our water footprint and take steps to safeguard 
water quality.
Water is a critical component to our processes and thus it 
is essential to secure a sustainable source of water for our 
operations. In an area with limited fresh water resources or 
municipal water, we rely on a sea water intake and pipeline 
from the Red Sea to provide a sustainable water supply to 
the mine.
As a secondary source of water, we have beach wells where 
sea water infiltrates into groundwater. We have desalination 
plants for generating fresh water for the process plant and 
for domestic use. 
Case study – career progression
Mr Nagy Abdou, Senior Production Supervisor
Mr Abdou, a graduate of intermediate industrial 
schools, first came to Sukari in the exploration phase. 
Trained as an equipment operator working primarily 
with the machinery designed for early stage leveling 
and exploration drilling, his potential was soon noticed 
and he was promoted as a leading hand. 
Mr Abdou recalls that this period of his career 
helped him to realise the importance of planning 
and managing people. 
As an individual with the desire to grasp new 
knowledge and skills, whose passion for the job was 
recognised by his supervisors, he gained experience 
from expatriate employees who provided him with 
comprehensive theoretical and practical training 
and coaching. 
Mr Abdou was then promoted to a production 
supervisor. His practical experience with equipment 
made him aware of the efficiency potential and 
limitations of the equipment he was handling. 
As well as understanding the equipment required for the 
operation, Mr Abdou can now discuss mining design 
models and plans with the geologists onsite. He hopes 
to be able to prepare mine design models one day. 
In addition to creating a positive work environment, the 
Company believes it is important that employees enjoy their 
time before and after work. The majority of our people live 
in the Sukari camp, and thus we have invested in a variety 
of leisure facilities such as playing fields, a gymnasium, a 
library, internet access, satellite television and a swimming 
pool. Special barbecue dinners are also held at the 
beach or around Sukari and sports tournaments are 
regularly organised.
The environment
Our Policies outline our commitment to environmental 
responsibility. Safeguarding the environment, and coaching 
and training our employees to reduce the impact of our 
activities are essential parts of our operations. 
We remain committed to maintaining, and whenever 
possible exceeding, the high level of environmental 
performance that we have achieved during 2013.
Maintaining an environmentally responsible culture 
We run a well‑established programme for training and 
awareness of environmental impacts. The programme 
addresses different environmental fields including 
chemical management, waste management, emissions 
and water conservation, as well as general environmental 
management practices.

Corporate social responsibility statement continued
The sea water pumped to site is used, and re‑used 
throughout the process plant ensuring maximum usage of 
this resource without needlessly taking more water from the 
intake pipeline.
Groundwater protection measures have been incorporated 
in the design of the tailing storage facility and other 
components where a layer of gypsum and a HPDE liner 
are used to prevent seepage. Workshops have concrete 
working areas to prevent seepage. Five monitoring bores 
are downstream from the tailing storage facility to detect 
any potential contamination. In 2013, the monitoring of 
these bores showed no contamination.
Desalinated water used in camps and offices is tested to 
ensure its quality accords with chemical and bacteriologic 
parameters. Bottled water used for drinking is also 
periodically tested as a double check on suppliers and 
storage procedures. All samples are compliant with 
Egyptian legal requirements.
Energy
Marsa Alam, the region in which the Sukari mine is located, 
is a remote area with no direct connection to any power 
grid. The city has its own power plant whose capacity 
is only sufficient for residential uses and not suitable for 
industrial needs. 
Consequently, the project at Sukari powers the entire 
processing plant through our own diesel power 
station onsite.
A review of alternative fuel sources to supply the processing 
plant is ongoing. 
Emissions, effluents and wastes
Programmes are in place to manage emissions, effluents, 
non‑process waste, waste rock and tailings. All our industrial 
water streams are re‑circulated within our operations. 
Sewage is treated in a tertiary wastewater treatment plant 
and the treated water is used in landscaping. To ensure 
effective performance periodic checks and inspections are 
conducted on the treated wastewater.
Our monitoring activities in 2013 confirmed that we 
remained within legal requirements and international best 
practice standards in respect of the following areas:
•	 ambient air quality in the camp area (in terms of dust 
and emissions);
•	 dust concentration in different work areas;
•	 noise and illumination;
•	 work environment emissions, including carbon 
monoxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia;
•	 stack emissions due to fuel combustion;
•	 quality of treated wastewater; and
•	 quality of groundwater.
We maintain a salvage area where valuable wastes are 
temporarily stored until transferred offsite or recycled in 
different areas onsite.
Biodiversity
Centamin is committed to protecting the wildlife unique 
to the eastern desert by minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We are conscious that the 
sea near Sukari is renowned for its crystal‑clear water, and 
includes a variety of coral reefs and marine biota. The desert 
environment is characterised by its scarce terrestrial 
biodiversity resources, and the area of Marsa Alam also 
includes the Wadi El‑Gemal Protectorate, one of Egypt’s 
largest environmental protectorates, with about 100km of 
pure beach and desert landscapes. 
Biodiversity conservation principles were integrated into the 
project design for Sukari from the outset and are applied to 
all of our activities. 
While we maintained careful monitoring of areas of potential 
concern, such as migratory bird movement across the area, 
there were no incidents reported of adverse impact on 
wildlife as a result of operations at Sukari during 2013. 
Land management and rehabilitation
Mining is a business that deals directly with natural 
resources and it is inevitable that land will be disturbed. 
For our part, we are committed to leaving a positive legacy 
for coming generations and development initiatives. 
Accordingly, upon closure, the goal is to transfer Sukari 
to a stable and self‑sustaining condition, after taking into 
account the beneficial uses of the site and surrounding land. 
Due consideration shall be given to environmental and 
social impacts to avoid long‑term challenges for parties that 
might live close by or depend on the area.
The planning for the closure of the mine aims to ensure 
that mining activities are soundly phased out, the mine is 
closed in an environmentally sound manner, a physically 
and chemically stable landform is maintained, with minimal 
erosion and minimal potential for dust generation and that 
the hazards are reduced to levels equal to or below those 
naturally existing within the surrounding environment. 
A draft restoration and rehabilitation plan is updated 
each year. A provision for restoration and rehabilitation 
is included in the annual budget. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of 
the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation 
at the reporting date. 
In addition to the long‑term rehabilitation plan, we 
undertake short‑term rehabilitation and restoration activities 
especially for construction sites and for spills. As mentioned, 
we have a wide range of spill kits and personnel are trained 
for clean‑up operations. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Community and society
Centamin recognises that it has a responsibility to support 
and enhance the community in which it operates, and 
to minimise our impacts on the environment and local 
people at every stage of our activities. We consider good 
community relations as a key component of continued 
operational success as well as a corporate requirement. 
We are committed to acting at all times in a socially 
responsible manner. 
Stakeholder engagement
We attach considerable importance to maintaining dialogue 
with the local community in areas in which we operate. 
A public consultation system has been in place at Sukari 
since the project design phase, and during the construction 
phase. With mining in operation we have maintained open 
channels of communication with all our stakeholders for the 
purpose of information disclosure. 
In providing opportunities for raising concerns 
and grievances we have been pleased to find that 
throughout 2013, as in previous years, the Sukari mine 
continues to be welcomed by the local community and 
government authorities.
Community development initiatives
We have supported infrastructure and services in Marsa 
Alam for a number of years. The initiatives include:
•	 providing the Bedouin with food waste to use as 
animal fodder;
•	 continuing to support a neighbouring 
Bedouin settlement;
•	 supporting the refurbishment of mosques and 
youth centres;
•	 furnishing schools and finance maintenance activities;
•	 supporting the celebration of local community and 
cultural events; and
•	 supporting the treatment of Bedouin children in 
the hospital.
Preparatory work was undertaken in 2013 for a number 
of community projects that will be announced and 
implemented in 2014.
We strongly contribute to the employment from Upper 
Egypt. Where possible, we tender contracts to local 
companies to aid local economic activity and progress. 
Across Egypt, we use local suppliers and contractors 
wherever possible, providing jobs and income to a much 
larger group of people than our direct employees.
We provide summer training to students from the Egyptian 
universities every year. In 2013 we trained 42 students from 
various faculties of science, geology and engineering and 
mining. University students are given an induction course 
and then sent to their respective departments for on‑the‑job 
training. They are required to prepare and present reports 
at the end of the training, which provides a unique 
opportunity for a practical interaction with modern mining 
and processing.
Eastern Desert dwellers

Case study – knowing your neighbours 
Ababda: eastern desert dwellers
The Ababda are nomads living in the eastern desert 
and Red Sea mountains in south‑ east Egypt. Ababda 
prefer to think of themselves as Arab Bedouin, and 
not Beja, the more settled local population of the 
region. They are often only able to speak Arabic. 
Traditionally, Ababda lived as desert nomads herding 
camels and goats in the northern reaches of the eastern 
desert. By the 1920s, most Ababda were settled, only 
venturing into the desert when necessary.
Many Ababda now live in towns and villages in the Nile 
Valley and the Red Sea coast, and find employment 
in fishing, as truck drivers, or as day labour and, 
increasingly, in tourism. Others, who cling to the 
traditional way of life, still move through the desert 
with their herds of goats and sheep.
Whether living in small settlements along the coast 
or as isolated families in the mountains living in huts, 
or in natural caves, as did their ancestors in classic 
times, the Ababda Bedouin are a hearty, hospitable, 
exuberant and resourceful people who live in one of the 
most demanding regions of the world. They know and 
respect the desert and the environment.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Overview
Centamin is a mineral exploration, development and mining company that has been active in Egypt since 1995. 
The Company’s principal asset is the Sukari Gold Mine, which is located in the Eastern Desert approximately 900km from 
Cairo and 25km from the Red Sea. First gold was poured at Sukari on 26 June 2009, and was followed by four successive 
years of growth, from approximately 150,000 ounces in 2010 to c.357,000oz in 2013. The doubling of plant throughput 
to a nameplate rate of 10 million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”) will see another significant step‑up in 2014 as Sukari heads 
towards the long‑term target production rate of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015. Exploration at Sukari Hill and 
over the rest of the Sukari concession area is continuing, with further significant resource and reserve growth expected, 
particularly from the high grade underground mine areas.
Centamin’s management team and Board of Directors have considerable expertise in the gold mining industry. This ranges 
from the early stage identification of deposits, project financing, construction and development, to the operating of large 
mines. Some of the leadership team has been based at Sukari for almost a decade, taking it from an early stage exploration 
project to the operating gold mine it is today.
Centamin’s operating experience gives it a significant advantage in acquiring and developing other gold projects.  
In 2013 Centamin agreed a recommended takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd and formed a joint venture 
with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc, adding highly prospective licence packages in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia respectively. 
Accounting for Sukari Gold Mines
The operating company of Sukari, Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”), is jointly owned by Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) 
and the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (“EMRA”) on a 50% equal basis. For accounting purposes, SGM is 100% 
proportional consolidated within the Centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the provisions of which are described more fully below, PGM solely 
funds SGM’s activities. PGM is also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue 
(excluding the royalty payable to the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) (i) all current operating expenses incurred and 
paid after the initial commercial production; (ii) exploration costs, including those accumulated to the commencement 
of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum); and (iii) exploitation capital 
costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of 
total accumulated cost per annum). Legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is 
completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
Since the commencement of commercial production on 1 April 2010, the cash flows generated by SGM through the sale of 
gold are used to fund the ongoing operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund the cost recovery due to PGM 
for exploration and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum. 
In return, ongoing capital expenditure incurred in connection with the Sukari mine is funded solely by PGM out of cash flows 
received from SGM through the cost recovery process as described above. The expenditure incurred by PGM in relation to 
Stage 4 will become recoverable once the infrastructure has been commissioned, which is currently planned at the end of 
2013, at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum. Legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA 
when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus “profit share” (defined as revenue less payment of the 3% 
production royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). Based on the Company’s calculation there was no Net Profit Share due to 
EMRA as at 30 June 2013, nor is any likely to be due as at 30 June 2014. It is expected that there will be a net production 
surplus (revenue in excess of production royalty and cost recoveries) available for sharing between EMRA and PGM for 
the SGM financial year ending 30 June 2015 (SGM’s accounting period is 1 July to 30 June) based on current gold prices, 
production forecasts and operating expenses. Any disruption to operations or reduction in gold price realised will delay this 
profit sharing. This expected profit sharing takes into account the costs incurred on paying for fuel at international prices.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Any recovery of these prepayments, discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements, will result in further amounts to be 
shared between EMRA and PGM. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement 
will be recognised as a variable charge to the income statement of Centamin, which will lead to a reduction in the earnings 
per share. Separate accounts are prepared in respect of SGM. These are independently audited and certified by Egyptian 
certified accountants approved by EMRA. Any expected profit share payable to EMRA and PGM becomes payable on 
completion of the audit of the SGM accounts. Centamin will be working together with EMRA to ensure that these can be 
approved as soon as possible so that the profit share can be paid to EMRA and PGM. Centamin is looking forward to paying 
the first profit share to EMRA. With a view to demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, PGM has made 
advance payments to EMRA which will be netted off against any future profit share that becomes payable to EMRA.
Highlights for the year
 (1) (2) (3)
Centamin delivered strong operational and financial results in 2013, producing 356,943 ounces of gold (2012: 262,828 
ounces) and generating profit after tax for the year of US$184.0 million (2012: US$199.0 million). Centamin has continued 
to return strong earnings and cash flow generation despite the weaker gold price environment, owing to the Group’s 
emphasis on maximising productivity and maintaining rigorous cost control. Now in its fifth year of production, the Sukari 
Gold Mine remains highly cash generative, with EBITDA of US$234.2 million (2012: US$233.3 million). Centamin has a 
robust cash and cash equivalents balance of US$106.0 million (2012: US$147.1 million) as at 31 December 2013.
2013 saw the Sukari operation performing well across all areas. Most notably, the processing plant operated consistently 
at c.15% above nameplate capacity and the output from the underground mine continued to rise quarter‑on‑quarter to end 
the year at levels significantly above original expectations. The completion of construction of the Stage 4 plant expansion, 
which is currently under commissioning, sets the stage for the next step‑up in production towards Sukari’s long‑term target 
of 450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015 onwards. 
An updated resource and reserve statement for Sukari was announced on 18 December 2013, with the total Measured 
and Indicated resource containing 13.4 million ounces (“Moz”) and the total reserve containing 8.2Moz. The underground 
reserve of 2.30 million tonnes (“Mt”) represented a 120% increase on the December 2011 reserve, despite mining 
depletion. We remain confident of further significant reserve expansion, with the 0.52Mt Proven component of 
this reserve showing a grade of 11.4g/t gold, and continued positive results from ongoing drilling into the target 
high‑grade extensions.
The Company progressed its medium and long‑term growth strategy during 2013. In September, Centamin entered into a 
joint venture with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc over their exploration projects in Ethiopia, thus expanding the Company’s 
presence in this important region of focus. A recommended all‑share takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, 
valued at A$40.9 million, was announced on 10 December 2013. This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive 
licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 100km+ trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso. 
Centamin will implement a systematic exploration programme, aimed at developing the potential for further substantial 
growth of the existing resource base comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred.
Centamin remains in a robust position to continue delivering on its track record of production growth and solid cash flow 
generation during 2014 and beyond, as shown by the following:
•	 basic earnings per share 16.87 cents, down 8% on prior year;
•	 record EBITDA US$234.2 million, up 1% on the prior year;
•	 full year production was 356,943, a 36% increase on 2012 and above guidance of 320,000 ounces;
•	 cash costs of production of US$663 per ounce;
•	 Stage 4 plant expansion (to nameplate capacity of 10Mtpa) expenditure at the year end was US$327.8 million of the 
reforecast cost of US$331.2 million, including contingency;
•	 Centamin remains debt‑free and unhedged with cash, bullion on hand, gold sales receivable and available‑for‑sale 
financial assets of US$142.5 million as at 31 December 2013; and
•	 the Supreme Administrative Court appeal and Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) Court Case are both ongoing. Both of these 
cases are described in detail elsewhere in this MD&A (refer to the section headed “Egyptian Court Litigation” below). 
Operations continue as normal and any enforcement of the Administrative Court decision has been suspended pending 
the appeal ruling. We remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved in both cases.
With respect to the DFO case, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from 
the government and, for this reason, has fully provided against the cumulative prepayment of US$97.0 million as an 
exceptional item (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements). In the meantime the Group is continuing to pay international 
prices for DFO. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Centamin produced 356,943 ounces of gold in 2013, which is a 36% increase on 262,828 ounces in 2012. The higher 
year‑on‑year production was a result of: (a) a 26% increase in tonnes milled (to 5.7Mt) due to the improved plant 
productivity and availability, (b) an 50% increase in production from the underground due to improved underground mining 
contractor equipment availability, and (c) a 4% higher feed grade to the mills (2.12g/t in 2013 compared to 2.04g/t in 2012) 
as underground productivity and head grades increased.
Open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 41,718kt for the year, an increase of 66% on the prior year. The increase 
in total material movement was related to increase in the mining fleet capacity during the year. Additional mining 
equipment will continue to be delivered during the first half of 2014.
As part of the implementation of Stage 4, the Company is in discussions with EMRA and other government departments in 
relation to increasing the daily usage of ammonium nitrate (“AN”) in order to increase open pit mining rates to the required 
level to feed the expanded plant. The increase in the daily issue of AN is still outstanding and this has had an impact on 
the movement of waste material compared to the current mining plan. However from recent meetings with the relevant 
authorities, management believe government approval is now in its final stages. 
Ore production from the open pit was 11.7Mt at 0.81g/t with an average head grade fed to the plant of 1.25g/t. The ROM 
ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 1.8kt by the end of the year. Mining was primarily from the Stage 3 area, in the 
Stage 2 area mining continued to the 950RL and development work progressed in the Gazelle and Eastern Hills area to 
the 1100RL. 
Underground mine
Ore production from the underground mine was 587kt. The ratio of ore from stoping versus development remained 
consistent year on year, with 52% of development ore (304kt) and 48% of stoping ore (283kt). Ore production from stoping 
and development was in line with forecasts. Development and stoping requirements were increased in the second half 
of 2013. 
A total of 11,620 metres of diamond drilling was completed for both short‑term stope definition and underground resource 
development. During the year 3,786m of development were driven through ore. The project development total to date is 
15,766m, of which 9,200m were through ore.
As part of the development of the Ptah area, the first crosscut to access the 845, 860, 875 and 890 levels has been 
completed. Three exploration drill cubbies have been established where drilling is actively taking place Ore drives have 
been developed on the Ptah 875 level and the exhaust system was extended to the 875 level crosscut. 
Processing
The annual throughput in the Sukari plant was 5.7Mt in 2013, a 27% increase on 2012 (4.5Mt). Productivity of the 
processing plant averaged 700tph for the year, 12% above the nameplate design rate of 625tph, as the operations team 
continued to optimise availability and throughput.
Plant metallurgical recoveries were 88.6% in the year, a 2.6% increase on 2012. Continued optimisation of operational 
controls and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery steadily increasing throughout the year. Whilst operational 
improvements are being made, recoveries are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon regeneration kiln is 
commissioned in 2014.
The dump leach operation produced 12,382oz in 2013, an 85% increase from 2012.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Operational review continued
Stage 4 expansion
Construction continued on Stage 4 of the process plant expansion, which commenced in late 2011 and will expand Sukari 
nameplate capacity from 5Mtpa to 10Mtpa. The estimated capital cost of the Stage 4 expansion, which is funded by PGM 
out of cost recoveries, is US$331.2 million including contingency, with expenditure to date of US$327.8 million. 
Main plant
The processing plant was 97% completed at the end of December. Electrical instrumentation and piping work remained 
outstanding at the end of the period. Commissioning of the new conveyor to the COSP took place in December together 
with direction testing of various motors and pumps. 
Power station
The new Wartsila plant has been completed, and was handed over to operations in October.
Sea water pipeline
The seawater pipeline was completed in December and handed over to operations.
Tailings storage facility
Construction of the facility is 100% complete and the TSF is in operation.

Exploration update
Sukari Hill
Centamin has resources (as of 30 July 2013) of 13.4 million ounces Measured and Indicated, and 1.9 million ounces 
Inferred, and reserves (as of 30 September 2013) of 8.2 million ounces. Underground drilling continued to be stepped‑up 
during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions 
of the deposit. Underground drilling is utilising 4 Longyear LM90 rigs. These rigs have been located in the Ptah decline, 
drilling east through both the eastern and the western contact of the porphyry and in the Amun area, drilling outwards east 
and west from the within the porphyry. The ore body has neither yet been closed off by drilling to the north, nor at depth. 
Further exploration of the Sukari deposit will take place during 2014, predominantly from positions within the porphyry in 
both the Amun and Ptah areas. 
Regional exploration
Reverse circulation and diamond drilling programmes have been under way on the Quartz Ridge, V‑Shear and Kurdeman 
prospects to the east, north‑east and south of the hill respectively during 2013. Ongoing drilling to the south at the 
Kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fast‑track near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing production. 
Further regional drilling of the Sukari licence is planned for 2014. 
Growth beyond Sukari
Centamin continued exploration on its four tenements in northern Ethiopia where drilling has confirmed the presence of 
low grade mineralisation.
In September 2013 Centamin entered into joint venture with Alecto Minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities 
identified by Alecto in Ethiopia. The initial joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences Wayu Boda and Aysid 
Meketel where exploration activities have now commenced.
A recommended all‑share takeover offer for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd, was announced on 10 December 2013. 
This takeover provides Centamin with an extensive licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored +100km 
trend of gold mineralisation in Burkina Faso, as well as further exploration properties in Côte d’Ivoire. Centamin will 
implement a systematic exploration program, aimed at developing the outstanding potential for further significant growth 
of the existing resource base, comprising 1.92Moz Indicated and 1.33Moz Inferred.

Results of operations
The Group recorded net profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2013 of US$184.0 million 
(2012: US$198.6 million). The decrease is driven primarily by the lower gold price which was offset by higher 
volumes of gold sold and lower costs due to management’s rigorous cost control.

January 2012, refer to Note 6 to the financial statements for further details. 
Revenue reported comprises proceeds from gold sales and silver sales. Revenue has increased by 18% to US$503.8 million, 
as a result of a 43% increase in gold sold to 363,576oz offset by a 17% decrease in the average gold price to US$1,384 
per ounce. 
Cost of sales represents the cost of mining, processing, refinery, transport, site administration and depreciation and 
amortisation, as well as preproduction costs incurred prior to commercial production and movement in production 
inventory. Cost of sales has increased by 37% to US$277.4 million, as a result of:
(a) a 35% increase in mine production costs to US$237.7 million, primarily due to an increase in activity year on year with  
tonnes moved increasing by 67% and tonnes treated by 26%; 
(b) a 43% increase in depreciation and amortisation from US$35.6 million to US$50.8 million, a result of an increase in the 
underlying and mine development properties; offset by
(c) a US$11.1 million credit for movement in production inventory a result of an increased addition to the ROM ore 
stockpile and the year on year decrease in gold in circuit at year end.
Finance income reported comprises interest revenue applicable on the Company’s available cash and term deposit 
amounts. The movements in finance income are in line with the movements in the Company’s available cash and term 
deposit amounts.
Other comprehensive income has increased by US$9.6 million as a result of the cumulative loss that had been recognised 
in other comprehensive income being reclassified from equity to profit.

Current assets have decreased by US$13.6 million to US$269.3 million, as a result of:
(a)  US$55.6 million in relation to funds advanced to our fuel supplier, Chevron, to ensure the continuous supply of fuel 
for our operations whilst negotiations are ongoing with the Egyptian government on the path forward for fuel subsidies; 
(b) the self‑funding of the Stage 4 expansion amounting to a cash outflow of US$99.3 million; and
(c) offsetting these decreases is a US$15.3 million decrease in gold sale receivables, the transfer of the available‑for‑sale 
financial assets from non‑current assets to current assets as described below, and a US$40.6 million increase in inventory 
to US$135.3 million. Stores inventory has increased by US$29.5 million to US$101.4 million in preparation for the

expenditure in relation to Sheba tenements in northern Ethiopia;
(e) available‑for‑sale financial assets have decreased by US$4.6 million to US$1.0 million as a result of:
•	 a US$6.3 million devaluation (including foreign exchange loss) in the shares held in Nyota;
•	 the sale of a total of 60 million shares in Nyota for US$0.8 million; both offset by

mining fleet expansion, US$16.2 million for open pit development, US$29.5 million for underground development, 
US$1.7 million for mine development properties and US$28.1 million for other sustaining capital expenditure); offset by
(h) a depreciation and amortisation charge of US$50.9 million. 
Current liabilities have increased by US$18.7 million to US$78.2 million as a result of the addition to the open pit 
mining fleet.
Non‑current liabilities reported during the period have increased by US$2.1 million as a result of:
(a) a change in estimate of the future rehabilitation costs; and
(b) the unwinding of the discount on the provision for rehabilitation.
There has been no movement in issued capital.
Reserves reported have increased by US$2.3 million to US$5.7 million as result of the recognition of the share‑ based 
payments expense.
Accumulated profits increased by US$190.7 million as a result of the increase in the profit for the year attributable to the 
shareholders of the Company of US$184.0 million together with a US$6.8 million gain on available‑for‑sale financial assets as a 
result of the cumulative loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified from equity to profit.
Current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities. The decrease in the current ratio is a result 
of the increase in current liabilities driven by the rise in supply relating to higher production at the Sukari Gold Mine and an 
increase in the payables in relation to the open pit mining fleet.
The return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company 
for the period by total shareholders’ equity and measures the return on ownership. The return on equity ratio showed a 
decrease from 20 for 2012 to 16 for 2013 as a result of the increase in the shareholders equity.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Net cash flows generated by operating activities comprise receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, offset 
by operating and corporate administration costs. Cash flows have increased by US$24.6 million to US$245.1 million, 
primarily attributable to:
(a) an increase in revenue, due to higher gold sales volumes offset by a lower average realised price; and
(b) an increase in cash flows in relation to receivables and payables; both offset by
•	 a decrease in gross margins as a result of the decrease in the average realised gold price; and
•	 an increase in cash flows in relation to inventories and prepayments, in preparation for the increase of the processing 
plant throughput as Stage 4 comes online.
Net cash flows used in investing activities comprise exploration expenditure and capital development expenditures 
at Sukari including the acquisition of financial and mineral assets. Cash flows have decreased by US$39.0 million to 
US$282.8 million. The primary use of the funds during the year was for investment in capital work‑in‑progress in relation to 
the Stage 4 development. In addition cash used in the purchase of available‑for‑sale financial assets was US$2.5 million, 
offset by proceeds received from the sale of available‑for‑sale financial assets of US$0.8 million compared to an outflow of 
US$6.4 million in 2012.
Net cash flows generated by financing activities in the prior year comprised the exercising of shares issued under the 
Company’s Loan Funded Share Plans (“LFSPs”) and options under the Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) respectively. 
There were no such cash flows in the current financial year.
Effects of exchange rate changes have decreased by US$6.3 million as a result of the poor performance of the A$ to 
the US$.

removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012 (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements for further details).
The Company’s results over the past several quarters have been driven primarily by fluctuations in gold price and 
increases in gold equivalent ounces produced. Additionally, increases in input costs and foreign exchange rates have 
impacted results.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, revenue increased to US$111.2 million on gold equivalent ounces sold of 88,856 
compared with revenue of US$138.5 million on sales of 82,316 gold equivalent ounces during the fourth quarter of 2012. 
The average realised gold price per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2012 was US$1,697 compared with the average realised 
gold price during this quarter of US$1,384 per ounce. 
Cost of sales decreased by 9% to US$72.4 million in the final quarter of 2013 versus US$79.5 million in the prior year, 
and although there were underlying increased costs in the mining area and processing area as a result of increased 
activity quarter on quarter with tonnes moved increasing by 43% and tonnes treated by 14%, Q4 2012 included the full 
exceptional provision against prepayments to reflect the removal of the fuel subsidy which occurred in January 2012.
Liquidity and capital resources
At 31 December 2013, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of US$106.0 million compared to US$147.1 million at 
31 December 2012. The majority of funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term higher interest money 
market deposits. The decrease in cash position is primarily due to the payments in relation to the Stage 4 processing plant 
development together with unfavourable gold prices and the inclusion of an exceptional provision against prepayments to 
reflect the removal of fuel subsidies offset with increased production. 
Centamin has a strong and flexible financial position with no debt, no hedging and cash and cash equivalents, bullion 
on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets of US$142.5 million at 31 December 2013. 
Cash and cash equivalents, bullion on hand, gold sales receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets is a non‑GAAP 
financial measure.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Liquidity and capital resources continued
Liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having access to sufficient funds to meet planned and unplanned cash 
requirements. Centamin manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels 
are well above minimum company requirements.
Trade and other payables increased from US$54.6 million to US$78.1 million reflecting the amounts owed for mining 
equipment, which were needed to move the additional material, in readiness for Stage 4.
In the day‑ to‑ day business, the Group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that 
capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. 
The Group’ s primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow. The principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is cost, 
gold prices, timing of gold sales and the legal actions in relation to the Concession Agreement and subsidy for diesel fuel oil.
The Group’s financial commitments are limited to planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the Sukari 
Gold Mine, planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the exploration licences owned by Sheba, 
administration expenditure at the Egyptian, Australian, Jersey and Ethiopian office locations and for general working 
capital purposes.
Management considers that the Group has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage 
liquidity risks arising from settlement of current liabilities and non‑current liabilities.
We had no debt for both the 2013 and the 2012 period.

Segment disclosure
The Group is engaged in the business of exploration and production of precious metals only, which is characterised as one 
business segment only. See Note 8 to the financial statements.
Significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3 to the financial statements, 
management is required to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience 
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making the judgments. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could, affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari in 
the manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. The details of this litigation, which relate 
to the loss of the Egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the Group to operate outside the area of 
3km
2
 determined by the Administrative Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are available 
in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not 
currently possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km
2
. 
Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
41
Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including the making of formal legal appeals and, although their 
resolution may take some time, management remains confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved. 
In the meantime, however, the Group is continuing to pay international prices for Diesel Fuel Oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application to 
suspend this decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that 
normal operations would be able to continue during this process.
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure 
being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction 
activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the 
existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and 
circumstances, in particular whether the Group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether 
an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Such estimates and assumptions may change from period 
to period as new information becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being 
capitalised, a judgment is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, the relevant 
capitalised amount will be written off to the income statement.
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 23 to the financial statements).
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing 
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into account the 
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of 
the affected areas. The provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount 
rates and production costs for future cash flows. It also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models. 
The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. Changes 
in ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation 
assets and deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and 
reserve growth. It is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, 
based on current information. However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for 
further reserve definition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth 
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production 
used in depreciation calculations.
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the Sukari mine is based on reserve estimates. 
Management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition, 
the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground 
mine development. 
Depreciation of the Sukari plant
Sukari plant, capitalised within plant and equipment, is depreciated on a straight‑ line basis over a 45 year economic life. 
When determining the useful economic life of the plant, management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead 
to future reserves increases at the Sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine, which is 2029 
based on current reserves. Management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its 
current expiry date of 2035. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
42
Accounting policies
The Group adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements for further details. 
There have been no further changes to the Group’s accounting policies during the year. 
Going concern statement
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in this business review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are also described in this business review above. In addition, Note 26 to the financial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in Note 26 to the financial statements, the Group meets its day‑ to‑ day working capital requirements through 
cash generated by its operations. The current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of 
demand of the Group’s products; (b) the price at which its products can be sold; and (c) the price at which its main raw 
materials can be procured. 
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group should be able to continue generating sufficient cash in order to finance its operations and capital expansions. 
During the year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. The first of these followed from a decision 
taken by EGPC to charge international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and the second arose 
as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court of first instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the Company’s 
160km
2
 exploitation lease. In relation to the first decision, the Company remains confident that in the event that it is 
required to continue to pay international prices, the mine at Sukari will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the Company 
remains confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the Administrative Court will ultimately be 
successful, although final resolution of it may take some time. On 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld 
the Company’s application to suspend the decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, 
thus providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process. A detailed summary of the 
litigation is available at Note 20 to the financial statements.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are 
restricted to a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern.
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Non‑GAAP financial measures 
Three non‑GAAP financial measures are used in this report:
(1) EBITDA: “EBITDA” is a non‑GAAP financial measure, which excludes the following from profit before tax:
•	 finance costs;
•	 finance income; and
•	 depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the Group’s ability to generate liquidity by producing 
operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is also frequently used by 
investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that is 
based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total 
enterprise value of a company. EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and 
does not have any standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs and income 
of financing activities and taxes, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from 
operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA differently. The following table provides 
a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the year attributable to the Company.

subsidies (refer to Note 6 to the financial statements for further details).
(2) Cash cost per ounce calculation: “cash costs per ounce” is a non‑GAAP financial measure. Cash cost per ounce 
is a measure of the average cost of producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a 
period by the total gold production over the same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less 
administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and amortisation. Management uses this measure internally to better 
assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional 
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors use such non‑GAAP information to evaluate the 
Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. The Company believes that these measures provide an 
alternative reflection of the Group’s performance for the current period and are an alternative indication of its expected 
performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional information, does not have any standardised 
meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance 
prepared in accordance with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from 
operations as determined under GAAP . Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

Internal controls
Financial reporting controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is 
gathered and reported to management, including the CEO, CFO and COO, on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions 
can be made regarding public disclosure. Management, with the participation of the certifying officers, has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the design and operation, as of 31 December 2013, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures 
(as defined by the Canadian Securities Administrators). Based on that evaluation, the certifying officers have concluded 
that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to the 
Company and its subsidiaries is made known to them by others within those entities. 
Internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our 
financial reporting and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in our financial statements. Management 
evaluated at implementation the design of internal controls over financial reporting and has concluded that such internal 
controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”). In addition, there have been no changes in the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting during the year ended 31 December 2013 that have materially affected, or are 
reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
Financial instruments
At 31 December 2013, the Group has exposure to interest rate risk which is limited to the floating market rate for cash.
The Group does not have foreign currency risk for non‑monetary assets and liabilities of the Egyptian operations as these 
are deemed to have a functional currency of United States dollars. The Group has no significant monetary foreign currency 
assets and liabilities apart from Australian dollar and United States dollar cash term deposits.
The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign 
currency risks.
Foreign investment in Egypt
Foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors in Egypt are governed by individual production sharing 
agreements (concession agreements) between foreign companies and the Ministry for Petroleum and Mineral Resources 
or the Egyptian Mineral Resource Authority (“EMRA”) (as the case may be) and are individual Acts of Parliament.
Title, exploitation and development rights to the Sukari Gold Mine are granted under the terms of the Concession 
Agreement promulgated as Law No. 222 of 1994, signed on 29 January 1995 and effective from 13 June 1995. 
The Concession Agreement was issued by way of Presidential Decree after the approval of the People’s Assembly in 
accordance with the Egyptian Constitution and Law No. 61 of 1958. The Concession Agreement was issued in accordance 
with the Egyptian Mines and Quarries Law No. 86 of 1956 which allows for the Ministry to grant the right to parties to 
explore and mine for minerals in Egypt.
Whilst the Company is the first foreign company to develop a modern large‑scale gold mine in Egypt there is significant 
foreign investment in the petroleum sector. Several large multinational oil and gas companies operate successfully in 
Egypt, some of which have long histories in the country and have dedicated significant amounts of capital. The Company 
believes that the successful track record of foreign investment established by these companies in the petroleum sector is 
an important indication of the ability of foreign companies to attract financing and receive development approvals for the 
construction of major mining projects in Egypt.
Egyptian court litigation 
As discussed elsewhere in this document the Company was involved in two separate actions. The first followed from a 
decision taken by EGPC to charge international, not local prices (subsidised), prices for the supply of Diesel Fuel Oil, and 
the second arose as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court of first instance in Cairo in relation to the Company’s 
160km
2
 exploitation lease. 
Concession agreement court case
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was  
entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s  
wholly‑ owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as Law 222 of 1994.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient 
evidence had been submitted to Court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2 
“exploitation lease” between PGM 
and EMRA had received approval from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. 
Accordingly, the Court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated 
that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister of 
Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notification of the judgment the Group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. 
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the 
initial decision until such time as the Court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the 
Court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations will be 
able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal was 
lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter 
publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the exploitation lease was 
valid. The Minister of Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to the 
country. The Company believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at Sukari and the 
desire to stimulate further investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process 
in Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading 
Egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km
2
 
exploitation lease. The Company therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will 
ultimately be successful. 
In the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the Group, 
the operations at Sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the Group’s operation exceeds the exploitation 
lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original court decision.
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is under way. 
Centamin does not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of Egypt as Centamin remains of the belief 
that the Egyptian Court will rule in Centamin’s favour.
Further details about this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual 
Information Form (“AIF”) which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Diesel fuel court case
In January 2012 the Group received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue 
supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices, thereby adding approximately 
US$150 per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron 
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). Subsequent to 
this first letter, the Group received a demand from Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”) for LE403 million 
(US$60 million) being the amount of the subsidy received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from December 2009 
until January 2012.
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in consequence in June lodged an appeal against EGPC’s 
decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is 
good prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the Group has 
since January advanced funds to our fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the international price for fuel. Further details about 
this litigation are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed AIF which will be available on 
SEDAR at www.sedar.com. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Overview of Sukari concession agreement
Pharaoh Gold Mines NL (“PGM”) a 100% wholly‑ owned subsidiary of the Company, EGSMA (now “EMRA”) and the Arab 
Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) entered into the Concession Agreement dated 29 January 1995, granting PGM and EMRA the 
right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas located in the Eastern 
Desert of Egypt identified in the Concession Agreement. The Concession Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law 
on 13 June 1995.
A summary of the main terms of the Concession Agreement is as follows:
•	 PGM provides funding to the Operating Company, Sukari Gold Mining Company, (“SGM”) and is responsible for the 
day‑to‑day management of that company;
•	 PGM is entitled to recover: 
• 	 	 all 	 curr ent 	 operating 	 expenses 	 incurr ed 	 and 	 paid 	 after 	 the 	 initial 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction;
• 		 	 exploration 	 costs, 	 including 	 those 	 accumulated 	 to 	 the 	 commencement 	 of 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction 	 (at 	 the 	 rate 	 of	
33.3% per annum); and
• 		 	 exploitation 	 capital 	 costs, 	 including 	 those 	 accumulated 	 prior 	 to 	 the 	 commencement 	 of 	 commer cial 	 pr oduction 	 (at 	 the	
rate of 33.3% per annum).
•	 the ARE is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals from the Sukari 
Gold Mine;
•	 commencing on the date of commercial production, SGM and PGM is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government, with an option to file an application to extend this entitlement for a further 
15 years;
•	 after the deduction of recoverable expenses and the payment of the 3% royalty, the profits are shared equally between 
PGM and EMRA (with an additional 10% of proceeds paid to PGM in the first two years that there are net proceeds and 
an additional 5% in the following two years);
•	 PGM, EMRA and the Operating Company are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of 
machinery, equipment and consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at Sukari; 
•	 PGM, EMRA, the Operating Company and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export 
of gold and associated minerals produced from the Sukari Gold Mine; and
•	 legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed 
and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.
In addition, the Concession Agreement establishes a procedure for the conversion of any exploration lease granted 
in favour of PGM into an exploitation lease. Upon following the procedure prescribed by the Concession Agreement, 
the Company was granted such an exploitation lease in respect of 160km
2
 in 2005 and is in possession of the original 
document granting this lease duly signed by all relevant parties. The validity of this lease is, however, the subject of the 
litigation referred to above.
For the accounting treatment of the Concession Agreement refer to Note 23 to the financial statements.
Principal risks affecting the Centamin Group
The exploration for and development of metals and mineral resources, together with the construction and development 
of mining operations is a speculative activity that involves a high degree of risk. 
Centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout the year, which are reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee 
and the Board in accordance with best practice guidelines and in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and relevant Canadian requirements. 
Centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational and exploration activity 
which are monitored and evaluated regularly. Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute 
assurance that mitigating actions will be wholly effective.
The table below describes the key risks affecting Centamin and its operational and exploration activities together with the 
measures to mitigate risk and the preserved risk by management.
Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Single project 
dependency for  
near‑term revenues
The Sukari Project currently constitutes Centamin’s main mineral resource and reserve and near‑term production 
and revenue. Any adverse development affecting the progress of the Sukari Project such as, but not limited to 
unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave‑ins, flooding and other conditions 
involved in the drilling and removal of material, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines 
and other producing facilities, or any other event leading to a reduction in production or closure of mines or other 
producing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage, hiring suitable personnel and engineering 
contractors, or securing supply agreements on commercially suitable terms.
Mitigating factors include continued growth and expansion through exploration and acquisition targets both 
inside and outside of Egypt. Until further production growth beyond Sukari is identified the risk remains high.
Sukari Project joint 
venture risk and 
relationship with 
EMRA
SGM is owned jointly by PGM and EMRA, with equal board representation, whilst responsibility for the day‑to‑day 
management of SGM rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. The board of SGM operates by 
way of simple majority. As such, should the board of SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring 
board‑level approval or in the event of any dispute arising between PGM and EMRA, which PGM is unable to 
amicably resolve, it may have to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to resolve the dispute, which 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance 
and prospects.
Any dispute with EMRA may adversely affect Centamin’s ability to manage the Sukari Project in the most 
effective way. Such a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share provisions of the Sukari 
Concession Agreement.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good working 
relationship with EMRA. The Group has regular meetings with officials from EMRA and invests time in liaising 
with relevant ministry and other governmental representatives. Management and the Board of Directors believe 
the Group has a positive and constructive working relationship with EMRA. The Group complies with all terms 
and conditions of the Concession Agreement covering the Sukari Gold Mine. EMRA has equal representation on 
the Board of Sukari Gold Mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all work programs and 
expenditures. EMRA inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all aspects of the Sukari operations. Current 
discussions with EMRA are focused on determining the exact timing and quantum of the first payment of Profit 
Sharing for Sukari. Whilst the impact would be high, management believes there is a low probability of a material 
deterioration in relationships with EMRA, particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit share 
made during the year.
Mitigating factors also include ensuring co‑operative relations with EMRA however the risk identified above 
remains moderate.
Failure to achieve 
production 
estimates
Centamin currently prepares estimates of future gold production for its existing and future development of the 
Sukari Gold Mine. There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates and such failure 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s future cash flows, profitability, results of operations 
and financial condition. The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst other things: the 
accuracy of mineral reserve and resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and 
recovery rates; ground conditions (including hydrology); physical characteristics of ores; the presence or absence 
of particular metallurgical characteristics; the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining (including access 
to and permitting for sufficient quantities of ammonium nitrate and related blasting products), ore haulage, 
the availability of suitable machinery and equipment, skilled labour and processing capacity and all logistics for 
consumables and parts.
Whilst there can be no certainties, production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and 
mine planning methods. The pending commissioning of the Stage 4 process plant means that the current risk 
rating remains high.
Operational failures 
and unscheduled 
interruptions
The achievement of Centamin’s operational targets will be subject to the timely completion of planned 
operational goals on budget and the effective support of Centamin’s personnel, contractors, systems, procedures 
and controls and suppliers. Any failure in this regard or any instances of unscheduled interruptions in Centamin’s 
operations due to mechanical or other failures or industrial relations related issues or problems or issues with the 
supply of fuel and other goods or services including spare parts, machinery and explosives, may result in delays in 
the achievement of operational targets with a consequent material adverse impact on Centamin’s business, results 
of operations, financial performance and prospects to include all logistics for consumables and parts.
Mitigating factors include management’s assessment of critical components on the operational infrastructure on 
a continuous basis and keep a large inventory of critical spares. In addition management closely monitor progress 
of both normal operations and expansion projects and have regular dialogue with key project stakeholders and 
suppliers. Operational risk for a mining project on a remote location is moderate, although the rating at present 
is high due to the commissioning of Stage 4. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
48
Capital and 
operational cost 
inflation may 
reduce anticipated 
returns
The capital costs for the Sukari Project and the development of Centamin’s portfolio assets may be significantly 
higher than anticipated due to, amongst other things, unforeseen delays in supplies, labour and material cost 
inflation, local and international political events, or workforce disruption. In turn, this may result in Centamin 
having to make unexpected calls on its treasury reserves or otherwise seek to raise external financing, for which 
there can be no guarantee of success and which may result in value dilution for current shareholders.
The Sukari Project has a limited operating history upon which Centamin can base estimates of future operating 
costs. The costs, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote 
location of the Sukari Project, as well as Centamin’s other development opportunities. It is common in new mining 
operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during construction, development, mine operation 
and mine expansion. Accordingly, Centamin’s actual results may be subject to both greater variability and difficulty 
in accurately predicting future operating costs and results than would be the case for a company with a longer 
mining history. Estimates of operating costs are based upon, amongst other things: anticipated tonnage, grades 
and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed; anticipated recovery rates of gold and 
other metals from the ore; and cash operating costs based on a bottom‑up approach utilising historical data.  
Cash operating costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in previous studies or 
estimates prepared by or for Centamin may differ from those estimated costs currently anticipated by Centamin.
Whilst there can be no certainties, capital and operational cost control to date has provided confidence in 
management’s budgeting and cost controls implementation.
Mine construction 
and operational 
risks
Planned construction and commissioning of the remainder of the expansion of the Sukari Project and any further 
expansion projects that Centamin undertakes, may be delayed by a number of factors, which could have a 
material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects. 
Mining projects can suffer delays in start‑up and commissioning due to late delivery of components, adverse 
weather or equipment failures or delays in obtaining, or renewing where applicable, the required permits or 
consents or gaining access to suitable skilled labour, as well as cost overruns and cost inflation. Furthermore, mine 
construction raises a range of social and environmental issues, including costs associated with rehabilitation of 
areas which have been mined or otherwise disturbed, addressing areas of archaeological significance, forestry 
and water matters, local social, health and community issues upon construction (including compensation for 
land and crops) and again on closure of operations. Any estimates for such costs made by the Centamin Group 
may be insufficient and/or further issues and costs may be identified. Any underestimated or unidentified social 
and environmental costs related to the development and subsequent closure of a mine could potentially reduce 
earnings and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial 
performance and prospects.
Construction is now largely complete with the commissioning phase now under way although increased 
throughput is unlikely to increase materially until towards the end of Q2 2014.
Reliance on key 
personnel
The success of Centamin’s operations and activities is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities 
of the directors and management team, including developing and maintaining or, in the context of the recent 
political changes in Egypt, renewing important relationships with governmental and regulatory authorities in 
Egypt. Investors must be willing to rely to a significant extent on Centamin directors and the management team’s 
discretion and judgment. Centamin’s ability to continue to retain, motivate and attract qualified and experienced 
management personnel is vital to the Group’s business. Factors critical to retaining Centamin’s present staff and 
attracting and recruiting additionally highly qualified personnel include, amongst other things, Centamin’s ability 
to provide competitive compensation arrangements. Centamin does not hold key person insurance in respect 
of any members of its management team. There can be no assurance that Centamin will be able to successfully 
recruit and retain the necessary qualified personnel. The loss or diminution in the services of a member of its 
management team or an inability to recruit, train and/or retain necessary personnel could have a material and 
adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
The Group regularly assess its staff recruitment and retention policies, including its reward structures and 
incentive plans, to assist with labour stability and maintain appropriate investment in training and development 
to safeguard the skills of its work force and senior management. The risk of disruptions within the work force and 
senior management remain elevated but the impacts are assessed as manageable.
Reliance on external 
contractors
Centamin’s underground mining operations at Sukari are conducted by third party contractor Barminco. Centamin 
shareholders must be willing to rely to a significant extent on the expertise and competence of outside contractors 
or sub‑contractors. When the world mining industry is buoyant there is increased competition for the services of 
suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors, such as drilling contractors, assay laboratories, metallurgical 
testwork facilities and other providers of engineering, project management and mineral processing services. As 
a result, Centamin may experience difficulties in sourcing and retaining the services of suitably qualified and/or 
experienced sub‑contractors on suitable economic commercial terms. The loss or diminution in the services of 
suitably qualified and/or experienced sub‑contractors or an inability to source or retain necessary sub‑contractors 
or their failure to properly perform their services could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, 
results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
Regular reviews are carried out in order to attract, retain and incentivise key employees, including the expatriate 
workforce. Assessments of arrangements with key contractors are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that 
contracted services and support meet business requirements and expectations.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Dependency upon 
good employee 
relations
Egyptian employment law affords extensive protection to employees. Although management believes its labour 
relations, with both employees and contractors, are good, there can be no assurance that a work slowdown,  
a work stoppage or strike will not occur at the Sukari Project or at any of Centamin’s possible future development 
projects or exploration prospects, even where the workforce is not unionised. Work slowdowns, stoppages, 
disputes with employees or other labour‑related developments or disputes could result in a decrease in 
Centamin’s production levels which could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results  
of operations, financial performance and prospects.
A workers’ representative group has been established for the purpose of facilitating better dialogue with those 
employed at the Sukari Gold Mine, however, strikes have occurred in the past at Sukari and there can be no 
assurance that a future work slowdown, a work stoppage or strike will not occur here or at any of Centamin’s 
other projects. The risk of disruption within the work force remain elevated but the impacts are judged to  
be manageable.
Currency and gold 
price risk
A significant portion of Centamin’s operating expenses are incurred in US dollars, Egyptian pounds and Great 
British pounds, whilst its revenues from gold sales are in US dollars. Furthermore, Centamin does not currently 
maintain any facilities for hedging its exposure to currencies or the price of gold, which fluctuates as a result of a 
number of factors beyond Centamin’s control.
Any appreciation in currencies other than US dollars in which the Group incurs material expenses or adverse 
fluctuations in the gold spot price, could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of 
operations, financial performance and prospects.
Centamin manages its exposure to gold price fluctuations by retaining a focus on keeping operating costs as 
low as possible. However, the risks relating to gold price reductions remain high. The Group has not entered into 
forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency 
liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings 
in line with underlying requirements and commitments.
Egyptian  
political risk
With the exception of Centamin’s small Ethiopian exploration portfolio, Centamin’s production and exploration 
activities are entirely in Egypt, a country which has been subject to civil and military disturbance in the last 
two years. There is no assurance that future political and economic conditions in Egypt will not result in the 
government of Egypt adopting different policies respecting foreign development and ownership of mineral 
resources. Any such change in policy may result in changes in laws affecting ownership of assets, use of 
explosives, tenure and mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, rates of exchange, environmental protection, 
labour relations, repatriation of income and return of capital, which may affect both Centamin’s ability to 
undertake exploration, development and operational activities in respect of future properties as well as its 
ability to continue to explore, develop and operate those properties in respect of which it has obtained mineral 
exploration and exploitation rights to date. Egypt also has limited experience of large scale mining operations and 
current laws do not necessarily reflect current international practices (for example in relation to 24 hour blasting 
techniques).
Centamin actively monitors legal and political developments in Egypt and Ethiopia and actively engages in 
dialogue with relevant government and legal policy makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory developments. 
The potential for serious impact should be balanced against the Egyptian government’s support of Centamin’s 
investment and contribution to both revenue and development of the mining industry.
External 
perceptions 
of Egypt
External perceptions of Egypt with respect to political and economic instability and civil unrest may have 
an adverse effect on: The market value of Centamin’s shares or the ability of Centamin to attract suppliers, 
contractors and skilled workers to its operations in Egypt, which could have an adverse impact on capital projects 
and ongoing operations, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s business, results of 
operations, financial performance and prospects.
Reserve and 
resource estimates
Mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by Centamin Group personnel, with the assistance of 
independent geologists. By their nature, mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on a range of 
assumptions, including geological, metallurgical and technical factors. There can be no guarantee that the 
anticipated tonnages or grades expected by Centamin will be achieved.
Management has implemented processes to continuously monitor and evaluate the current life of the Sukari 
Gold Mine, mine plans and production targets. The most recent Technical update was completed in the 
Form 43‑101F1 dated 30 January 2014 and is available at www.sedar.com. This takes into account the latest drill 
results, higher cost environment and the timing of the Stage 4 commissioning. Whilst there are no certainties, 
production to date has provided confidence in management’s estimation and mine planning methods.
Hazardous 
operating 
conditions
The mining operations of Centamin at Sukari are often carried out in extreme temperatures. Whilst Centamin 
maintains strict health and safety policies, Centamin remains susceptible to the possibility that liabilities might 
arise as a result of breaches of these requirements, accidents, fatalities or other workforce‑related misfortunes, 
some of which may be beyond Centamin’s control. The occurrence of any accidents or any of these situations 
could delay production, increase production costs and/or result in material liability for Centamin.
Safety induction and training programs for staff are an essential component of the policies and procedures at 
Sukari and throughout Centamin. Sukari has a strong safety culture and a good track record with a LTIFR of 
0.36 per 200,000 man hours in 2013, a strong improvement on 2012. The Group manages effectively the risks to 
health and safety and so the risk is low. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Management discussion & analysis and business review 
continued
Litigation risks Centamin’s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely adversely affected by current and any future 
litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be initiated against Centamin at any time.
Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the 
price at which it can purchase Diesel Fuel Oil.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has:
1.  engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing 
litigation and its legal advisers believe that Centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases; and
2.  management and the Company’s legal advisers monitor both activity in court and local media for signs of any 
litigation that may threaten its operations, finances or prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be balanced against Centamin’s adherence to local laws and agreements, 
as well as the Egyptian government’s support of Centamin’s investment and its proposals for a new investment 
law that could protect Centamin against litigation of this nature.

Corporate governance
Statement by the Chairman of the Compliance/Corporate 
Governance Committee, Mark Bankes
Dear shareholders
I am presenting the Corporate Governance Report in my capacity as the 
Chairman of the Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee, a committee 
established by the Board of the Company whose primary function is to make 
recommendations to the Board on matters such as:
(a) the formulation or re‑formulation of, and implementation, maintenance and 
monitoring of the Company’s Corporate Compliance Programme and Code of 
Conduct; and
(b) the Company’s activities in the area of corporate compliance that may impact 
the business operations or public image, in light of applicable government 
and industry standards, legal and business trends and public policy issues. 
The Company is incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands. The Company applies 
the United Kingdom’s 2012 Corporate Governance Code. The Listing Rules also 
require a company to confirm that it has complied with all relevant provisions of 
the Corporate Governance Code or explain areas of non‑ compliance. The Board 
is committed to adhering to the Corporate Governance Code and disclosing 
clearly, with suitable explanation, any non‑compliance.
In addition the Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance 
contained in the best practice recommendations of the Toronto Stock Exchange 
and the best practice recommendations prescribed under National Policy 58‑201 
– Corporate Governance Guidelines (“NP 58‑201”), for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders.
The report also includes the key areas the Board has focused on during the year, 
from a corporate governance perspective, together with details of the roles of 
the key Board members and an assessment on the effectiveness of the Board.
The matters relating to the combination of the roles of Chairman/CEO and 
the independence of the Chairman have been specifically addressed by the 
non executive directors and reported on below. The non executive directors, 
believe that the format of the Board, in conjunction with the activities of the 
various board committees, and the open debate which exists allowing any 
director to engage executive management on policy, performance and risk 
management is sufficient to allow them to effectively monitor the performance 
of management and develop proposals on strategy.

Compliance statement
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
Company has been in compliance with the provisions set 
out in the Corporate Governance Code with the exception 
of the following matters:
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) 
were both exercised by Josef El‑Raghy.
The Board continues on an ongoing basis to assess the 
options for ensuring that the Company has the right 
leadership to best further its future development and 
at present the Board believes that there is no urgent 
requirement to fill the CEO position. In arriving at this 
decision the Board has taken into account the degree and 
breadth of experience brought to the senior management 
team by Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Pardey, Chief 
Financial Officer, Pierre Louw and Head of Business 
Development and Investor Relations, Andy Davidson, 
as well as the requirements of the Code. In relation to the 
Code, the Board believes the interests of shareholders 
continue to be best served by the current arrangement and 
that the Company is not at risk from an undue concentration 
of decision‑making authority by the temporary combination 
of the Chairman and CEO roles. In reaching this conclusion, 
the Board has taken into consideration the strong presence 
of highly experienced independent non executive 
directors on the Board and the structure of the Board 
Committees designed to devolve away from the Chairman 
the responsibility and control of certain key areas of 
Board responsibility.
Furthermore, for so long as the roles remain combined, 
certain corporate governance functions undertaken by Josef 
El‑Raghy in his capacity as Chairman will be delegated to 
the Senior Independent Non Executive Director. These 
functions include chairing Board meetings, ensuring that the 
Board receives timely information and ensuring the efficient 
organisation and conduct of the Board.
It should also be noted that both the Corporate Governance 
Code and the best practice recommendations favour that 
the Chairman be an independent director, however, Josef 
El‑Raghy is not an independent non executive Chairman 
within the meaning of the Code. Again, given the expanded 
role of the Senior Independent Non Executive Director, 
the non executive directors consider this matter has been 
appropriately dealt with.
In addition, it is noted that in the case of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, the disclosures have exceeded the 
obligations on the Company, however, such disclosures are 
considered appropriate to allow comparison with other UK 
incorporated FTSE 350 listed companies.
How the Board of Directors operates 
The Company, led by its directors, sets and implements 
the strategic aims and values of the Company, providing 
strategic direction to management. The specific matters 
reserved for the Board are set out in the Board Charter 
which was last updated in December 2013 which is 
available on the Company’s website at www.centamin.com. 
The matters reserved for the Board provides sufficient 
power to agree on significant matters affecting the Group, 
these can be viewed under the following headings in the 
Board Charter:
•	 strategy and management;
•	 structure and capital;
•	 financial reporting and controls;
•	 significant contracts;
•	 stakeholder communication;
•	 board membership and appointment;
•	 remuneration;
•	 corporate governance;
•	 delegation of authority; and
•	 company policies.
As indicated by the table below, the Board has established 
Audit and Risk, Compliance/Corporate Governance, 
Nomination, Remuneration and Health Safety Environmental 
and Sustainability committees. The Board has delegated 
certain matters to the Committees which can be viewed 
in their respective charters which can all be found on the 
Company’s website at www.centamin.com. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Key board roles
The key roles and the respective responsibilities are set out 
in the table below.

all aspects of setting the 
Board’s agenda.
•	 Efficient organisation of 
the Board’s functioning and 
ensuring the Board behaves 
in accordance with the 
Code of Conduct.
•	 Ensuring the directors 
receive accurate and 
timely information.
Independent non executive directors
Main duties Encouraged to:
•	 Participate as a member 
of the Board and 
certain committees.

management.

and integrity of financial or

•	 Regularly refresh skills and 
knowledge;
•	 Seek clarification

professional advice).
•	 Address any concerns and

raise the matter at the 
Board.
Detailed knowledge of the Group’s activities is essential 
and during the year a site visit was arranged for all the 
non executive directors, allowing them to experience and 
understand the operation at Sukari first hand.
The Senior Independent Non Executive Director held 
meetings with the non executive directors without the 
executive directors present, providing feedback to the 
full Board (where appropriate). These meetings focused 
primarily on the evaluation of the Board’s performance, 
a performance evaluation of the Chairman/CEO as well as 
staffing at senior levels, reporting flows and strategic issues 
such as geographical diversification.
The Board recognises the requirements of the Code 
in appointing an external facilitator to evaluate the 
performance of the Board. In June 2013, the Institute 
of Directors carried out an evaluation of the Board and 
the findings were reviewed and accepted by the non 
executive directors.
Board appointments and independence
There have been no Board appointments during the 
course of 2013. The Company remains compliant with 
the principles of the Code to the extent that it dictates 
the Board should have a greater number of non executive 
directors than executive directors.
When determining whether a director is independent, 
the Board has established a Directors’ Test of Independence 
Policy, which is based predominantly on the definition 
of independence as defined in Canadian Securities 
Administrators’ National Instrument 52‑110 – Audit 
Committees (“NI 52‑110”), and is available on the 
Company’s website or to shareholders upon request. 
The criteria in NI 52‑110 are mandatory and are more 
stringent in certain respects than the independence criteria 
suggested by the Code. Based on this policy, the majority of 
the Board are considered by the Board to be independent 
non executive directors.
The Company has considered certain recommendations 
put forward in the UK in respect of gender diversity on the 
boards of listed companies but has not adopted a formal 
policy in this regard. The Board believes that a board 
performs well, providing the individuals have a range of 
perspectives and backgrounds with appointments made 
on merit, having attracted the best qualified persons for 
the role. Based on our experience, to date, the availability 
of women with the required experience within the mining 
industry has not been encouraging; however, this matter is 
kept under constant review. 
Detailed separately in the CSR Report is a summary of 
the social conditions in Egypt and the Middle East which 
provide an explanation as to the gender diversity in 
the workforce.

Communications

The Board, with assistance from the Audit and Risk Committee 
oversees the Group’s internal control and management 
information systems.
Managing risks
The Board is responsible for satisfying itself that 
management has developed and implemented a sound 
system of risk management and internal control. Assisted 
by the Audit and Risk Committee, management report to 
the Board on the Group’s key risks and the extent to which 
they believe these risks are being appropriately managed 
and mitigated.
As a matter of practice, and in line with the Group’s 
approach to financial and risk management, the 
executive directors, assisted by the senior management, 
are responsible for:
•	 developing corporate strategy, performance objectives, 
business plans and budgets for review and approval by 
the Board; and
•	 managing the risk and compliance frameworks, reporting 
to the Board on significant breaches or updates to 
policies and procedures.
The CEO/Chairman is responsible for ensuring senior

these matters.
Full details of the risk evaluation and risk mitigation are 
detailed in the Audit and Risk Report.
Performance evaluation
In order to ensure that the Board continues to discharge its 
responsibilities in an appropriate manner, the performance 
of all directors is constantly reviewed by the Chairman/CEO. 
The Company deployed a formal process for evaluation 
of the Board, the Board members, Board committees and 
the Chairman during the relevant period led by the Senior 
Independent Non Executive Director. 
The Board has also had training sessions on various topics 
during the year.
The Company has established a Remuneration Policy 
which sets out the structure of the remuneration of key 
senior management, executive directors and non executive 
directors. The Board has also established a Selection, 
Appointment and Re‑Appointment of Directors Policy which 
details the procedures for the selection, appointment, 
reappointment and evaluation of the Company’s directors.
All compensation arrangements for executive directors and 
senior management are determined and reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board, after 
taking into account the current competitive arrangements 
prevailing in the market.
The performance of executive directors and senior 
management is evaluated by the Remuneration Committee, 
often taking into account recommendations from the 
Chairman/CEO. The Board can exercise its discretion in 
relation to approving incentives, bonuses and options 
and can recommend changes to the Committee’s 
recommendations. 
Details of the performance criteria, performance 
evaluation and executive director and non executive 
director remuneration are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The Board expects that the remuneration structure will result 
in the Company being able to attract and retain the best 
senior management and executive directors to manage the 
Group. It will also provide the necessary incentives to grow 
long‑term shareholder value.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Board composition and re‑election
It is proposed at the date of this annual report that all 
directors will be put forward for re‑election at the AGM in 
May 2014. Trevor Schultz, currently holding the position of 
executive director, is due to stand down as an executive 
director and take up the position as a non executive 
director prior to the AGM in 2014, which will coincide with 
the successful hand over of the Stage 4 commissioning to 
operations. The services and valuable experience of Trevor 
Schultz will therefore be retained by the Company.  
All directors are subject to annual re‑election.
The Board of Directors
At the date of this report the Board is made up of a 
Chairman/CEO, an executive director and five independent 
Non Executive directors. All the directors who served 
throughout the year and the names of the directors 
and their qualifications and experience are set out on 
pages 52 and 53. 
The following table sets out the number of Board and 
Committee meetings held during the year and the number 
of meetings attended by each director.

Edward Haslam chaired the majority of the Board meetings (in line with the delegation of certain of Josef El‑Raghy’s roles 
to the Senior Independent Non Executive Director). Certain decisions were agreed by written resolution and these have not 
been included in the statistics above.
Board committees
The Board committees are a valuable part of the 
Company’s corporate governance structure. The workload 
of the Board committees is far greater than the table of 
scheduled meetings would indicate, as ad hoc meetings 
and communications between meetings frequently require 
considerable amounts of time from the non executive 
directors. Details of the activity of the committees is set 
out below (or where indicated in the other sections of the 
annual report).
Audit and Risk Committee
As at the date of this report, the Audit and Risk Committee 
comprises Mark Arnesen (Chairman), Mark Bankes and 
Edward Haslam, all of whom are considered by the Board to 
be independent within the terms of Group’s Directors’ Test 
of Independence Policy.
The Audit and Risk Committee Report includes a full 
description of the role of the committee acting on behalf of 
the Board and the activity carried out during the year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Edward Haslam 
(Chairman), Mark Arnesen, Bob Bowker and Kevin 
Tomlinson.
The Remuneration Report includes a full description of the 
role of the committee acting on behalf of the Board and the 
activity carried out during the year.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Edward Haslam 
(Chairman), Mark Arnesen, Bob Bowker and Kevin 
Tomlinson, all of whom are independent non executive 
directors of the Company.
The Nomination Committee’s primary functions are to:
•	 Make recommendations for the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and Board committees;
•	 Assist with the alignment of directorships held within the 
Group’s subsidiary companies;
•	 Review the necessary and desirable competencies, skills, 
knowledge and experience of directors;
•	 Review the Board succession plans; and
•	 Make recommendations for the appointment, re‑election 
and removal of directors to/from the Board.
The Nomination Committee established guidelines for the 
future nomination and selection of potential new directors. 
The full Board (subject to members’ voting rights in general  Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements

meeting) is ultimately responsible for selection of new 
directors and will have regard to a candidate’s experience 
and competence in areas such as mining, exploration, 
geology, finance, administration and other areas of 
relevance that can assist the Group in meeting its corporate 
objectives and plans.
After the year end, the Board proposed the change in role 
of Trevor Schultz from the position of executive director to 
non executive director. The move ensures the knowledge, 
experience and expertise of Trevor Schultz is retained, after 
the completion and successful hand over of the Stage 4 
processing plant. The role of Trevor Schultz as non executive 
director had the full support of the members of the 
Nomination committee.
Within the remit of the Nomination Committee, the 
requirement to ensure adequate succession planning 
is routinely discussed. Reviews of management 
capabilities and potential are performed on a routine 
basis and resources allocated to assist with this continued 
development. 
Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee
The Compliance/Corporate Governance Committee  
is chaired by Mark Bankes and its other members are  
Edward Haslam and Bob Bowker.
The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its fiduciary 
responsibilities by making recommendations to the 
Board with respect to the formulation or re‑formulation 
of and implementation, maintenance and monitoring 
of the Company’s programme to ensure compliance 
with corporate governance policies and legal rules 
and regulations.
Fundamental to the Company’s policy and procedures on 
corporate governance is that all directors and employees 
reflect the Company’s key values of accountability, fairness, 
integrity and openness. This committee oversees the 
Company’s activities in the area of corporate compliance 
that may impact the Company’s business operations 
or public image, in light of applicable government and 
industry standards, legal and business trends and public 
policy issues.
The main activities carried out by the Committee during the 
year include:
•	 assessing the Company’s compliance with laws and 
regulations (including those required in‑country, 
particularly in Egypt and Ethiopia);
•	 monitoring the Company’s systems and controls 
(including a review of the policies, procedures and roll 
out of procedures to the business and employees);
•	 review of progress in respect to the Concession 
Agreement (“CA”) hearing and the DFO litigation; and
•	 review of reporting requirements and reports prepared 
by management as required by the LSE and TSX.
Health Safety Environmental and 
Sustainability Committee
The Health Safety Environmental and Sustainability 
Committee comprises Bob Bowker (Chairman), Mark 
Arnesen, Mark Bankes and Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are 
independent non executive directors of the Company. 
The Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 26 
to 29 includes a full description of the role of the committee 
acting on behalf of the Board and the activity carried out 
during the year.
Shareholder communication
All shareholders are encouraged to find the time to attend 
our AGM on 16 May 2014, which will be held in Jersey.
This will be an excellent opportunity to meet Board 
members and our senior management team. 
The Board of Directors aims to ensure that shareholders 
are provided with important information in a timely manner 
through written and electronic communications. It is for 
this reason that the Company established a Shareholder 
Communications Policy, through:
•	 the annual report;
•	 the annual information form;
•	 the availability of the Company’s quarterly report and 
half‑yearly report;
•	 adherence to continuous disclosure requirements;
•	 webcasts of the Company’s quarterly results;
•	 the Annual General Meeting and other meetings called 
to obtain shareholder approval for Board action as 
appropriate; and
•	 the provision of the Company’s website containing all of 
the above mentioned reports and its constant update 
and maintenance.
The Chairman/CEO and other directors, communicate with 
major shareholders on a regular basis in the way of face to 
face contact, telephone conversations, and through analyst 
and broker briefings, to help better understand the views of 
the shareholders. Any material feedback is then discussed at 
Board level.
The Board recognises the importance of keeping the 
market fully informed of the Group’s activities and of 
communicating openly and clearly with all stakeholders. 
The Company has established a formal Continuous 
Disclosure Policy to ensure that this occurs. The Policy is 
designed to ensure compliance with the listing rules in all 
jurisdictions in which the Company is listed.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
62
Shareholder communication continued
In accordance with this policy, Company information 
considered to be material and which requires 
announcement is announced immediately to the LSE and 
TSX. All key communications are placed immediately on the 
Company website, and when necessary, provided directly 
to shareholders. As a premium listed company on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the Company 
also complies with the various obligations imposed on 
it pursuant to the Disclosure Rules and the Transparency 
Rules (“DTRs”). 
Commitment to stakeholders and ethical standards
The Board supports the highest standards of corporate 
governance and requires its members and the management 
and staff of the Company to act with integrity and 
objectivity in relation to:
•	 compliance with laws and regulations affecting the 
Group’s operations;
•	 listing rules, the UK Corporate Governance Code, and 
NP 58‑201;
•	 employment practices;
•	 responsibilities to the community;
•	 responsibilities to individuals;
•	 the environment;
•	 conflict of interests;
•	 confidentiality;
•	 ensuring that shareholders and the financial community 
are at all times fully informed in accordance with the 
spirit and letter of the Model Code and the Canadian 
Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51‑102;
•	 corporate opportunities or opportunities arising from 
these for personal gain or to compete with the Group;
•	 protection of and proper use of the Group’s assets; and
•	 active promotion of ethical behaviour.
The Company has a formal Code of Conduct, which all 
directors, employees and contractors are required to 
observe, and a range of corporate policies which detail the 
framework for acceptable corporate behaviour. These set 
out the procedures that personnel are required to follow in 
a range of areas, including compliance with the law, dealing 
with conflicts of interest, use of knowledge and information, 
gifts and entertainment, responsibility to shareholders 
and the financial community. The Company’s policies are 
reviewed periodically. 
Securities Trading Policy
The Company has adopted a formal Securities Trading 
Policy restricting directors, senior executives and other 
employees from acting on material information until it 
has been released to the market in accordance with the 
requirements of continuous disclosure. Directors and senior 
management of premium listed companies on the LSE are 
restricted in a number of ways, by statute, common law and 
by the Model Code in relation to dealings in the Company’s 
securities. This imposes restrictions beyond those imposed 
by law to ensure that the directors and certain employees 
and persons connected with them do not abuse and do not 
place themselves under suspicion of abusing price‑sensitive 
information that they have or are thought to have, 
especially in periods leading up to announcement of results 
(close periods).
Statement by the Chief Executive Officer  
and Chief Financial Officer
The Board receives written assurance from the Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to confirm 
that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the Group’s 
financial position presents a true and fair view and that the 
financial statements are founded on a sound system of risk 
management, internal compliance and control. Further, it is 
confirmed that the Group’s risk management and internal 
compliance is operating efficiently and effectively. The 
Board notes that due to its nature, internal control assurance 
from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
can only be reasonable rather than absolute, and therefore 
is not and cannot be designed to detect all weaknesses in 
control procedures. 
Shareholder resolutions
After the year end, additional share securities were issued 
for the purpose of acquiring Ampella Mining Ltd, which 
was made possible by the resolution approved at the 
2013 AGM authorising the issue of further securities, 
for purposes such as this recommended take‑over offer. 
The continued support of the Company’s shareholders in 
this way is recognised and valued by the Board and allows 
the Company to further expand and meet the Company’s 
long‑term objectives.

Remuneration report
Statement by the Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee, Ed Haslam
Edward Haslam
Chairman of the  
Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholders
1. Introduction and annual statement
Background to remuneration decisions
While this year has continued to be challenging, the Company has been 
successful in a number of important ways: 
•	 year gold production 356,943 oz (36% increase on 2012);
•	 cash operating costs of under US$663 per ounce (below budget of US$700 
per ounce);
•	 safety record of 0.36 LTIFR in 2013 (48% reduction on the prior year);
•	 Stage 4 expansion project largely on time and on budget (total capital 
expenditure estimate of US$331.2 million);
•	 strong financial position US$106 million cash and liquid assets at year end;
•	 systematic exploration continued both at Sukari and Ethiopia, although 
only low grade mineralisation discovered resulting in the write down and 
relinquishing of the licence areas; and
•	 M&A activity culminated in a recommended takeover offer of Ampella Mining 
Ltd to extend exploration into prospective and stable Burkina Faso.
Therefore, while there are still challenges in respect of the litigation, details of 
which are set out in Note 20 to the financial statements, from an operational and 
financial perspective this has been a successful year and it is within that context 
that the key remuneration decisions for 2013 described below have been taken.
Last year some shareholders expressed concerns about certain aspects of the 
remuneration policy and practice. We have been working on those concerns and 
I would like to thank the shareholders, whom I had an opportunity to meet this 
year, for their constructive feedback on the Remuneration Report. I will continue 
to engage with shareholders throughout 2014. 
Simple approach to remuneration
We continue to be wedded to a simpler remuneration structure for the executive 
directors with only three elements of remuneration for Josef El‑Raghy, base pay, 
contribution to a pension and annual bonus and two elements for Trevor Schultz, 
base pay and annual bonus. As described below we are not proposing any changes 
in this policy for the coming year. We believe this simple approach allows a cleaner 
line of sight for the delivery of performance in the short term while meaningful 
actual shareholdings means the executives’ wealth is directly linked to the fortunes 
of other shareholders. There is no better union of interest between shareholder and 
executives than for executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
As reported last year Josef El‑Raghy no longer participates in any long term 
incentive plans, the committee being of the view the his significant shareholding is 
a sufficient link to shareholders’ interests. Trevor Schultz award of 1,000,000 shares 
under the terms of the Directors Loan Funded Share Plan failed to achieve the 
necessary performance criteria, after the year end and therefore it was agreed that 
these awards lapse. He will receive no further awards for long term incentives.
For employees the complex loan funded arrangements that previously existed 
have been replaced with one simple Deferred Bonus Share Plan. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Changes in the Board
Trevor Schultz is due to stand down as an executive director 
prior to the AGM in 2014. This will coincide with the final 
stages of commissioning and handover to operations of the 
Stage 4 expansion project. Trevor Schultz is expected to be 
appointed as a non executive director and put forward for 
re‑election at the AGM to be held on 16 May 2014.
Key remuneration decisions for 2013
Base salary for Josef El‑Raghy was GB£500,000 
(US$782,112) for 2013 and remains at this level for 
2014. The next review will make any changes with effect 
from January 2015. Trevor Schultz base was A$550,000 
(US$526,768) for 2013 and this will continue for 2014 at the 
same rate while holding the position of executive director.
For 2013 a pension is provided as a cash supplement 
of 20% of base for Josef El‑Raghy. He receives no other 
benefits. For Trevor Schultz there is no pension or benefit 
provision. This will remain the same in both cases for 2014. 
The bonus opportunity and structure for 2013 will remain 
the same as 2014. For Josef El‑Raghy a maximum bonus 
opportunity is 175%. The bonus calculation is made 
by reference to a balanced scorecard which comprises 
a combination of financial, operational and individual 
performance criteria. 
The bonus outcome for Josef El‑Raghy for 2013 was a 
bonus of 75% of the maximum opportunity which equates 
to GB£656,250 (US$1,082,028) and represents 131.25% of 
base salary.
For Trevor Schultz, as disclosed last year, a bonus of 
A$750,000 (US$777,847) was accrued in 2012 in respect 
of performance in 2012 and payment of this was approved 
by the Remuneration Committee in December 2013. 
A further bonus of A$500,000 (US$443,616) for 2013 and 
2014 performance may be paid in 2014 (representing 90% 
of base pay). The bonus amounts were and are based 
upon progress towards and the successful commissioning 
and hand over to operations of Stage 4 (see section 4,  
“annual bonus”).
The remainder of the Remuneration Report consists of 
the following sections:

Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee was supported by the 
Company Secretary. Following a review in 2012 Meis was 
appointed as adviser to the Committee in respect of its 
work on executive remuneration. Meis does not provide 
any other service to the Company and is regarded as 
independent by the Committee. Meis is engaged on an 
annual retainer for GB£7,000 for a twelve month period.
Josef El‑Raghy may attend meetings of the Committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports but neither he nor the 
Company Secretary are in attendance at meetings when 
their own remunerations are under consideration.
3. Our remuneration policy
Introduction
The remuneration policy will be subject to a non‑binding 
advisory vote at the AGM on 16 May 2014.
In developing its remuneration policy the Committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company 
is operated outside the UK and in a market which requires 
the engagement; motivation and retention of very 
particular operational and managerial personnel and skills. 
The remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
•	 position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements of 
remuneration and be reflective of the performance of 
the Company;
•	 use external benchmark data on a transparent and open 
basis using comparator groups that reflect the industry 
and size of the Company;
•	 provide incentive arrangements for relevant employees 
that are based upon pre‑agreed performance criteria 
against which individuals will then be tested. Such 
incentives should be relevant and stretching;
•	 other than for executive directors, provide long term 
incentives that encourage the involvement, in the long 
term, of the performance of the Company; and
•	 encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company.

ordinarily takes effect from the 1 January.
Salaries are benchmarked against a number 
of comparator groups as described below to 
provide a balanced approach. Increases will take 
account of those of the general workforce.
Increases will take account of the performance 
of the individual and the benchmarked data but 
any increase which exceeds that of the general

Remuneration arrangement across the Company
Our remuneration policy for executive directors is consistent 
with that across the Company and intends to attract and 
retain high‑performing individuals and to reward success. 
Base pay and benefits are set competitively taking account 
of the individual’ s performance and market data. Annual 
incentives are typically linked to local business performance 
with a focus on performance against key strategic business 
objectives. Key management team members may also 
receive some of their annual bonus in shares which are 
deferred. At this time there are no all employee share 
arrangements but this is kept under review on a regular basis 
taking account of the locations the Company operates in and 
the appropriateness of share base rewards in such locations.
All employees of Sukari Gold Mine Company (the majority 
of whom are based at the Sukari mine site) are subject to a 
performance related bonus which is linked to the underlying 
operation performance and cost control measures at the 
mine. Further details on employee relations can be found 
on the CSR Report.
Policy if a new director is appointed
The Company has a track record of succession planning and 
growing and promoting talent internally.
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting an 
individual to the Board, the Committee will offer a package 
that is sufficient to attract and motivate while aiming to pay 
no more than is necessary taking account of market data, 
the impact on other existing remuneration arrangements, 
the candidate’s location and experience, external market 
influences and internal pay relativities.
The structure of the remuneration package of a new 
executive director will follow the policy above, however 
in certain circumstances, the Committee may use other 
elements of remuneration if it considers appropriate, 
with due regard to the best interests of the shareholders. 
In particular, a service contract that contains a longer initial 
notice period, tapering down to twelve months over a 
set period of time, the buyout of short and or long term 
incentive arrangements (taking account of the performance 
measures on such incentives) as close as possible on a 
comparable basis, the provision of long term incentives 
and the provision of benefits such as housing allowance or 
similar particularly where it is an expatriate appointment.
The Committee may, where necessary and in the interest of 
shareholders, also offer recruitment incentives to facilitate 
the recruitment of an appropriate individual.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s approach to payment on loss of office 
will take account of the circumstances of the termination 
of employment. In the case of a good leaver then the 
individual will be expected to work through the notice 
period and will be entitled to all the benefits under the 
service agreement during that period.
In the case of a termination as a result of poor performance 
or a breach of any of the material terms of the agreement 
then the Company may terminate with immediate effect 
without notice and with no liability to make any further 
payment to the individual other than in respect of amounts 
accrued due at the date of termination.
In the case that the Company wishes to terminate 
the agreement and make a payment in lieu of notice, 
this payment shall be phased in monthly or quarterly 
installments over a period of no longer than twelve months 
(or the notice period if less) and that any payment should 
be reduced in accordance with the duty on the executive 
to mitigate his loss. The Company will consider if any 
bonus amount is to be included in the calculation when 
determining the payment in lieu of notice. Normally, any 
bonus (if included at all) would be restricted to the director’s 
actual period of service only.
In the case of notice given in connection with and shortly 
following a change of control then in the case of Josef 
El‑Raghy he is entitled to payment in lieu of an amount 
equal to twelve month’s basic salary plus bonus. Any bonus 
that may be due to him at the completion of the change 
of control, shall be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee, and such bonus (if any) would be based on 
the period only up to the completion of the change of 
control, taking account of all the relevant key performance 
indicators.
The only claw back provisions for executive directors relate 
to holiday taken in advance. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Policy on external Board appointments
The Company encourages the executive directors to 
have non executive external appointments provided that 
such appointments do not adversely impact on the duties 
required to be performed to the Company. Where there are 
external appointments the director will retain any fees for 
such appointments and will not be liable to account to the 
Company for such fees.
Of the executives, Trevor Schultz received remuneration 
from another external appointment. 
For Josef El‑Raghy the graphs assumes a base salary 
as disclosed in this report of GB£500,000, pension 
contributions of 20% of base being GB£100,000 and bonus 
from zero at the minimum, to 50% of 175% at target, and 
175% of base for the maximum. There are no benefits or 
long term incentive elements. 
For Trevor Schultz a base salary of A$550,000 is assumed 
and a bonus of zero at the minimum, 50% of 90% at target, 
and 90% of base for the maximum. For T. Shultz there are 
no benefits, pension or long term incentives included.

1.  The EDLFSP has no prospect of meeting the performance conditions and has therefore been excluded from this table.
2.  The amounts shown in Salary in the table above for Trevor Schultz include Egyptian income taxes paid by the Company on behalf of  
Trevor Schultz. During 2013 Egyptian income taxes paid by the Company on behalf of Trevor Schultz amounted to US$ 144,580 in 2013 
(2012: US$142,597).
3.  Superannuation is payable to Bob Bowker and Mark Arnesen and this is included in the pension column.

2013 is 0.9578 and the average GB£:US$ exchange rate for 2013 is 1.5642. Bonus accruals for 2013 applied an exchange rate of A$:US$ 
0.8872 and GB£:US$ 1.6488.
5.  The pension payable to Josef El‑Raghy r epresents a cash payment in lieu of contributions to a pension scheme.
6.  The Bonus for Trevor Schultz in 2013 represents the amount accrued in 2012 and paid in 2013 (this is restating the prior year to meet the 
new disclosure requirements and the bonus which was shown in 2012’s table is now shown in 2013 and 2012 shows no bonus). The bonus 
amount accrued in 2013 referred to in this report may be payable in 2014 (see section 4, “annual bonus”).
Non executive director fees
Non executive directors receive annual fees within an 
aggregate directors’ fee pool limited to an amount which 
is approved by shareholders. The Committee reviews and 
recommends, for Board approval, remuneration levels and 
policies for directors within this overall directors’ fee pool. 
The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed. 
The current annual fee rate for non executive directors is 
as follows:
1. With effect from 1 April 2013, the fees payable to Gordon 
Edward Haslam in his capacity as Senior Independent Director 
were increased such that, for so long as the roles of CEO and 
Chairman are combined, the total fees paid to him, on an annual 
basis, would be GB£150,000 (US$247,231) per year 2012: 
GB£125,000 (US$198,088). In keeping with the Company’s 
policy, Edward Haslam did not participate in any meeting during 
which his fees were discussed.
2. These amounts include any statutory superannuation payments 
where applicable.
3.  The Company reviewed the NED fees during 2013. The 
increases in non executive director fees took effect from 
1 April 2013.
4. The non executive directors do not participate in any of the 
Company’s share plans or incentive plans. 
Base pay
Remuneration of the executive directors and the senior 
management team is considered against three criteria 
– general pay levels and pay increases throughout the 
Company, the performance and skills of the individual and 
market data.
In respect of market data for the executive directors and 
the senior management team, a selection of five different 
comparator groups are used in order to gain a balanced 
view of the market data. These comparator groups consist 
of a bespoke list of UK and international mining companies, 
companies with a similar market capitalisation, companies 
with a similar turnover, the mining sector and the FTSE 250.

4. Annual remuneration report continued
Base pay continued
Any increase which exceeds that of the general work force 
may only normally be awarded in cases as a result of change 
in responsibility, or the complexity and nature of the role or 
size of the organisation or the pay level becoming out of 
line with the market data. 
Pay is reviewed annually and any change takes effect from 
the 1 January.
While performance of the executive directors has been 
satisfactory the Committee, taking account of market data 
has determined that there will be no increases in base 
pay for 2014. Therefore the base pay for Josef El‑Raghy 
of GB£500,000 (US$782,112) will remain at this level 
during 2014. The base pay for Trevor Schultz of A$550,000 
(US$526,768) will remain at this level in 2014 and there is no 
increase for 2014 whilst Trevor Schultz holds the position of 
executive director.
Annual bonus
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon a 
balanced score card approach designed to encourage and 
reward the delivery of operational performance. For Josef 
El‑Raghy the bonus is split 70% business and 30% individual 
targets as follows:
•	 70% – the business targets are based on: 
•	 40% – financial (profitability, cost against  
budget and operational efficiency);
•	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in Egypt and other locations, 
project delivery); and
•	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance and CSR 
development).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
For Trevor Schultz the structure is weighted to the Stage 4 
expansion project. In 2012, no bonus was paid, but a 
bonus was provided for and after review this was paid to 
Trevor Schultz in 2013. This was based upon the substantial 
satisfactory completion of the Stage 4 expansion project. 
The bonus payable in 2014 is dependent upon the 
successful hand over and commissioning of Stage 4.
The following graph shows the balance of the 
performance criteria.
2013 bonus 
The Committee during the year reviewed the annual 
bonus scheme and the bonus scheme that operated for 
substantially all of 2013, which was based upon the same 
balanced score card approach as above. On this basis 
the Committee determined that 75% of the maximum 
bonus of 175% of Josef El‑Raghy’s 2013 base salary had 
been achieved. This resulted in a payment of GB£656,250 
(US$1,082,028).
In 2012 the Company reserved A$750,000 in respect of 
the satisfactory progression of Stage 4 for Trevor Schultz. 
Notwithstanding considerable adversities it was determined 
that this had been achieved and as a result this sum had 
been earned and was paid in 2013. 
2014 bonus
The bonus for 2014 will be based upon the balanced score 
card approach above.
•	 70% – the business targets:
•	 40% – financial (an improvement in profitability, cost 
against budget and operational efficiency); 
•	 20% strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
exploration in In Egypt and other locations, project 
delivery); and 
•	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
health and safety, production guidance CSR 
development).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
For Trevor Schultz the bonus is based upon the 
satisfactory final commissioning of Stage 4 and hand 
over to Operations. The maximum amount is A$500,000 
(US$443,616).

Pension arrangements and benefits in kind
Josef El‑Raghy is entitled to a payment in respect of pension 
entitlement equal to 20% of base pay. Trevor Schultz has no 
such entitlement. Other than statutory superannuation for 
Australian resident directors, Bob Bowker and Mark Arnesen 
and the payments in lieu of pension above, no pensions or 
payments in lieu of pensions are made. No benefits in kind 
are provided to any director.
Long term incentives – shares award table
Neither executive director currently participates in any long 
term incentive arrangement. In 2012 Josef El‑Raghy waived 
his outstanding share award as part of the restructuring of 
his remuneration package. He therefore has no outstanding 
award under any Company share arrangement. Josef 
El‑Raghy holds a substantial shareholding in the Company 
and this is deemed to be sufficient to create a union of 
interest between the executive and other shareholders. The 
awards held by Trevor Schultz under the EDLFSP did not 
meet the performance criteria and therefore at the date of 
this report neither executive director has any outstanding 
awards under any Company share scheme.

6. Long term incentive arrangements
Introduction
The Company has had a number of share schemes intended to facilitate employee and executive participation in the 
capital value of the Company. A number of these share schemes were developed to take account of Australian tax law. 
With the review last year and Committee concluding that the schemes were too complex and failed to provide any 
meaningful motivation or link to shareholder interests those scheme are no longer being used.
The existing executive directors no longer participate in any long term incentive arrangement and neither executive 
director has any outstanding award under any company share scheme.
There is a deferred share plan for senior management detailed below. 
Deferred Bonus Scheme (not for directors)
This plan, introduced in 2013, allows the annual bonus to be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released in 
three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued employment with the Group. The plan was introduced as a review of 
annual bonus arrangements for management with the objectives of:
(1) increasing the variable pay element of remuneration;
(2) introducing a new retention element in the remuneration package; and 
(3)  linking part of that reward to the medium‑term share performance of the Company.
For the initial year and to introduce the plan, on 4 June 2013, the Company offered to participants of existing plans the 
opportunity to replace awards with an initial one off award under the Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
The plan is not open to directors of the Company.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

6. Long term incentive arrangements continued
Historic long term incentive plan summary
Employee Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
There are no outstanding awards under this Plan and there is no current intention to make further awards under this plan. 
This was the rollover plan for the Centamin Egypt Ltd 2011 Employee Loan Funded Share Plan. Under the plan, employees 
receive a loan to buy shares in the Company. The shares are then held in trust for the employee and at the end of three 
years the employees can repay the loan and receive the shares. 
Director Loan Funded Share Plan 2011
After the year end, there were no outstanding awards under this Plan as the performance criteria were not met and awards 
lapsed. There is no current intention to use this Plan. The plan operated in the same way as the Employee Plan, except that 
there are mandatory performance conditions attached to the Director Plan, and that the shares vested in one tranche, three 
years from the date of grant. 
At 31 December 2013, having carried out initial calculations, the participants had no prospect of the performance 
conditions being met, however the plan operated in the following way. The awards were due to vest three years from the 
date of grant, dependent on the achievement of comparative total shareholder return, with 50% based upon the FTSE 250 
and 50% based upon comparator companies. 25% of the award would vest for median performance and 100% for upper 
quartile performance under each element. Comparator companies were selected by the Remuneration Committee from 
peers in the mining sector and were as follows: New Gold Inc; Centerra Gold Inc; Randgold Resources; Hochschild Mining; 
Alamos Gold Inc; European Goldfields Ltd; Eldorado Gold Corp; African Barrick Gold and Petropavlovsk Plc. 
Employee Share Option Plan
There are no outstanding awards under this plan and there is no current intention to use the plan. Awards under the plan 
were subject to performance criteria for senior management based upon share price, financial, production or key tasks.

Dear shareholders
During the financial year ended 31 December 2013, the Audit and Risk 
Committee (“AR Committee”) comprised three independent non executive 
directors (including myself as Chairman, Mark Bankes and Edward Haslam).
In accordance with the Ontario Securities Commission requirements, all members 
of the AR Committee are considered financially literate (pursuant to section 1.5 
of the Multilateral Instrument 52‑110) and in compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) I have the required relevant financial experience 
and am a professionally qualified accountant.
During the year the AR Committee reviewed and updated its Charter to 
take account of the Code and best practice guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council, a copy of which can be found on the Company’s website.
Details of the activities carried out by the AR Committee during the year are 
detailed in the Report and also required by the Code, the accounting issues 
highlighted during the year are summarised below (further details are set out 
at the end of the AR Committee report):
(1) impairment of assets (focusing on Sukari);
(2) litigation and the assessment of current litigation and appropriate disclosures;
(3) recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure;
(4)  revenue recognition in respect to gold sales under the gold refining and sales 
contract;
(5) accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines and forecast cost recoveries; and
(6) going concern: significant judgments, estimates and calculations.
Each of the significant issues identified above are detailed in the notes to the 
financial statements.
The external auditor of the Group, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”) have audited the 
Group for a number of years and I am satisfied that the audit engagement for the 
financial year ended 2013, headed by the Audit Partner, was both effective and 
value added to the Group.
The AR Committee continues to monitor the auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and I am satisfied that Deloitte and the Group have appropriate 
policies and procedures in place to ensure that these requirements are not 
compromised. The non‑audit work carried out by Deloitte during the year 
included the provision of tax and accounting services in relation to the take‑over 
of Ampella Mining Ltd, tax advice on restructuring and compliance and statutory 
services for certain of the Group’s subsidiaries.
Deloitte have open access to the Board of Directors at all times and the Audit 
Partner and certain of the Audit management team attended and presented to 
the AR Committee at key meetings throughout the year.
Statement by the Chairman of the  
Audit and Risk Committee, Mark Arnesen CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Audit and risk committee report continued
Deloitte have adopted a policy of rotating audit partners 
every five years. The last rotation of the audit partner 
occurred for the year ended 31 December 2012. Deloitte 
have provided audit services to the Centamin Group from 
the early 90’s, whilst listed on the Australian Stock Exchange 
and pursuing exploration in Western Australia. More 
recently, Deloitte LLP (UK) have provided audit services 
since the redomicile in December 2011.
Following a review of its governance arrangements and in 
the light of recommendations in the Code, the Company 
envisages commencing an audit tender process in 2014 
and will invite a number of leading audit firms to tender, 
including its current auditor, Deloitte. Pending the outcome 
of the tender, the AR Committee intend recommending that 
the Board reappoint Deloitte as Auditor at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting and approve the remuneration and 
terms of engagement of Deloitte.
Activity over the coming year, will include progressing a 
scoping document and further discussions with candidates 
in relation to the provision of internal audit services which 
will assist the Group and enhance the control and reporting 
environment for the financial reporting team. 
Composition of the AR Committee and attendance
The AR Committee is made up of three independent non 
executive directors, namely Mark Arnesen (Chairman of the 
committee) and the members Edward Haslam and Mark 
Bankes. Mark Arnesen has extensive expertise in structuring 
of major resource projects and is a Chartered Accountant 
with over 20 years’ experience in the international 
resources industry.
The AR Committee meetings are regularly attended by the 
CEO and Chairman, CFO and the Group Accountant along 
with the Company Secretary (who acts as the Secretary of 
the AR Committee). The external auditor is also invited to 
attend key meetings. Separate discussions outside a formal 
committee meeting are regularly held between the Audit 
Partner, the AR Committee Chairman and the CFO.
Every meeting during the year had full attendance of the 
AR Committee, with the exception of one meeting where 
a quorum of two members was present. The key activity 
undertaken during the year is summarised below:
Responsibility and activity of the AR Committee

CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
77
(a) Reporting
The AR Committee is responsible for reviewing the quarterly, 
half yearly and annual financial statements for submission to 
the Board for their approval. 
Internal controls over financial reporting are designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the 
Group’s financial reporting and compliance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the Group’s financial 
statements. Management evaluated at implementation the 
design of internal controls over financial reporting provided 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted by the European 
Union (“EU IFRS”). 
(b) Internal controls
In ensuring an effective internal control framework exists 
within the Group, the AR Committee has throughout the 
year and up to the date of this report, received regular 
internal reports from management, including analysis 
on forecasts, actual v budget analysis, information on 
adherence to internal controls and recommendations for 
improvements to the internal control framework in line with 
required guidelines.
The AR Committee monitored progress throughout the year 
on a number of enhancements to the control environment, 
including the following:
•	 development and implantation of a Whistleblowing and 
Treasury policy;
•	 enhanced formalities and record keeping of decisions 
between management and committees; and
•	 information flows between management and heads 
of department.
Due to the simplicity of the corporate structure and 
reporting framework, the Company has not required an 
internal audit function to date, however, as Stage 4 is 
complete and the Group is undertaking further joint venture 
arrangements and acquisitions, an internal auditor is 
considered appropriate for the Group. The AC Committee 
has reviewed an initial draft scoping document which sets 
out the parameters for an internal audit of the Group’s 
internal controls, concentrating primarily on the systems 
and controls in the financial reporting framework. Following 
a tendering process, an external audit firm is likely to be 
engaged in the first half of 2014 to carry out the internal 
audit process. 
(c) External auditors
Deloitte was re‑engaged as the Group’s auditors following 
the AGM in May 2013 and has acted as the Group’s auditor 
throughout the year.
The AR Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on 
external audit. The policy assigns oversight responsibility for 
monitoring the independence, objectivity and compliance 
with ethical and regulatory requirements to the AR 
Committee, and day‑ to‑ day responsibility to the Chief 
Financial Officer. It states that the external auditor is jointly 
responsible to the Board and the AR Committee and that 
the AR Committee is the primary contact. 
The AR Committee is satisfied that the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor has not been compromised 
as a result of the provision on non‑audit services and taken 
as a whole, the level of fees are not material relative to the 
total income of the external audit firm. 
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the AR 
Committee reviewed:
•	 the arrangements for ensuring the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity; 
•	 the external auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 
and any variations from the plan;
•	 the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor in their 
handling of the key accounting and audit judgments; and 
•	 the external auditor’s qualifications, expertise 
and resources.
Having considered the effectiveness of the external auditor 
the AR Committee concluded that the external auditor 
was effective.
(d) Non‑audit services
The policy on non‑audit services sets out the categories 
which the external auditor will and will not be allowed 
to provide to the Group, including those that need 
pre‑approval by the AR Committee and those which require 
specific approval before they are contracted for, subject to 
de minimis levels.
Fees for audit services incurred during the year amounted to 
US$418,000 with non‑audit fees amounting to US$305,000. 
Full details of audit and non‑audit fees are set out in 
Note 22 to the financial statements.
During the year the non‑audit work carried out by Deloitte 
included the provision of tax and accounting services in 
relation to the take‑over of Ampella Mining Ltd, tax advice 
on Group structuring and compliance and statutory services 
for certain of the Group’s subsidiaries.
T o the extent necessary, the auditor obtained pre‑approval 
from the AR Committee before performing these services 
and has used separate teams for the tax advisory services 
and other related services, than the team performing 
the audit. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

(e) Risk assessment and risk mitigation
The Board delegated responsibility to the AR Committee 
to review and monitor the risk management systems. 
The Board have reviewed the significant risks facing the 
Group and considered the identification and mitigation 
of these key risks. The AR Committee aim to influence 
management’s risk appetite to ensure they are aligned 
with the long‑term objectives of the Group.
The Group conducts a variety of risk assessments 
throughout the year, which are reviewed by the Audit 
and Risk Committee and the Board in accordance with 
best practice guidelines and in compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and relevant Canadian 
requirements. The Group takes a number of measures 
to mitigate risks associated with the Company and 
underlying operational and exploration activity which are 
monitored and evaluated regularly. The exploration for and 
development of metals and mineral resources, together with 
the construction and development of mining operations is a 
speculative activity that involves a high degree of risk. 
Due to the nature of these inherent risks, it is not possible 
to give absolute assurance that mitigating actions will be 
wholly effective. The table below describes the key risks 
affecting the Company and its underlying operational and 
exploration activities together with the measures to mitigate 
risk and the preserved risk by management.
A full list of the principal risks affecting the Centamin Group 
can be found in the MD&A.
Risk category Description of potential risks Mitigation/commentary
Single project 
dependency 
for near‑term 
revenues
The Sukari Gold Mine currently constitutes Centamin’s main mineral 
Resource and Reserve and near‑term production and revenue. Any 
adverse development affecting the progress of the Sukari Project 
such as, but not limited to unusual and unexpected geologic 
formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave‑ins, flooding and other 
conditions involved in the drilling and removal of material, any of 
which could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines and other 
producing facilities, or any other event leading to a reduction in 
production or closure of mines or other producing facilities, damage 
to life or property, environmental damage, hiring suitable personnel 
and engineering contractors, or securing supply agreements on 
commercially suitable terms.
Mitigating factors include continued growth 
and expansion through exploration and 
acquisition targets both inside and outside of 
Egypt. Until further production growth beyond 
Sukari is identified the risk remains high.
Sukari Project 
joint venture risk 
and relationship 
with EMRA
SGM is owned jointly by PGM and EMRA, with equal board 
representation, whilst responsibility for the day‑to‑day management 
of SGM rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. 
The board of SGM operates by way of simple majority. As such, 
should the board of SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter 
requiring board‑level approval or in the event of any dispute arising 
between PGM and EMRA, which PGM is unable to amicably resolve, 
it may have to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to 
resolve the dispute, which could have a material and adverse effect 
on Centamin’s business, results of operations, financial performance 
and prospects.
Any dispute with EMRA may adversely affect the Centamin Group’s 
ability to manage the Sukari Project in the most effective way. Such 
a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share 
provisions of the Sukari Concession Agreement.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold Mine is in part 
dependent on maintaining a good working relationship with EMRA. 
The Group has regular meetings with officials from EMRA and 
invests time in liaising with relevant ministry and other governmental 
representatives. Management and the Board of Directors believe 
the Group has a positive and constructive working relationship 
with EMRA. The Group complies with all terms and conditions 
of the Concession Agreement covering the Sukari Gold Mine. 
EMRA has equal representation on the Board of Sukari Gold 
Mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all 
work programmes and expenditures. EMRA inspectors are closely 
involved in monitoring all aspects of the Sukari operations. Current 
discussions with EMRA are focused on determining the exact timing 
and quantum of the first payment of profit sharing for Sukari. Whilst 
the impact would be high, management believes there is a low 
probability of a material deterioration in relationships with EMRA, 
particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit 
share made during the year.
Mitigating factors include ensuring 
co‑operative relations with EMRA however the 
risk identified remains moderate.

Risk category Description of potential risks Mitigation/commentary
Failure to 
achieve 
production 
estimates
Centamin currently prepares estimates of future gold production 
for its existing and future development of the Sukari Gold Mine. 
There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production 
estimates and such failure could have a material and adverse effect 
on Centamin’s future cash flows, profitability, results of operations 
and financial condition. The realisation of production estimates 
are dependent on, amongst other things: the accuracy of mineral 
Reserve and Resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions 
regarding ore grades and recovery rates; ground conditions 
(including hydrology); physical characteristics of ores; the presence 
or absence of particular metallurgical characteristics; the accuracy 
of estimated rates and costs of mining (including access to and 
permitting for sufficient quantities of ammonium nitrate and related 
blasting products), ore haulage, the availability of suitable machinery 
and equipment, skilled labour and processing capacity and all 
logistics for consumables and parts.
Whilst there can be no certainties, production 
to date has provided confidence in 
management’s estimation and mine planning 
methods.
The pending commissioning of the Stage 4 
process plant means that the current risk 
rating remains high.
Currency and 
gold price risk
A significant portion of Centamin’s operating expenses are incurred 
in US dollars, Egyptian pounds and Great British pounds, whilst its 
revenues from gold sales are in US dollars. Furthermore, Centamin 
does not currently maintain any facilities for hedging its exposure 
to currencies or the price of gold, which fluctuates as a result of a 
number of factors beyond Centamin’s control.
Any appreciation in currencies other than US dollars in which the 
Group incurs material expenses or adverse fluctuations in the gold 
spot price, could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’s 
business, results of operations, financial performance and prospects.
Centamin manages its exposure to gold price 
fluctuations by retaining a focus on keeping 
operating costs as low as possible. However, 
the risks relating to gold price reductions 
remain high. The Group has not entered into 
forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural 
hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset 
foreign currency liabilities. The Company 
maintains a policy of not hedging its currency 
positions and maintains currency holdings 
in line with underlying requirements and 
commitments.
Litigation risks Centamin’s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be 
severely adversely affected by current and any future litigation 
proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be 
initiated against Centamin at any time.
Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both to (a) the 
validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the price at which it 
can purchase diesel fuel oil.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has:
(1)  engaged appropriate legal advice and 
continues to actively pursue its legal rights 
with respect to the existing litigation and 
its legal advisers believe that Centamin will 
ultimately be successful in both of these 
cases; and
(2)  management and the Company’s legal 
advisers monitor both activity in court and 
local media for signs of any litigation that 
may threaten its operations, finances or 
prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be 
balanced against Centamin’s adherence to 
local laws and agreements, as well as the 
Egyptian government’s support of Centamin’s 
investment and its proposals for a new 
investment law that could protect Centamin 
against litigation of this nature.
Reserve and 
resource 
estimates
The mineral resource and reserve estimates are prepared by 
Centamin Group personnel, with the assistance of independent 
geologists. By their nature, mineral resource and reserves are 
estimates based on a range of assumptions, including geological, 
metallurgical and technical factors. There can be no guarantee that 
the anticipated tonnages or grades expected by Centamin will be 
achieved.
Management has implemented processes to 
continuously monitor and evaluate the current 
life of the Sukari Gold Mine, mine plans and 
production targets. The most recent technical 
update was completed in the Form 43‑101F1 
dated 30 January 2014 and is available at 
www.sedar.com reflecting a reduction in 
resource and reserve estimates. This takes 
into account the latest drill results, higher cost 
environment and the timing of the Stage 4 
commissioning. Whilst there are no certainties, 
production to date has provided confidence in 
management’s estimation and mine planning 
methods. Details of the resource and reserve 
estimate can be found in the Performance 
Review.

Significant Issues highlighted during the year  
by the AR Committee 
The following significant issues were highlighted during 
the year by the AR Committee (full details and analysis 
are set out in Note 4 to the financial statements: The AR 
Committee discussed these critical accounting judgments 
and associated disclosures with management and as 
a committee).
(1) Impairment of assets (focusing on Sukari)
As a result of the decline in the gold price, the Group 
carried out an impairment test in relation to Sukari. In 
calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, 
certain assumptions are required to be made in respect 
of highly uncertain matters including management’s 
assumptions of:
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes; 
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
Based on the impairment test performed, management 
believe, and the AR Committee support management’s 
analysis that no impairment write‑downs were required. 
See Note 14.1 and 14.2 to the financial statements.
(2) Litigation
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both of 
which could, affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari 
in the manner in which it is currently operated and adversely 
affect its profitability.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either 
or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities 
are restricted to a reduced area, it is management’s belief 
that the Group will be able to continue as going concern. 
The AR Committee has reviewed the documentation 
relating to the status of both legal actions and supports 
the view of management. See Note 20 to the financial 
statements for details of the litigation.
(3) Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation 
and development expenditure
As described in Note 13 to the financial statements, 
management have taken the decision not to renew the 
Finarwa and Shehagne licences in respect of exploration 
rights held by Sheba Explorations Holding Limited, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Centamin plc, and have thus 
written off all expenditure incurred to date including the 
acquisition costs in relation to those licences amounting 
to US$6,712,752. 
Contained within Note 13 are details of the carrying value 
and write downs of investments held in other exploration 
companies. The AR Committee having considered 
management’s view on the sampling, drill results and assay 
results, supports the approach taken by management 
in respect to the above. In addition, the AR Committee 
recommended the timely recording of the impairment of 
Nyota Minerals Limited and Sahar Minerals Limited during 
the year.
(4) Revenue recognition
The AR Committee has considered the terms of the 
previous and current contract with Johnson Matthey 
(Canada) effective from 1 March 2014. The papers 
put forward by management with regards to revenue 
recognition have been reviewed by the AR committee 
who agree with the approach.
(5) Going concern
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (“FRC”) the directors of UK listed companies are 
required to consider whether the going concern basis is the 
appropriate basis of preparation of financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by 
management, in which any reasonably possible changes 
in the key assumptions on which cash flow forecast have 
been set out, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and the AR 
Committee agree with this view.
(6) Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group 
of companies, reflecting the substance and economic 
reality of the Concession Agreement (see Note 23 to the 
financial statements) and records all the assets, liabilities, 
income and expense of SGM on a 100% proportionate 
consolidation basis. The AR Committee reviewed papers 
from management and agree with the current accounting 
treatment as set out above.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the AR Committee 
has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor. A member of the AR 
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting 
along with the CFO to answer any questions in relation to 
this report.

may hold office only until the dissolution of the next 
annual general meeting after his appointment unless he is 
reappointed during that meeting. Each appointed director 
shall retire from office at each annual general meeting and 
may, if willing to act, be reappointed.
All directors must notify the Company of any shares held, 
acquired or disposed of in the Company. A register of 
director shareholdings is held at the registered office 
which is open to inspection by the members. The directors 
are also required to disclose shares held by their 
connected parties. 
Details of the interests of directors and their connected 
persons in the Company’s shares are outlined in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Corporate Governance Compliance Statement
The statement on compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) for the reporting period is 
contained in the Corporate Governance Report.
Political donations
Centamin does not make donations to any organisations 
with stated political associations. 
Supplier and payment policy
It is the Company’s policy that, subject to compliance 
with trading terms by the supplier, payments are made in 
accordance with terms and conditions agreed in advance 
with the supplier. Further details on trade creditors are 
provided in Note 15 to the financial statements.
Employees
Information relating to employees is contained in the 
CSR Report together with details of the number of 
employees at Sukari. Centamin abides by anti‑discrimination 
legislation in all jurisdictions in which it operates. These 
principles are also set out in the Company’s Code of 
Conduct which sets out the framework in which Centamin 
expects all staff to operate.
Strategic priority
The Centamin Group strategy is set out in the Strategic 
Report. In summary, the Sukari Project is set to double plant 
throughput to a nameplate rate of 10 million tonnes per 
annum (“Mtpa”) with a long‑term target production rate of 
450‑500,000 ounces per annum from 2015. 
Exploration at Sukari Hill and over the rest of the Sukari 
concession area is continuing, with further significant 
resource and reserve growth expected, particularly from the 
high grade underground mine areas.
Operating experience in Egypt gives it a significant 
advantage in acquiring and developing other gold projects. 
In 2013 Centamin agreed a recommended takeover offer 
for ASX‑listed Ampella Mining Ltd and formed a joint 
venture with AIM‑listed Alecto Minerals plc, adding highly 
prospective licence packages in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia.
Environmental compliance
The directors are aware of their commitment to 
environmental, community and social responsibility, 
details of which can be found in the CSR Report. 
An environmental policy has been established with the 
aim of ensuring environmental protection and sustainable 
development. The policy is based on pollution prevention 
and abatement approaches to protect the environment, 
community and indigenous people.
The environmental management scheme for the Sukari 
Project includes a monitoring programme designed to 
evaluate compliance with local environmental laws and 
regulations, company policies and international best 
practices. It provides information for periodic review 
and adjustment of the environmental management 
plan ensuring that environmental protection is achieved 
through early detection and mitigation of negative 
environmental impacts.
The Group is currently complying with relevant 
environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which it 
operates and has no knowledge of any environmental 
orders or breaches against the Group.

Greenhouse gas emissions
The greenhouse gas emissions reporting required by 
Schedule 7 of The Large and Medium‑Sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as 
amended by The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, is a requirement 
only on UK incorporated quoted companies. Centamin is 
taking steps during 2014 to capture the data required by 
this legislation.
Directors’ indemnity insurance
In accordance with Company’s Articles of Association and to 
the extent permitted by law, the Company may indemnify 
its directors out of its own funds to cover liabilities incurred 
as a result of their office.
The Company has entered into indemnity agreements 
with each director to indemnify each director to the extent 
permitted by applicable law and excluding any matters 
involving fraud, dishonesty, wilful default or bad faith on the 
part of a director.
During the year, the Company paid a premium in respect 
of a contract insuring the directors and officers of the 
Company and any related body corporate against a liability 
incurred as a director or officer to the extent permitted by 
law. This provides insurance cover for any claim brought 
against directors or officers for wrongful acts in connection 
with their positions. The insurance provided does not 
extend to claims arising from fraud or dishonesty and it 
does not provide cover for civil or criminal fines or penalties 
imposed by law.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements.
The going concern statement is detailed in full in Note 3 to 
the financial statements.
External auditors 
So far as each current director of the Company is aware, 
there is no information relevant to the audit of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware, and each director has 
taken all the steps necessary as a director to make himself 
aware of any such information and to ensure that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Following a review of its governance arrangements and in 
the light of recommendations in the Code, the Company 
envisages commencing an audit tender process to be 
concluded in June 2014 and will invite a number of leading 
audit firms to tender, including its current auditor, Deloitte. 
Pending the outcome of the tender, the Audit and Risk 
Committee intend recommending to the Board the 
reappoint of Deloitte as auditor at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.
Deloitte has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and be included in the tender process.
Subsequent events
Subsequent to the year end, the Company acquired, via its 
wholly owned subsidiary, a controlling interest in Ampella 
Mining Ltd. The details of all subsequent events occurring 
after the reporting date are contained in Note 30 to the 
financial statements.

Directors’ responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and financial statements in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991 (the “Law”) and applicable 
laws and regulations. The Law requires the Company to 
prepare financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and Company has chosen 
to prepare the accounts in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union.
The directors must not approve the accounts unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that directors:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in 
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information; 
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance; 
and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Law. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom and Jersey governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors are also responsible for the preparation 
of the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement. These reports are contained within the annual 
report and financial statements.
The directors concluded that the annual report and 
financial statements, when taken as a whole, were 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report 
to the members of Centamin plc
Opinion on financial statements of Centamin plc
In our opinion the financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
as adopted by the European Union; and
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law, 1991.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows and the related Notes 1 to 30. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union.
Emphasis of matter – significant uncertainty relating to 
the outcome of the Sukari exploitation lease judgment
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which 
is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosures made in Notes 3, 4 and 20 to the financial 
statements concerning the 30 October 2012 judgment 
of the Egyptian Administrative Court, which found the 
Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease for the Sukari 
mine to be invalid, but separately found that there was 
in existence a valid 3km
2
 exploitation lease. The Group 
has filed an appeal before the Supreme Administrative 
Court in Egypt to challenge this judgment and on 
20 March 2013 the Court suspended the enforcement 
of the judgment pending a hearing on the merits of 
the appeal. 
Whilst the directors are confident based on legal advice 
that the matter will be resolved in the Group’s favour, 
the ultimate outcome of the appeal cannot presently 
be determined with any certainty, and no impairment or 
other impact that may result has been recorded in the 
financial statements.
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 83 
that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
•	 we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; and
•	 we have not identified any material uncertainties that 
may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
The appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court in 
Egypt concerning the validity of the Sukari exploitation lease
Centamin has an ongoing legal case relating to the validity of 
its exploitation lease for Sukari. If Centamin lose the case they 
will lose the right to exploit the 160km
2
 area previously provided 
within the concession agreement and will revert to a 3km
2
 
exploitation area. 
The outcome of this legal case is subject to significant uncertainty 
and accordingly we have included an emphasis of matter within 
our audit opinion as set out above.
We reviewed legal advice from management’s external legal 
counsel in connection with the legal case. This advice specifically 
assessed the risk that the Group may not succeed in its appeal 
against the Administrative Court ruling. 
We held meetings with the Groups’s internal and external legal 
counsel and evaluated management’s assessment of the outcome 
of the court case. 
We have reviewed the disclosures within the financial statements 
for consistency with opinions given by the Group’s internal and 
external legal counsel.
The assessment of the risk of impairment of the Sukari 
producing asset
The Sukari producing asset is material by virtue of its size and 
nature to Centamin. In a reducing gold price environment there is 
a risk that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable.
We challenged management’s assumptions and key inputs used 
in the impairment model for the Sukari producing asset including 
the discount rate, cash flow projections, the reserves, gold price 
and production profile. Where applicable, we assessed the key 
assumptions in line with observable industry benchmarks and 
compared them to external data, employing the use of internal 
specialists. We assessed whether the assumptions used were in 
accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. 
We also visited the Sukari mine as part of our audit procedures. 
Our visit enabled us to corroborate our understanding with 
operational staff and to observe that mining activity was consistent 
with the Group’s mine plan.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Independent auditor’s report continued
to the members of Centamin plc
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
The claim before the Administrative Court in Egypt 
concerning diesel fuel disputes
Centamin has an ongoing legal case relating to historical and 
current fuel subsidies. The potential amount that could be 
recouped relating to the current subsidy case is $97m and the 
potential amount that the Company could have to pay if they lose 
the historical case is $60m. 
We reviewed legal advice from management’s external legal 
counsel in connection with the legal case. 
We held meetings with the Group’s internal and external legal 
counsel and evaluated management’s assessment of the outcome 
of the court case. 
We have reviewed the disclosures within the financial statements 
for consistency with opinions given by the Group’s internal and 
external legal counsel. 
The assessment of the risk of impairment of exploration and 
evaluation assets
The Group capitalises exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) 
expenditure in line with IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation 
of Mineral Resources. The assessment of each asset’s future 
prospectively requires significant judgement. There is a risk that 
amounts are capitalised which no longer meet the recognition 
criteria of IFRS 6. 
We considered and challenged the appropriateness of 
management’ s judgements in relation to the ongoing viability of 
their exploration and evaluation asset base.
We participated in meetings with key operational and finance 
staff to understand the exploration and evaluation activities and 
gathered evidence relevant to the recoverability of exploration 
and evaluation assets carried forward, including drilling results, 
confirmations of any changes to license conditions, exploration 
and evaluation budgets and ongoing exploration activity. We 
also reviewed and challenged management’ s assessment of 
impairment indicators of exploration assets in accordance with IFRS 
6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on pages 78 and 79.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement 
in the financial statements that makes it probable that 
the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. We use 
materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work 
and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be 
$10 million, which is approximately 5% of the Group’s 
profit before impairment charges and tax, and below 1% 
of equity. Impairment charges have been added back 
because, if included, they would distort the materiality 
assessment year on year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of £200,000, as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an 
understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including group-wide controls, and assessing the risks  
of material misstatement at the group level. 
Based on that assessment, our group audit scope 
focused primarily on the Sukari Gold Mine, the Group’s 
principal operation, which was subject to a full audit at a 
lower level of materiality. This location accounts for 95% 
of the Group’s net assets, 100% of the Group’s revenue 
and 100% of the Group’s gross profit.
All audit work to respond to the risks of material 
misstatement was performed directly by the group audit 
engagement team. In the year, members of the group 
audit engagement team visited the Sukari mine site, the 
headquarters of the Egyptian office in Alexandria and 
the headquarters of Centamin plc in Jersey. 
Other Group companies in Australia and Jersey, and 
exploration assets in other companies, were subject 
to specific audit procedures to address identified risks 
and other matters with all work performed by the 
group audit team. We did not employ the use of any 
component auditors for the purpose of the Group audit.
Matters on which we are required  
to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received  
and accounting records 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
•	 proper accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or proper returns adequate for 
our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
•	 the financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the 
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the information in the 
audited financial statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
•	 otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether 
we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ 
statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether the 
annual report appropriately discloses those matters 
that we communicated to the audit committee which 
we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm 
that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Other matters 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 
2006 as if that Act had applied to the company.
We have reviewed certain elements of the report to the 
shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration as if 
the company had been incorporated in the UK and have 
nothing to report to you in that respect. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review 
team, strategically focused second partner reviews and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law, 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and/or those further matters we have expressly 
agreed to report to them on in our engagement letter and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

1. General information
Centamin plc (the “Company”) is a listed public company, incorporated in Jersey and operating through subsidiaries and 
jointly controlled entities operating in Egypt, Ethiopia, United Kingdom and Australia. It is the parent company of the 
Group, comprising the Company and its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities. 
Registered office and principal place of business
Centamin plc

The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report and the Performance 
Review of the Annual Report.
2. Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In the current year, no new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted that have affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption 
has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but, with the exception of the 
amendment to IFRS 1, may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
IFRS 1 (amended) Government Loans The amendment addresses how a first-time adopter would account for a 
government loan with a below-market rate of interest when transitioning to 
IFRS. The amendments mirror the requirements for existing IFRS preparers 
in relation to the application of amendments made to IAS 20 Accounting for 
Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance in relation to 
accounting for government loans.
IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – 
Offsetting Financial Assets and 
Financial Liabilities
Amends the disclosure requirements to require information about all 
recognised financial instruments that are set off. The amendments also require 
disclosure of information about recognised financial instruments subject to 
enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements even if 
they are not set off under IAS 32. The IASB believes that these disclosures 
will allow financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect 
of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with an entity’s 
recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities, on the entity’s 
financial position.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value when such 
measurements are required or permitted by other standards. The adoption 
of IFRS 13 has not had any significant impact on the fair value measurements 
carried out by the Group and the amounts reported within the unaudited 
interim condensed consolidated financial statements. IFRS 13 requires 
specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace existing disclosure 
requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures. IFRS 13 also results in an amendment to IAS 34 requiring that 
some of these disclosures relating to financial instruments are made in the 
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Improvements to IFRS 2009 – 2011 Aside from those items already identified above, the amendments made to 
standards under the 2009 – 2011 improvements to IFRS 2 have had no impact 
on the Group.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by 
the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
IAS 27 (revised)  Separate Financial Statements  
IAS 28 (revised)  Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) 
IAS 32 (revised) Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
IAS 36 (revised)  Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
The directors are still considering the impact of adoption of new accounting standards and note that the main impacts 
upon the adoption of the new standards will be:
•	 IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments;
•	 IFRS 10 and 11 will introduce revised definitions of control and joint arrangements and the Group will consider the 
accounting for the Concession Agreement under this guidance. The directors’ determination of the appropriate 
treatment under the new accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact in the year of adoption; and
•	 IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the Group has in other entities.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a 
detailed review has been completed.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) 
adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”) and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU 
IAS Regulation.
There are no changes in these accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2013 except as disclosed in Note 3 
below “Changes in accounting policy”.
Changes in accounting policy
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 
The Group adopted IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement on its effective date of 1 January 2013. IFRS 13 establishes a single 
framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are required or permitted by other standards. The adoption 
of IFRS 13 has not had any significant impact on the fair value measurements carried out by the Group and the amounts 
reported within the Group financial statements. IFRS 13 requires specific disclosures on fair values, some of which replace 
existing disclosure requirements in other standards, including IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. 
A number of other amendments to accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
also apply for the first time in 2013. These do not have a significant impact on the accounting policies. These financial 
statements are denominated in United States dollars, which is the functional currency of Centamin plc. All companies in the 
Group use the United States dollar as their functional currency except for Sheba Exploration Holdings Limited and Sheba 
Exploration Limited that use the Great British pound. All financial information presented in United States dollars has been 
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for the revaluation of certain 
non-current assets and financial instruments. Cost is based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange 
for assets. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise 
the consolidated entity, being the company (the parent entity) and its subsidiaries as defined in IAS 27 Consolidated and 
Separate Financial Statements. Consistent accounting policies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the 
Company obtains control and until such time as the Company ceases to control such entity. Control is achieved where 
the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from 
its activities.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, and unrealised profits 
arising within the consolidated entity are eliminated in full.
Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) is jointly controlled by PGM and EMRA on a 50% equal basis. For accounting purposes, 
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 23). Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, PGM solely funds SGM’s activities. PGM is 
also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue (excluding the royalty payable to 
ARE) (a) all current operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial production; (b) exploration costs, 
including those accumulated to the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum); and (c) exploitation capital costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial 
production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated cost per annum). 
EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE 
and recoverable costs). Accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been recognised to date. Any payment made to EMRA 
pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a variable charge in the income statement. 
Going concern
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which 
contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations. During the year 
the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. A detailed summary of the litigation is available in Note 20 
of these financial statements. The first of these followed from a decision taken by EGPC to charge international, not local 
(subsidised) prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil, and the second arose as a result of judgment of an Administrative Court 
of first instance in relation to, amongst other matters, the Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease. 
In relation to the first decision, the Company remains confident that in the event that it is required to continue to pay 
international prices, the mine at Sukari will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the Company remains confident that 
the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the Administrative Court will ultimately be successful, although 
final resolution of it may take some time. On 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s 
application to suspend the decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing 
assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process. 
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are 
restricted to a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the Group will be able to continue as going concern. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
Accounting policies
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial statements satisfy the 
concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events 
is reported.
The following significant policies have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of these financial statements:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly-liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or other 
financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at 
FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: 
•	 it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
•	 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has 
a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or
•	 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; or
•	 the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and 
its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
•	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in 
profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and 
is included in the “other gains and losses” line item in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a 
financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, 
a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or 
they expire.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and 
are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through 
the profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the Company financial statements. 
Other financial assets are “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial 
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Financial assets continued
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest 
income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
Available-for-sale financial assets (“AFS”)
Listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being 
AFS and are stated at fair value. The Group also has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market 
but that are classified as AFS financial assets and stated at fair value (because the directors consider that fair value can be 
reliably measured). Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 26. Gains and losses arising from changes 
in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated profits with the exception of impairment 
losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividends 
is established.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and 
translated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit 
or loss are determined based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are 
recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Loans and receivables 
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classified as “loans and receivables”. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate except for short-term 
receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
reporting date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been 
impacted. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. 
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account 
are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of available-for-sale equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment 
loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, 
the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the 
investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the 
impairment not been recognised.
In respect of available-for-sale equity instruments, any subsequent increase in fair value after an impairment loss is 
recognised in other comprehensive income.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. 
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have 
to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group 
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Employee benefits
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave 
and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within twelve months, are measured at their 
nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement. Liabilities recognised in respect 
of employee benefits which are not expected to be settled within twelve months are measured as the present value of 
the estimated future cash flows to be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services provided by employees up to 
reporting date.
Superannuation 
The Company contributes to, but does not participate in, compulsory superannuation funds on behalf of the employees 
and directors in respect of salaries and directors’ fees paid. Contributions are charged against income as they are made.
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration and 
evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
(b) at least one of the following conditions is also met:
(i) the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and 
exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; or
(ii) exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and 
significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost and include acquisition of rights to explore, studies, 
exploration drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities. General and administrative costs are only included in 
the measurement of exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular 
area of interest.
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances (as defined in IFRS 6 
Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources) suggest that the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation 
assets may exceed its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation assets (or the 
cash-generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated, being no larger than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset in previous years.
Where a decision is made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest, the relevant exploration 
and evaluation asset is tested for impairment, reclassified to mine development properties, and then amortised over the life 
of the reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations have commenced.
Mine development expenditure is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. 
When commercial production in an area of interest has commenced, the associated costs are amortised over the 
estimated economic life of the mine on a units of production basis.
Changes in factors such as estimates of proved and probable reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt 
with on a prospective basis. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Accounting policies continued
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group entity are presented in its functional currency being the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, 
the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in United States dollars, which is the functional currency of the 
Group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. All companies in the Group use the United 
States dollar as their functional currency except for Sheba Exploration Holdings Limited (previously, Sheba Exploration (UK) 
plc) and Sheba Exploration Limited that use the Great British pound.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, 
monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs including an appropriate portion of fixed and 
variable overhead expenses are assigned to inventory on hand by the method appropriate to each particular class of 
inventory, with the majority being valued on a weighted average cost basis. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and bullion are valued applying absorption costing.
Interests in joint ventures
Jointly controlled entities 
Where the Group is a venturer (and so has joint control) in a jointly controlled entity, the Group recognises its share of the 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses, line by line, in the consolidated financial statements. 
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 23). 
Leased assets
Leased assets are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where other 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Plant and equipment will include 
capitalised development expenditure. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item 
as well as the estimated cost of abandonment. In the event that settlement of all or part of the purchase consideration 
is deferred, cost is determined by discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present value as at the date 
of acquisition.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the 
net cost or other revalued amount of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each annual financial 
period, with the effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:
Plant and equipment  2 – 50 years 
Office equipment  3 – 7 years  
Mining equipment  2 – 13 years 
Land and buildings  4 – 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Mine development properties
Where mining of a mineral resource has commenced, the accumulated costs are transferred from exploration and 
evaluation assets to mine development properties.
Amortisation is first charged to new mine development ventures from the date of first commercial production. Amortisation 
of mine properties is on a unit of production basis resulting in an amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the 
proved and probable ore reserves. The unit of production can be on a tonnes or an ounce depleted basis.
Capitalised underground development costs incurred to enable access to specific ore blocks or areas of the underground 
mine, and which only provide an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area, are depreciated on a 
units of production basis, whereby the denominator is estimated ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves within 
that ore block or area where it is considered probable that those resources will be extracted economically.
Stripping activity assets
The Group defers stripping costs incurred (removal of mine waste materials which provide improved access to further 
quantities of material that will be mined in future periods). The Group changed its accounting policy on stripping costs in 
the production phase of a surface mine IFRIC 20 effective 1 January 2012. IFRIC 20 provides clarity on how to account for 
and measure the removal of mine waste materials which provide access to mineral ore deposits. This waste removal activity 
is known as “stripping”. There can be two benefits accruing to the entity from the stripping activity:
•	 usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and 
•	 improved access to further quantities of material that will be mined in future periods.
The costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in accordance with the principles of IAS 2 Inventories to the extent that 
the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory produced. The costs of stripping activity which 
provides a benefit in the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a non-current “stripping activity asset” where the 
following criteria are met: 
(a) it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity 
will flow to the entity;
(b) the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved; and
(c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably.
When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory produced are not separately identifiable, production 
stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by using an allocation basis 
that is based on a relevant production measure. A stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to, or as an 
enhancement of, an existing asset and classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the existing asset of 
which it forms part. A stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or its revalued 
amount less depreciation or amortisation and impairment losses. A stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised on 
a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more accessible 
as a result of the stripping activity. The stripping activity asset is depreciated using a units of production method based on 
the total ounces to be produced over the life of the component of the ore body.
Deferred stripping costs are included in “stripping assets”, within tangible assets. These form part of the total investment in 
the relevant cash-generating unit, which is reviewed for impairment if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in operating costs. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

Impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets)
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future flows have not 
been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Where an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or less, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case the reversal of an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services in the normal 
course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the Group has passed the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will 
flow to the Group, the sales price can be measured reliably, and the Group has no significant continuing involvement and 
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. This is when insurance risk has 
passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location.
Where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the 
mineral production by the buyer (for instance an assay for gold content), recognition of the revenue from the sale of mineral 
production is based on the most recently determined estimate of product specifications.
Pre-production revenues 
Income derived by the entity prior to the date of commercial production is offset against the expenditure capitalised and 
carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. All revenues recognised after commencement of commercial 
production are recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated above. The commencement date of commercial 
production is determined when stable and sustained production capacity has been achieved.
Interest revenue 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably. Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 
and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through 
the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Production royalty 
The Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) is entitled to a royalty of 3% of net sales revenue as defined from the sale of gold and 
associated minerals from the Sukari Project. This royalty is calculated and recognised on receipt of the final certificate of 
analysis document received from the refinery. Due to its nature, this royalty is not recognised in cost of sales.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

for the year ended 31 December 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
101
Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted 
against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with 
relevant IFRS. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have 
previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would 
be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3 (2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
•	 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards 
are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale.
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard. If the initial accounting 
for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group 
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the 
amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a 
joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted 
for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value 
of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to 
the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill 
is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. 
Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over 
the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the relevant associate.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments with employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value 
of the equity instrument at grant date. Fair value is measured by the use of the Black Scholes model. Where share-based 
payments are subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on 
the consolidated entity’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
102
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments continued
Equity-settled share-based transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, 
except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Further details on how the fair value of 
equity-settled share-based transactions has been determined can be found in Note 27. At each reporting date, the 
Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.
Issued capital
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds.
Where the Company or other members of the consolidated Group purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the 
consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders’ equity of the Group and/or of the Company as treasury shares 
until they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in 
shareholders’ equity of the Group and/or the Company.
Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible 
in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from 
goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction 
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries 
and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary 
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the 
liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences 
that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Special considerations
In Australia, Centamin Egypt Limited and Pharaoh Gold Mines NL have elected to form a tax consolidated group and 
therefore are treated as a single entity for Australian income tax purposes. Pharaoh Gold Mines NL has elected into the 
“Branch Profits Exemption” whereby foreign branch income will generally not be subject to Australian income tax.
In Egypt, Centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by Sukari Gold 
Mining Company’s activities is granted a long-term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in Egypt. 
Restoration and rehabilitation
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of exploration, 
development and production activities undertaken, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably. The estimated future obligations include 
the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of the affected areas. The provision for future 
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation 
at the reporting date. Future restoration costs are reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate are reflected in the 
present value of the restoration provision at each reporting date.
The initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and mining 
production activities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and amortised on the same basis as the related asset, 
unless the present obligation arises from the production of the inventory in the period, in which case the amount is 
included in the cost of production for the period. Changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration and rehabilitation 
are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a 
finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.
4. Critical accounting judgments 
Critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Management has discussed its critical accounting judgments and associated disclosures with the Company’s Audit and 
Risk Committee.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets)
IFRS requires management to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of 
a finite lived asset may not be recoverable. As a result of the decline in the gold price, the Group carried out an impairment 
test over the assets, other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets.
Impairment testing is an area involving management judgment, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of 
assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections 
which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain 
assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management’s assessment of:
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes ;
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
Each year, the Group prepares and approves a formal one year budget for its operations. The Group then extended the 
data produced in the budget over the life of mine for inclusion in the value in use calculations. The impairment test is highly 
sensitive to the gold price and an impairment would be required if the gold price falls below US$1,280 per ounce at a 
discount rate of 12%. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

4. Critical accounting judgments continued
Critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies continued
Litigation
The Group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related 
to pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see Note 20 to the financial statements). Judgment is necessary 
in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of 
the financial settlement.
The Group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari in the 
manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. The details of this litigation, which relate to 
the loss of the Egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the Group to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 
determined by the Administrative Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are given in Note 
20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available on SEDAR 
at www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not currently 
possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km
2
. 
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including the making of formal legal appeals and, although their 
resolution may take some time, management remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved. 
In the meantime, however, the Group is continuing to pay international prices for diesel fuel oil. With respect to the 
Administrative Court ruling, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application to 
suspend this decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that 
normal operations would be able to continue during this process.
In the unlikely event that the Group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are 
restricted to a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the Group will be able to continue as going concern.
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure 
being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction 
activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the 
existence of reserves. 
This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in 
particular whether the Group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether an economically 
viable extraction operation can be established. Such estimates and assumptions may change from period to period as new 
information becomes available. If, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being capitalised, a judgment 
is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, the relevant capitalised amount will 
be written off to the income statement.
As described in Note 13 to the financial statements, management have taken the decision not to renew the Shehagne 
or Finarwa/Winibo (Werie Lehe and Saharti) licences in respect of exploration rights held Sheba Explorations Holding 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centamin plc, and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including the 
acquisition costs in relation to those licences amounting to US$6,712,752. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the Group has passed the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will 
flow to the Group, the sales price can be measured reliably, and the Group has no significant continuing involvement and 
the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. This is when insurance risk has 
passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location.
Going concern
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) the directors of UK listed companies are required 
to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis of preparation of financial statements.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2013 CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013
105
Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, in which any reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Key assumptions under-pinning this 
forecast include:
•	 litigation as discussed in Note 20 to the financial statements;
•	 forecast gold price;
•	 production volumes; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations, in preparing 
the financial statements
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”)
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin Group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see Note 23 to the financial statements).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the 
reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
The Group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing 
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The provision has been calculated taking into account the 
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and monitoring of 
the affected areas. The provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates 
and production costs for future cash flows. It also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models. The 
economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period. Changes in 
ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, provision for rehabilitation assets 
and deferred taxes. Ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income and the calculation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and 
reserve growth. It is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, 
based on current information. However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for 
further reserve definition, the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth 
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production 
used in depreciation calculations.
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the Sukari mine is based on reserve estimates. 
Management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative, based on current information. 
However, as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition, 
the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground 
mine development.
Depreciation of the Sukari plant
Sukari plant, capitalised within plant and equipment, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 45 year economic life. 
When determining the useful economic life of the plant, management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead 
to future reserves increases at the Sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine, which is 2029 
based on current reserves. Management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its 
current expiry date of 2035. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

The directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their unusual, irregular or

In January 2012 the Company received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue 
supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the reason that 
this letter was issued was that Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum 
Corporation (“EGPC”). It is further understood that EGPC itself took the decision to issue this instruction because it 
had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of the Council of State (an internal government advisory 
department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not entitled to such subsidies. 
In addition, the Company during the year received a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received 
in the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to some US$60 million (EG£403 million).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State) and in consequence in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the 
Administrative Courts. Again, the Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every prospect 
of success. However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the Group has since 
January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the international price for diesel.  CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

6. Profit before tax continued
As at the date of the financial statements, no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. 
Furthermore, the Group remains of the view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome 
and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour. However, 
management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this 
reason has, fully provided against the prepayment of US$97.0 million, as an exceptional item, of which US$55.6 million 
was provided for during 2013 as follows: 
(a) a US$51.0 million increase in cost of sales; 
(b) a US$1.7 million increase in stores inventories; 
(c) a US$2.1 million increase in mining stockpiles and ore in circuit; and 
(d) a US$0.8 million increase in property, plant and equipment (capital WIP).
This has resulted in a net decrease of US$51.0 million in the profit and loss.

Tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity
Companies within the Group’s wholly-owned Australian resident entities formed a tax-consolidated group with effect 
from 1 July 2003. The head entity within the tax-consolidated Group is Centamin Egypt Limited. The members of the 
tax-consolidated Group are identified at Note 21.
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing agreements
Entities within the tax-consolidated Group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax-sharing agreement with 
the head entity. Under the terms of the tax-funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and each of the entities in the 
tax-consolidated Group has agreed to pay a tax-equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax 
liability or current tax asset of the entity. Such amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities 
in the tax-consolidated group.
The tax-sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax-consolidated Group provides for the determination 
of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. 
No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts 
under the tax-sharing agreement is considered remote.

Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. 
The average age of the receivables is 18 days (2012: 35 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are no trade 
receivables past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. 
Of the trade receivables balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from Johnson Matthey of Canada. The amount due 
has been received subsequent to year end and was considered to be fully recoverable. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

During the year, as a result of the decline in the gold price, the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the 
property, plant and equipment. The review did not lead to a recognition of an impairment loss. The discount rate used in 
measuring value in use was 12% per annum and the assumed average gold price was US$1,342 per ounce. No impairment 
was performed in 2012 as there was no indication of impairment. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

The exploration and evaluation asset relates to the drilling, geological exploration and sampling of potential ore reserves. 
During the prior year the Group acquired the exploration rights in Sheba Exploration Holdings Limited (previously, Sheba 
Exploration (UK) plc) for US$10.2 million in relation to the licences of Finarwa/Winibo (Werie Lehe and Saharti), granted 
until 29 November 2013, Shehagne, granted until 21 September 2013 and the Una Deriam, granted until 19 March 2014. 
The Una Deriam licence is renewable for a period of one year, however, management has taken the decision not to renew 
the licences in respect of Finarwa/Winibo and Shehagne and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including 
the acquisition costs in relation to those licences.

The available-for-sale financial asset at period end relates to a 12.62% (2012: 13.62%) equity interest in Nyota Minerals 
Limited (“NYO”), a listed public company. During the year, management made the decision to sell its interest in Nyota and 
the financial asset has now been classed as a current asset.
As a result of the prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment in Nyota, an impairment loss has been recognised 
and the cumulative investments revaluation reserve balance within the accumulated profit reserve has been transferred to

was acquired in July 2011, 3% acquired in December 2012, and a further 4% acquired in September 2013. The associate 
holds exploration rights and continues to explore, however, management has taken the decision to write off the costs 
associated with the interest held in Sahar as a result of management’s intention to put all assets into hibernation as a result 
of funding requirements.

Trade payables principally comprise the amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit 
period taken for trade purchases is 69 days (2012: 38 days). Trade payables are interest free for periods ranging from 30 to 
180 days. Thereafter interest is charged at commercial rates. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to 
ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximate their fair value.

Contingent liabilities
Fuel supply
In January 2012, the Group received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would only be able to supply Diesel 
Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at international prices rather than at local subsidised prices, which had the effect 
of adding approximately US$150 per ounce to the cost of production. It is understood that the reason that this letter was 
issued was that Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation 
(“EGPC”). It is further understood that EGPC itself issued this instruction because it had received legal advice from the 
Legal Advice Department of the Council of State (an internal government advisory department) that the companies 
operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not entitled to such subsidies. In November, the Group received 
a further demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period from late 2009 through 
to January 2012, amounting to EG£403 million (approximately US$60 million at current exchange rates).
The Group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by the Legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State) and in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative 
Courts. Again, the Group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good prospect of success. 
However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the continuation of supply whilst the matter is resolved, the Group 
has since January advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the international price for fuel.
As at the date of this document, no decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. The Group remains of the 
view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced 
thus far should the court proceeding be successfully concluded. However, management recognises the practical difficulties 
associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of 
US$97.0 million, as an exceptional item. Refer to Note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for further details on the 
impact of this exceptional provision on the Group’s results for 2013.
No provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal advice, 
the Company believes that the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Concession Agreement court case 
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, 
amongst others, an independent member of the previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the 
agreement that confers on the Group rights to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was 
entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s 
wholly-owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was approved by the People’s Assembly as law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient 
evidence had been submitted to Court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation lease” between PGM 
and EMRA had received approval from the relevant Minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. 
Accordingly, the Court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated 
that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed 
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease was approved by the Minister of 
Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the Court. 
Upon notification of the judgment the Group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine 
at Sukari. These included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. 
In addition, in conjunction with the formal appeal the Group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the 
initial decision until such time as the court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the 
Court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations would be 
able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way. 
EMRA lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 November 2012, the day after the Company’s appeal was 
lodged. Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter 
publicly indicated that, in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the “exploitation” lease 
was valid. The Minister of Petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to 
the country. The Company believes this demonstrates the government’s commitment to our investment at Sukari and the 
desire to stimulate further investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude, although it is aware of the potential for the process in 
Egypt to be lengthy. The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading 
Egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease. 
It therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful. In the 
event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the Group, the operations 
at Sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the Group’s operation exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km² 
referred to in the original court decision. 
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal case is heard.
Contingent assets
There were no contingent assets at the year end (31 December 2012: nil).

and independence could be compromised. These safeguards include the implementation of a policy on the use of the 
external auditor for non-audit related services. 
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed 
by the auditor of the Company for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible 
provided that it has been pre-approved. All these services are also subject to a predefined fee limit. Any work performed in 
excess of this limit must be approved by the Audit Committee. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA and the 
Arab Republic of Egypt granting PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals 
in specific concession areas located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession Agreement came into effect under 
Egyptian law on 13 June 1995. 
In 2001 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an Exploitation Lease over 160 square kilometres surrounding the Sukari 
Project site. The Exploitation Lease was signed by PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and gives tenure for 
a period of 30 years, commencing 24 May 2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 30 years upon PGM providing 
reasonable commercial justification.

Introduction Strategic report Performance review Management discussion Governance Financial statements
In 2006 SGM, was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, 
exploitation and marketing operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the project rests with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM. 
The fiscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that PGM solely funds SGM. PGM is however entitled to recover 
from sales revenue recoverable costs, as defined in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net 
production surplus or profit share (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). 
As at 31 December 2013, PGM has not recovered its cost and accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been recognised 
to date, It is anticipated that the first payment to EMRA will become payable during 2015, Any payment made to 
EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a variable royalty charge to the 
income statement. 
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following: 
•	 from 1 April 2010, being the date of commercial production, the Sukari Project is entitled to a 15 year exemption from 
any taxes imposed by the Egyptian government on the revenues generated from the Sukari Project. PGM and EMRA 
intend that SGM will in due course file an application to extend the tax-free period for a further 15 years. The extension 
of the tax-free period requires that there has been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain 
activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed by all parties; 
•	 PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and 
consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the Sukari Project. The exemption 
shall only apply if there is no local substitution with the same of similar quality to the imported machinery, equipment or 
consumables. Such exemption will also be granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the 
imported machinery, equipment or consumables after the additional of the insurance and transportation costs; 
•	 PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and 
associated minerals produced from the Sukari Project; 
•	 PGM at all times is free to transfer in US dollars or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of PGM 
representing its share of net proceeds and recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government limitation, tax or duty
•	 PGM’s contractors and sub-contractors are entitled to import machinery. Equipment and consumable items under the 
“Temporary Release System” which provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty; and
•	 legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed 
and movable assets remains with PGM and SGM.

26. Financial instruments
(a) Group risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the cash and equity balance. The Group’s overall 
strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial period.
The Group has no debt and thus is not geared at year end or in the prior year. The capital structure consists of cash and 
cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves as disclosed 
in Notes 17 and 18. The Group operates in Australia, Jersey, Egypt and Ethiopia. None of the Group’s entities are subject 
to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group utilises inflows of funds toward the ongoing exploration and development of the Sukari Gold Project in Egypt.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential risk adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the Group’s financial 
targets whilst protecting future financial security. The Group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position 
against these objectives.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; 
and interest rate. These risks are managed under Board approved directives through the Audit Committee. The Group’s 
principal financial instruments comprise interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other financial instruments include 
trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, Group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments 
be undertaken. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

26. Financial instruments continued
(c) Market risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the Australian dollar, Great British pound and Egyptian pound. Exposure to Canadian dollars has 
diminished considerably when compared to prior periods. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions 
and recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The risk 
is measured by regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the Group’s financial position.
Financial instruments denominated in Great British pound, Australian dollar and Egyptian pound are as follows:

The following table summarises the sensitivity of financial instruments held at the reporting date to movements in the 
exchange rate of the Great British and Egyptian pounds and Australian dollar to the United States dollar, with all other 
variables held constant. The sensitivities are based on reasonably possible changes over a financial period, using the 
observed range of actual historical rates.

US$/E£ increase by 10%     3,003 238 — —
US$/E£ decrease by 10%     (3,003) (238) — —
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease in 
foreign currency cash holdings in Australian dollars and Great British pounds and a corresponding increase in US dollar 
cash holdings.
The Group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset 
foreign currency liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency 
holdings in line with underlying requirements and commitments.
(d) Commodity price risk
The Group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, in particular gold prices. The Group has 
not entered into forward gold hedging contracts.

(e) Interest rate risk
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from cash and short-term deposits and is not considered to be a material risk due 
to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 30 days 
at a time.

(f) Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its financial commitments 
in a timely and cost effective manner.
Ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who has established an appropriate 
management framework for the management of the Group’s funding requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by 
maintaining adequate cash reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity on the basis of 
expected cash flow. The tables above reflect a balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk 
based on those values. Trade payables and other financial liabilities originate from the financing of assets used in the 
Group’s ongoing operations. These assets are considered in the Group’s overall liquidity risk. Management continually 
reviews the Group liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain 
appropriate liquidity levels.

(g) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral 
or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group measures 
credit risk on a fair value basis. The Group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the Group has good credit checks 
on customers and none of the trade receivables from the customer has been past due. Also, the cash balances held in 
Canadian and Australian dollars are held with a financial institution with a high credit rating.
The gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained.

(h) Fair value
The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their 
respective fair values, principally as a consequence of the short-term maturity thereof.
(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”)
The consolidated entity had an Employee Share Option Plan (“ESOP”) in place for executives and employees. Options 
were issued to key management personnel under the Employee Option Plan 2006 (previously the Employee Option Plan 
2002) as part of their remuneration. Options were offered to key management personnel at the discretion of the directors, 
having regard, among other things, to the length of service with the consolidated entity, the past and potential contribution 
of the person to the consolidated entity and in some cases, individual performance. Each share option converts into one 
ordinary share of the Company on exercise. The options carry neither rights to dividends nor voting rights and are not 
transferable. Options vest over a period of twelve months, with 50% vesting and exercisable after six months and the other 
50% vesting and exercisable after twelve months of issue. All options are issued with a term of three years. At the discretion 
of the directors part or all of the options issued to an executive or employee may be subject to performance based hurdles. 
No performance based hurdles have been applied for options granted to date. Upon exercise of the options the ordinary 
shares received rank equally with the existing ordinary shares. No options have been offered under the ESOP in 2011 
or 2012.
Executive Directors Loan Funded Share Plan (“EDLFSP”) and Employee Loan Funded Share Plan (“ELFSP”)
Shares were issued to executive directors under the Executive Directors Loan Funded Share Plan EDLFSP 2011 and 
employees under the ELFSP as part of their remuneration package. Under the terms of the EDLFSP and ELFSP , the 
Company has provided a limited recourse and interest free loan to certain employees of the Company for the purpose of 
acquiring the New Shares (the “Loan”). The purchase of the shares has been funded by the Loan and the shares will not 
vest until certain performance conditions are met. In the event the performance conditions are not met, or the shares are 
forfeited by the participant, the Company can either re-acquire the shares or direct the trustee to sell them on, offsetting 
the proceeds against the outstanding loan amount and waiving the remainder of the loan. Subject to performance 
conditions and time based hurdles being met, the loan will be repayable by the relevant employee in full on the earlier 
of the termination date of the loan (three years from the date of issue) or the date on which the shares are disposed of. 
No options have been offered under the EDLFSP and ELFSP in 2012.
Further details of the EDLFSP and ELFSP can be found in the Notice of General Meeting for the shareholder meeting held 
on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, and full copies of the plan are available upon request.
Further details of the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

of the Group other than directors are able to participate in the 2011 EOS. The Committee shall select from time to time 
from such group the actual participants in the 2011 EOS. There are no current plans for options to be granted under the 
2011 EOS.
The 2011 EOS provides for employees (other than directors) to receive up to an annual aggregate of options over ordinary 
shares, with an exercise price calculated by either the volume weighted average closing price of ordinary shares sold on an 
exchange for the five trading days most recently preceding the day as at which the market value is calculated or if market 
value is required to be determined in another manner or another amount for the purposes of tax legislation in another 
jurisdiction, then the value is so determined at the date of issue. The ability to exercise the options is conditional on the 
Group achieving its performance hurdles. For the initial grants to be made under the 2011 EOS it is the current intention 
that the performance criteria will be the TSR performance criteria as detailed in the 2011 Executive LFSP . Further details of 
the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report. There are no outstanding awards under this plan and 
there is no current intention to use the plan.
Under the 2011 EOS the exercise price of the options is denominated in Great British pounds. All options expire on the 
earlier of their expiry date or termination of the individual’s employment. 
Deferred Bonus Share Plan
During the year the Company implemented a Deferred Bonus Share Plan (“DBSP”) which is a long-term share incentive 
arrangement for senior management (but not executive directors) and other employees (participants).
Under the DBSP , the Board shall, at its absolute discretion, require such eligible participants to defer up to one hundred 
per cent (100%) of their bonus opportunity and such eligible participants shall not be paid their deferred bonus in cash but 
shall instead be granted a Deferred Bonus Award over such number of shares provided that the eligible participant remains 
in employment on the date of grant (effectively the vesting date). The award of the deferred shares will not have any 
performance criteria attached. They will however be subject to a service period.
On 4 June 2013, the Group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the ELFSP and to the majority 
of the beneficiaries of the options granted under the EOS the choice to replace their awards and options with awards 
under the DBSP . The Group has accounted for this change as modifications to the share-based payment plans and will be 
recognising the incremental fair value granted, measured in accordance with IFRS 2, by this replacement over the vesting 
period of the new DBSP awards. 
Under this offer, each participant has been granted a number of awards under the DBSP equivalent to the number of shares 
or options held under the ELFSP and EOS respectively. Such DBSP awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions 
of the DBSP and shall ordinarily vest in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date, conditional upon the 
continued employment with the Group. All offers made to participants were accepted.
The total share-based payment charge relating to Centamin plc shares for the year is split as follows:
       31 December 31 December  
       2013 2012 
       US$’000  US$’000
2011 EOS        74 110
LFSP        596 1,650
DBSP        1,614 221
         2,284 1,981
No LFSP awards or EOS options were granted during the year.
The fair value of share-based payments awarded under the LFSP and granted under the 2011 EOS were measured 
by the use of the Black Scholes model where share-based payments have non-market based performance conditions. 
Where share-based payments are subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of a Monte-Carlo 
simulation. The Monte-Carlo simulation has been used to model the Company’s share prices against the performance 
of the chosen comparator group and the FTSE 250 at the relevant vesting dates.

f) Transactions with the government of Egypt
Royalty costs attributable to the government of Egypt of US$15,074,098 (2012: US$12,769,084) were incurred in 2013.
With a view to demonstrating goodwill toward the Egyptian government, PGM has made advance payments to EMRA of 
US$18,950,000 (2012: nil) which will be netted off against any future profit share that becomes payable to EMRA.
g) Transactions with other related parties
Other related parties include the parent entity, subsidiaries, and other related parties.
During the financial period, the Company recognised tax payable in respect of the tax liabilities of its wholly owned 
subsidiaries. Payments to/from the Company are made in accordance with terms of the tax funding arrangement. 
During the financial period the Company provided funds to and received funding from subsidiaries.
All amounts advanced to related parties are unsecured. No expense has been recognised in the period for bad or doubtful 
debts in respect of amounts owed by related parties.

financial statements of the Group.
30. Subsequent events
As referred to in Note 20, the Group is involved in ongoing litigation in respect of both the price at which diesel fuel oil is 
supplied to the mine at Sukari and the validity of the 160km
2
 exploitation lease. 
Subsequent to period end the Group reduced its interest in Nyota from 12.62% to 11.37% through the sale of 11 million 
shares held in Nyota and generated proceeds amounting to US$0.1 million.
On 20 February the Group announced that it had entered into an unconditional agreement for an off-market takeover 
for all the issued, and to be issued, shares of Ampella Mining Ltd (the “Offer”). Under the Offer, Ampella Mining Ltd 
(“Ampella”) will receive one (1) new Centamin share for every five (5) Ampella shares held. 
The acquisition of Ampella will add significant gold assets to Centamin’s development portfolio, with c.2,200km
2
 of 
exploration ground in Burkina Faso, including the Batie West gold project which hosts the Konkera Resource and 
c.1,200km
2
 of exploration ground across the border from Batie West in Côte d’Ivoire. Centamin intends to progress a 
substantial exploration programme at Batie West, aimed at developing the potential for further significant resource growth 
and realising the project’s full value, ultimately through development of a sizeable producing operation.
On 24 February 2014, the Group had a relevant interest in 126,321,285 shares or 51.14%. In respect to the Offer, 
the Company issued a further 38,151,563 ordinary shares to the Ampella shareholders who had accepted the Offer by 
28 February 2014. The enlarged share capital of the Company at 7 March 2014 was 1,139,548,944 ordinary shares.
The numbers presented below are provisional and have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The assumed acquisition consideration based on the terms of the Offer by Centamin will be as follows:
Number of Ampella shares on issue as at 24 February 2014     254,302,883*
Number of Ampella shares to be acquired      254,302,883*
Number of Centamin shares offered for every Ampella share     0.20
Total number of Centamin shares issued      50,860,577
Fair value of Centamin shares as at 24 February 2014 US$/share     0.96
Share consideration US$        48,826,154
Fair value of consideration US$       48,826,154
*  This number assumes that all Ampella performance rights have vested in accordance with the terms of the Employee Performance 
Rights Plan. It also assumes that 1,500,000 Ampella shares issued under the Ampella Employee Share Acquisition Plan are cancelled.

The fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are subject to change following a detailed 
assessment of the fair values which is currently under way. For the purposes of the preparation of the financial statements, 
management has assumed the following:
(a) inventories have not been adjusted as management do not have sufficient information from which to estimate fair value; 
(b) management have assumed that the book value of the property, plant and equipment is indicative of fair value as 
detailed valuations have not been performed; and
(c) management have allocated the excess of the fair value of the consideration of US$46.6 million over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired to mineral rights.
The premium on acquisition of Ampella has been calculated as follows:
        US$’000
Current assets        12,363
Non-current assets         1,523
Current liabilities        (914)
Mineral rights        35,854
Fair value of assets and liabilities acquired      48,826
Management have assumed that a deferred tax liability will arise for the full value of the uplift to the mine assets based 
on the limited information available and accordingly have recorded a deferred tax liability of US$10.8 million. The mineral 
right, inclusive of the deferred tax liability, amounts to US$46.6 million.
On completion of the detailed fair value exercise, certain intangible assets may be identified and recorded separately. 
This may also result in the recognition of additional deferred tax liabilities. Further, any intangible assets with a finite life 
identified in the business combination will be required to be amortised over their useful life. 
Transaction costs are assumed to be approximately US$1.9 million. 
There were no other significant events occurring after the reporting date requiring disclosure in the financial statements. CENTAMIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2013

dump leach 
a process used for the recovery 
of metal ore from typically 
weathered low-grade ore. 
Blasted material is laid on a 
slightly sloping, impervious pad 
and uniformly leached by the 
percolation of the leach liquor 
trickling through the beds by 
gravity to ponds. The metals 
are recovered by conventional 
methods from the solution

indicated resource 
as defined in the JORC Code, 
is that part of a mineral resource 
which has been sampled 
by drill holes, underground 
openings or other sampling 
procedures at locations that are 
too widely spaced to ensure 
continuity but close enough 
to give a reasonable indication 
of continuity and where 
geoscientific data is known 
with a reasonable degree of 
reliability. An indicated mineral 
resource will be based on more 
data and therefore will be more 
reliable than an inferred resource 
estimate
inferred resource
as defined in the JORC Code, 
is that part of a mineral resource 
for which the tonnage and 
grade and mineral content can 
be estimated with a low level 
of confidence. It is inferred 
from the geological evidence 
and has assumed but not 
verified geological and/or 
grade continuity. It is based on 
information gathered through 
the appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes which may be limited or of 
uncertain quality and reliability

ore reserve 
the economically mineable part 
of a Measured or Indicated 
mineral resource. It includes 
diluting materials and allowances 
for losses which may occur 
when the material is mined. 
Appropriate assessments, which 
may include feasibility studies, 
have been carried out, and 
include consideration of and 
modification by realistically 
assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal,

governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the 
time of reporting that extraction 
could be reasonably justified.

Cautionary note regarding forward looking statements
This document contains “forward-looking information” which 
may include, but is not limited to, statements with respect to 
the future financial or operating performance of Centamin plc 
(“Centamin” or “the Company”), its subsidiaries (together “the 
Group”), affiliated companies, its projects, the future price of 
gold, the estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources, 
the realisation of mineral reserve and resource estimates, the 
timing and amount of estimated future production, revenues, 
margins, costs of production, estimates of initial capital, sustaining 
capital, operating and exploration expenditures, costs and timing 
of the development of new deposits, costs and timing of future

risks, governmental regulation of mining operations and exploration 
operations, timing and receipt of approvals, consents and permits 
under applicable mineral legislation, environmental risks, title 
disputes or claims, limitations of insurance coverage and regulatory 
matters. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can 
be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is 
expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, 
“intends”, “targets”, “aims”, “anticipates” or “believes” or 
variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, 
or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions, 
events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “should”, “might” or 
“will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and a variety of material factors, many of which are 
beyond the Company’s control which may cause the actual results, 
performance or achievements of Centamin, its subsidiaries and 
affiliated companies to be materially different from any future 
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the 
forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-
looking statements may not be appropriate for other purposes than 
outlined in this document. Such factors include, among others, 
future price of gold; general business, economic, competitive, 
political and social uncertainties; the actual results of current 
exploration and development activities; conclusions of economic 
evaluations and studies; fluctuations in the value of the US dollar 
relative to the local currencies in the jurisdictions of the Company’s 
key projects; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be

is not exhausted of the factors that may affect the Company’s 
forward-looking statements.
Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors 
that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially 
from those described in forward-looking statements, there may 
be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ 
from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward-looking 
statements contained herein are made as of the date of this 
document and, except as required by applicable law, the Company 
disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, 
whether as a result of new information, future events or results 
or otherwise. There can be no assurance that forward-looking 
statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future 
events could differ materially from those anticipated in such 
statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance 
on forward-looking statements.

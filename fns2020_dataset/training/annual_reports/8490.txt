I am pleased to present the results for the past financial year, during 
which we have continued to deliver against our strategy of building 
a significant international, specialist hospital medicines group. Revenue 
has more than doubled to £7.0m (2007: £2.8m) and we have delivered 
the Group’s first full year of profitability with profit after tax of £1.69m 
(2007: loss of £0.03m). It is the intention of the Board to continue 
to drive earnings growth using this strategy.
the year started with the acquisition of acorus therapeutics limited 
(“acorus”) in may 2007 which was accompanied by an oversubscribed 
equity fundraising. this development provided both a portfolio of 
products with a strong fit and an increased international presence 
in the form of a well-developed network of distributors. acorus was 
successfully integrated into the group ahead of schedule – a testament 
to the strong operational capabilities of our management team.
In parallel, we have seen strong organic growth from the existing 
product portfolio as well as significant progress in the Group’s 
new product pipeline.
Record results and continued 
delivery against strategy.
chairman’s statement
“ o ur focus on late-stage 
specialist products presents 
an increasingly attractive 
and logical investment.” IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  5
Since the year end, we have completed the acquisition of 
Speciality European Pharma International AG (“SEPI AG”), a profitable 
Swiss-based business. this acquisition further strengthens our portfolio 
of specialist products. SePI ag was acquired for an initial consideration 
of £9.25m and up to a further £5m in deferred payments, conditional 
upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales targets. 
t he integration of SePI ag is on schedule and both the cost 
and revenue synergies are being delivered as planned.
Outlook
Since the year end and the acquisition of SePI ag , we have restructured 
the group’s balance sheet, undertaken a seven for one share consolidation 
and changed the name of the business from maelor plc to IS Pharma plc 
to reflect the business model and strategy of the Group. These actions 
were approved at a general meeting of our shareholders on 21 april 2008.
our business model and strategy with their focus on late-stage 
specialist products present, we believe, an increasingly attractive 
and logical investment even in uncertain market conditions.
trading since the year end has been strong and is in line with 
expectations. We look forward to the coming year with confidence.

During the course of a very exciting year, we have established 
ourselves as a dynamic, earnings-focused international specialist 
hospital medicines group. crucially, we are focused on late-stage 
and launched brands. our revenue and earnings growth is driven 
organically and by means of acquisitions.
The financial year 2007/08 provided proof of our strategy at work; 
with the organic growth of our established portfolio of drugs such as 
volplex and the transformational acquisition of acorus in may 2007 
and SePI ag after the year end in april 2008.
Driving a specialist hospital medicines business
the business is focused around late-stage and launched brands 
in three core areas of specialist hospital medicine:
i critical care
i neurology
i oncology
assets, which are out of this area either because they are 
early-stage (such as our proprietary technologies) or are more 
community-oriented, continue to be leveraged through 
partnerships as a “non-focus” portfolio.
the implementation of our strategy over the year can 
be summarised into the three categories of acquisition, 
organic growth and internationalisation.
Rapid growth in turnover 
and earnings continues.
chief executive officer’s review
“ We are creating a growing 
and significantly profitable 
group, both in the UK 
and internationally.” IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  7
Acquisition
Acquisition of Acorus and of Aloxi from Helsinn Healthcare SA 
(“Helsinn”)
as announced in the Interim r esults in november 2007, the acquisition 
of acorus was successfully completed during the year and we were 
pleased to announce the completion of its integration ahead of schedule. 
as well as providing a rich portfolio of products, the acquisition has 
allowed us to establish our presence through a strong network of 
distributors in europe, as well as in South america and South africa.
In october 2007, we announced the acquisition of the UK distribution 
rights to aloxi from Helsinn. aloxi is a patented new generation 5-Ht3 
antagonist used for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting 
associated with high and moderate emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, 
which is differentiated by its strength on initiation and the duration of 
its activity. aloxi obtained a centralised registration in e urope in 2005 
and is already being successfully marketed in 40 countries, with annual 
sales in 2006 of $323m worldwide, according to IMS figures. 
Acquisition of SEPI AG 
Since the year end, we have delivered another transforming, 
earnings-enhancing acquisition which has strengthened the 
company’s portfolio of products within our core areas of expertise 
and added to our late-stage product pipeline. SePI ag is a Swiss-based 
pharmaceutical company with a profitable portfolio of specialist 
hospital pharmaceutical products, highly synergistic with our existing 
portfolio. the business was acquired for an initial cash consideration 
of £9.25m and up to a further £5m in deferred consideration, conditional 
on SePI ag meeting certain regulatory criteria and sales targets.
the acquisition is fully aligned with IS Pharma’s stated strategy of 
building a focused late-stage pharmaceutical and medical devices 
business in the specialist hospital medicine sector:
i  it is a further step in the transformation of the business creating 
a growing and significantly profitable enlarged Group, driven in 
particular by existing and significant potential sales from the 
critical care drug, Haemopressin;
i  it consolidates a presence in the major european markets through 
a distributor network outside the UK and enables a low-risk step 
into the US market through a licensee; and
i  as a virtual business it can be readily integrated into IS Pharma’s 
existing infrastructure with minimal cost and distraction.
Haemopressin is a rapid-acting vasoconstrictor used in the treatment 
of oesophageal varices (varicose veins in the food pipe) and hepatorenal 
syndrome (late stage liver disease). As such, it is a very good fit for 
our critical care portfolio. Haemopressin is currently sold in germany, 
austria, Switzerland, Hungary, Korea, Pakistan and t aiwan. It is 
currently in the mutual recognition regulatory process in europe 
and we anticipate launches in some markets before the year end. 
We are also pleased to confirm that a rolling New Drug Application 
has recently been submitted in the US by our licensee, and that 
this will be subject to “fast track” review by the US Food and 
Drugs administration. 
“ Our revenue and 
earnings growth is 
driven organically 
and by means 
of acquisitions.” 8  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc
chief executive officer’s review continued
Organic growth
During the year our launched product portfolio increased following 
the acquisition of acorus.
We have continued to drive growth in volplex, our plasma substitute 
used in trauma to maintain blood volume, with sales up 41% and 
moving annual trend market share grown from 20% (march 2007) 
to 30%. 
We have also seen continued market growth from cryogesic, 
our market leading vapocoolant spray used before blood sampling 
and cannula insertion and we have identified and taken advantage 
of new applications for the product, particularly in paediatrics.
the growth of mysoline, our treatment for epilepsy and essential 
tremor, has been driven both in the UK market and by our 
internationalisation of the brand as we have been executing a 
planned programme of regulatory switches of mysoline in various 
international territories. We have rapidly developed a new dosage 
form of the product for the management of essential tremor, which 
affects 1 in 20 people over 40. the new dosage form, called mysoline l ow, 
is currently being sold as a “special” ahead of regulatory approval 
so that people suffering from essential tremor can get effective 
relief from their symptoms.
as noted earlier, during the year we also acquired the UK rights to 
aloxi, a new generation treatment for nausea and vomiting associated 
with chemotherapy from Helsinn. We were pleased that our commercial 
team was able to accelerate the integration process and achieve a 
successful launch, ahead of schedule, in February 2008. We have 
achieved encouraging sales, ahead of our expectations, in the three 
months since our launch.
Leverage ‘non-focus’ portfolio through efficient partnerships
maintaining focus on late-stage hospital specialist products 
whilst partnering “non-focus” assets, either because they are 
early-stage or sold in the community, continues to be a key 
strategy of the group. 
In october 2007 we announced a new agreement with 
Bard limited (“Bard”) for distribution of the optiFlo™ catheter 
maintenance solutions. the agreement which covers the UK 
and Ireland continues the very positive relationship that has 
seen the brand grow to become the UK market leader, with 
a 54% market share. 
our partnership with Plethora Solutions limited (“Plethora”), 
who licensed our proprietary micelle nanotechnology for application 
in the treatment for interstitial cystitis, continues positively.

and product 
acquisitions have 
been made and 
are combined 
with a rich 
product pipeline.” IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  9
Focus on high value niches 
of critical care, neurology 
and oncology.
Pipeline of products
as well as the growth within our launched product portfolio, 
our pipeline of late-stage products continues to progress well: 
i  a quiHex, currently sold as a special while it is undergoing 
registration, is a water-based antibacterial with broad antimicrobial 
activity used to combat hospital acquired infections. It is targeted 
for launch during the first half of the financial year 2009/10;
i  Isoplex is a balanced electrolyte plasma substitute used as 
a fluid replacement as a sister product to Volplex in trauma or 
surgery. Development of the product is on schedule and launch 
remains forecast for the second half of the current financial year. 
This product – our own development – is a very good fit with 
our existing critical care portfolio and fulfils a currently unmet 
medical need;
i  acoranil is a product (currently sold as a special) we gained through 
the acquisition of acorus. It is used in the treatment of depression 
and has a particularly important niche in the treatment of nocturnal 
enuresis (bed wetting) in children. regulatory approval from the 
medicines and Healthcare products regulatory agency for the UK 
market has been obtained ahead of schedule and we plan to launch 
this product in the second half of the current financial year; and
i  along with our successful product cryogesic, we have developed 
Dermogesic which is a non-flammable version of the vapocoolant 
spray. It has obvious uses in accident and emergency situations and 
in ambulance and paramedic units and was launched on schedule 
in the first half of the current financial year.
International expansion
2007/08 has also seen the group developing international distribution 
channels by means of which our sales successes in the UK market can 
be replicated. We have focused these activities on the most significant 
international markets.
through the acorus acquisition earlier in 2007, we secured distribution 
and sales channels in the majority of european markets as well as 
South africa, South america and t urkey. Following the year end 
and the acquisition of SePI ag we have deepened our international 
network and now have distributors established in all target european 
markets as well as key developing markets.
The US is a significant healthcare market; however the Board is 
sensitive to the risks and complexity of establishing a presence in 
this territory. the acquisition of SePI ag has enabled us to take a 
low risk presence through a licensee for Haemopressin who will 
be responsible for both registration and commercialisation.
Financial summary
Financial results for the year ended 31 march 2008 have been 
delivered in line with recently upgraded expectations and are the 
first under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), 
as adopted by the eU. 
revenue for the year to 31 march 2008 has more than doubled 
to £7.0m (2007: £2.8m).  10  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc
chief executive officer’s review continued
Outlook
trading since the year end has been strong and we have secured 
another transformational acquisition. the integration of SePI ag 
is on schedule and due to its almost virtual nature we have already 
managed to secure cost savings and synergies with our existing business.
as well as an oversubscribed placing of £10m and an £8m debt facility 
from HBoS, we have also undertaken a seven for one consolidation 
of our issued share capital and changed the name of the business to 
IS Pharma plc (aIm: ISPH) which better represents the core values of 
the business and its enlarged structure.
With a number of our pipeline products targeted for launch in 
this current financial year and the continued growth of our launched 
portfolio both in the UK and internationally, we look to the future 
with confidence.
Tim Wright
Chief Executive Officer
Financial summary continued 
gross margins increased from last year by 13% to 61% (2007: 48%), 
as a result of further efficiencies in manufacturing and supply and 
an expanded product mix.
The Group enjoyed its first ever full year of profit with a profit 
from operations for the year (before share-based payments and 
amortisation) of £1.62m (2007: loss of £0.06m). 
Retained profit for the year was £1.69m (2007: loss of £0.03m).
Basic earnings per share for the year were 10.3p per share 
(2007: 0.7p loss per share) following the seven for one 
share consolidation. 
group cash balances at 31 march 2008 were strengthened during 
the year to £2.3m compared with £1.4m last year. 
the post balance sheet acquisition of SePI ag was funded via an 
oversubscribed placing in difficult markets of £10.0m. At the same 
time we put into place an £8.0m debt facility through HBoS, which 
is as yet unused.
The Board is constantly reviewing its dividend policy and can confirm 
it will not be paying a dividend for the year ended 31 march 2008 
(2007: £nil).

Business review and future developments
The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive Officer’s Review, on pages 4 to 10, describe the Group’s activities and future developments.
Key performance indicators
All of the Group’s key performance indicators (“KPIs”) showed an improvement on last year. Revenues more than doubled over 
the prior year to £7.03m (2007: £2.84m) and retained profit increased to £1.69m (2007: loss of £0.03m). The cash balance increased 
to £2.30m (2007: £1.43m) and gross margins were uplifted to 61% (2007: 48%).
Principal risks and uncertainties
IS Pharma’s business is influenced by a range of factors, some of which may be beyond the control of the Group and its Board. The risk factors 
set out below are regularly reviewed by the Board in the course of operating its business and are considered carefully. 
There may be other risks which the Group is not aware of, which are not deemed to be material but turn out to be material.
I  Adverse information about one or more of IS Pharma’s products is received by the Group’s customer base, with a negative impact on 
demand for its products.
In the event of the Group becoming aware of any information relating to severe unexpected effects of any of IS Pharma’s products, it would 
immediately take steps to fully investigate these. In accordance with the responsibilities placed upon the Group by the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency, IS Pharma would immediately notify its customers and/or withdraw those products from sale, as appropriate. Where 
these were proven to be false or ill-founded, IS Pharma would consider issuing information to its customers, communicating the facts to them. 
I IS Pharma experiences a significant increase in the cost of producing its product.
In the event of a significant increase in the cost of producing one or more of its products IS Pharma would seek alternative sources of supply 
at the earliest opportunity to mitigate the impact on its profitability.
I  The Group is unable to fulfil its commitments to supply its products, with adverse consequences for its customers.
IS Pharma has obligations under some of its key contracts to guarantee the supply of its products. The Group safeguards its ability to meet 
these obligations by closely managing its relationships with its suppliers, as well as by continuously reviewing its stock levels to ensure that 
these are adequate, while at the same time properly controlled.
I  A product liability or similar lawsuit is issued against IS Pharma, resulting in substantial financial penalties.
IS Pharma is confident that the robustness of the clinical trials process prior to the launch of its products minimises the risk of claims against 
the Group as a result of its products. The Group also continuously reviews the production quality of its products to ensure that this is consistently 
high. Were a claim to be lodged against the Group in respect of its products, IS Pharma believes that its product liability insurance would 
indemnify it in the majority of cases.

IS Pharma encourages involvement of employees in the Group’s performance through an annual, individual objective-setting process linked 
to the Company’s corporate objectives and through the operation of an employee share option scheme, details of which are set out in note 22 
to the consolidated accounts.
Policy and practice on the payment of trade payables
It is the policy of the Group that each of the companies in the Group should agree appropriate terms and conditions for its transactions with 
suppliers by means ranging from standard written terms to individually negotiated contracts. Payments should then be made in accordance 
with those terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has also complied with them. The number of days’ purchases outstanding at 
31 March 2008, was 83 (2007: 61).
Taxation
The Company is not a close company within the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Directors
The Directors of the Company during the year are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 18.
A third party indemnity provision for the benefit of the Directors was in force during the financial year.

Auditor
All of the current Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the 
Company’s auditor for the purposes of its audit and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of 
any relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware.
In line with good governance practices, the provision of audit services has been reviewed by the Audit Committee. As a consequence of 
that review the Board has decided to replace the current auditors, Baker Tilly LLP , and a resolution to appoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

corporate governance
Compliance with the Combined Code
The rules of the Alternative Investment Market (“AIM”) do not compel the Company to comply with the Combined Code (“the Code”). 
Nevertheless, the Group fully endorses both the spirit and principles of the Code and seeks to comply wherever possible, whilst taking account 
of both its own size and its resources. Precisely how the Group has applied these principles is set out in the following statement.
Board of Directors
The Board meets at regular intervals, approximately every six weeks. The Company is committed to maintaining a balance of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors and the Board consists of six members, three are Executive Directors, the remaining three, one of whom is Chairman, 
are Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board believes that, given its size and complexity, it is not appropriate to specify a Senior 
Independent Director.
Non-Executive Directors are members of the Audit, AIM Compliance and Remuneration Committees. Their biographies on page 11 illustrate 
their relevant corporate and industry experience.
Given the Company’s limited resources and manpower, there is no separate Nominations Committee. However, any new appointments 
at Board level are considered and approved by the full Board. A detailed introduction to the activities of the Company is given to any new 
appointee who is also provided with any appropriate training deemed necessary. The Company Secretary, to whom all Directors have full 
access, attends all Board and Committee meetings.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by J H Gregory, who took over from P Murray on 4 May 2007, meets at least twice a year. The Finance Director 
is generally in attendance at those meetings and also acts as Secretary to the Committee. An invitation is extended to the auditor to attend 
meetings of the Committee in order to discuss related matters. On a formal basis, the Committee reviews with the auditor those reports to 
be issued by the auditor to the Directors.
The Audit Committee also undertakes a formal assessment of the auditor’s independence each year which includes:
I a review of the non-audit services provided to the Group and related fees;
I  discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all relationships with the Company and any other parties that could affect 
independence or the perception of independence;
I  a review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring the independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved in the audit, 
including the regular rotation of the audit partner; and
I obtaining written confirmation from the auditor that, in its professional judgement, it is independent.
An analysis of the fees payable to the external audit firm in respect of both audit and non-audit services during the year is set out in note 6 
to the consolidated accounts. 
AIM Compliance Committee
The Company has an obligation to comply with the London Stock Exchange Rules for Companies. Rule 31 requires IS Pharma plc to:
I have in place sufficient procedures, resources and controls to enable its compliance with the AIM Rules for Companies (“Rules”);
I seek advice from its nominated adviser regarding its compliance with these rules whenever appropriate and take that advice into account;
I  provide its nominated adviser with any information it requests in order for that nominated adviser to carry out its responsibilities under 
these rules and the AIM Rules for Nominated Advisers;
I ensure that each of its Directors accepts full responsibility, collectively and individually, for its compliance with these rules; and
I  ensure that each Director discloses without delay all information which it needs in order to comply with AIM Rule 17 insofar as that 
information is known to the Director or could with reasonable diligence be ascertained by the Director.
In order to ensure that these obligations are being discharged, the Board considers all AIM Compliance matters at each Board Meeting and reports 
back formally to its nominated adviser, confirming that it has made it aware of all relevant compliance matters.
Having reviewed relevant Board papers and met with the Company’s Executive Board and the nominated adviser to ensure that such is the 
case, the AIM Compliance Committee is satisfied that the Company’s obligations under AIM Rule 31 have been satisfied during the year 
under review. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  17
Internal control
At the present time, given the aforementioned limitations imposed by manpower and resources, there is no internal audit function. The Board 
is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control, which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives; it can therefore only provide a reasonable and not an absolute assurance against material misstatements or losses.
Proper briefing of all Directors at Board meetings is considered an important issue and all Board papers are distributed in advance of those 
meetings; meetings are either adjourned or decisions deferred on occasions when the Board seeks the provision of further information upon 
which to base its decisions. There also exists a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decisions by the Board.
During the year the Directors have reviewed and are satisfied with the adequacy of the Group’s internal financial controls. These controls 
include the following:
I a comprehensive annual budgetary process, reviewed and approved by the Board; and
I  the monitoring of actual results against budget, no greater than at monthly intervals, together with the revisiting of forecasts whenever 
it is deemed appropriate.
Using the guidance on internal controls contained in the Code as a benchmark, the Group continues to develop its review procedures of all 
other aspects of internal control, including operational and compliance issues and risk management.
Communication with shareholders
The Board has a strong commitment to the maintenance of good investor relations and seeks, wherever possible, to build a relationship 
of mutual understanding with both its institutional and private investors.
Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”)
IS Pharma takes its CSR seriously.
The Company is mindful of the environmental impact of air miles used in the supply of its products worldwide and seeks wherever possible 
to minimise the frequency of deliveries and to use alternative methods of transportation.
IS Pharma’s commitment to environmental issues is reflected in this annual report which has been printed on Revive Gloss, a recycled 
paper stock which contains 75% recovered fibre and 25% virgin fibre and Revive 100 Offset which is 100% recycled from post consumer 
waste. This document was printed by Beacon Press using pureprint
®
, their environmental print technology which minimises the impact 
of printing on the environment. All energy used comes from renewable sources, vegetable based inks have been used and 94% of all 
waste associated with this production has been recycled. The printer is a carbon neutral company. Both the printer and the paper mill 
are registered to ISO 14001. 18  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc
remuneration report
As well as complying as far as possible with the provisions of the Code as disclosed in the Company’s Corporate Governance statement, 
the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration as described below.
The level and composition of Directors’ remuneration
The Board believes that it does not pay more than is necessary to attract and retain Directors needed to run the Company successfully.
Statement of remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee, consisting of the three Non-Executive Directors and chaired by P Murray, who took over from J H Gregory 
on 4 May 2007, meets at least once a year (or more frequently as required). The Committee is responsible for the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors, including their benefits in kind, terms of employment and share options; the Executive Directors also consult the Committee 
in relation to the remuneration of senior employees and staff share option schemes. It takes account of remuneration paid to the Directors 
and senior employees of other companies of a similar size and comparable industry sector in the UK, and the relative performance of such 
companies, to ensure that the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors 
and senior employees. 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, based on outside advice and review of current 
practices in other companies. The Chief Executive Officer is normally in attendance, except when his own remuneration is under discussion.
Full details of the remuneration packages of individual Directors and information on share options, pensions and other benefits are set 
out below.

statement of directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and accounts in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
UK Company Law requires the Directors to prepare consolidated and Company accounts for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare consolidated accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU 
and have elected to prepare the Company accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
The consolidated accounts are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of 
the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides, in relation to such consolidated accounts, that references in the relevant part of that Act 
to consolidated accounts giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company accounts are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. 
In preparing each of the consolidated and Company accounts, the Directors are required to:
I select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
I make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
I  for the consolidated accounts, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU; and for the Company accounts 
state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Company accounts; and
I  prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  21
independent auditor’s report
to the members of IS Pharma plc
We have audited the consolidated and Parent Company accounts on pages 22 to 52.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group accounts in accordance with applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”), and for preparing the Parent Company accounts in accordance 
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
is consistent with the accounts.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited accounts. The other 
information comprises only the Highlights, Product Portfolio, Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive Officer’s Review, the Directors’ Report 
and the Corporate Governance statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information 
in the accounts.
Opinion
In our opinion:
I  the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
I  the Parent Company accounts give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008;
I the accounts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
I the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the accounts.

1. Accounting policies 
IS Pharma plc is a public listed company incorporated and domiciled in England and quoted on AIM.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the accounts are set out below. The policies have been consistently applied 
to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS and IFRIC interpretations) as adopted 
by the EU (“IFRS”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under IFRS. The Company 
has elected to prepare its Parent Company accounts in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 49 to 52. This is the first time 
the Company has prepared its accounts in accordance with IFRS, having previously prepared its accounts in accordance with UK accounting 
standards. Details of how the transition from UK accounting standards to IFRS has affected the Group’s reported financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows are given in note 2.
The accounts have been prepared using the historical cost convention basis, except where detailed in specific accounting policies below:
Transition to IFRS
(a) New standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations to existing standards effective in 2007 adopted by the Group
I  IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments” – Disclosures and an Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures” 
(effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007). IFRS 7 introduces new requirements aimed at improving the 
disclosure of information about financial instruments. It requires the disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about exposure 
to risks arising from financial instruments, including specified minimum disclosures about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Where 
those risks are deemed to be material to the Group it requires disclosures based on the information used by key management. It replaces 
the disclosure requirements in IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”. It is applicable to all entities that report under 
IFRS. The amendment to IAS 1 introduces disclosures about the level and management of an entity’s capital. The Group has applied IFRS 7 
and the amendment to IAS 1 to the accounts for the year beginning on 1 April 2007.
I  IFRIC 8 “Scope of IFRS 2” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006). IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions 
involving the issue or grant of equity instruments to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2. It applies to situations 
where the identifiable consideration received is or appears to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued. There was no 
impact on the Group’s accounts from its adoption.
I  IFRIC 10 “Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006). IFRIC 10 
prohibits impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and on financial assets 
carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date. There was no impact on the Group’s accounts from its adoption.
I  IFRIC 11 “IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007). IFRIC 11 
requires share-based payment transactions in which an entity receives services as consideration for its own equity instruments to be 
accounted for as equity-settled. This applies regardless of whether the entity chooses or is required to buy those equity instruments from 
another party to satisfy its obligations to its employees under the share-based payment arrangement. It also applies regardless of whether: 
(a) the employee’s rights to the entity’s equity instruments were granted by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s); or (b) the share-based 
payment arrangement was settled by the entity itself or by its shareholder(s). There was no impact on the Group’s accounts from its adoption.
(b) Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards effective in 2007 but which are not relevant to the Group
 The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2007 but are currently not relevant to the Group’s operations:
I  IFRIC 7 “Applying the Restatement Approach Under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 March 2006). IFRIC 7 provides guidance on the application of IAS 29 requirements in a reporting period 
in which an entity identifies the existence of hyperinflation in the economy of its functional currency, when the Company was not 
hyperinflationary in the prior period. IFRIC 7 is not relevant to the Group as none of the Group companies has a currency of a 
hyperinflationary economy as its functional currency.
I  IFRIC 9 “Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2006). IFRIC 9 requires 
an assessment of whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative 
when an entity becomes party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change in the terms of the contract 
that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required.  IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  27

Transition to IFRS continued
(c)  Standards, amendments and interpretations of published standards, which are not yet effective
  Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods and which the Group has decided not to adopt early. These are:
I  IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). This standard sets out requirements 
for the disclosure of information about an entity’s operating segments and also about the entity’s products and services, the geographical 
areas in which it operates and its major customers. It replaces IAS 14 “Segmental Reporting”. The Group expects to apply this standard 
in the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2009. As this is a disclosure standard it will not have any impact on the results 
or net assets of the Group.
I  IAS 23 “Borrowing Costs (revised)” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). The revised IAS 23 is still to be 
endorsed by the EU. The main change from the previous version is the removal of the option of immediately recognising as an expense 
borrowing costs that relate to qualifying assets, broadly being assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale.
I  IFRIC 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 12 is still to be 
endorsed by the EU. IFRIC 12 gives guidance on the accounting by operators for public-to-private service concession arrangements. IFRIC 12 
is not relevant to the Group’s operations due to the absence of such arrangements.
I  IFRIC 13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes” (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008). IFRIC 13 is still to be 
endorsed by the EU. IFRIC 13 addresses sales transactions in which the entities grant their customers award credits that, subject to meeting 
any further qualifying conditions, the customers can redeem in future for free or discounted goods or services. 
I  IFRIC 14 “IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction” (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008). IFRIC 14 is still to be endorsed by the EU. IFRIC 14 clarifies when refunds or reductions in 
future contributions should be regarded as available in accordance with paragraph 58 of IAS 19, how a minimum funding requirement 
might affect the availability of reductions in future contributions and when a minimum funding requirement might give rise to a liability. 
I  Revised IFRS 3 “Business Combinations and Complementary Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” 
(both effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). This revised standard and amendments thereto are still to be endorsed 
by the EU. The revised IFRS 3 and amendments to IAS 27 arise from a joint project with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, 
the US standards setter, and result in IFRS being largely converged with the related, recently issued, US requirements. There are certain 
very significant changes to the requirements of IFRS, and options available, when accounting for business combinations. 
I  Amendment to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations” (effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2009). This amendment is still to be endorsed by the EU. The amendment to IFRS 2 is of particular relevance to companies 
that operate employee share saving schemes. This is because it results in an immediate acceleration of the IFRS 2 expense that would 
otherwise have been recognised in future periods should an employee decide to stop contributing to the savings plan, as well as a 
potential revision to the fair value of the awards granted to factor in the probability of employees withdrawing from such a plan. 
I  Amendment to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (effective for periods commencing on or after the 1 January 2009). This amendment 
is still to be endorsed by the EU. The amendments change the titles of some of the financial statements to reflect their function more carefully. 
The amendments introduce a new component referred to as the “Statement of Comprehensive Income” which enables readers to analyse 
changes in a company’s equity resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as owners (such as dividends, share issues and 
repurchases) and ‘non-owner’ changes.
I  Amendments to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” and IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements Relating to Puttable Financial 
Instruments and Obligations Arising on Liquidation” (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009). These amendments are 
still to be endorsed by the EU. The amendments require certain puttable financial instruments and certain financial instruments that impose 
an obligation on the entity to deliver a pro rata share of net assets of the entity on liquidation, to be classified as equity whilst IAS 1 has 
extended disclosure requirements in respect of such instruments. 28  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc

Transition to IFRS continued
(c)  Standards, amendments and interpretations of published standards, which are not yet effective continued
I  Amendments to IFRS1 “First Time Adoption of International Reporting Standards” and IAS 27 “Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements”. The International Accounting Standards Board has published amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 with regards to the accounting 
for the cost of an investment in a subsidiary, jointly controlled entity or associate (effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009).
   The amendments to IFRS 1 permit first-time adopters of IFRS to use deemed cost of either fair value or the carrying value under previous 
GAAP to measure the initial cost of investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in the separate financial statements. 
   The amendment to IAS 27 removes the definition of the cost method. As a consequence, dividends received by the acquirer in excess 
of earnings recognised after the acquisition date are no longer recognised as a reduction to the cost of the investment but recognised 
as income. The amendment to IAS 27 also provides additional guidance on how to account for an investment when an entity decides 
to reorganise its operating structure by forming a new parent entity so that the existing entity becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
new parent. The amendment states that the new parent shall measure the cost of its investment in the existing entity using the carrying 
amounts of the equity, assets and liabilities in the separate financial statements of the existing entity at the date of the formation. 
  The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material effect on the accounts 
of the Group, other than the additional segment disclosures under IFRS 8 as noted above. 
Revenue
The Group revenue arises from the sale of pharmaceutical products, sale of medical devices and share of gross margin on medical devices 
sold by distributors. Revenue is recognised upon the transfer of all risks and rewards in relation to the Group’s products. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of value added tax and similar taxes and trade discounts. 
For pharmaceutical products, revenue is recognised on dispatch of goods by the distributor to the final customer. 
For medical devices, revenue is represented by either (1) recognition on dispatch of goods to the final customer or (2), in the case of certain 
medical devices, (i) recognition on dispatch of goods from the manufacturer to the distributor and (ii) a share of the gross margin, which 
is recognised on dispatch of goods by the distributor to the final customer.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations is stated after charging all operating costs including those separately disclosed by virtue of their size or unusual nature 
or to facilitate a more helpful understanding of the Group’s results. It is stated before finance income and costs.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested. 
Finance costs
Finance costs comprises interest payable on financial liabilities and imputed interest payable on loan note instruments issued by the Group.
Tax income/(expense)
Tax income/(expense) represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax payable.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year; using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only recognised on taxable and deductible temporary differences, except for differences arising on:
I the initial recognition of goodwill;
I  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
I  investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference 
and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
difference can be utilised. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  29
1. Accounting policies continued
Basis of preparation continued
Tax income/(expense) continued
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the deferred tax assets/(liabilities) are settled/(recovered). Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
I the same taxable Group company; or
I  different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously, in each future year in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated accounts present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. Intra-Group 
transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. 
Business combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities that 
exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date. The results of subsidiaries acquired in the 
year are included in the income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including 
any intangible assets identified, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment 
losses. In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of the business 
combination and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon the extent to which the Directors believe performance conditions 
will be met and thus the probability of whether any further consideration will be payable. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually. Other non-financial 
assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s cash-generating 
unit (i.e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows). Goodwill is allocated on 
initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination giving rise 
to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line in the income statement, except to the extent they reverse gains previously 
recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense. Impairment losses on goodwill can never be reversed.
Foreign currency
All Group companies use Pounds Sterling as the functional and presentational currency. Transactions entered into in a currency other than the 
functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated 
at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 30  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc

Segment reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing an individual product or service or a group 
of related services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. A geographical segment is 
a distinguishable component of an enterprise that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment and 
that is subject to risk and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments. 
Financial instruments
Classification of financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments.
Following the adoption of IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity instruments 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
I  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Group; and
I  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation 
to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a fixed 
number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these accounts for called up share capital and share premium 
account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. Finance 
payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.
Financial assets
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand deposits held at call with banks. The Group had no bank overdrafts at either year end.
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by allowances for impairment when there is objective 
evidence of impairment.
Provisions for impairment are recorded in a separate allowance account with i) the loss on general provisions being recognised within administrative 
expenses or ii) the loss on specific credit note provisions being recognised within revenue in the income statement. On confirmation that the trade 
receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
Financial liabilities
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are recognised at amortised cost.
Loan note instruments issued by the Group are initially recognised at their fair value on the date issued. The liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the year to repayment 
is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the balance sheet. “Interest expense” in this context includes imputed interest 
using prevailing market rates of interest for a similar instrument.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are initially recorded at fair value and are not subsequently remeasured. The par value is recognised in share 
capital and the premium in the share reserve.
Employee benefits: defined contribution schemes
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an 
independently administered fund. The amount charged against profits represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the 
financial year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either other payables or other receivables 
in the balance sheet. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  31
1. Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based remuneration scheme for all employees under the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme. 
Share options granted to Executives in excess of the tax thresholds required by the Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme are classified for 
tax purposes as Unapproved Share Options. Share options vest after three years’ continuous employment by an individual holding the options. 
The options lapse if the employee leaves the Company before three years or if the share options are not exercised within ten years from the date 
of grant.
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement over the 
vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each 
balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately 
before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group (a “finance lease”), 
the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the fair value or, if lower, the present value 
of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments 
are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the income statement over the term of the lease and is calculated 
so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are retained by the lessor (an “operating lease”), the total rentals 
payable under the lease are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Externally acquired intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised over their useful economic lives. The amortisation 
expense is included within the administrative expenses line in the income statement.
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual/legal 
rights and where their fair value can be measured reliably. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate 
valuation techniques.
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used to determine the cost of intangibles 
acquired in a business combination are as follows:
Intangible asset     Useful economic life  Valuation method
Mysoline Trademark     10 years Royalty Relief Method
Cryogesic Trademark     10 years Royalty Relief Method
Haemopressin Trademark     10 years Royalty Relief Method
Internally generated intangible assets (development costs)
Expenditure on internally developed assets is capitalised if it can be demonstrated that:
I  adequate resources are available to complete the development;
I  there is an intention to complete and sell the product;
I  the Group is able to sell the product which the intangible asset supports;
I  use of the intangible asset will generate future economic benefits through product sales; 
I  expenditure on the project can be measured reliably; and
I  the Directors believe that it is technically feasible to complete the asset so that it can generate future economic benefits through product sales.
This would normally be demonstrated by reference to the stage of development which the product has reached or evidenced by a formal 
announcement by the Directors declaring a launch timescale for the product.
Capitalised development costs are amortised over the periods the Group expects to benefit from selling the products developed. 
Development expenditure not satisfying the above criteria and expenditure on the research phase of internal projects are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred. 32  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc

1. Accounting policies continued
Dividends
Interim dividends to equity shareholders are recognised when they are paid. Final dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. Depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment 
to write off the carrying value of items over their expected useful economic lives. It is applied at the following rates:
Plant and machinery – 20% to 25% per annum straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 25% to 50% per annum straight line
Inventories
Inventories are initially recognised at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase, 
costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Provision is made where necessary for obsolete, slow moving inventory where it is deemed that the costs incurred may not be recoverable.
Government grants
Government grants received on capital expenditure are generally deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset purchased. 
Grants for revenue expenditure are netted against the cost incurred by the Group.
Where retention of a government grant is dependent on the Group satisfying certain criteria, it is initially recognised as deferred income. 
When the criteria for retention has been satisfied, the deferred income balance is released to the income statement or netted against the 
asset purchased as appropriate. 
Critical judgements and estimates
The preparation of the accounts in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The key sources of estimation that have a significant impact on the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
Valuation of intangibles acquired in business combinations
Determining the fair value of intangibles acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value of the cash flows related to the 
identified intangibles and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
The value of cash flows has been estimated by applying royalty rates achievable on comparable products to the forecast gross profit used 
at the time of the business combination. The estimated gross profit is calculated by estimating future revenues and cost of sales based on 
historical experiences.
The estimate of the applicable discount rates for intangible assets are based on a Capital Asset Pricing Model-derived discount rate and the 
nature of the intangible asset being valued.
Other fair value assessments for business combinations
IFRS 3 requires all assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination to be recorded at fair value. This requires a judgement 
to be made on the likely provisions required against book receivable balances and provisions for liabilities which have not been recognised 
in the books of the acquired entities. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  33
1. Accounting policies continued
Critical judgements and estimates continued
Initial recognition of deferred consideration – Acorus Therapeutics Limited 
The fair value of deferred consideration is determined by discounting the amount payable on redemption of loan note instruments to their 
present value at the date of exchange. 
The loan note instruments are redeemable (together with accrued interest) upon achievement of milestone events, dependent upon the 
cumulative net sales of the acquired company, over a six year period following the date of acquisition. 
To estimate the amount payable in deferred consideration, the Directors estimate the probability of these milestone events being achieved 
against forecast revenues.
The discount rate used to achieve the fair value is estimated using equivalent rates of return for financial instruments with similar terms 
and characteristics.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating 
unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. An impairment review has been performed at the reporting date and 
no impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in the notes 26 and 27.
Valuation of development costs as intangibles
Determining whether expenditure qualifies as development expenditure requires, amongst other criteria, estimation of the probability of the 
project generating future economic benefit. 
Expenditure identified as development expenditure is valued at acquisition cost. The Group reviews intangible assets for impairment when 
there is an indication of impairment. If an impairment is identified the value of the impairment is charged to the income statement.
Useful economic lives of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are amortised or depreciated over their useful economic lives. Useful lives are based on 
management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. 
Changes to estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged to the income statement in particular periods 
which, in the case of intangible assets, could be significant. More details including carrying values are included in notes 12 and 13.
Deferred tax asset recognised in respect of tax losses
Determining the value of the deferred tax asset which should be recognised in respect of tax losses requires an estimation of the taxable profits 
of the subsidiary against which accumulated tax losses may be utilised. The estimated taxable profit is calculated by estimating future revenues 
and operating profit based on formally approved forecasts and historical experience.
Share-based payments
The Group has an equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Employee services received, and the corresponding 
increase in equity, are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments (shares) at the date of grant, excluding the impact 
of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value of share options is estimated by using a binomial valuation model on the date of grant 
based on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in note 22 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate, expected 
volatility, expected life of the options and number of options expected to vest. More details including carrying values are disclosed in note 22.  34  annual report and accounts 2008 / IS Pharma plc

2. First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
For all periods up to and including 31 March 2007, the Group prepared its accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“UK GAAP”). For the financial year ending 31 March 2008, the Group has prepared its annual consolidated accounts in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the EU and implemented in the UK.
The Directors have considered the impact of endorsed IFRS upon the Group and have concluded that apart from changes in format and 
presentation there is no impact upon the previously reported results, balance sheet and cash flows of the Company.
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” sets out the transition rules, which must be applied, when 
endorsed IFRS is adopted for the first time. The standard sets out certain mandatory exemptions to retrospective application and certain 
optional exemptions. The most significant optional exemptions available and taken by the Group are as follows:
I  share-based transactions: The Group adopted the exemption in IFRS 1 which allows a first-time adopter to apply the standard only to share 
options and equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that have not vested by 1 April 2006; and
I Land and buildings are valued at deemed cost at the date of transition under the exemption allowed by IFRS 1.
3. Financial instruments 
The Group is exposed through its operations to one or more of the following financial risks:
I  liquidity risk;
I  market price risk; and
I  credit risk.
Policy for managing these risks is set by the Board following recommendations from the Finance Director. Certain risks are managed centrally, 
while others are managed locally following guidelines communicated from the centre. The policy for each of the above risks is described in 
more detail below.
Principal financial instruments
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial risk arises, are as follows:
I trade receivables;
I  cash and cash equivalents;
I  trade and other payables; and
I  loan notes.
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk of each Group entity is managed centrally by the Group Finance Director. Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management 
of working capital and the finance charges and principal payments on debt financing. It is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting 
its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group currently has sufficient liquid resources which, along with operating cash generation, 
is sufficient to meet the liquidity requirements of the business and its future plans. 
The Group also had access to £1.5m of undrawn borrowing facilities at the year end at a floating rate of interest. Since the year end the Group 
has negotiated borrowing facilities of £8.0m to ensure that short-term fluctuations are manageable and that it will always have sufficient 
short, medium and long-term funding in place. The Board monitors a cash flow forecast on a regular basis.
Market price risk
Market price risk arises from the use of interest bearing, tradeable and foreign currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of 
future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, currency rates or other market factors. The Group 
balance sheet is not exposed to market price risk.
Fair value and cash flow interest rate risk
Cash balances attract a market rate of interest. 
The Group has issued loan note instruments described in note 26 which incur a fixed rate of interest. 
The Group does not hold any liabilities which incur a floating rate of interest and therefore there is no significant interest rate risk associated 
with the Group’s cash balances.  IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  35
3. Financial instruments continued
Liquidity risk continued
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s primary foreign currency risk arises from suppliers who invoice in Euros and also export sales to the EU which the Group invoices 
in Euros.
The Group does not currently utilise forward contracts to manage the risk but bulk purchases of inventories enable management of the overall 
pricing of materials and monitoring of exchange rates ensures that the Group makes payments against trade payables at an appropriate time 
to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.
Payments to suppliers from the EU are paid out of a Euro bank account which is funded through export sales to the EU. This further helps to 
mitigate the risks of foreign exchange movements.
The Euro bank account is monitored and maintained to ensure that sufficient Euros are available to meet purchasing requirements. Surplus 
Euros are converted back into Pounds Sterling to minimise the foreign currency risk generated by revenues from the EU.
Balances which are denominated in Euros are broken down as follows:
      2008 2007 
      £ £
Trade receivables      779,756 42,194
Cash and cash equivalents      561,597 33
Trade payables      (389,142) (269,301)
Whilst the Group takes steps to minimise its exposure to foreign exchange risk as described above, changes in foreign exchange rates will have 
an impact on profit.
The Group’s foreign exchange risk is dependent on the movement in the Euro to Pounds Sterling exchange rate. The effect of a 10% 
strengthening in the Euro against Pounds Sterling at the balance sheet date on the Euro denominated assets and liabilities at that date and 
on the annualised interest on that amount would, all other variables being held constant, have resulted in an increase in the post-tax profit for 
the year of £0.1m. A 10% weakening in the exchange rate would, on the same basis, have decreased post-tax profit by £0.1m and reduced 
shareholders’ equity by the same amount.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily derived from its trade receivables, this risk is managed daily by the Group’s credit controller who 
monitors recovery to ensure that outstanding debts are identified when these become overdue and appropriate action is taken to recover 
the amounts outstanding.
Credit checks are also made for new customers and appropriate credit limits are set from this information. Credit limits may only be exceeded 
with the express authorisation of the Group Finance Director.
The Group provides against specific trade receivables where appropriate and based on likely recovery.
The Group’s credit risk is dependent on the recoverability of trade receivables from its customers. An analysis of credit quality is shown in note 16. 
If customers in Category 3,“Overseas balances carrying a provision”, were to default on repayments, this would reduce post-tax profit by £0.2m 
and reduce shareholders’ equity by the same amount.
Capital
The Group considers its capital to comprise its ordinary share capital, share premium and accumulated retained earnings. The Group’s objective 
is to maximise shareholder wealth by capital growth.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where 
the Directors believe it is probable that these assets will be recovered. In previous years no tax asset was recognised in respect of tax losses 
attributable to IS Pharmaceuticals Limited as this company was loss making. In 2008 IS Pharmaceuticals Limited has become profitable and 
the Directors believe it is appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset in view of forecast future profits.

Costs of acquisition       629,713
Cash and cash equivalents in subsidiary acquired       (666,915)
Cash outflow on acquisition       8,077,897
The only intangible assets that were in existence at the date of acquisition were the trademarks. These assets were not separately recognised 
on the balance sheet as they did not meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38. Therefore, the carrying value of such instruments at acquisition 
was £nil.
The fair value adjustments in respect of intangible assets are due to the recognition of £2.2m in respect of trademarks which have been valued 
by applying the Royalty Relief Method to the forecast cash flows that were expected to be generated by the trademarks at the date of the 
business combination.
The fair value of the shares issued was determined by reference to their quoted market price of 12.38p at the date of acquisition.
The loan note instruments are redeemable (together with accrued interest) in five equal instalments at least twelve months apart upon 
achievement of milestone events dependent upon the cumulative net sales of the acquired company over a six year period following the 
date of acquisition. The amount included represents the Directors’ estimate of the fair value of the amount payable.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are:
I  the presence of certain intangible assets, such as the non-contractual customer relationships of the acquired entity, which do not qualify 
for separate recognition; and
I  synergistic distribution and marketing opportunities which result in the Group being prepared to pay a premium. 
Since the acquisition date, Acorus Therapeutics Limited has contributed £751,142 to Group profit. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007, 
Group revenue would have been £819,427 and Group profit for the year would have been £2,004,407. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  47
27. Goodwill and impairment
No impairment losses in respect of goodwill have been recognised in the year ending 31 March 2008. For the purposes of performing impairment 
reviews, the Directors have identified two cash-generating units (“CGUs”). Annual impairment reviews are performed as at 31 March for all CGUs. 
These reviews compare the carrying value of each CGU with the present value of future cash flows arising from the use of assets of the unit 
(value in use). If the value in use is less than the carrying value of the CGU, an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Details of goodwill allocated to CGUs for which the amount of goodwill so allocated is significant in comparison to total goodwill is as follows:
      Goodwill Goodwill 
      2008 2007

Pharmaceutical Products CGU      8,085,281 —
Medical Devices CGU      3,148,947 —
      11,234,228 —
The recoverable amounts of all the above CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash flow projections from 
formally approved forecasts over five years which are then extrapolated to cover a ten year period to 31 March 2018. Other major assumptions 
are as follows:
      Pharmaceutical  Medical 
      products devices

      % %
Discount rate (pre tax)      — —
Extrapolated forecast overhead inflation      — —
Extrapolated growth rate      — —
Gross margins based on past experience are applied to expected sales.
Discount rates are based on the Group’s Capital Asset Pricing Model-derived discount rate adjusted to reflect management’s assessment 
of specific risks related to the CGUs. 
Forecast growth rates in sales are based on opening new markets through synergistic marketing and distribution opportunities, for which 
the Directors have estimated significant potential. Growth rates for the year following the budget correspond to overhead inflation. 
Overhead inflation has been based on independent economic data and the Group’s experience of the market place.
The aggregate recoverable amount for the CGUs of £18,668,098 exceeds their aggregate carrying amount as shown below:
       2008 
       £
Aggregate recoverable amount       18,668,098
Aggregate carrying amount       (11,234,228)
Net aggregate carrying value       7,433,870
If the discount rate increased from 15.00% to 27.31% based on the above key assumptions, the carrying amount and recoverable amount 
would be the same.

I  increasing the authorised share capital to £28,000,000 by creating an additional 11,428,572 consolidated ordinary shares; and
I  cancellation of its share premium account and reduction in accumulated deficit on the retained earnings by £12,035,094.
Acquisition of Speciality European Pharma International AG
On 25 April 2008 the Company completed the acquisition of Speciality European Pharma International AG (“SEPI AG”) a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Speciality European Pharma Limited. SEPI AG is a Swiss based pharmaceutical company with a profitable portfolio of specialist 
hospital pharmaceutical products. The consideration for the acquisition was satisfied by an initial cash payment of £9.25m subject to a completion 
adjustment and up to a further £5.00m in deferred consideration, conditional on SEPI AG meeting certain regulatory criteria and sales targets.
In order to satisfy the cash component of the acquisition and to enable the Company to implement its strategy, the Board raised 
£10.00m by way of a placing of 13,000,000 ordinary shares at 77p per placing share. 
Name change
In conjunction with the acquisition the Company changed its name from Maelor plc to IS Pharma plc.  IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  49

for the year ended 31 March 2008
1. Accounting policies
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Valuation of investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Investments held as current assets are stated at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value.
Finance costs
Finance costs are charged to profit over the term of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Finance 
costs include issue costs, which are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Current tax is measured at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except 
that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the Company anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future 
to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders 
at an Annual General Meeting.
Dividends on shares wholly recognised as liabilities are recognised as expenses and classified within interest payable.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the financial instrument’s contractual obligations, rather than the 
financial instrument’s legal form. 
Share-based payments
In accordance with FRS 20 “Share-based Payments” the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the 
date of the grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of share options that will 
eventually vest. In the case of options granted, fair value is measured by a binomial pricing model. 
Company profit and loss account
The retained profit for the year ended 31 March 2008 was £1,170,379 (2007: loss of £32,630).
As permitted under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Parent Company. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008  51

Notes
1.  A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend 
and, on a poll, to vote on his or her behalf. In order to be valid an appointment of proxy must be returned by one of the following methods:
I in hard copy form by post, by courier or by hand to Capita Registrars, PO Box 25, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR; or
I in the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out below;
 and in each case must be received by the Company not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting 
service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order 
for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, 
regardless of whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to 
be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of 
meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications 
Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid 
a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular 
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s) to 
procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
2.  A form of proxy is enclosed for use by shareholders and, if appropriate, must be deposited with the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PO Box 25, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR not less than 48 hours before the time of the Annual General Meeting. Appointment of a proxy does 
not preclude a shareholder from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person.
3.  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, in order to be able to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting or any 
adjourned meeting, (and also for the purposes of calculating how many votes a person may cast), a person must have his/her name entered on the register 
of members of the Company by 11.00 am on Monday 8 September 2008 (or not less than 48 hours before any adjourned meeting). Changes to entries on the 
register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
4.  Copies of the Directors’ service contracts with the Company and the register of interests of the Directors and their families in the share capital of the Company 
are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) and will be 
available at the place of the Annual General Meeting from 15 minutes prior to and during the Annual General Meeting. 
5.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the Meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the Meeting so that: (i) if a corporate shareholder 
has appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative, with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all the 
other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting who have been appointed in respect of different parts of the holding of that corporate 
shareholder, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) in respect 
of each different part of the shareholding as corporate representative in accordance with the directions he has received from such corporate representatives, 
in relation to the respective parts of the shareholding in respect of which they are each appointed; or (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the 
same corporate shareholder attends the Meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative, 
a designated corporate representative will be nominated from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll in accordance with the 
directions he receives from the other corporate representatives, in respect of the parts of the corporate shareholder’s shareholding, in respect of which such 
corporate representatives have each been appointed. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries 
and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form 
of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. IS Pharma plc / annual report and accounts 2008 55

Notes
1.  This form of proxy must be received by Capita Registrars, Proxies, PO Box 25, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4BR, or in the case of CREST members 
by using the CREST proxy voting appointment service, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the meeting. The form must be signed. If someone 
else signs the form on your behalf, you or that person must send the power of attorney or other written authority under which it is signed to the address stated 
above. Crest members should refer to Note 1 of the Notice of Annual General Meeting in relation to the appointment of a proxy appointment via CREST.
2.  A corporation must execute this form either under its Company seal or under the hand of two Directors or one Director and the Secretary or under the hand 
of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing.
3.  You are entitled to appoint one or more proxies of your own choice to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. A proxy need 
not be a member of the Company. If you appoint more than one proxy, each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by you. You can only appoint proxies using the procedures set out in these notes.
4.  To appoint more than one proxy, you will need to complete a separate proxy form in relation to each appointment. Additional proxy forms may be obtained 
by contacting the Company’s registrar at Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU or you may photocopy this form. 
You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. Please therefore indicate in the appropriate 
space the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by ticking the box provided if the proxy instruction is 
one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope. A failure to specify the number of 
shares each proxy appointment relates to or specifying a number in excess of those held by the member may result in the proxy appointment being invalid.
5.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the Meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the Meeting so that: (i) if a corporate shareholder 
has appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate representative, with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all the 
other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting who have been appointed in respect of different parts of the holding of that corporate 
shareholder, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) in respect 
of each different part of the shareholding as corporate representative in accordance with the directions he has received from such corporate representatives, 
in relation to the respective parts of the shareholding in respect of which they are each appointed; or (ii) if more than one corporate representative for 
the same corporate shareholder attends the Meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the Meeting as its corporate 
representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll in 
accordance with the directions he receives from the other corporate representatives, in respect of the parts of the corporate shareholder’s shareholding, 
in respect of which such corporate representatives have each been appointed. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance 
includes a sample form of representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
6. Returning the form of proxy will not prevent you from attending the meeting and voting in person.

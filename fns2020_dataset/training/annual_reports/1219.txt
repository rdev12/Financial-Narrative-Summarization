4 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Results and dividend
The increasingly widespread adoption of ARM technology in consumer
electronic devices was illustrated in 2005 by the 31% increase in the
reported total shipments of ARM Powered
®
products to 1.7 billion units,
up from 1.3 billion units in 2004. The strong cash generation resulting
from this robust operational performance, together with our confidence
in the Company’s long-term prospects, enabled us to increase
investments in research and development by 20% and to acquire Keil,
a microcontroller tools business, in October 2005.
The combination of ARM microprocessor IP with the physical IP
acquired through the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004 has
accelerated ARM’s momentum towards becoming the architecture for
the digital world. ARM’s strong financial performance continued with
revenue growth at twice the rate of the semiconductor industry, 
year-on-year dollar revenue growth of 14% and operating margins 
up to 33%.
The board decided at the end of 2003 to initiate the payment of an
annual dividend. It is the board’s intention to increase the dividend
over time, taking into account the opportunity for continued
investment in the business and the Company’s underlying operational
performance. With this in mind, the board is recommending a final
dividend of 0.5 pence per share, bringing the total for the year to 
0.84 pence per share, an increase of 20% over the dividend paid in
respect of 2004.
We see a return of cash to shareholders through a dividend as part of
a package of measures to make the best use of the business’s cash
resources. The board also initiated a share buyback programme in July
2005 and purchased a total of 13.9 million shares at a total cost of
£16.2 million in the period up to the end of 2005. The buyback
programme is ongoing.
The market
2005 was expected to be a year of flat growth for the semiconductor
industry although the year ended with growth of approximately 7%. 
In face of a slow first half and an improving second half of 2005, ARM’s
revenue growth of 14% was at a rate double that of the industry. 
Looking to 2006, the industry has started the year with a general
feeling that the growth seen in 2005 would continue at a similar 
level in 2006, with the possibility of some further improvement. 
In the light of this industry backdrop, ARM is well positioned to outgrow
the semiconductor industry once again in 2006. Our confidence in 
the growth of our business is underpinned by a healthy technology
portfolio of both processor and physical IP , consisting of both new and
mature products, the prospect of more synergistic deals for the 
Physical IP Division and continued acceleration of penetration of ARM IP
into royalty-generating designs in both the mobile and non-mobile
market segments.
Geographic expansion
In 2005, ARM continued to strengthen its position as a global entity
across all regions. In the year, 43% of revenue emanated from  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 5
North America, 43% from Asia Pacific and 14% from Europe. ARM
received its first royalties from China-based chip designers and ended
the year with four Chinese design teams shipping ARM technology-
based designs. ARM also signed the first processor licence with a design
team in India and expects continued success in that country in 2006.
Not only did ARM continue to expand its commercial presence around
the globe in 2005, but the engineering diversity within the Company
also expanded during the year. We now have 11 design centres,
located in Cambridge, Maidenhead, Sheffield and Blackburn, England;
Sunnyvale, California and Austin, Texas in the USA; Bangalore, India;
Sophia Antipolis, France; Leuven, Belgium; and Aachen and Munich,
Germany. During 2005, ARM doubled the capacity of its design team 
in India to more than 100 people and expects to increase it to at least
150 people by the end of 2006.
People
On behalf of the board, I thank all employees worldwide for the
contribution they have made to the excellent results achieved in 
2005 in the increasingly demanding market in which we operate. 
At 31 December 2005, we had 1,324 full-time employees, compared
with 1,171 at the end of 2004. Of these, 576 are based in the UK, 
486 in the US, 101 in continental Europe, 116 in India and 45 in the
Asia Pacific region.
Board changes
Simon Segars and Philip Rowley joined the board in January 2005
which brought the number of directors to 14. Peter Cawdron has been
a member of the board since 1998 and had planned to step down at
the 2005 AGM. He has, however, kindly agreed to stand for re-election
this year for a further period of up to one year, which will provide
valuable continuity following the appointment of four new directors
since December 2004. Lucio Lanza, who joined the board following the
acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, and has considerable
experience of US reporting requirements, joined the audit committee
with effect from February 2006.
Current trading and prospects
During 2005, we integrated Artisan into ARM and began to accelerate
new product development in physical IP . We also brought three 
new processor designs to market, completed the acquisition of 
a microcontroller tools company and invested further in product
development. As a result, we enter 2006 well placed to build 
on our market leadership position.
A broad technology portfolio for licensing, increasing royalty
momentum, growth in development systems sales and the prospect of
more synergistic revenues arising from the combination of processor IP
and physical IP underpin our confidence in our ability to achieve
another strong performance in 2006.
Sir Robin Saxby Chairman
2005 was another successful year for ARM; we entered 2006 
well placed to build on our market leadership position  Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations
6 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Technology is now influencing lifestyle rather than simply reflecting 
it: the Blackberry device, for example, has fundamentally changed 
the work-life balance for large numbers of professionals worldwide; 
the merging of mainstream media with our everyday lives is made
possible by easy access to the internet, any time and anywhere, and 
in turn makes that access critical. We expect our household appliances
to have an increasing number of features, our cars to be safe and
reliable, our cameras to react automatically to prevailing light
conditions, and our mobile telephones to incorporate myriad 
features. A silent revolution in the way ordinary people interact 
with technology is underway.
This is a revolution which ARM has foreseen and, indeed, has
pioneered. In recent years we have transformed our business,
organically and by acquisition, from one which was primarily focused
on the development of microprocessor intellectual property (IP), to one
which is now capable of delivering a total solution – from beginning 
to end of the design process – to our customers. Our 2004 acquisitions
of California-based companies Artisan Components, which designs
physical IP , and Axys, which provides electronic system-level (ESL)
design tools, were augmented in October this year by the acquisition
of Keil. Based in Munich, Germany, and in Plano, Texas, Keil is a 
leading provider of 8/16-bit software development tools for the
microcontroller market; bringing it into the ARM fold enables our 
silicon Partners’ customers to develop intelligent and low-cost 
32-bit microcontroller-based products more easily.
Our strategic priorities
It is our ambition for all digital products to be powered by ARM
technology – and we are well on the way to becoming the architecture
for the digital world. In the future, digital products will contain
increasing amounts of our technology, including processor and physical
IP , other systems IP and embedded software. In addition, we will
continue to provide the software development tools that enable
designers to build innovative ARM Powered products: in 2005 our
Partners shipped 1.7 billion of these, up 31% on 2004, and in May
2005, we announced that we expect total shipments to increase to
approximately 4.5 billion by 2010.
We use the analogy of a human body to describe how ARM technology
brings digital products to life: our processor IP is the brain controlling
and driving the system; our data engine IP forms the specialist organs,
such as the lungs; fabric IP makes up the nervous system which
enables the brain to communicate with the other parts of the body;
and our physical IP – the libraries and memories – are the cells from
which the entire body is made. Our tools are the parents and teachers
which shape the body and develop its thoughts; and our software IP
are the thoughts that go through the brain and provide the intelligence
and character of the product. 
A year of execution and delivery
In 2005, we made significant progress in executing on our strategic
priorities. At the beginning of the year we set ourselves an objective:
to take ARM into the next phase of its growth. Looking back, we have
done just that. We have positioned our enlarged group to capitalise on
Our industry is one which changes constantly, 
but in the past year the shift has been particularly
noticeable  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 7
the huge potential benefits which accrue from the combination of ARM
and Artisan; we have delivered a number of new products which
underpin the proliferation of our IP; and we have delivered meaningful
earnings growth for our shareholders.
Building on the combination of ARM and Artisan
We completed the acquisition of Artisan Components in December
2004. One year on, we have successfully integrated Artisan, now our
Physical IP Division (PIPD), into the Group. The PIPD management team
is a blend of senior executives from ARM and Artisan. The unified ARM
sales team is a combination of the former ARM and Artisan sales
teams; based on an account management structure, it uses technical
specialists from across the group.
During the year, we began to see good progress in effecting the
strategic plan for the acquisition. This was, first, to outsource physical
IP to traditional ARM Partners; second, to create optimised products
from the combination of physical IP and processor IP; and, third, to use
the Artisan sales channel to create broader access to processor IP .
We plan to build on the success Artisan achieved in selling its physical
IP to small fabless semiconductor companies, which account for
approximately 10% of the world’s semiconductor industry revenue, by
expanding the customer base to include large fabless semiconductor
companies and integrated device manufactures (IDMs). These not only
account for the other 90%, but represent ARM’s traditional customer
base. We made progress on this and exceeded our expectations by
completing seven deals – encouraging early indications of our Partners’
willingness to outsource the development of physical IP when it makes
economic sense to do so, and when we have the right products. As the
cost and complexity of developing physical IP increases, we anticipate
that an increasing number of our Partners will realise the commercial
and technical wisdom of outsourcing it from us. 
During the year, we also developed our first optimised products
through the combination of physical IP and processor IP . Developing
processor and physical IP concurrently has enabled us to create faster,
smaller, and more power-efficient processors. In October, at the second
annual ARM Developers’ Conference in California, we introduced 
the Cortex™-A8 processor; at the same time, we introduced the
Advantage™ CE libraries which increase the processor’s performance
and efficiency. Our Partners will be able to license optimised physical
IP to maximise the Cortex-A8 processor’s performance while, at the
same time, minimising size and power consumption. A number of
other optimised products, including the introduction of an
implementation of the ARM1176JZF-S™ processor, were delivered
through collaborative technology design: advanced physical IP , and
process technology delivery will provide 40% more performance
without increasing size or power consumption.
Delivering new technologies 
At the beginning of 2005 we had a strong portfolio of products for
licensing. During the year, we increased licence revenues in the
Processor Division (PD) by 19% – building on 27% growth in 2004 – and
signed 71 new licences, including 12 for ARM11 family products which
are now increasingly being licensed for use outside the mobile sector. Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations/continued
8 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
During the year, PIPD had sold 20 platform licences to its foundry and
IDM Partners, and a further 42 end-user licences to IDMs and fabless
semiconductor companies. At the year end the cumulative total for
PIPD licensing reached 67 platform licences and 143 end-user licences.
The year was an outstanding one for the development of the new
products that will drive future revenue growth. The Cortex-A8 processor
is the industry’s fastest embedded processor and our first complete
processing solution to comprise a wide range of ARM technology to
reduce time-to-market. Its performance and power consumption
characteristics make it ideal for consumer products which run multi-
channel video, audio and gaming applications. We expect it to
revolutionise consumer and low-power mobile devices, and to enable
even more innovative product features to be delivered to end users to
provide higher levels of functionality and entertainment. The Cortex-A8
processor’s attributes were recognised by the winning of four high-
profile industry awards: Electronic Products magazine’s “Product of the
Year”; Portable Design magazine’s “Editor’s Choice”; Electronic Design
magazine’s “Best of Embedded 2005” and Microprocessor Report’s
“Analysts’ Choice Award for the Best Processor-IP Core of 2005”. In
October, we announced that there were already five lead licensees for
the product, including Freescale, Matsushita, Samsung and Texas
Instruments. We expect the Cortex-A8 processor to be available for
general licensing by mid-2006.
We continued the development of our other products in the Cortex
family, including the Cortex-M3 processor, which was available for
general release by early 2006. We licensed it to four lead licensees in 
2005 and had made initial deliveries to them by the middle of the year. 
Test silicon for the Cortex-M3 processor is revealing higher performance
and smaller size characteristics than we initially visualised and creates
a significant opportunity for licensing growth in 2006. The latest addition
to the Cortex family, code named “Serval-E”, was licensed to two lead
Partners and is expected to be available for general licensing during 2006.
We also made significant advances in technology in PIPD with the
acceleration of the development of leading-edge products. This will
ensure that we have the ability to support large IDMs and fabless
companies which, as a result of rapid increases in the cost and
complexity of physical IP arising from the continuing advances in silicon
process technology, are increasingly looking to us to provide third-party
physical IP . To this end we have successfully developed 90nm and,
more recently, 65nm physical IP products, enabling us to sell leading-
edge physical IP to a number of major foundries, including Chartered
Semiconductor and IBM. 
ARM IP in digital products 
When we updated our estimate of future shipments of ARM Powered
products, we also rationalised our application-oriented approach to
target markets in line with the changing nature of the electronic
industry: we now focus on solutions for the mobile, home, enterprise,
embedded and emerging applications markets.
By the final quarter of the year, our Partners had shipped a record 
499 million units – the equivalent of approximately 5.5 million each
day. The mobile market continued to grow strongly: we shipped more  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 9
than 1 billion units into mobile for the first time and also increased
penetration by attaining an average of 1.4 ARM processors per
handset. The first shipments of ARM11 family-based phones were
made in Japan from the FOMA N902i; with multiple versions now
shipping. We expect this strong growth in mobile (up 23% from 2004),
to continue in 2006, driven by shipments of ultra-low-cost handsets
(ULCH) in emerging markets and by the increased popularity of smarter
phones.
We also achieved significant growth (46% over 2004) in non-mobile
markets: our Partners shipped 600 million units in 2005 –
approximately the same number as was achieved for mobile
shipments in 2003. This was over a broad base of applications,
particularly hard disk drives, games consoles, smartcards, printers, DVD
players, flash memory products, digital still cameras, Wi-Fi chipsets and
automotive products.
We continued to make strategic investments to speed our growth in
non-mobile areas. The microcontroller sector promises particular
potential and we expect this to reach approximately 1 billion units by
2010. Our acquisition of Keil maximises the opportunity for success in
the microcontroller market; we are aiming to provide an easy transition
for developers from their older 8- and 16-bit technologies to new ARM
32-bit microcontrollers. We believe we can accelerate this by providing
a consistent development system platform for building applications. 
We introduced our first combined development product, the RealView
®
Microcontroller Development Kit, in January 2006.
Looking ahead
Our extensive portfolio of technology for licensing, increasing
momentum in royalties, the growth in sales of development systems,
and the prospect of more revenues arising from the combination of
processor IP and physical IP , gives us confidence for another strong
performance in 2006. We enter the year in an excellent position to
continue to build on our market leadership.
Warren East Chief Executive Officer Operating and financial review/IFRS
10 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notwithstanding the 20% increase in R&D expenditure to drive
expected strong revenue growth, an increase in earnings per share of
more than 20% has enabled us to return more cash to shareholders
through a progressive dividend policy and the ongoing share buyback
programme that we introduced during the year.
The business, its objectives and strategy
ARM's comprehensive product offer includes 16/32-bit RISC
microprocessors, data engines, 3D processors, digital libraries,
embedded memories, peripherals, software and development tools, 
as well as analogue functions and high-speed connectivity products.
The Group licenses this technology to semiconductor companies which,
in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors and related
products. ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual property-
centred and market-driven business model in which it neither
manufactures nor sells the products incorporating ARM technology, but
concentrates on the research and development, design and support of
the ARM architecture and supporting development tools and software.
Together with our broad Partner community, we provide a total 
system solution that offers a fast, reliable path to market for leading
electronics companies.
In 2005, as well as growing profitability, the Company was robustly
cash generative (before investing activities), with net cash inflows
from operating activities of £41.7 million, giving rise to a year-end
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable
securities balance of £160.9 million.
Performance
Revenues
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2005 amounted 
to £232.4 million. Total revenues comprised £182.3 million from 
the Processor division, an increase of 19% over total revenues 
of £152.7 million in the year ended 31 December 2004, and 
£50.1 million for PIPD (2004: £0.2 million). 
The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2005 was $1.80 compared
with $1.78 in 2004 for ARM standalone. This had the effect of
decreasing total reported revenues by approximately £2.8 million.
Total licensing revenues in 2005 were £104.2 million, being 45% 
of total revenues, compared with £59.4 million or 39% of total revenues
in the year to 31 December 2004. Total licensing revenues in 2005
comprised £69.4 million from the Processor division, compared with
£59.4 million in 2004 and £34.8 million from PIPD (2004: £nil). 
Royalty revenues in 2005 were £87.8 million, representing 38% 
of total revenues, compared with £59.6 million or 39% of total
revenues in the year to 31 December 2004. Royalty revenues in 
2005 comprised £72.5 million from the Processor division, compared
with £59.6 million in 2004, and £15.3 million from PIPD (2004: 
£0.2 million). 
Sales of development systems in 2005 were £25.7 million, being 
11% of total revenues, compared with £19.7 million, or 13% of total
revenues in 2004. Service revenues, which include consulting services
and revenues from support, maintenance and training, were 
£14.7 million in 2005, representing 6% of total revenues, compared
with £14.2 million, or 9% of total revenues in 2004.
In 2005, ARM increased revenues at twice the rate 
of the semiconductor industry, achieved operating
margins healthily in excess of 30%* and saw volumes 
of ARM Powered products grow by more than 30% 
year-on-year to 1.7 billion units

amortisation charges. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 11
Royalty revenues and unit shipments
Total royalty revenues for 2005 were £87.8 million, comprising 
£72.5 million from the Processor division and £15.3 million from PIPD.
Royalties from the Processor division came from record unit shipments 
of 1,662 million compared with £59.6 million and 1,272 million units
in 2004. Dollar royalty revenues earned in the Processor division were
$131.1 million, up 22% on 2004 compared with the increase in year-
on-year unit shipments of 31%. The average royalty rate in 2005 was
7.9 cents. The average royalty rate in a given period is based on a
number of variables, including the average selling prices of the chips
being shipped, the applicable royalty rate payable to ARM and the mix
of unit shipments by ARM product family.
In 2005, the proportion of total unit shipments accounted for by the
mobile segment was 65%. Unit shipments in the mobile segment
grew by 23% year-on-year with unit shipments in the non-mobile
segments growing by 46%. Growth in the non-mobile segments was
achieved across a broad range of product applications, including hard
disk drives, games consoles, smart cards, printers, DVD players, flash
memory products, digital still cameras, Wi-Fi chipsets and automotive
products.
There were 68 Partners shipping ARM technology-based products at
the end of 2005; 19 companies were paying royalties for physical IP
products at the end of the year. Royalties within PIPD demonstrated
market share growth against a backdrop of lower year-on-year revenue
for the foundries as a whole.
Gross margin
Gross margins for the year to 31 December 2005 were 89% compared
with 92% for the ARM standalone business in 2004. Cost of sales in 2005
included compensation charges in respect of share-based payments of
£1.3 million (2004: £0.4 million). The reduction reflects the higher
margin achieved in the Processor division offset by the lower margins
achieved in the Physical IP Division.
Operating expenses
The comparability of costs between 2004 and 2005 is affected by 
the acquisitions of Artisan Components Inc. on 23 December 2004 
and Axys Design Automation Inc. on 16 August 2004. On acquisition,
significant values of intangible assets other than goodwill were
recognised and these amounts are amortised over the expected useful
lives of the assets acquired, with the cost recorded against research
and development, sales and marketing or general and administrative
expenses as appropriate. To aid comparability, these costs have been
separately identified as “acquisition-related charges” in the narrative
below. In addition, the issuance of ARM share options to the
employees of Artisan on its acquisition gives rise to significant non-
cash share-based compensation charges. These, together with the
share option compensation costs arising on options granted to existing
ARM employees, are separately identified in the narrative below.
Total operating expenses in the year to 31 December 2005 were
£170.7 million compared with £112.3 million in 2004. Average headcount
increased from 774 in 2004 to 1,234 in 2005. Operating expenses in
2005 included total acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million (2004:
£0.5 million) and compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments and related payroll taxes of £20.2 million (2004: £7.5 million). Operating and financial review/IFRS/continued
12 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Excluding acquisition-related charges and compensation charges in respect
of share-based payments and related payroll taxes, total operating
expenses in 2005 were £132.6 million in 2005, compared with 
£99.8 million in 2004 after excluding a further £4.5 million in respect
of a non-recurring charge for a technology licence agreement. 
Research and development (R&D) expenses at £80.3 million in 2005,
represented 35% of revenues. This compares with £54.7 million, 36%
of revenues, in 2004. Average headcount in this area increased from
464 in 2004 to 783 in 2005. R&D expenses included total acquisition-
related charges of £8.1 million (2004: £0.3 million) and compensation
charges in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of
£12.3 million (2004: £4.3 million). Excluding acquisition-related charges

was £79.9 million or 34.4% of revenues. This compares with 
£48.2 million, before acquisition-related charges of £0.5 million,
compensation charges in respect of share-based payments of 
£7.9 million and £4.5 million in respect of a non-recurring charge 
for a technology licence agreement, or 31.5% of revenues in 2004.
The Group’s effective taxation rate in 2005 was 26.8%, compared with
26.6% in 2004. In 2005, there was an increase compared with 2004 
in the level of disallowable items, but this was offset by tax benefits
arising from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition and increased
R&D tax credits and deferred tax adjustments.
Fully diluted earnings per share in 2005 were 2.1 pence compared 
with 2.5 pence in 2004. Earnings per fully diluted share in 2005, before
acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million, compensation charges 
in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of 
£21.5 million and related estimated tax adjustments thereon of 
£9.1 million, were 4.2 pence, compared with 3.5 pence before acquisition-
related charges of £0.5 million, compensation charges in respect 
of share-based payments of £7.9 million, £4.5 million in respect 
of a non-recurring charge for a technology licence agreement and
related estimated tax adjustments thereon of £2.1 million, in 2004.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Goodwill at 31 December 2005 was £474.4 million, compared with
£419.2 million at 31 December 2004. The increase in goodwill 
in 2005 is due primarily to foreign exchange movements, given 
the strengthening of the US dollar against sterling from $1.92 at 
31 December 2004 to $1.72 at the end of 2005. Goodwill arising 
on the Keil acquisitions amounted to £5.8 million. Goodwill is not
amortised under IFRS but is subject to impairment review on at least
an annual basis. A regular review of the carrying value of the assets
arising on the acquisition of Artisan was performed as at 31 December
2005 and it was concluded that no impairment charge was required. 
Other intangible assets at 31 December 2005 were £79.7 million,
compared with £84.0 million at 31 December 2004. The movement 
in other intangible assets in 2005 reflects the amortisation in the year
of the intangible assets arising on the acquisitions of Artisan and Axys
of £17.5 million and an additional £8.7 million arising on the Keil
acquisitions in October 2005. The other intangible assets will be
amortised through the profit and loss account over a weighted average
period of five years. 
Accounts receivable at 31 December 2005 were £55.5 million, 
compared with £34.3 million at 31 December 2004. The allowance
against receivables was £2.2 million at 31 December 2005, compared
with £1.5 million at 31 December 2004. Deferred revenues were 
£20.4 million at 31 December 2005, compared with £21.4 million 
at the end of 2004.
Resources available
The consolidated cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments 
and marketable securities balance was £160.9 million at 31 December
2005 compared with £142.8 million at 31 December 2004. Operating and financial review/IFRS/continued

Interest receivable
Interest receivable was £5.3 million for the year to 31 December 2005
compared with £6.9 million in 2004. 
Returns to shareholders
Dividend 
The directors recommend payment of a final dividend in respect of
2005 of 0.5 pence per share which, taken together with the interim
dividend of 0.34 pence per share paid in October 2005, gives a total
dividend in respect of 2005 of 0.84 pence per share, an increase of
20% over 0.7 pence per share in 2004. Subject to shareholder
approval, the final dividend will be paid on 5 May 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 31 March 2006.
Total dividends actually paid in 2005 amounted to £10.4 million 
(2004: £9.0 million).
Share buyback programme
During 2005, the Group initiated a share buyback programme to
supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders.
During 2005, the Company bought back over 13.9 million shares at 
a total cost of £16.2 million. This programme is on-going and further
repurchases are expected to be made in 2006 and beyond.
Capital structure
The authorised share capital of the Company is 2,200,000,000 ordinary
shares of 0.05 pence each (2004: 2,200,000,000). The issued share
capital at 31 December 2005 was 1,386,102,680 ordinary shares of
0.05 pence each (2004: 1,350,786,975).  
Treasury policies and objectives and liquidity
The Group has established treasury policies aimed both at mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on reported profits and
cash flows, and at ensuring appropriate returns are earned on the
Group’s cash resources.
With approximately 95% of Group revenues earned in US dollars and
approximately 45% of Group costs being incurred in US dollars, the
Group has a significant exposure to movements in the exchange rate
between the US dollar and sterling. This exposure is partially mitigated
by an ongoing hedging programme, involving forward contracts and
low-risk option contracts where appropriate. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
In line with the guidance for the preparation of an operating and
financial review, certain risk factors faced by the Group are identified
below. A more detailed description is included in the Group's annual
report on Form 20-F. Details of the Group's internal control and risk
management procedures are included in the corporate governance
report on pages 18 to 20.
ARM’s quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and be
unpredictable which could adversely affect the market price 
of ARM ordinary shares
ARM has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant
quarterly fluctuations in its results of operations. Quarterly results may
fluctuate because of a variety of factors. Such factors include: 
— the timing of entering into agreements with new licensees;
— the mixture of licence fees, royalties, revenues from the sale 
of development systems and fees from services;
— the introduction of new technology by us, our licensees or our
competition;
— the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems companies 
of ARM technology-based microprocessors from our semiconductor
Partners;
— sudden technological or other changes in the microprocessor
industry; and
— new litigation or developments in current litigation. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 15
In future periods, ARM’s operating results may not meet the
expectations of public market analysts or investors. In such an event
the market price of our shares could be materially adversely affected. 
General economic conditions may reduce ARM’s revenues and
harm ARM’s business
ARM is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global
economic conditions. Because of economic uncertainties in many of 
our key markets, many industries may delay or reduce technology
purchases and investments. The impact of this on ARM is difficult to
predict, but if businesses defer licensing our technology, require less
services or development tools, or if consumers defer purchases of 
new products which incorporate ARM’s technology, revenue could
decline. A decline in revenue would have an adverse effect on the
results of operations and could have an adverse effect on ARM’s
financial condition. 
ARM competes in the intensely competitive semiconductor market
The semiconductor market is intensely competitive and characterised
by rapid technological change. ARM cannot give assurance that it will
have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing or
support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. 
Competition is based on a variety of factors including price,
performance, product quality, software availability, marketing and
distribution capability, customer support, name recognition and
financial strength. Further, given ARM’s reliance on our semiconductor
Partners, its competitive position is dependent on their competitive
position. In addition, ARM’s semiconductor Partners do not license
ARM’s architecture exclusively, and several of them also design,
develop, manufacture and market microprocessors based on their 
own architectures or on other non-ARM architectures. 
ARM may not develop or operate systems which comply fully with
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Preparations for attestation under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act as at 31 December 2006 are relatively well-advanced. There can
be no guarantee, however, that the detailed testing of internal controls
required as part of the attestation process will not identify significant
control deficiencies or material weaknesses that impact on the
auditors’ opinion on internal controls over financial reporting and/or
require disclosure on Form 20-F.
Other risks include ARM's inability to manage the significant changes 
in the number of its employees and the size of its operations in the
United States, dependence on semiconductor Partners and systems
companies, availability of development tools, systems software and
operating systems compatible with ARM’s architecture, dependence on
a small number of customers and products, ARM’s inability to develop
new products on a timely basis, unanticipated costs due to products
that could have technical difficulties or undetected design errors, the
ARM architecture not being continued to be accepted by the market,
risks associated with any strategic investments or acquisitions,
dependence on senior management personnel and on hiring and
retaining qualified engineers, exposure from international operations,
litigation and threats of litigation and protection of ARM’s intellectual
property, unavailability of debt financing or additional equity funding to
satisfy future capital needs, adverse affects resulting from changes in
stock option accounting rules adversely impacting ARM’s reported
operating results and its competitiveness in the marketplace.

United Kingdom Compliance with the Combined Code
The Group complies and complied throughout 2005 with the Combined
Code, with the exception only that the board does not comprise a
majority of independent non-executive directors. The board has considered
the overall balance between executive and non-executive directors and
believes that the number of executive directors is fully justified by the
contribution made by each of them. To increase the size of the board
further to meet this particular provision is not considered appropriate.
Composition and operation of the board
The board currently comprises six executive directors, six independent
non-executive directors, one other non-executive director and the
Chairman. The executive directors are the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Technology
Officer, the Executive Vice President, Marketing and the Executive Vice
President, Worldwide Sales, all of whom play significant roles in the
day-to-day management of the business. Six of the non-executive
directors are regarded by the board to be independent in character 
and judgement based on both participation and performance at board
and committee meetings. There are no relationships or circumstances
which are likely to affect the judgement of any of them. Mark
Templeton relinquished his executive role in October 2005 and remains
on the board as a non-executive director. The non-executive directors
provide a blend of experience and considerable knowledge to the
board’s deliberations. Peter Cawdron, who is the Senior Independent
Director and the financial expert, has extensive knowledge of UK public
group issues and a strong financial background. Doug Dunn and Jeremy
Scudamore both have experience of running large companies in 
allied industries. Lucio Lanza and John Scarisbrick both have a broad
understanding of the Group’s technology and the practices of major US-
based technology companies. The share options held by Lucio Lanza
were granted prior to the Group’s acquisition of Artisan and no further
options have been or will be granted to him since he joined the ARM
board. Philip Rowley has a strong financial background and knowledge
of internet technologies and e-commerce.
The board had seven scheduled meetings during 2005 each of which
was attended by all the directors, with the following exceptions:
January – Mike Muller and John Scarisbrick
May and November – Peter Cawdron
July – Tudor Brown
December – Mike Inglis and Simon Segars
There is a procedure in place for additional meetings or conference calls
on any pertinent issues to be organised as necessary during the year. 
In addition, the Chairman held two meetings with the non-executive
directors without the executives present and the non-executive
directors met on one occasion without the Chairman being present. 
The board is responsible for setting the Company’s strategic aims and
ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place
for it to meet its objectives. The board has a formal schedule of matters
reserved for its decision, which includes the approval of major business
matters, policies, operating and capital expenditure budgets, and
ensuring high standards of corporate governance are maintained. 
The board is also responsible for sanctioning unusual commercial
arrangements such as atypical licence agreements and investments. 
Before each meeting, the board is furnished with information in a form
and of a quality appropriate for it to discharge its duties concerning the
state of the business and its performance. The ultimate responsibility 
for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts and the
quarterly reports, and for ensuring that they present a balanced
assessment of the Group’s position, lies with the board. The board
delegates day-to-day responsibility for managing the Group to the
executive committee and has a number of other committees, details 
of which are set out below.
During 2005 the formal board evaluation undertaken during 2004, with
the assistance of external consultants, was reviewed and updated with
assistance from the Company Secretary. This review covered board
performance, processes, committees, composition, skills and director
induction. The overall conclusion was that the board works well and its
committees operate properly and efficiently. Various recommendations
resulted from the evaluation which will be reviewed and acted upon 
by the board in 2006, as appropriate. It is intended that there will be 
a further review and update by the board each year with probable
involvement of external consultants every three years. The Group has 
a commitment to training and all directors are encouraged to attend
suitable training courses. During 2005 the executive directors attended
anti-trust and sexual harassment training courses. A full, formal
induction programme is arranged for all new directors, tailored to their
specific requirements, the aim of which is to introduce them to key
executives across the business and to enhance their knowledge and
understanding of the Group and its activities. 
The main channel of communication with shareholders continues to 
be through the CEO, the CFO and the VP Investor Relations, although 
the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and other non-executive
directors remain willing to engage in dialogue with major shareholders
at any time.
The board has adopted guidelines for individual directors to obtain
independent professional advice at the Group's expense in appropriate
circumstances and all members of the board have access to the advice
of the Company Secretary. 
Executive committee
The executive committee is responsible for implementing the strategy
approved by the board. Among other things, this committee is
responsible for approval of standard licence agreements, ensuring that
the Group’s budget and forecasts are properly prepared, that targets are
met, and generally managing and developing the business within the
overall budget. Variations from the budget and changes in strategy
require approval from the main board of the Group. The executive
committee, which meets monthly, comprises the executive directors
(excluding the Chairman) and the directors of ARM Limited and
meetings are attended by the Company Secretary and other senior
operational personnel, as appropriate.
Audit committee 
The audit committee has written terms of reference which are
published on the corporate website at www.arm.com. The committee
has responsibility for, among other things, monitoring the integrity 
of the financial statements of the Company and any formal
announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance, and
18 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Corporate governance/UK reporting
  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 19
for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained
in them; reviewing the Company’s internal controls and risk
management systems; making recommendations to the board in
relation to the appointment, remuneration and resignation or dismissal
of the Group’s external auditors; reviewing and monitoring the external
auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the
audit process; developing and implementing policy on the engagement
of the external auditors to supply non-audit services; and considering
compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards, the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The committee also keeps under review the value for money of the
audit and the nature, extent and cost-effectiveness of the non-audit
services provided by the auditors. The committee has discussed with
the external auditors their independence, and has received and
reviewed written disclosures from the external auditors as required by
the Auditing Practices Board’s International Standard on Auditing (ISA)
(UK and Ireland) 260 “Communication of audit matters with those
charged with governance”, as well as those required by the US
Independence Standards Board’s Standard No. 1, “Independence
discussions with audit committees”. To avoid the possibility of the
auditors’ objectivity and independence being compromised, the Group’s
tax consulting work is carried out by the auditors only in cases where
they are best suited to perform the work. In other cases, the Group 
has engaged another independent firm of accountants to perform tax
consulting work. The Group does not normally award general consulting
work to the auditors. From time to time, however, the Group will
engage the auditors to perform work on matters relating to human
resources and royalty audits. The Group may also seek professional
advice from another firm of independent consultants or its legal advisers.
The current audit committee comprises Peter Cawdron (Chairman), Doug
Dunn, John Scarisbrick, Jeremy Scudamore, Philip Rowley, who joined the
committee on his appointment as a director on 4 January 2005 and
Lucio Lanza who joined the committee on 16 February 2006. Peter
Cawdron is the financial expert as defined in the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002
and Philip Rowley is also qualified to fulfil this role. The committee met on
two occasions during 2005 with all members present, with the exception
of John Scarisbrick for the January meeting. The external auditors, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary attend
all meetings in order to ensure that the information required by the
audit committee for it to operate effectively is available. Representatives
of the Group’s external auditors meet with the audit committee at least
once a year without any executive directors being present.
Remuneration committee
A description of the composition, responsibility and operation of the
remuneration committee is set out in the remuneration report on page
25. The terms of reference of the remuneration committee are
published on the Group’s website www.arm.com
Nomination committee
The nomination committee leads the process for board appointments
and makes recommendations to the board in relation to new
appointments of executive and non-executive directors and on board
composition and balance. It is chaired by Sir Robin Saxby, and the other
members are Peter Cawdron, Doug Dunn, John Scarisbrick and Lucio
Lanza. The nomination committee met on two occasions with all
members present, with the exception of Peter Cawdron for the
November meeting. The Committee considers the roles and capabilities
required for each new appointment, based on an evaluation of the
skills and experience of the existing directors. In relation to the
appointment of new directors, including Philip Rowley in January 2005,
the services of external search consultancies are generally used. The
terms of reference of the nomination committee are published on the
Group’s website www.arm.com.
Internal control/risk management 
The board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group maintains an adequate system of internal control and risk
management and for reviewing its effectiveness. The board has
reviewed the system of internal control, including internal financial
controls, which has been in place for the year under review and up to
the date of approval of the annual report. Such systems are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risks inherent in a fast-moving, high-
technology business and can, therefore, provide only reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Company’s risk review committee consists of the Chief Technology
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Financial Controller and the
Company Secretary. The committee receives and reviews quarterly
reports from business unit managers and corporate functions and its
findings are considered and challenged by the executive committee.
The committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating risks which
may impact the Group’s strategic and business objectives and for
monitoring the progress of actions designed to mitigate such risks. 
The risk review committee reports formally to the executive committee
once a year and, in turn, the executive committee reports to the board
once a year. In addition, during 2005, the Company set up a compliance
committee consisting of the General Counsel, the Chief Operating
Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the EVP Worldwide Sales, the EVP
Human Resources, the Director of Quality, the Director of IT and the
Company Secretary. The committee oversees compliance throughout 
the business with all appropriate international regulations, trading
requirements and standards, including oversight of financial,
employment, environmental and security processes and policies.
The Company appointed a disclosure committee in 2003, in compliance
with the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002. The committee, which comprises the
Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Financial Controller,
the General Counsel, the VP Investor Relations and the Company Secretary,
is responsible for ensuring that disclosures made by the Company to its
shareholders and the investment community are accurate, complete and
fairly present the Company’s financial condition in all material respects.
In addition, there is a series of interconnected meetings that span the
Group from the weekly management meeting chaired by the Chief
Executive Officer, and the weekly business review meeting chaired by
the Chief Operating Officer, the purpose of which is to monitor and
control all main business activities, sales forecasts and other matters
requiring approval that have arisen within the week, to the board
meetings of the Group. Each month there are customer satisfaction and
process review meetings attended by managers representing different
functions across the Group to review key performance indicators such
as revenues, orders booked, costs, product and project delivery dates and levels of defects found in products in development. The outputs 
of the weekly business review meeting and the monthly operations
meeting are reviewed by the executive committee which, in turn,
raises relevant issues with the board. These processes for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant business, operational, financial,
compliance and other risks facing the Group have been in place for the
year under review and up to the date of approval of the annual report
and financial statements. They accord with the guidance on internal
control issued in September 1999 by the Internal Control Working Party
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
As required by the Combined Code, the audit committee has considered
whether it would be appropriate for the Group to have its own financial
internal audit function and has concluded that, taking account of its
relatively small number of employees and a high degree of centralisation
in the way the business is run, this is not appropriate at present. 
The committee has confirmed this view to the board. The Group does,
however, have an operational internal audit function that audits the
Group’s business and product/project management processes. These
processes are documented, maintained and continuously improved, for
effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, they are audited externally by
independent auditors for compliance with ISO 9001:2000.
Corporate social and ethical policies
While the Group is accountable to its shareholders, it also endeavours 
to take into account the interests of all its stakeholders, including its
employees, customers and suppliers and the local communities and
environments in which it operates. The Chief Financial Officer takes
responsibility for matters relating to corporate, social and ethical policies
and these matters are considered at board level. A corporate social
responsibility report is on pages 21 to 22 of this report and also on the
Group’s website www.arm.com. The Company’s Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics is available on the Group's website www.arm.com.
The Group also operates a whistle-blowing policy which provides for
employees to have access to senior management to raise concerns in
strict confidence about any unethical business practices.
As a company whose primary business is the licensing of IP , employees
are highly valued and their rights and dignity are respected. The Group
strives for equal opportunities for all its employees and does not tolerate
any harassment of, or discrimination against, its staff. In 2003 ARM was
named Employer of the Year in the UK National Business Awards. The
Group also endeavours to be honest and fair in its relationships with its
customers and suppliers and to be a good corporate citizen respecting
the laws of the countries in which it operates.
Environmental policies
The Group’s premises are composed entirely of offices since it has no
manufacturing activities. Staff make use of computer-aided design tools
to generate IP . This involves neither hazardous substances nor complex
waste emissions. With the exception of Development Systems products,
the majority of “products” sold by the Group comprise microprocessor
core designs that are delivered electronically to customers. 
The Group recognises the increasing importance of environmental issues
and these are discussed at board level where the Chief Financial Officer
takes responsibility for them. The Group’s environmental policy is
published on its website. An environmental action plan is implemented
through various initiatives. These include monitoring resource
consumption and waste creation so that targets set for improvement are
realistic and meaningful, ensuring existing controls continue to operate
satisfactorily and working with suppliers to improve environmental
management along supply chains. Energy usage and resource
consumption data is published in the Group’s corporate social
responsibility report on its website.
Health and safety
Although ARM operates in an industry and in environments which are
considered low risk from a health and safety perspective, the safety of
employees, contractors and visitors is a priority in all ARM workplaces
worldwide. Continual improvement in safety management systems is
achieved through detailed risk assessments to identify and eliminate
potential hazards and occupational health assessments for employees.
The UK offices are covered by a health and safety committee, fire
wardens and first aiders. Each year the GoodCorporation verification
ensures that the criteria in its charter are met. The UK offices are also
audited by the British Safety Council, and the Company achieved three
stars in the 2004 audit. Other offices around the world have similar
cover dependent on local needs, practices and customs and operate 
to a global health and safety policy standard. 
Relationships with shareholders
The board makes considerable efforts to establish and maintain good
relationships with institutional shareholders. The Group has a regular
dialogue with institutional shareholders throughout the year other than
during close periods. The board also encourages communication with
private investors and part of the Group’s website is dedicated to
providing accurate and timely information for all investors including
comprehensive information about the business, its Partners and products,
including all press releases. A new role of VP Investor Relations was
created in July 2005. At present, around 20 analysts write research
reports on the Group. The Group publishes telephone numbers on its
website enabling shareholders to listen to earnings presentations and
audio conference calls with analysts. Members of the board, including
some of the non-executive directors attend the annual analysts’ day
and develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders
through any direct contact that may be initiated by shareholders or
through analysts' and brokers' briefings and feedback from the Group's
financial PR advisers who obtain feedback from analysts and brokers
following investor roadshows. All shareholders may register to receive
the Group’s press releases via the internet.
The board actively encourages participation at the Annual General
Meeting, scheduled for 25 April 2006, which is the principal forum for
dialogue with private shareholders. A presentation will be made outlining
recent developments in the business and an open question-and-answer
session will follow to enable shareholders to ask questions about the
business in general.

20 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Corporate governance/UK reporting/continued ARM considers itself to be a good corporate citizen. The Group strives 
to reduce the impact it makes on the environment and to increase its
connections with the communities in which it operates. Considerable
efforts are made to communicate effectively with the Group’s
shareholders, partners, suppliers and employees.
The Group is a corporate member of the Institute of Business Ethics
(IBE) and was one of the first members of the GoodCorporation, which
was founded in 2001 to help organisations to develop, manage and
monitor their corporate responsibilities. Based on principles set out by
the IBE, the GoodCorporation charter enables companies to measure
how effective they are in achieving these responsibilities. ARM’s
commitment to the charter includes being verified against a 62-point
charter standard covering the fair treatment and protection of its
employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, the community and the
environment. This independent verification process is repeated each
year and, during 2005, the Group successfully retained its membership.
In addition, ARM is listed on the FTSE4Good Index, is a member of
Business in the Community and takes part in its Business in the
Environment Index and Corporate Responsibility Index each year.
The environment 
The Group’s business focuses on designing IP which enables devices 
to use less power and, as a result, to be more environmentally friendly.
Its activities do not produce harmful waste or emissions and the Ethical
Investment Research Service (EIRIS) grades ARM as an environmentally
“low impact” business. Nevertheless, environmental performance is
monitored to enable targets to be set, for example reducing paper
usage (and increasing the amount recycled) and controlling carbon
emissions through energy use. 
A document output study has been established to examine paper
consumption within the Group and to consider how an extension of its
electronic document management systems might reduce the need for
paper documents. The Group can also demonstrate an increase in paper
and packaging recycling and an improvement in the facilities in place to
promote recycling of more materials. Energy usage is monitored closely
to understand how it is used, which aids the setting of new targets.
Renewable energy sources are also being investigated. There are
recycling bins for aluminium cans in the majority of the Group’s offices
and air conditioning systems run on non-ozone-depleting refrigerants.
The supply of company cars is discouraged and in a Group of over 1,300
people, there are less than 30 company cars. There is a sustainable
transport team within the business looking at ways in which the impact
on the environment can be reduced. Initiatives introduced so far include
encouraging employees to cycle to work through the provision of
improved facilities at the Group’s offices, or to share car journeys, or
use public transport. Business travel and ways in which it can be
reduced are measured, while still maintaining ARM’s very effective
partnership network, particularly through the provision of video
conferencing equipment. The Group will continue to work closely with
the British Safety Council in 2006 to establish ways to formalise our
environmental objectives and performance as well as implementing
recommendations made through working with The Carbon Trust.
Connecting with local communities 
The Group aims to be a good corporate citizen of the communities in
which it operates and supports local initiatives and fundraising. In the
UK, the focus has been on educational projects – particularly for pupils
who are interested in mathematics, science, IT and business subjects.
This support is sometimes financial and sometimes in the form of
providing employees’ time and skills. ARM has established relationships
with the local business community and is a founding member of The
Learning Collaboration (TLC) within the Cambridge business community
in the UK. The TLC enables member companies to pool resources to
collaborate to learn, improving the quality, availability and value of
training and related services. 
Supporting education
ARM’s support for education stretches from financial sponsorship 
of science/IT-related education initiatives, donations of redundant
computer equipment to schools and education charities, working on
extra-curricular engineering projects with school and college students in
the Cambridge area and working on specific projects with students at
the Judge Institute, Cambridge University’s business school. The Group
supports the Engineering Education Scheme, Young Engineers and
contributes to the funding to train the UK team for the International
Maths Olympics. ARM’s University Programme engages universities
worldwide, designing course material, providing technical seminars,
donating equipment and software and offering assistance directly to
students. ARM has worked with a number of engineering schools
internationally, including Seoul National University, Carnegie-Mellon
(US), Southeast University (China), and the National Institute of
Technology Karnataka (India). In addition, the Group has relationships
with a number of UK universities. The Chairman, for example, is a
visiting professor at Liverpool University. 
Supporting good causes
ARM encourages employees to support their local communities. Some
are school governors, some help children improve their reading skills,
others support charities. Employees at the Group’s Austin, Texas office
have, for example, helped with blood drives and have also collected
food and toys for underprivileged families. The Group “doubles the
efforts” of employees who raise money for approved charities by
matching the funds they raise (with the exception of political donations
or other non-approved causes). Charities for cancer research, conservation,
to support sufferers of heart disease and those with autism or terminal
illness have been some of the beneficiaries of this scheme. In 2005,
ARM matched donations made by employees to the leading national
charities supporting those affected by the Asian tsunami. 
In 2005 ARM continued as a sponsor of the Prince’s Trust Technology
Leadership Group and has participated in events targeted at widening
the knowledge and understanding of technology and contributed
expertise to the technology networking events.
Connecting with employees
ARM’s aim is to attract and retain the best people available by being 
a good and ethical employer. The skills, knowledge and motivation 
of employees are crucial to ARM’s success. The Group promotes and
supports individuals and teams through on-the-job and formal training,
coaching and mentoring. Every effort is made to keep employees well
informed about the Company and matters that affect them. This is done
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 21
Corporate social responsibility/UK reporting through both formal and informal communications methods across all
offices worldwide. The Group also carries out a regular, comprehensive,
global opinion survey to monitor employee views and to provide
valuable input on how the Company operates. The Employee Assistance
Programme helps staff and their families with issues such as care for
children or elderly relatives, legal and health advice, and stress or other
counselling. 
Equal opportunities
The Group needs highly-qualified staff and does not see age, colour,
disability, ethnic origin, gender, political or other opinion, religion or
sexual orientation as a barrier to employment. If any member of staff
becomes disabled, their needs and abilities are assessed with a view to
them continuing in their current role. If this is impossible, every effort is
made to offer them alternative employment.
Benefits
Employees receive benefits including private medical/healthcare;
health, travel and life insurance; pensions/401k plan; sabbaticals;
flexible working; stock options and a Save As You Earn share scheme.
The Group supports family friendly initiatives and offers a child care
voucher scheme for UK tax payers. Flexible working arrangements are
available for all employees, regardless of whether they have children.
Understanding and acceptance of national and cultural diversity is
encouraged by giving employees the opportunity to work in offices
other than in their home country, where appropriate.
Accessibility
The Group endeavours to provide access to all whether through building
design to allow easy disabled access or through improving access to our
website for those with visual impairments.
Health and safety
The safety of employees, contractors and visitors is a priority. ARM
measures and analyses all accidents and “near misses” as part of its
continuous improvement in this area. Despite the low-risk nature of its
operations ARM aims to provide a safe, secure and sustainable working
environment to all employees and stakeholders. The Group is verified
by GoodCorporation each year to ensure that its health and safety
requirements are met and in addition its UK offices are audited by the
British Safety Council. In the UK, there is a health and safety committee
and each office has fire wardens and first aiders. Overseas offices have
the health and safety cover required by local legislation. Health and
safety is high on the agenda and there has been an increase in the
amount of communication with employees on occupational health
issues and other health and safety issues through different media
including the intranet. During 2005 health and safety training has been
provided to line managers to assist in the development of a safety
culture within the organisation.
22 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Corporate social responsibility/UK reporting/continued The directors present their annual report and audited financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Principal activities and review of business
The principal activities of the Group and its subsidiaries are the
licensing, marketing, research and development of RISC-based
microprocessors and systems. The nature of the global semiconductor
industry is such that most of its business is conducted overseas and, 
to serve its customers better, the Group has sales offices around the
world. These include six offices in the US and offices in Shanghai and
Beijing, PR China; Shin-Yokohama, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Taipei,
Taiwan; Kfar Saba, Israel; Paris, France; Munich, Germany; and
Bangalore, India. Design offices are based in Cambridge, Maidenhead,
Sheffield and Blackburn, UK; Sophia Antipolis, France; Leuven, Belgium;
Aachen and Munich, Germany; Austin, Texas and Sunnyvale, California
in the US; and Bangalore, India. More information about the business is
set out in the Chairman’s statement on pages 4 to 5, the Chief
Executive Officer’s review on pages 6 to 9, and the operating and
financial review on pages 10 to 15.
Future developments 
The Group’s stated objective is to establish a global standard for RISC
architecture and physical IP for the embedded microprocessor market.
The directors believe that to achieve this goal it is important to expand
the number and range of potential customers for its technology. The
Group intends to enter into licence agreements with new customers
and to increase the range of new technology supplied to existing
customers. Relationships will continue to be established with third-party
tools and software vendors to ensure that their products will operate
with the ARM architecture. As a result of its position as an emerging
standard in its industry, the Group is presented with many opportunities
to acquire complementary technology or resources. It continues to
review these opportunities and in October 2005, the Group acquired
Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc., independent providers 
of software development tools for the microcontroller market. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they
have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.
Dividends
The directors recommend a final dividend in respect of the year to 
31 December 2005 of 0.5 pence per share which, subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2006, will be paid on 
5 May 2006 to shareholders on the register at 31 March 2006. This 
final dividend, combined with the interim dividend of 0.34 pence 
per share paid during the year, makes a total of 0.84 pence per share
for the year (2004: 0.7 pence).
Research and development (R&D)
R&D is of major importance and, as part of its research activities, the
Group collaborates closely with universities worldwide. Key areas of
product development for 2006 include the development of further low-
power, high-performance engines for both data and control applications,
such as the OptimoDE technology and ARM cores based on symmetric
multiprocessor and superscalar technology. The Group is investing in
future physical IP development, including the Advantage and Metro
physical IP libraries, to ensure technology leadership in this market. In
addition, the Group will develop highly integrated software solutions
with the processor IP such as the TrustZone and Intelligent Energy
Management (IEM) technologies.
The Group incurred R&D expenses of £80.3 million in 2005,
representing 35% of revenues, compared with £54.7 million in 2004.
All R&D expenses have been charged to the income statement. 
Donations
During the year the Group made donations for charitable purposes 
of £65,795 (2004: £33,327). The total amounts given for each such
purpose were:
Local Cambridge charities £2,814
Promotion of education £21,199
Wider understanding of science, 
maths and information technology £19,100
Medical research £2,100
Relief of poverty £9,488
Other £11,094
The Group does not make any political donations. ARM employees are
encouraged to offer their time and expertise to help charities and other
groups in need. The Group operates a gift matching system for
employee fundraising.

Directors’ report/UK reporting Directors’ shareholdings in the Company
The interests of the directors in the Company’s ordinary shares of 
0.05 pence, all of which were beneficially held, are disclosed in the
remuneration report on page 28.
Substantial shareholdings
The directors are aware of the following substantial interests in the
issued share capital of the Company as at 24 February 2006:
Percentage of issued
ordinary share capital
Fidelity Investments 14.7%
Capital Group Companies 10.2%
Janus Capital Corporation 3.9%
Legal and General Investment Management 3.6%
American Century Investments 3.5%
Save for the above, the Company has not been notified, as at 
24 February 2006, of any material interest of 3% or more or any 
non-material interest exceeding 10% of the issued share capital of 
the Company.
Disabled persons
The Group has a strong demand for highly-qualified staff and, as such,
disability is not seen to be an inhibitor to employment or career
development. In the event of any staff becoming disabled while with
the Group, their needs and abilities would be assessed and the Group
would, where possible, seek to offer alternative employment to them 
if they were no longer able to continue in their current role. 
Employee involvement
As the Group is an IP enterprise, it is vital that all levels of staff are
consulted and involved in its decision-making processes. To this end,
internal conferences and communications meetings are held regularly
which involve employees from all parts of the Group in discussions 
on future strategy and developments. Furthermore, employee share
ownership is encouraged and all staff are able to participate in one of
the Group’s schemes to encourage share ownership. The Group has an
informal and delegated organisational structure. It does not presently
operate any collective agreements with any trade unions.
Policy on payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to pay suppliers before the end of the month
following receipt of the invoice, unless terms have been specifically
agreed in advance. This policy and any specific terms agreed with
suppliers are made known to the appropriate staff and to suppliers on
request. Trade creditors of the Group at 31 December 2005 were
equivalent to 11 days’ purchases for the Group (2004: 26 days’) and nil
days for the Company in both years. 
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The AGM will be held at the Grange City Hotel, 8-14 Cooper’s Row,
London EC3N 2BQ, UK, on 25 April 2006 at 2pm. A presentation will 
be made at this meeting outlining recent developments in the business.
The Group will convey the results of proxy votes cast at the AGM.
Shareholders are invited to submit written questions in advance of the
meeting. Questions should be sent to The Secretary, ARM Holdings plc,
110 Fulbourn Road, Cambridge CB1 9NJ.
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the
Group will be proposed at the AGM. Details of other resolutions to be
proposed at the meeting are set out in the circular which will be sent to
all shareholders together with the notice of AGM and proxy card.

Directors’ report/UK reporting/continued Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee has responsibility for determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Group’s policy
for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors including basic salary and
annual bonuses, the level and terms of grants of options and awards and the terms of any performance conditions to apply to the exercise of such
rights, pension rights and any compensation payments. Where the remuneration committee considers it appropriate, the committee will make
recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management. The committee also liaises with the board in relation to the preparation
of the board’s annual report to shareholders on the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors’
remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 1985 (as amended), the Combined Code and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority. 
The committee is chaired by Doug Dunn, and Peter Cawdron, John Scarisbrick and Jeremy Scudamore are members. The committee met five times
during 2005 and all meetings were attended by all the committee members, with the exception of the January meeting when John Scarisbrick was
unable to attend. Given their diverse experience, the four independent non-executive directors are able to offer a balanced view with respect to
remuneration issues for the Group. The committee has access to professional advice from external advisers, generally appointed by the Executive
Vice President, Human Resources, in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice. During 2005, KPMG, Linklaters, Watson Wyatt,
Deloitte & Touche and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, have provided advice or services to the committee. KPMG provided advice
on the new executive compensation framework, Linklaters provided legal services and Watson Wyatt provided pension advice to the Group during
this period. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Human Resources, normally attend for part of the remuneration
committee meetings. No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
During 2005 the committee undertook an extensive review of the pay and incentive structures for senior executives and has proposed some key
changes for executive directors which are outlined below and are described in more detail in a circular which was sent to shareholders in March
2006 and is available on the corporate website at www.arm.com. The key changes proposed are:
l New Deferred Annual Bonus Plan: the maximum bonus opportunity is to be increased from 100% under the current deferred bonus plan 
to 125% of base salary with compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up 
to 2:1 measured against an EPS performance condition;
l Long Term Incentive Plan: it is proposed that the comparator group for the TSR performance measure be changed from the FTSE 250 to the 
FTSE 350 to better reflect the Company’s position within the index; and
l Employee Equity Plan: it is proposed to cease granting options to all employees including executive directors (other than in exceptional
circumstances) and introduce an all-employee share plan.
Details of the new proposals were sent to larger shareholders and other interested parties in October 2005 and a period of consultation has
followed. The committee believes that these proposals reflect good governance, bring the remuneration structure closer in line with UK market
norms, increase alignment between remuneration and financial performance and strengthen the retention aspect of the deferred bonus. The 
move away from options to shares for all employees will reduce dilution and the move from three plans to two for executive directors 
simplifies arrangements.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration committee in its deliberations on the remuneration policy for the Group’s directors seeks to give full consideration to the
principles set out in the Combined Code. The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an 
ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the high-quality
management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders. This policy seeks 
to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the
Group. These comprise a mix of performance-related and non-performance-related remuneration. The committee believes that a director’s total
remuneration should seek to recognise his worth in the external market and, to this end, operates a policy of paying base salaries which are in line
with the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which is upper quartile. The committee believes that this is justified, recognising
that more than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related. The committee obtains information about the external market 
from various surveys, including the Watson Wyatt High Technology and Executive Reward Surveys and the Deloitte & Touche Executive Directors
Remuneration Survey.
The nature of the Group’s development has meant that there has been a good deal of focus on the attainment of short-term objectives with a 
high level of variable remuneration. In 2005, variable remuneration consisted of three elements: annual cash bonus, discretionary share options and
conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan. As described above, subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, this will reduce to two elements
in future, both of which are performance-related and, as a result, more than half of each executive director’s remuneration is targeted to be
performance linked. In 2003 a shareholding guideline was introduced under which executive directors and certain senior managers are required to
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 25
Remuneration report/UK reporting build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years. The shareholdings may be built up of shares received under the Company’s
discretionary share option schemes and/or the Long Term Incentive Plan and/or the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive
directors, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements
The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group. There is a strong
bonus element to executive directors’ remuneration and for 2005 a bonus of up to 50% of basic pay could have been earned through the executive
bonus plan if all targets were met (plus an accelerator for performance in excess of targets and the ability to increase the bonus to 100% by
deferring the entire bonus for three years). Payment of bonus is subject to the achievement of revenue and profit targets set by the remuneration
committee, which are directly related to the Group’s financial results and ensure that the Group’s short-term financial goals are met. Small bonuses
are payable to executive directors in respect of performance during 2005, as shown in the table on page 33.
Proposed new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan
Subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan will operate for 2006 under which 50% of any bonus earned will be
paid in cash and 50% will be deferred into shares on a compulsory basis. Voluntary deferral will no longer be possible. Due to these changes and
the fact that no further grants of options will be made (except in exceptional circumstances) the maximum bonus opportunity will increase to 125%
of base salary (including a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25), which is in line with current market bonus
levels. The bonus earned will continue to be subject to a revenue target with an EPS underpin but the calibration will be changed. Under the 2005
bonus arrangement no bonus was payable at less than 90% of the revenue target and maximum bonus would have been paid at 100% of the
revenue target with a 1% increase in bonus for every 2% above the revenue target. Under the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan no bonus is paid
at less than 90% of the revenue target and maximum bonus will now be paid at revenues above the target. In 2006 maximum bonus will be paid
at 104% of target revenues. The upper limit of the performance range will not exceed 110% of the target revenue. At the end of the three-year
deferral period the deferred shares will be matched subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition. At EPS growth equal to the increase
in the Consumer Prices Index (“CPI”) plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth 
is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum. While the deferral can only be forfeited for gross misconduct, the match is subject to forfeiture for 
“bad leavers”.
Proposed new Employee Equity Plan
Subject to approval at the 2006 AGM, the new Employee Equity Plan will operate for 2006, in place of the existing Employee Share Option
Schemes. The introduction of this plan reflects the shift in market practice away from options and towards free shares. However, to enable the
Group to respond to any future changes in market conditions, it is proposed that this plan provides the flexibility to grant either shares or options,
with a “currency conversion” between the two to ensure that awards are of a similar value to employees and a similar cost to the Company. Under
this plan it is intended that free shares or options will be granted to employees on an annual basis up to a limit set for each grade and equivalent
to grant values under the existing Executive Share Option Scheme. In the three major employing countries and other countries as may be
appropriate, the new Employee Equity Plan may involve the use of government approved plans to deliver awards in a tax efficient manner. 
Existing option schemes
It is intended that the grant of options under the existing share option schemes will cease once the new Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and the new
Employee Equity Plan are approved by shareholders. In relation to existing grants of options, in line with practice among the Group’s peers in the
technology sector, there are generally no performance conditions attached to the issue or exercise of discretionary options under the existing
schemes, except for those issued to executive directors where performance conditions based on real EPS growth apply. Share options issued to
executive directors prior to their appointment to the board of the Group do not have performance conditions attached to them. However,
discretionary options issued to executive directors after their appointment to the board of the Group have performance conditions attached to them.
Executive directors have not received options under the Approved Scheme and the Incentive Stock Option Scheme. Under the Unapproved Scheme,
share options with a value of up to five times base salary may be issued on the executive director joining the Group. In addition, discretionary
options with a value of up to two times base salary may be issued each year. These discretionary options will vest after seven years, but may vest
after three years from grant if the performance conditions are satisfied. 
Performance conditions applicable to these options vary depending on the year of grant and details of these conditions are shown in the auditable
information below.
The performance conditions applicable to the Long Term Incentive Plan are described in more detail below and are based on total shareholder
return (“TSR”), providing the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
26 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Remuneration report/UK reporting/continued These performance conditions were selected having regard to the position of the Group within its sector and the nature of the companies against
which it competes to attract and retain high calibre employees. The Committee believes that the performance conditions represent the correct
balance between being motivational and challenging.
Pensions
The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For the UK based directors, the rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executive’s basic salary (25% in the case of the Chairman) subject to the
Inland Revenue salary capping limits. From April 2006 when the salary capping limits cease to apply, contributions will be calculated on full basic
pay. For Mark Templeton (who is based in the US), the rate of Group contribution was 6% of his basic salary up to October 2005 when his status
changed from executive to non-executive director.
Service agreements
Executive directors have “rolling” service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one year’s notice. The service contracts also terminate
when executive directors reach age 65. With the exception of the Chairman, these agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services
to the Group on a full-time basis. The agreements contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of
employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Group’s customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the 
Group’s suppliers and employees. In addition, each service agreement contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Group’s
trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the 
course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows:
Director Date
Sir Robin Saxby 31 January 1996
Warren East 29 January 2001
Tim Score 1 March 2002
Tudor Brown 3 April 1996
Mike Inglis 17 July 2002
Mike Muller 31 January 1996
Simon Segars 4 January 2005
Mark Templeton 18 November 2004
Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion shall be
entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors
During 2005, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of £33,000 per annum and the other non-executive
directors each received a total fee of £30,000 per annum. These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size
and complexity, and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Group’s activities during the year, which
is between 10 to 15 working days a year. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the board and their term of appointment is
three years. Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their
service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits. No element of their fees is performance-related. Share options held by Lucio Lanza
were granted prior to the Group’s acquisition of Artisan and share options held by Mark Templeton were granted prior to his change of status from
executive to non-executive director in October 2005.

A performance graph showing the Company’s TSR together with the TSR for the FTSE All-World Technology Index of 249 companies from 
31 December 2000 is shown below. The TSR has been calculated in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. 
The TSR for the Company’s shares was -76% over this period compared with -42% for the FTSE All-World Technology Index for the same period.
ARM total return performance from 31 December 2000 to 31 December 2005 (£ sterling)
The directors consider the FTSE All-World Technology Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index contains companies from the US, Asia and
Europe and therefore reflects the global environment in which the Group operates. In addition, the Index includes many companies that are
currently the Group’s customers, as well as companies which use ARM technology in their end products.

In addition to the interests disclosed above, all the executive directors (together with all the employees of the Group) are potential beneficiaries 
of the ARM Holdings plc Employee Share Ownership Plan. They are, therefore, treated as interested in all the shares held by this trust, being
5,000,000 ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004. The shares that vested under the Long Term Incentive Plan on 1 February
2006 were transferred from the Trust reducing the number that the executive directors are treated as being interested in to 1,201,438 ordinary
shares. The executive directors also have interests in dividend shares that could be awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the amount of
which will depend on the extent to which the performance criteria are satisfied and the dividends declared during the performance period.

* The performance period for the 2003 LTIP grant ended on 31 December 2005 and as such the actual number of awards vesting is disclosed below.
** Mark Templeton was conditionally awarded 162,794 shares as part of the 2005 LTIP grant, but these lapsed on his change in status from an executive to a non-executive director in October 2005, thus none
were held at 31 December 2005.
Conditional awards will vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year
of award. The performance conditions are based on the Company’s TSR when measured against that of two comparator groups (each testing half of the
shares comprised in the award). The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors (FTSE 250) and the second comprises predominantly US
companies within the Hi Tech sector (FTSE Global Technology Index). For each comparator group, the number of shares that may vest may be 
up to a maximum of 200% of the shares if the Company’s TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% will vest in the event of median performance and
between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis. Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid 
by the Company during the performance period. No shares will be received for below-median performance. In addition, no shares will vest unless
the committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company. For 2006 awards
it is intended that the first comparator group be changed from the FTSE 250 to the FTSE 350 to reflect the Company's position within the index.
The performance conditions applicable to the conditional awards granted on 25 July 2003 were satisfied to the extent of 175.9% plus dividend
shares which vested on 1 February 2006, as follows:

The market value of the shares of the Company as at 31 December 2005 was 121 pence. The closing mid-price ranged from 94.25 pence to 127.75

Deferred bonus plan
The existing deferred bonus plan was introduced in 2001 and enabled directors to double their annual bonus if payment is deferred for three years,
and to receive 6% interest per annum on the deferred element. There are no outstanding arrangements under this plan and, subject to approval of
the new Annual Deferred Bonus Plan at the 2006 AGM, there will be no further operation of this plan. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 33

It is the Company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold non-executive positions at other companies and receive remuneration for their
service. Details of executive’s roles within other companies and their remuneration are as follows:
Mike Inglis is a non-executive director of Superscape Group plc. The Group holds 8.2% of the issued share capital of Superscape Group plc and more
details about this investment are included in note 14 on page 54. In this capacity, Mike Inglis received remuneration totalling £15,000 for the year
to 31 December 2005 (2004: £15,000) and holds options over 20,000 shares in Superscape Group plc at an option price of 33 pence which were
granted on 7 January 2004. The shares will vest in thirds over a three-year period provided that performance targets are met. Tim Score became a
non-executive director of National Express Group plc in February 2005. In this capacity he received remuneration totalling £34,000 for the year to
31 December 2005. Tudor Brown is a non-executive director of ANT Software Limited. In this capacity he received remuneration totalling £20,000
for the year to 31 December 2005. Simon Segars is a non-executive director of Plastic Logic Limited. In this capacity he received remuneration
totalling £10,000 for the year to 31 December 2005. Warren East was appointed a non-executive director of Reciva Limited in 2006.
All the executive directors are accruing benefits under a money purchase pension scheme as a result of their services to the Group, contributions 
for which were all paid during the year.
Doug Dunn OBE Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the Company, and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
l make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statements; and
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue 
in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and Company and for ensuring that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Information published on the internet is accessible in
many countries with different legal requirements. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
34 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Statement of directors’ responsibilities We have audited the Group financial statements of ARM Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of change in shareholders’
equity and the related notes. These Group financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of ARM Holdings plc for the year ended and on the information in the
directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group financial statements
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the Group financial statements, if we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. The other
information comprises only ARM at a glance, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations, the operating and
financial review, directors and advisers, the corporate governance statement, the corporate social responsibility statement, the directors’ report,
the unauditable part of the remuneration report, and the statement of directors’ responsibilities. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and 
l the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

* Own shares held Offset within retained earnings is an amount of £16,315,000 (2004: £7,485,000) representing the cost of own shares held. These
shares are expected to be used in part for the benefit of the Group’s employees and directors to satisfy share option and conditional share awards in
future periods. Own shares held include £1,438,000 (2004: £1,438,000), being the cost of 5,000,000 (2004: 5,000,000) shares in the Company held by
the Group’s ESOP . Own shares held also include £nil (2004: £6,047,000), being the cost of nil (2004: 713,034) shares in the Company held by the
Group’s QUEST. Own shares also include £14,877,000 (2004: £nil), being the cost of treasury stock. Refer to note 23 for further details on the movement
of these balances in 2005.
** Revaluation reserve The Group includes on its balance sheet publicly-traded investments, which are classified as available-for-sale. These are carried at
market value. Unrealised holding gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, within the revaluation reserve. The amounts within
this reserve are undistributable.

Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity/IFRS
For the year ended 31 December 2005 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies
The business of the Group ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies (“ARM” or “the Group”) design reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and power-
efficiency of high-volume embedded applications. The Group licences and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics companies,
which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and application-specific standard processors (ASSP)
based on the Group’s architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products. By creating a network of Partners, and working
with them to best utilise the Group’s technology, the Group is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many high-volume embedded
microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many growing markets, including
smart cards and digital video. The Group also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and provides consulting and support
services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers. The Group’s principal geographic markets are Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled under the laws of England and Wales. The Company was formed 
on 16 October 1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer (UK) Limited and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC
Machines Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc. Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited (incorporated in the UK), ARM Inc. (incorporated in the US), ARM Physical IP Inc. (formerly Artisan Components Inc.,
incorporated in the US), Axys Design Automation Inc. (incorporated in the US), Keil Software Inc. (incorporated in the US, acquired during 2005), 
ARM KK (incorporated in Japan), ARM Korea Limited (incorporated in South Korea), ARM France SAS (incorporated in France), ARM Belgium N.V. (incorporated
in Belgium), ARM Germany GmbH (incorporated in Germany, renamed during 2005), Keil Elektronik GmbH (incorporated in Germany, acquired during 
2005), ARM Embedded Technologies Pvt. Limited. (incorporated in India, renamed during 2005), ARM Physical IP Asia Pacific Pte. Limited (incorporated 
in Singapore, renamed during 2005), ARM Taiwan Limited (incorporated in Taiwan) and ARM Consulting (Shangai) Co., Limited (incorporated in PR China).
Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by
the EU, International Accounting Standards (IAS) and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting
under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and
derivative instruments. 
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the directors to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Significant estimates in the financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, accounting for investments, provisions 
for income taxes, allowance for doubtful debts, impairment of non-current assets, goodwill and purchased intangible assets and contingencies and 
legal settlements.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Intra-group
transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation. All subsidiaries use uniform accounting policies for
like transactions and other events and similar circumstances. 
Business combinations The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are included in the income statement from the date they are acquired. On acquisition,
all of the subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including
any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less impairment losses. In determining the fair
value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of completion, the fair value of share options assumed 
is calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based upon whether the directors believe any
performance conditions will be met and thus whether any further consideration will be payable. 
As permitted by IFRS 1, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. The Group performs its annual impairment review at the
cash-generating unit level. At the date of transition, and at the annual tests in 2004 and 2005, impairment tests showed there was no impairment with
respect to goodwill.
Available-for-sale investments Publicly-traded investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at market value. Unrealised holding gains or
losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, directly in equity via a revaluation reserve. Impairment losses and realised gains and losses of
such securities are reported in earnings. Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at fair value. At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the
estimated fair value of these investments approximated to cost less any permanent diminution in value, based on estimates determined by the directors.
The Group has applied the provisions of IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: disclosure and presentation”, and IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: recognition and
measurement”, from the date of transition to IFRS and has therefore not taken advantage of the optional exemption available under IFRS 1, under which the
Group could have elected to apply these standards only from 1 January 2005.  
Research and development expenditure All on-going research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Where a product is technically
feasible, production and sale are intended, a market exists, and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised
and amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective product. The Group believes its current process for developing products
is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility which is evidenced by a working model. Accordingly, development
costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalised to date.
40 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the IFRS financial statements
  1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which 
it is incurred.
Impairment charges The Group considers at each reporting date whether there is any indication that non-current assets are impaired. If there is such an
indication, the Group carries out an impairment test by measuring the assets’ recoverable amount, which is the higher of the assets’ fair value less costs to
sell and their value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised, and the assets are written down to
their recoverable amount. In addition, as discussed under "Goodwill" above, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. 
Revenue recognition The Group follows the principles of IAS 18, “Revenue recognition”, in determining appropriate revenue recognition policies. 
In principle, therefore, revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into 
the Group.
Revenue (excluding VAT) comprises the value of sales of licences, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees’ ARM-based products, revenues from
support, maintenance and training, consulting contracts and the sale of boards and software toolkits.
Revenue from standard licence products which are not modified to meet the specific requirements of each customer is recognised when the risks and
rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the customer.
Many licence agreements are for products which are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer. Revenue from the sale of such licences
is recognised on a percentage-of-completion basis over the period from signing of the licence to customer acceptance. Under the percentage-of-completion
method, provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognised in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined. The
percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated
project requirement, which approximates to the extent of performance. 
Where invoicing milestones on licence arrangements are such that the receipts fall due significantly outside the period over which the customisation 
is expected to be performed or significantly outside its normal payment terms for standard licence arrangements, the Group evaluates whether it 
is probable that economic benefits associated with these milestones will flow to the Group and therefore whether these receipts should initially 
be included in the arrangement consideration. In particular, it considers:
– whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice will be raised in the expected timeframe, particularly where the invoicing milestone is in some way
dependent on customer activity; 
– whether it has sufficient evidence that the customer considers that the Group’s contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled;
– whether there is sufficient certainty that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will indeed be incurred before the customer will accept that a future
invoice may be raised; and
– the extent to which previous experience with similar product groups and similar customers support the conclusions reached.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with such future milestones will flow
to the Group, taking into account these criteria, such milestones are excluded from the arrangement consideration until there is sufficient evidence that 
it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group. The Group does not discount future invoicing milestones,
as the effect of so doing would be immaterial. 
If the amount of revenue recognised exceeds the amounts invoiced to customers, the excess amount is recorded as amounts recoverable on contracts within
debtors.
Where agreements involve several components, the entire fee from such arrangements has been allocated to each of the individual components based on
each component’s fair value. Vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value is determined by reference to licence agreements with other customers
where components are sold separately. 
Agreements including rights to unspecified products are accounted for using subscription accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognised on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered, beginning with the delivery of the 
first product.
Certain products have been co-developed by the Group and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licences to the product. In
those cases where the Group makes sales of these products and is exposed to the significant risks and benefits associated with the transaction, the total
value of the licence is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as cost of sales. Where the collaborative partner
makes sales of these products, the Group records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by the collaborative partner that a sale has been
made and cash has been collected.
In addition to the licence fees, contracts generally contain an agreement to provide post-contract support (support, maintenance and training) (PCS) which
consists of an identified customer contact at the Group and telephonic or e-mail support. Fees for PCS which take place after customer acceptance are
specified in the contract. Revenue related to PCS is recognised based on VSOE, which is determined with reference to contractual renewal rates, or, 
if none are specified, by reference to the rates actually charged on renewal PCS arrangements for the same level of support and for the same or similar
technologies. Revenue for PCS is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by 
the Company with the licensee. 
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 41 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
The excess of licence fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred revenue.
Sales of software, including development systems, which are not specifically designed for a given licence (such as off-the-shelf software) are recognised
upon delivery, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. At that time, the Group has no further obligations
except that, where necessary, the costs associated with providing post-contract support have been accrued. Services (such as training) that the Group provides
which are not essential to the functionality of the IP are separately stated and priced in the contract and, therefore, accounted for separately. Revenue is
recognised as services are performed and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Company’s customers of products containing ARM technology. Revenues are recognised when ARM receives
notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties, normally quarterly in arrears.
Revenue from consulting is recognised when the service has been provided and all obligations to the customer under the consulting agreement have been
fulfilled. For larger consulting projects containing several project milestones, revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis as milestones are
achieved. Consulting costs are recognised when incurred.
As disclosed above, in accordance with IAS 8, “Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors”, the Group makes significant estimates in
applying its revenue recognition policies. In particular, as discussed in detail above, estimates are made in relation to the use of the percentage-of-completion
accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress toward completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty. The use of the
percentage-of-completion method is itself based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, customer acceptance is not uncertain. The Group
also makes assessments, based on prior experience, of the extent to which future milestone receipts represent a probable future economic benefit to the
Group. In addition, when allocating revenue to various components of arrangements involving several components, it is assumed that the fair value of 
each element is reflected by its price when sold separately. The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and
uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. If different
assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Government grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income
statement to match the projects’ related expenditure.
Retirement benefit costs The Group contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government
pension schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China, Israel and India. The Group contributes to these plans based upon various fixed
percentages of employee compensation, and such contributions are expensed as incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Group considers all highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than three
months but less than one year to be either short-term investments or short-term marketable securities. Any investments with a maturity date of greater
than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long term. 
Allowance for doubtful debts Trade receivables are first assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually
significant. Where there is no objective evidence of impairment for an individual receivable, it is included in a group of receivables with similar credit risk
characteristics and these are collectively assessed for impairment. Movements in the provision for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In general, cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and includes transport
and handling costs. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. External costs
and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if
appropriate, at each balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal economic
lives used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 25 years
Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter
Computers Three to five years
Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years
Motor vehicles Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred. Asset lives and
residual values are reviewed on an annual basis.
Acquired intangible assets Computer software, purchased patents and licences to use technology are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line
basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is expected to benefit from them, which is typically three to five years. Costs that are directly
attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed
into operational use, are capitalised. External costs and internal costs are capitalised to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
42 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the IFRS financial statements/continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, the directors are primarily responsible 
for determining the fair value of intangible assets. Developed technology, existing agreements and customer relationships, core technology, trademarks and
tradenames, and order backlog are capitalised and amortised over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the time that the Group is
expected to benefit from them.
In-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3, “Business combinations”,
for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill. The directors track the status of in-process research and development intangible assets such that
their amortisation commences when the assets are brought into use. This typically means a write-off period of one to five years.
Amortisation is calculated so as to write off the cost of intangible assets, less their estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each
balance sheet date, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal economic lives used for this
purpose are:
Computer software Three to five years
Patents and licences Three to five years
In-process research and development One to five years
Developed technology One to five years
Existing agreements and customer relationships Two to six years
Core technology Five years
Trademarks and tradenames Four to five years
Order backlog One year
Provision is made against the carrying value of acquired intangible assets where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Currency translation The functional currency of each Group entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into the functional currency of each Group entity at actual rates of exchange ruling 
at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such exchange differences have been included in general and administrative costs.  
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income statements of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the period. Translation differences are taken
directly to equity via the cumulative translation adjustment. On disposal of a subsidiary such amounts are recycled to the income statement. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate. 
As permitted by IFRS 1, the balance on the cumulative translation adjustment on retranslation of subsidiaries’ net assets has been set to zero at the date of
transition to IFRS.
Derivative financial instruments The Group utilises currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts
receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business. The Group’s currency exchange contracts do not subject the Group
to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being
hedged. The currency exchange contracts and related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end. Fair value is estimated using the
settlement rates prevailing at the period end. All recognised gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and
administrative costs in the income statement. The Group does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions. 
Embedded derivatives From time to time, the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency (typically US dollars) that is neither the
functional currency of the Group nor the functional currency of the customer. Where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Group carries 
such derivatives at fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs. 
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted rates and laws that will be 
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Valuation allowances
are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference
is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
arising in the same tax jurisdiction are off-set. 
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 43 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
In the UK and the US, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for amounts treated as compensation on exercise of certain employee share options under
each jurisdiction’s tax rules. As explained under “share-based payments” below, a compensation expense is recorded in the Group’s income statement 
over the period from the grant date to the vesting date of the relevant options. As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, 
a deferred tax asset is recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the
future (based on the Group’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income
statement. If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess 
is recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings. 
As explained under “share-based payments” below, no compensation charge is recorded in respect of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in
respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 1 January 2005. Nevertheless, tax deductions have arisen and will continue 
to arise on these options. The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity, against retained earnings.  
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding treasury stock and those shares held in the ESOP and the QUEST which are treated as cancelled. For
diluted earnings per share, the weighted number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The
diluted share base for the year ended 31 December 2005 excludes incremental shares of approximately 39,614,000 (2004: 38,143,000) related to employee
stock options. These shares are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market price.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. In accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-based payments”,
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on
the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. 
The Group operates Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the US. Options under these schemes are
granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue, which
stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months. The Group has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans and US
ESPPs. The charges for these are calculated as detailed above. 
The Group also has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognise a compensation charge under IFRS 2, calculated as detailed above.  
The Group has applied the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to those options granted after 7 November 2002 and which
were outstanding at 31 December 2004. 
The share-based payments charge is allocated to cost of sales, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and
administrative on the basis of headcount.
Employer’s taxes on share options Employer’s National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of
certain share options. In accordance with IFRS 2, this is treated as a cash-settled transaction. A provision is made, calculated using the fair value of the
Group’s shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options.  
Employee share ownership plans The Company’s Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) are
separately administered trusts which are funded by loans (the ESOP) and loans and gifts (the QUEST) from the Company, and the assets of which comprise
shares in the Company. The Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and shares held by the trusts are
recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until such time as the shares vest conditionally to employees. 
Investment income Investment income relates to interest income, which is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the
effective interest rate applicable.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable Distributions to equity holders are not recognised in the income statement under IFRS, but are disclosed as a component of the
movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a dividend when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of past events; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. 
Segmental reporting The primary reporting format is based on business segments, comprising the Processor Division and the Physical IP Division. The
secondary reporting format is based on geographical segments, these being Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. The primary reporting format requires
segmentation of the Group’s revenue and result before investment income and tax. Segment expenses are expenses that are directly attributable to a
segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be attached to the segment. Investment income and tax are not
segmented.
44 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the IFRS financial statements/continued 1 The Group and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Forthcoming accounting standards At the date of approval of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have 
not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: an amendment to IAS 21 in respect of an entity's investment in foreign
operations; an amendment to IAS 1 requiring new disclosures about entities’ management of their capital resources; amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4
which clarify whether financial guarantees fall within the scope of IAS 39 or IFRS 4 and stipulate the measurement method to be applied to such
guarantees; an amendment to IAS 39 restricting the use of the option to designate a financial asset or financial liability as “at fair value through profit or
loss”; an amendment to IAS 39 to permit hedge accounting for certain forecast intra-Group transactions; and a new accounting standard, IFRS 7 “Financial
instruments: Disclosures”. This standard replaces IAS 30 and the disclosure requirements in IAS 32 and locates in one place all disclosures relating to
financial instruments. The new requirements incorporate many of IAS 32’s disclosures as well as additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the
risks arising from financial instruments.
The directors acknowledge the adoption of these standards and interpretations in the future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements when they come into effect for periods after 1 January 2006.
2 Segmental reporting
At 31 December 2005 and 2004, the Group is organised on a worldwide basis into two business segments:
– Processor Division
– Physical IP Division
There are no sales between the business segments. Unallocated costs represent corporate expenses. Segment assets include property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets, goodwill, inventories, receivables and operating cash and exclude deferred tax assets. Segment liabilities comprise operating liabilities and
exclude current and deferred tax. Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets, including additions
resulting from acquisitions through business combinations.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate relevant to each tax jurisdiction.
The movement on the deferred tax account is shown below:

£000 £000
At 1 January 261 5,980

Adjustment in respect of share option benefits 6,072 –
Exchange differences (881) 411
At 31 December 4,440 261
Deferred tax assets have been partially recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because 
it is not probable that the unrecognised portion of these assets will be recovered. The amount of deferred tax assets unrecognised at 31 December 2005 
was £366,000 (2004: £254,000).
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax 
is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. If the earnings were remitted, tax of £2,379,000 would be payable. 
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12) during the year
are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforcable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the
balances net.

In addition, the directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2005 of 0.5 pence per share which will absorb
an estimated £6,842,000 of shareholders' funds. It will be paid on 5 May 2006 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 31 March 2006.
9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in
issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP , the QUEST and treasury stock which are treated as cancelled. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary
shares. The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year: those being share options granted to employees and directors
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under
the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). For 2005 and 2004, no shares that were allocated for awards under the LTIP were included in the diluted
EPS calculation as the performance criteria could not be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are shown on the face of the income statement.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, “Impairment of assets”. 
No impairment charge was required as a result of this annual impairment test. 
The carrying amounts of goodwill by cash generating unit (CGU) are summarised in the following schedule on a segment level: 
Processors Physical IP Group
£000 £000 £000
Goodwill relating to Artisan 114,840 344,519 459,359
Goodwill relating to other acquisitions 15,071 – 15,071
129,911 344,519 474,430
The recoverable amount for each CGU has been measured based on a value in use calculation. 
Processor Division (PD)
The Processor Division encompasses the whole of the business excluding Physical IP .
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were:
Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2015 of 3%
per annum. It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan to
the Processor Division are expected to accrue. It is expected that it will take between four and seven years before the majority of ARM’s larger
semiconductor partners are licensing physical IP from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, 
i.e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by an amount consistent with the Group's five-year plan as well as analysts’ expectations. These
have proved to be reliable guides in the past and the directors believe that these estimates are appropriate.
Revenue attributable to the benefits afforded by owning the PIPD unit The directors believe that revenue will accrue to the Processor Division as 
a result of the ownership of the Physical IP Division for the following reasons:
– the development of faster and more power-efficient microprocessors as a result of collaboration between PD and PIPD engineering teams. This is
expected to generate more PD licensing deals at higher prices;
– the potential for PD to win more microprocessor licensing business as a result of ARM being able to offer both processor and physical IP in-house; and 
– the improvement in PD operating margins as a result of being able to transfer a number of engineering tasks to the Bangalore design centre acquired
with Artisan.
Operating margins Operating margins have been assumed to remain consistent with current operating margins over the period of the calculation. 
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with ARM’s estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.5% pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Processor Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating 
its fair value are appropriate. Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably
foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the
carrying value.

Notes to the IFRS financial statements/continued 16  Goodwill continued
Physical IP Division (PIPD)
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were:
Period over which the directors have projected cash flows A ten-year forecast period is used with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2015 of 3%
per annum. It is considered appropriate to use a ten-year forecast period to properly reflect the period over which the benefits of the acquisition of Artisan
are expected to accrue. It is expected that it will take between four and seven years before the majority of ARM’s larger semiconductor partners are licensing
physical IP from the Group, with royalties being generated from these licences a further two to four years later, i.e. a total period of six to 11 years.
Forecast revenue growth Revenue is forecast to grow by approximately 20% in the first five years, falling to 6% by 2015 to reflect the uncertainty of
forecasting revenues in the years further in the future. In assessing the appropriate valuation of PIPD in 2004, the directors assumed revenue growth of
approximately 20% per annum was achievable in the PIPD stand-alone business based on process geometry shrinks bringing more licensing opportunities
across a broader range of foundries and based on the significant increase in the usage of Artisan IP in 2003 and 2004 which is yet to generate royalties.
Confidence in achieving revenue growth of 20% is underpinned by the expected increasing contribution from synergistic revenues in addition to the growth
potential in the stand-alone business. In 2005 licence revenues still grew by 21%. Like-for-like royalty revenue growth was only 1% but was materially
impacted by industry macro factors and changes to internal processes. 
Operating margins Operating margins are assumed to increase from 32% in 2006 with growth up to margins in the mid-40s% by 2010. In 2005, PIPD
operating margin was 30%. This is expected to increase in future years as royalty growth gathers pace at effectively 100% margins. Costs are expected to
grow broadly in line with licence revenue growth.
This timescale is consistent with ARM’s experience in developing the processor licensing and royalty model. ARM has signed approximately 370 processor
licences over the last 15 years with less than half of these yielding royalties thus far. As royalty revenues are a function of cumulative licensing, royalty
growth gathers momentum as the licensing base grows – ARM processor royalties have increased from $38 million in 2002 to $131 million in 2005.
Discount rate Future cash flows are discounted in line with estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Physical IP business of approximately 10%
pre-tax.
The directors are confident that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Physical IP Division is appropriate and that the assumptions used in estimating its
fair value are appropriate. Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable
changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.

Financial risk factors
The Group's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk. 
The Group has no derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations in place at the year end since it has no loan financing, and as such 
no hedge accounting is applied.
Given the size of the Group, the directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee of the board.
The policies set by the board of directors are implemented by the Group's finance department. The department has a policy and procedures manual that
sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and price risk and circumstances where it would be
appropriate to use financial instruments to manage these.
Currency risk The Group’s earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally in respect of the US dollar, reflecting
the fact that most of its revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars, while a significant proportion of its costs are settled in sterling (the
proportion of US dollar denominated costs for the Group going forward after the acquisition of Artisan increased from approximately 25% to approximately
45%). The Group seeks to use forward contracts and currency options to manage the US dollar/sterling risk as appropriate, by monitoring the timing and
value of anticipated US dollar receipts (which tend to arise from low-volume, high-value licence deals and royalty receipts) in comparison with its requirement
to settle certain expenses in US dollars. The Group reviews the resulting exposure on a regular basis and hedges this exposure using forward contracts and
currency options for the sale of US dollars as appropriate. Such contracts are entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with projected US
dollar cash receipts. As the timing of large cash receipts cannot be predicted with certainty, the Group enters into forward contracts which allow exercise
between two dates, typically between three and four months from the invoice date. In those cases where customers settle debts before the expiry of the
foreign exchange contract, the Group evaluates whether money market rates available for US dollar investments exceed those for sterling investments. 
It then seeks to maximise its returns by remitting US dollars against forward contracts at the beginning or end of the exercise period, depending on the
prevailing money market rates for US dollars and sterling at the time. 
At 31 December 2005, the Group had outstanding forward contracts to sell $36,000,000 (2004: $50,000,000) and potential exercisable currency options 
of $76,000,000 (2004: $nil). The Group had $59,987,000 (2004: $56,205,000) of accounts receivable denominated in US dollars at that date, and US dollar
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balances of $121,427,000 (2004: $176,464,000). Thus 38% (2004: 79%) of the
Group’s US dollar current assets were not hedged by matching forward contracts and currency options at the year end. The Group does not qualify for hedge
accounting, and all movements in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments are recorded in the income statement, offsetting the foreign
exchange movements on the accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents being hedged.
In addition, certain customers remit royalties and licence fees in other currencies, primarily the euro. The Group is also required to settle certain expenses in
euros, primarily in its French, Belgian and German subsidiaries, and as the net amounts involved are not considered significant, the Group does not take out
euro forward contracts.
Interest rate risk At 31 December 2005, the Group has £160,902,000 (2004: £142,817,000) of interest-bearing assets. At 31 December 2005, 
77% (2004: 45%) of interest-bearing assets were at fixed rates. Floating rate cash earns interest based on relevant national LIBID equivalent. 
The proportion of funds held in fixed rather than floating-rate deposits is determined in accordance with the “liquidity risk” policy below.
Price risk The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk on available-for-sale investments. As there can be no guarantee that there will be a future
market for securities (which are generally unlisted at the time of the investment) or that the value of such investments will rise, the directors evaluate each
investment opportunity on its merits before committing ARM’s funds. The directors review holdings in such companies on a regular basis to determine
whether continued investment is in the best interests of the Group. Funds for such ventures are strictly limited in order that the financial effect of any
potential decline of the value of investments will not be substantial in the context of the Group’s financial results.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential
customers before sales commence. Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the board of directors and such approval is limited to
financial institutions with an AAA rating. The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit, which is reassessed annually by the
board. 
Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to maintain balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term marketable securities, such that
highly liquid resources at all times exceeds the projected cash outflows of the business.

Use of financial instuments
External borrowings At 31 December 2005, the Group owed £nil (2004: $3.3 million or £1,732,000) extending beyond one year from the balance 
sheet date being the final payment of a technology licence agreement signed in 2004. The Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
at 31 December 2005 (2004: nil) or during the financial year.

Short-term investments The carrying amount approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments, being greater than three
months but less than one year.
Short-term marketable securities There is a readily available market for these investments. Unrealised gains and losses on these investments are
recognised directly as equity via the revaluation reserve. The Group recognises an impairment charge when the decline in fair value below cost is judged to
be other than temporary. At 31 December 2005, the fair value is £30,000 less than cost with a corresponding amount being charged to equity as the decline
is judged to be temporary. 
Fair value of currency exchange contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is estimated using the settlement rates. The estimation of
the fair value of the liability in respect of forward contracts is £1,708,000 at 31 December 2005 (2004: asset of £1,674,000). The decrease is due to the
value and relative exchange rates of contracts outstanding compared to 2004. The resulting gain or loss on the movement of the fair value of currency
exchange contracts is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs as shown below.

Long-term marketable securities There is a readily available market for these investments. Unrealised gains and losses on these investments are
recognised directly in equity via the revaluation reserve. The Group recognises an impairment charge when the decline in fair value below cost is judged to
be other than temporary. At 31 December 2005, the fair value approximates to carrying value. 
Available-for-sale investments: investments in unlisted companies Those companies in which ARM has invested are early-stage development
enterprises, which are generating value for shareholders through research and development activities, and most do not currently report profits. The directors
do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Group’s investments in unlisted companies (carrying value at 31 December 2005:
£1,805,000) as they are, by definition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities. However, based on recent fundraising
transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are 
of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Available-for-sale investments: investments in listed companies The fair value of listed investments is determined with reference to prices quoted on
the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2005. On this basis, the fair value of the Group’s listed investments was £6,995,000 at 31 December 2005
(2004: £10,262,000).
Embedded derivatives In accordance with IAS 39, "Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement", the Group has reviewed all contracts for
embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard. From time to time,
the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency (typically US dollars) that is neither the functional currency of the Group nor the functional
currency of the customer. Where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, the Group carries such derivatives at fair value. The resulting gain or loss
is recognised in the income statement under general and administrative costs, as shown below:

During the year £16,211,000 of shares (13.9 million shares) were repurchased. These shares have a nominal value of 0.05 pence and represent 1% 
of called-up share capital at 31 December 2005.
24  Acquisitions
On 27 October 2005, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH (KEG), a leading provider of software development tools for the
microcontroller market (MCU) and incorporated in Germany for total consideration of £7.4 million. On the same day, the Group purchased the entire share
capital of Keil Software Inc. (KSI), also a leading provider of software development tools for the MCU market and incorporated in the US for total
consideration of £3.5 million. These purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
The Group has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Group’s future business and with this acquisition, the Group will be able to accelerate
progress in that market by offering a more complete solution. As the MCU applications shift from 8/16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination of the ARM
®
Cortex™-M3 processor, which was specifically designed for microcontroller applications, the RealView
®
high-performance compiler and Keil’s complementary 
MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions. For the reasons given above, the Group paid a premium on both the Keil acquisitions,
giving rise to goodwill.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 the acquisitions contributed £0.9 million to revenue, and £0.6 million to both profit before interest and profit
before tax. The acquisition did not make a material contribution to the Group’s post-acquisition net operating cash flows, tax paid or capital expenditure.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the
financial statements. 
The accounting for the Keil acquisitions has been determined on a provisional basis at 31 December 2005 because the fair values assigned to the acquiree’s
identifiable assets and liabilities have been determined only provisionally. Any adjustments to these provisional values as a result of completing work on the
fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will be recognised within 12 months of the acquisition date and will be recognised as if they had occurred as at
the date of acquisition.

£000
Cash consideration paid 4,397
Expenses paid 263
Cash acquired (2,911)
Net cash outflow 1,749
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KEG can be analysed as follows:
£000
Developed technology 2,744
Customer relationships 4,290
Total 7,034
The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below:
Developed technology Technology of £2.7 million related to software development tools for the microcontroller market, consisting of 8-,16- and 32-bit
technology. At the date of acquisition, the technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility. Any costs incurred in the future will relate to
the ongoing maintenance of the technology and will be expensed as incurred. To estimate the fair value of technology, the relief from royalty method
within an income approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 11%, with a specific surcharge of 5% for both the 8- and 16-bit technology and 3.4%
for the 32-bit techology.
To derive the royalty cash flows, the revenues from each identified technology were used. All technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful
life of one to five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of £4.3 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts. These have been
divided into different customer groups: direct company customers and dealers. To estimate the fair value of the customer base, the multi-period excess
earnings method has been applied, with the valuation based on the planned free cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships as of the
valuation date. Direct company customers and dealers are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively. 
KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of £1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax
of £1.0 million. The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG occurred on 1 January 2005.

The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of KSI is calculated as follows:
£000
Cash consideration paid 2,415
Expenses paid 132
Cash acquired (32)
Net cash outflow 2,515
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of KSI can be analysed as follows:
£000
Customer relationships 482
Tradenames 1,175
Total 1,657
The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below:
Tradenames Tradenames of £1.2 million represented the trade names and internet domain names legally held by Keil Software, Inc. To estimate the fair
value of these tradenames, the relief from royalty method within an income approach was applied with a post-tax discount rate of 14.5%. To derive the
royalty cash flows, the revenues from Keil Software Inc. and Keil Elektronik GmbH were used. All tradenames are being amortised over an estimated useful
life of five years.  
Customer relationships The customer base of £0.5 million represented the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, these have been
divided into different customer groups: direct customers and distributors. To estimate the fair value of the customer base, the multi-period excess earnings
method has been applied, with the valuation based on the planned free cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships as of the valuation date.
Direct company customers and distributors are being amortised over their estimated useful lives of two and three years respectively. 
KSI made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of £95,000 and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a loss after tax of
£40,000. The results of the Group would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KSI occured on 1 January 2005.
Artisan Components Inc. acquisition
On 23 December 2004, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc., a leading provider of physical IP components for the design
and manufacture of complex system-on-chip (SoC) integrated circuits, for total consideration of £546.6 million. This purchase was accounted for as an
acquisition. 
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2004, Artisan contributed £195,000 to revenue, decreased profit before interest by £653,000 and decreased
profit before tax by £599,000. The acquisition did not make a material contribution to the Group’s post-acquisition net operating cash flows, tax paid or
capital expenditure.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the
financial statements.

Cash and cash equivalents acquired 82,567
Net cash outflow (43,595)
In 2005, a further £14,350,000 was paid in relation to Artisan acquisition expenses. 
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. can be analysed as follows:
£000
Computer software 697
In-process research and development 3,542
Developed technology 17,240
Core technology 12,031
Existing agreements and customer relationships 37,292
Order backlog 1,667
Trademarks 2,604
Total 75,073
The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identifiable intangible assets are described below:
In-process research and development In-process research and development of £3.5 million reflected certain research projects that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and commercial viability. The fair value assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the income approach, which
discounts to present value the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a post-tax discount rate of 18%.
Developed technology and core technology Developed technology of £17.2 million and patents and core technology of £12.0 million included intellectual
property components for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input/output components, and
analogue and mixed-signal products. In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular
architecture and trade secrets that are the buildings blocks of the technology. At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had
reached technological feasibility. Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed
as incurred. To estimate the fair value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 13% for existing
technology and 15% for patents and core technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash
flows. All developed technologies are being amortised over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of £37.3 million and order backlog of £1.7 million represented
the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements. To estimate the fair value of
the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach (replacement value) was used. The customer base and order backlog are being amortised over their
estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks The fair value assigned to trademarks, including the company name Artisan, was estimated to be £2.6 million. This was calculated using the
income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a post-tax discount rate of 15%. 
The results of the operation in 2004, as if the above acquisition had been made at the beginning of the period are as follows:
£000
Revenue 197,852
Profit 15,449
The pro forma consolidated results of operations include adjustments to give effect to amortisation of acquired intangible assets other than goodwill, reduced
investment income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration, amortisation of deferred compensation and the related income tax effects. This
information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the purchase been made at the beginning of the period presented
or the future results of the combined operations.

Axys Design Automation Inc. acquisition
On 16 August 2004, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. a US company, for total consideration of £8.6 million. This
purchase was accounted for as an acquisition. 
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2004 the acquisition contributed £596,000 million to revenue. No indication can be given of the profit before
interest, profit before tax and contributions to the Group’s net operating cash flows for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2004 as the
business and assets were integrated into existing Group operations shortly after purchase. 
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values. The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the
financial statements.

Total 2,290
These intangibles were valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Axys concerning development projects, their stage of development, the
time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income-generating ability. 
The pro forma revenue of the operation, if the above acquisition had been made at the beginning of the period, is £667,000 after fair value adjustments
have been made. This information is not necessarily indicative of the revenue that would have occurred had the purchase been made at the beginning of
the period presented or the future revenues of the combined operations.
No indication can be given of the pro forma profit or loss as if the acquisition had been made at the beginning of the period as the business and assets

66 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the IFRS financial statements/continued 25  Share-based payments
The Group has several share option schemes in current operation, whereby options over shares in the Company can be granted to employees and directors.
The different schemes are described below, but all options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at
the date of grant, except for those options within the SAYE schemes which are issued at a 15% discount.  
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan (the Executive Scheme), the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain
eligibility requirements. Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options
expire.
Under the Company’s Unapproved Scheme (the Unapproved Scheme), for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are
exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire. The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially
the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue. Under both of these
schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary,
100% maximum on fourth anniversary. Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met
are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees (the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme). In the French Scheme, options are
exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third
anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition. The schemes remained substantially the
same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc. The
number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement. The schemes assumed were the “1993
Plan”, the “1997 Plan”, the “2000 Plan”, the “2003 Plan”, the “Director Plan”, the “Executive Plan” and the “ND00 Plan”.
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods. The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most
common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years. Some options vest on
a monthly basis, and some vest over five years. All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.  
The Company also offers savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company. The number of options granted 
is related to the value of savings made by the employee. The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM Inc. and ARM Physical IP
Inc. where the period is two years. The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise normally
only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. and ARM Physical IP Inc. where the right to exercise normally
only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed. 
The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions for each grant
during 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

The directors consider there to be no major non-cash transactions in 2005. In 2004, the Group acquired Artisan Components Inc. and part of the
consideration paid was in the form of ARM Holdings plc equity being issued to the former shareholders of Artisan. The fair value of equity issued was
£354,835,000. Further consideration in the form of approximately 90.4 million options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc were granted with a fair
value of £61,474,000.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. (Nazomi) filed suit against ARM alleging wilful infringement of Nazomi’s US Patent No. 6,332,215. ARM
answered Nazomi’s complaint in July 2002 denying infringement. ARM moved for summary judgment and a ruling that the technology does not infringe
Nazomi’s patent. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted ARM’s motion, and Nazomi appealed the District Court’s ruling.
On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and issued its decision on 11 April 2005. Because, in the opinion of the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District Court did not construe the disputed claim term in sufficient detail for appellate review, the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the dispute back to the District Court for further analysis. A supplementary “Markman” hearing was held on 
11 October 2005 and we are presently awaiting the ruling of the District Court. Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe 
that the effect of the original ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that
the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party. Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification
to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability. The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos and
is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee
infringes such third party’s intellectual property rights. The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the licence and will continue in
perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that 
it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements; and (ii) the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. 
Any such provision is based upon the directors’ estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
30  Related party transactions
During the year, the Group paid royalty fees of £33,000 (2004: £411,000) and made cross-licence payments of £26,000 (2004: £14,000) to Superscape
Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis, an executive director of the Group, is a non-executive director. Amounts owed to Superscape at 31 December
2005 and 2004 were £nil. 
During the year, the Group received licence fees of £321,000 (2004: £209,000), support and maintenance income of £37,000 (2004: £37,000) and
evaluation tools fees of £17,000 (2004: £nil) from CSR plc, a company in which John Scarisbrick, a non-executive director of ARM Holdings plc, is an
executive director. Amounts owed to CSR at 31 December 2005 and 2004 were £nil. 
There were no other related party transactions during 2005 or 2004 which require disclosure. 
Key management compensation is disclosed in note 4.
31  Post-balance sheet events
After the year end, the directors declared payment of a final dividend in respect of 2005 of 0.5 pence per share. Subject to shareholder approval, the final
dividend will be paid on 5 May 2006 to shareholders on the register on 31 March 2006. The final dividend has not been recognised as a distribution during
the year ended 31 December 2005.

33  Explanation of material adjustments to equity at 31 December 2004 and 1 January 2004 and to profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 
The transition to IFRS resulted in the following changes in accounting policies:
a) Goodwill Goodwill is not amortised under IFRS but is measured at cost less impairment losses. Under UK GAAP , goodwill was amortised on a straight-line
basis over an estimate of the time the Group was to benefit from it. The change does not affect equity at 1 January 2004 because, as permitted by IFRS 1,
goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date, the results of which assessment indicated no such impairment. 
The 2004 annual report included a provisional assessment of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. on 
23 December 2004. Where these provisional values have been amended as estimates have been refined in 2005, adjustments to fair values have been
recorded as prior year adjustments to goodwill for IFRS purposes. This would not have been the case under UK GAAP .
b) Other intangible assets Under IFRS, intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination may meet the criteria set out in IFRS 3 for
categorisation as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives. Under UK GAAP , intangible assets purchased as
part of a business combination are included within the goodwill balance unless the asset can be identified and sold separately without disposing of the
business as a whole. In August and December 2004, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan
Components Inc. respectively. Both of these business combinations have been accounted for under IFRS 3. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption
under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS retrospectively to business combinations occurring before 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS. Thus, at 31 December
2004, £76,659,000 of intangible assets recognisable under IFRS 3, but subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP , have been reclassified as intangible assets.
Amortisation expense in respect of these intangible assets has decreased profit for the year ended 31 December 2004 by £511,000. 
Under IFRS, the difference between the book value of the intangible assets for accounting purposes and the tax value of these assets gives rise to 
a temporary difference. A deferred tax liability of £30,409,000 at 31 December 2004 has therefore been recorded. The deferred tax liability is released 
to the income statement in proportion to the amortisation of the related intangibles. The impact is to increase the profit for the year ended 31 December
2004 by £204,000. 
As intangible assets and goodwill arising on overseas acquisitions are treated as foreign currency assets of the acquired entities under IFRS (but not under
the Group’s UK GAAP accounting policies), related foreign exchange movements have been recorded in reserves.

c) Computer software Under IFRS, computer software is classified within intangible assets. Under UK GAAP , computer software was classified as a tangible
fixed asset. This change in accounting policy has resulted in a reclassification between plant, property and equipment and intangibles at 31 December 2004
and 1 January 2004.
d) Publicly traded investments Under IFRS, publicly traded investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealised holding
gains or losses on such securities are included, net of related taxes, directly in equity via a revaluation reserve. Impairment losses and realised gains and
losses of such securities are reported in earnings. Under UK GAAP , these investments were carried at cost less any impairment charges. 
e) Embedded derivatives Under IFRS, where the Group enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency that is neither the functional currency of the
Group nor the functional currency of the customer and where there are uninvoiced amounts on such contracts, such derivatives are carried at fair value. The
resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. Embedded derivatives were not revalued to fair value under UK GAAP . 
f) Dividends payable Under IFRS, dividends to shareholders declared after the period end but before the financial statements are authorised for issue are
not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. A liability for a final dividend is recognised when the dividend is approved by shareholders; a liability 
for a dividend is recognised when paid. Furthermore, under IFRS, dividends are not shown in the income statement but are recorded directly in reserves via
retained earnings. Under UK GAAP , dividends declared after the period end are recorded in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate. 
g) Deferred tax assets and liabilities As required by IAS 1, “Presentation of financial statements”, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been classified as
non-current assets and liabilities respectively. Under UK GAAP , these were included within current assets and liabilities respectively. Additionally, as required
by IAS 12, “Income taxes”, deferred tax liabilities and assets have been offset where they arise in the same tax jurisdiction. Under UK GAAP , there was no
such right of offset. The transition to IFRS has impacted the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as follows:

h) Employer’s taxes on share options Under IFRS, employer’s taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are calculated using the fair value of
the Company’s shares at the balance sheet date, pro-rated over the vesting period of the options. Under UK GAAP , this calculation uses the market value of
the Company’s shares at the balance sheet date. Additionally, under UK GAAP , employer’s taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are
included within provisions for liabilities and charges. Under IFRS, these are included within accrued and other liabilities.
i) Other reserves As permitted by IFRS 1, the cumulative translation adjustment has been reset to zero as at 1 January 2004. This has had no effect on net
equity but has decreased retained earnings by £2,088,000 as at December 2004 and 1 January 2004 with matching offsetting adjustments to the cumulative
translation adjustment. 
j) Share-based payments The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. In accordance with IFRS 2, equity-settled share-
based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002 and which were outstanding at 
31 December 2004. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest. Under UK GAAP , the charge recorded represented the difference
between the share price at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option. In addition, the Group took advantage of an exemption under which no
charge was made in respect of SAYE options. Thus, under UK GAAP , a charge was made only in respect of the LTIP with no other share-based payments
charges being recognised.
As a consequence of accounting for share-based payments, a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases arises, and a deferred tax asset 
is recorded. The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based on the
Group’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement. If the amount
of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory rate, the excess is recorded directly in
equity, against retained earnings. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 75

continued
k) Prepayments and deferred revenue The conventions under which the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
is determined differ between IFRS and UK GAAP . This has given rise to a difference in the fair value of prepayments and deferred revenue purchased as part
of the Artisan acquisition. In addition, under UK GAAP prepayments fully due after more than one year were included within current assets. Under IFRS,
prepayments falling due after more than one year are disclosed within non-current assets.
l) Reversal of impairments In 2004, a previous impairment of an available-for-sale investment was reversed. Under UK GAAP , this was taken as a credit to
the income statement. However, under IFRS, this was taken directly to equity via the revaluation reserve. 
m) Financial assets: fair value of currency exchange contracts Under IAS 32, financial assets are required to be disclosed separately on the face of the
balance sheet. Under UK GAAP , these were disclosed within prepaid expenses and other assets at 31 December 2004 and within cash and cash equivalents
and trade receivables at 1 January 2004. 
n) Cash Under IAS 7, “Cash flow statements”, deposits with a maturity of less than three months at inception which are convertible into known amounts 
of cash are included as cash and cash equivalents. Deposits with a maturity at inception of between three months and one year are shown as short-term
investments. Under UK GAAP , cash does not include short-term deposits and investments which cannot be withdrawn without notice and without incurring 
a penalty. Such items are shown as short-term investments. 
o) Changes to the cash flow statement The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared under IFRS presents substantially the same information as that
required under UK GAAP .
Under IFRS only three categories of cash flow activity are required to be reported: operating, investing and financing. Cash flows from returns on
investments and servicing of finance and cash flows from taxation shown under UK GAAP are included as operating activities and investing activities
respectively under IFRS. There are no other material differences between the cash flow statement presented under IFRS and the cash flow statement
presented under UK GAAP . 
34  Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS
Goodwill Under both IFRS and US GAAP , goodwill is not subject to amortisation, but is tested at least annually for impairment. As permitted by IFRS 1, the
Group’s goodwill under IFRS has been frozen at the amount recorded under UK GAAP as at 1 January 2004. Under US GAAP , following the provisions of SFAS
142, “Goodwill and other intangible assets”, the carrying value of goodwill was frozen at the amount recorded under previous US GAAP as at 1 January
2002. Under both previous US GAAP and UK GAAP , goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life. Thus, while ongoing accounting policies in respect
of goodwill are similar under US GAAP and IFRS, the difference in the dates of transition means that different amounts of goodwill are recorded.
Under US GAAP , certain costs to be incurred on restructuring on business combination are treated as a fair value adjustment in the balance sheet acquired.
Under IFRS, these costs are expensed post-acquisition. Additionally, under US GAAP , tax benefits arising from the exercise of options issued as part of the
consideration for a business combination become a deduction to goodwill, only to the extent that those benefits do not exceed the fair value of the
consideration relating to those options at the appropriate tax rate. Any excess tax benefits are a deduction to equity. Under IFRS, the full tax benefit 
is a deduction to equity.
The 2004 annual report included a provisional assessment of the fair values of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. 
on 23 December 2004. Where these provisional values have been amended as estimates have been refined in 2005, adjustments to fair values have been
recorded as prior year adjustments to goodwill for IFRS purposes. Under US GAAP , these are recorded as amendments to goodwill in the current period.
Recognition and amortisation of intangibles The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS retrospectively to business
combinations occurring before 1 January 2004. This means that for business combinations occurring before this date, the previously reported UK GAAP
treatment has continued to be followed. Under previous UK GAAP , intangible assets were recognised separately from goodwill only where they could be sold
separately without disposing of a business of the entity. This separability criterion does not apply under either IFRS or US GAAP . Thus, a number of intangible
assets which are required to be recognised separately from goodwill under both IFRS 3 and SFAS 142, were subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP .
Under both US GAAP and IFRS, such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives. Except in relation to in-process research and
development (see below), there is no difference in accounting policy for intangible assets recognised as a result of business combinations entered into after
1 January 2004. 
In-process research and development Under IFRS, in-process research and development projects purchased as part of a business combination may meet
the criteria set out in IAS 38, “Intangible assets”, for recognition as intangible assets other than goodwill and are amortised over their useful economic lives
commencing when the asset is brought into use. Under US GAAP , in-process research and development is immediately written-off to the income statement.
This accounting policy difference gives rise to an associated difference in deferred taxation.
Valuation of consideration on business combination Under both IFRS and US GAAP , the fair value of consideration in a business combination includes the
fair value of both equity issued and any share options granted as part of that combination. Under IFRS, any equity issued is valued at the fair value as of the
date of completion, whilst under US GAAP , the equity is valued at the date the terms of the combination were agreed to and announced. For options, under
US GAAP , the fair value is based upon the total number of options granted, both vested and unvested, whilst under IFRS the fair value only includes those
that have vested, together with a pro-rata value for partially vested options. Furthermore, where there is contingent consideration for an acquisition, under
IFRS this is recognised as part of the purchase consideration if the contingent conditions are expected to be satisfied, whilst under US GAAP it is only
recognised if the conditions have actually been met. 76 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the IFRS financial statements/continued
34  Summary of significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS continued
Deferred compensation Under US GAAP , the intrinsic value of unvested stock options issued by an acquirer as part of a business combination in exchange
for unvested share options of the acquiree is recorded as a debit balance within shareholders’ funds. This amount is charged to the profit and loss account
over the vesting period of the share options in accordance with FIN 28. Under IFRS, no such adjustment to shareholders’ funds is made on acquisition. 
Compensation charge in respect of share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. In accordance
with IFRS 2, equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Under US GAAP , the Group accounts for share option compensation expense under APB 25, and
thus no compensation expense is recorded where the exercise price of the option is equal to the share price on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP , the Group recognises a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans. The compensation charge is calculated as the difference
between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings
period. In addition, certain options attract a charge under variable plan accounting under US GAAP . Under IFRS, this charge is calculated in the same manner
as other share-based payments, as detailed above.
Under US GAAP , the Group follows variable plan accounting for the LTIP grants, measuring compensation expense as the difference between the exercise
price and the fair market value of the shares at each period end over the vesting period of the share awards. Increases in fair market value of the shares
result in a charge and decreases in fair market value of the shares result in a credit, subject to the cumulative amount previously expensed. Under IFRS, this
charge is calculated in the same manner as other share-based payments, as detailed above.
Deferred tax on UK and US share options In the US and the UK, the Group is entitled to a tax deduction for the amount treated as employee
compensation under US and UK tax rules on exercise of certain employee share options. The compensation is equivalent to the difference between the
option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise.
Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised and are calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future (based
on the Company’s share price at the balance sheet date) with the cumulative amount of the compensation expense recorded in the income statement. If
the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded
directly in equity, against the profit and loss reserve. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, no compensation charge is recorded in respect
of options granted before 7 November 2002 or in respect of those options which have been exercised or have lapsed before 31 December 2004. Nevertheless,
tax deductions have arisen and will continue to arise on these options. The tax effects arising in relation to these options are recorded directly in equity,
against retained earnings.
Under US GAAP , deferred tax assets are recognised by multiplying the compensation expense recorded by the prevailing tax rate in the relevant tax
jurisdiction. Where, on exercise of the relevant option, the tax benefit obtained exceeds the deferred tax asset in relation to the relevant options, the 
excess is recorded in additional paid-in capital. Where the tax benefit is less than the deferred tax asset, the write-down of the deferred tax asset is
recorded against additional paid-in capital to the extent of previous excess tax benefits recorded in this account, with any remainder recorded in 
the income statement.
Employer taxes on share options Under IFRS, employer’s taxes that are payable on the exercise of share options are provided for over the vesting period
of the options. Under US GAAP , such taxes are accounted for when the options are exercised.

Selected consolidated financial data/US GAAP
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The matters addressed in this operating
and financial review and prospects, with the exception of the historical information presented, contain forward-looking statements involving risks and
uncertainties.
Overview ARM designs the technology that lies at the heart of advanced digital products, from wireless, networking and consumer entertainment solutions
to imaging, automotive, security and storage devices. ARM’s comprehensive product offering includes 16/32-bit RISC microprocessors, data engines, 3D
processors, digital libraries, embedded memories, peripherals, software and development tools, as well as analog functions and high-speed connectivity
products. The Company licenses this technology to semiconductor companies which, in turn, manufacture, market and sell microprocessors and related
products. ARM has developed an innovative, intellectual-property-centered and market-driven business model in which it neither manufactures nor sells the
products incorporating ARM technology, but concentrates on the research and development, design and support of the ARM architecture and supporting
development tools and software. Combined with the Company’s broad Partner community, they provide a total system solution that offers a fast, reliable
path to market for leading electronics companies.
Market conditions 2005 was another challenging year for the semiconductor industry, though there were signs of gradual improvement in the second half.
ARM has performed well despite these conditions, with our revenue growth doubling the overall growth in the industry. Both our royalty revenues and units
have increased significantly compared with previous years and quarter-on-quarter throughout 2005. Overall licensing backlog remains healthy with backlog
relating to physical IP products at a record level at the end of the year. 2006 is looking to have a more favourable backdrop though as always the Company
is susceptible to the timing of new licenses through the year. That said, all indications are for a year of growth in dollar revenues in all areas of the business.
As well as growing profitability, the Company has been robustly cash generative (before investing activities), with net cash inflows from operating activities
of £47.2 million, giving rise to a year-end cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities balance of £160.9 million.
The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the Company’s consolidated
statements of income.

Total revenues Total revenues were £232.4 million in 2005, an increase of 52% from £152.9 million in 2004, which was a 19% increase from £128.1 million
in 2003. Dollar revenues were $418.7 million in 2005, an increase of 54% from $272.4 million in 2004 which was an increase of 32% over the $206.5
million in 2003. The actual average dollar exchange rate in 2005 was $1.80 compared with $1.78 in 2004. This had the effect of reducing total reported
revenues by approximately £2.8 million. The figures for 2004 and 2003 do not include revenues for the Artisan business acquired in December 2004. If
these were included, dollar revenues increased by 18% in 2005 from the pro forma $355.5 million in 2004 of the combined ARM and Artisan businesses.
Product revenues Product revenues consist of license fees, sales of development systems and royalties. Product revenues for 2003, 2004 and 2005 were
£113.0 million, £138.7 million and £217.7 million, representing 88%, 91% and 94% of total revenues respectively.
License revenues increased from £50.8 million in 2003 to £59.4 million in 2004, and increased further to £104.2 million in 2005 representing approximately
40%, 39% and 45% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. 
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 79
Operating and financial review and prospects/US GAAP Having grown license revenues by 27% and 19% in 2004 and 2005 respectively, ARM enters 2006 well placed to maintain momentum in processor licensing.
The portfolio of licensable products comprises a rich mix of well-proven ARM technology, such as the ARM7 and ARM9 families of products, products introduced
in recent years which are still in the early stages of their licensing life cycle, such as the ARM11 family of products, and the first three Cortex family products
which have already been licensed by lead Partners and which will be available for general licensing in 2006.
71 new licenses were signed in 2005 compared to 65 in 2004 and 51 in 2003. ARM11 accounted for 21% of license revenues in 2005, compared to 17% in
2004 and 10% in 2003. 32 companies became new ARM Partners in 2005, bringing the total number of semiconductor partners to 172 at the end of 2005.
This total number of semiconductor partners was net of those companies that have signed licenses with ARM in the past but have since been acquired by
other companies or who no longer have access to ARM technology for other reasons.
In October 2005, we formally launched the Cortex-A8 processor, the industry’s fastest embedded processor to date and the first complete processing solution
comprising a broad portfolio of ARM technology to reduce time-to-market. The award-winning Cortex-A8 processor is expected to revolutionize consumer and
low-power mobile devices, enabling the delivery of higher levels of entertainment and innovation to end users. Its performance and power utilization
characteristics make it ideal for demanding consumer products running multi-channel video, audio and gaming applications. The exceptional speed and power
efficiency of the Cortex-A8 processor is enabled by new ARM Artisan libraries supporting technologies such as Intelligent Energy Manager (IEM). Additionally,
the new processor features ARM TrustZone technology for secure transactions. The ARM TrustZone Software Application Program Interface (API) is gaining
wide industry endorsement and quickly becoming a standard foundation for the implementation of security functions such as digital rights management,
device protection and payment.
The Cortex-M3 processor has been licensed to four lead partners to date. Initial product deliveries were successfully made to the lead partners in Q4 2005
and the product is now available for mainstream licensing. Test silicon for the Cortex-M3 processor has been received and is exhibiting higher performance
and smaller size characteristics than initially expected. The Cortex-M3 processor is specifically designed to meet the requirement for high system
performance in microcontrollers and other very cost-sensitive embedded applications such as automotive products and white goods. The microcontroller
market has traditionally been serviced by 8- and 16-bit devices, but it has seen a substantial increase in performance requirements as users demand greater
flexibility based in software, and as cost pressures drive the consolidation of applications on to a single device. The Cortex-M3 processor, with multiple
technologies to reduce memory use whilst delivering industry-leading power and performance, provides an ideal platform both to accelerate the migration
of thousands of applications from legacy components to 32-bit microcontrollers and for use in such products as ultra low-cost mobile handsets.
The third Cortex family product available for mainstream licensing in 2006, currently code-named “ServalE”, has been licensed by two lead partners to date.
ARM’s ServalE next-generation processor for deeply-embedded applications is expected to be available for mainstream licensing in the first half of 2006.
License revenues from non-core products, covering items such as platforms, peripherals, embedded trace modules, embedded software, data engines,
models and sub-systems, increased in 2005 to £11.1 million from £10.5 million in 2004 and £8.9 million in 2003 representing approximately 16% of license
revenues in 2005, 18% in 2004 and 18% in 2003.
2005 saw the first synergistic benefits from the combination of ARM and Artisan, both in terms of revenue and technology collaboration, with a total of seven
synergistic revenue deals signed in 2005. Synergistic deals include both instances of physical IP being licensed to ARM Partners and instances of contracts
being won against the competition due to both processor and physical IP being available from ARM. ARM’s Physical IP division (PIPD) reported license
revenues of £34.8 million in 2005, representing approximately 33% of total license revenues.
In the first half of 2005, ARM introduced the first innovative business model to result from the combination of ARM and Artisan, with the announcement 
on 11 April 2005 of the launch of the ARM DesignStart programme, a potentially significant broadening of the reach of ARM’s existing Foundry Programme,
which allows developers access to the ARM7TDMI processor for the TSMC, UMC, SMIC and Chartered Semiconductor process technologies at no initial charge.
By leveraging the web-based distribution channel developed by Artisan, developers are able to gain early access to ARM technology to complete the design
process all the way through to chip-level verification. Once the design is finished and ready for fabrication, a single-use design license can be purchased
from ARM to receive a full set of deliverables, enabling tape out and manufacture at any of the supported foundries.
As well as the Cortex-A8 processor, we are already developing other products which benefit from the integration of processor and physical IP . In January
2006, we unveiled a ground-breaking high performance implementation of the ARM1176JZF-S processor, enhanced with the ARM Artisan Advantage cell
library and memories, which achieves a frequency of more than 750 MHz in a high-performance 90nm foundry process while occupying less than 2.4 mm
2
of silicon area. This represents a significant performance increase through a combination of collaborative design, advanced physical IP and process
technology. The optimized implementation delivers an industry-leading performance for existing applications and operating systems without the need for
expensive software re-design or re-compilation. Further, the ongoing collaboration between PIPD and ARM’s Fabric IP business unit yielded fruit in the fourth
quarter of 2005 with the first 130nm test chip with combined DDR and PrimeCell peripherals being received back from the fab and working first time.
Revenues from the sale of development systems increased from £17.9 million in 2003 to £19.7 million in 2004 to £25.7 million in 2005 representing
approximately 14%, 13% and 11% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. This growth has been generated by working with customers on
longer term relationships for the supply of RealView® Developer tools for software development, continued momentum behind the RealView Create tools
for Electronic System Level design tools (“ESL”) customers and a buoyant market place for tools to support the broad portfolio of ARM microprocessors.
Development Systems has entered into more multi-year contracts for larger product volumes which improves the visibility of business going forward and
builds a good customer base from which to drive new innovation.
Following the acquisition of Axys in August 2004, ARM has further strengthened its Development Systems business with the acquisition of two microcontroller
tools suppliers in October 2005, namely Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. These acquisitions enable ARM to benefit even further from the accelerating
growth in the 32-bit microcontroller market and provides the Company access to a well-developed channel through which to sell microcontroller toolkits in
order to address the much larger customer base associated with this market.
80 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Operating and financial review and prospects/US GAAP/continued Royalties are either set as a percentage of the licensee’s net sales price per chip or, less frequently, as a fixed amount and are recognized when the
Company receives notification from the customer of product sales. In effect, this means that it is normally in the quarter following the shipments that data
is received and so royalty data for a year reflects actual shipments made from the beginning of October of the previous year to the end of September of the
current year. Royalties increased from £44.3 million in 2003 to £59.6 million in 2004 and increased further to £87.8 million in 2005, representing 34%, 39%
and 38% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. The 2005 revenues are split £72.5 million from the processor division royalties and £15.3
million from the physical IP division. Volume shipments increased from 782 million units in 2003 to 1,272 million in 2004, with the increase in volumes
coming from all market segments, especially consumer entertainment and storage products. Total unit shipments in 2005 of 1,662 million were 31% up on
2004. Unit shipments in the mobile segment grew by 23% year-on-year and in the non-mobile segments by 46%. Growth in the non-mobile segments was
achieved across a broad range of product applications including hard disk drives, games consoles, smart cards, printers, DVD players, flash memory products,
digital still cameras, WiFi chipsets and automotive products.
The Company expects royalty revenues to grow year-on-year although they may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter. The total
number of partners shipping ARM technology-based product at the end of 2005 was 68 after taking into account corporate activity within the ARM partnership.
19 companies are paying royalties for physical IP products at the end of the year. Royalties within PIPD have demonstrated market share growth against the
backdrop of a difficult year for the foundries.
Service revenues Service revenues consist of design consulting services and revenues from support, maintenance and training. Service revenues decreased
from £15.1 million in 2003 to £14.2 million in 2004, but grew to £14.7 million in 2005, representing 12%, 9% and 6% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and
2005 respectively. The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to foreign exchange as the majority of revenues for the business are in US dollars and service
revenues for 2003, 2004 and 2005 grew from $24.5 million to $25.1 million to $26.5 million respectively. 
Geographic analysis Operating in a global environment, the geographic destinations of the Company’s revenues fluctuate from period to period depending
upon the country of origin of its customers. The pattern of revenues in 2005 was 43% of revenues coming from the US, 18% from Japan, 25% from Asia
Pacific, excluding Japan, and 14% from Europe. In 2004, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 21%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 13%, and Europe
15%. In 2003, revenues from the US represented 51%, Japan 19%, Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, 12%, and Europe 18%. 
Product costs Product costs are limited to variable costs of production such as the costs of manufacture of development systems, amortization of our third-
party technology licenses, cross-license payments to collaborative partners and time of engineers on PIPD projects. Product costs were £6.2 million in 2003,
£6.7 million in 2004 and £19.3 million in 2005, representing 5%, 4% and 8% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. The large increase in
product costs in 2005 is as a result of the PIPD direct costs of revenue, namely the associated engineering time spent on revenue-projects. Approximately
two-thirds of total product cost of sales were made up of development systems costs in both 2004 and 2003, with the balance comprising additional costs
related to the costs of third-party licenses and cross-license payments to collaborative partners. In 2005, the proportion of development systems costs fell 
to approximately a quarter, PIPD direct costs approximately two-thirds and the balance third-party licenses and cross-license payments. Product gross margin
in 2005 was 91%, compared to 95% in 2004 and 95% in 2003. In 2005, product gross margin in the Company excluding PIPD was 96% and for PIPD was
75%. The Company does not currently expect a significant increase in product costs in 2006.
Service costs Service costs include the costs of support and maintenance services to licensees of ARM technology as well as the costs directly attributable to
consulting work performed for third parties. Cost of services increased from £4.9 million in 2003 to £5.1 million in 2004 and £6.1 million in 2005. The gross
margins earned on service revenues were approximately 68% in 2003, 64% in 2004 and 59% in 2005. Whilst services revenues have remained relatively flat
in 2004 and 2005, costs have increased as the business invests more into the engineering departments, a proportion of which is allocated to services costs.
Research and development costs Research and development costs increased from £48.1 million in 2003 to £50.1 million in 2004 to £60.1 million in 2005,
representing 38%, 33% and 26% of total revenues in 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. Continued investment in research and development remains an
essential part of the Company’s strategy since the development of new products to license is key to its ongoing success. 
Total engineering headcount increased from 442 at the end of 2003 to 739 at the end of 2004. The increase in 2004 was due to the acquisitions of both
Artisan and Axys as well as some growth within the existing business. Engineering headcount at the end of 2005 was 846 with the increases coming from
organic growth predominantly in India but in all locations around the world, as well as from the Keil acquisitions.
Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenditure increased from £23.0 million in 2003 to £23.9 million in 2004 and was £34.1 million in 2005,
representing 18% of total revenues in 2003, 16% in 2004, and 15% in 2005. Headcount in this area increased from 203 at 31 December 2003 to 282 at the
end of 2004, and was 297 at the end of 2005. Most of the growth in 2004 came from the acquisitions but there was also growth with new offices opening
in Bangalore, India and Beijing, PR China. The total number of offices with sales people is currently 22 and this enables improved contact with the
Company’s geographically diverse customer base. 
General and administrative General and administrative headcount at 31 December 2005 was 181, up from 150 at the end of 2004 and 95 at the end 
of 2003. Again, the majority of the increase in 2004 came from the acquisitions, whilst the increase in 2005 has come partly from acquisitions but also
organic growth to strengthen the infrastructure of the Company as it continually expands. General and administrative costs were £28.1 million in 2003,
£30.4 million in 2004 and £37.6 million in 2005, representing 22%, 20% and 16% of total revenues respectively. Costs in 2005 include £0.3 million of
impairments made to investments (2003: £1.6 million; 2004: £nil). Litigation costs were £9.1 million in 2003, £5.1 million in 2004 and £0.4 million in 2005,
fluctuations arising largely as a result of annual variations in the amount of legal expenses relating to patent protection cases and other similar costs. Legal
costs in 2003 were particularly high due to the provision for settlement of the Herodion arbitration which was paid early in 2004. £4.5 million of the costs in
2004 related to a technology license agreement signed in the year. Expense in relation to provisions for doubtful debts were £0.5 million in 2005, a release
of £0.1 million in 2004 and a further release of £0.1 million in 2003. Unrealized future foreign exchange gains on certain committed but not yet invoiced
future revenue streams of £2.1 million (2004: losses of £0.7 million; 2003: losses of £1.1 million) were recorded in accordance with SFAS 133. There was a
gain on foreign exchange of £0.9 million in 2003 but losses of £1.5 million and £2.3 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively. See “Foreign Currency
Fluctuations” below.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 81 Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation Deferred stock-based compensation arises on the Company's SAYE and LTIP schemes (see Accounting
for stock-based compensation in note 1 to the financial statements below) and the amortization of charges deferred on new options granted as part of the
acquisition of Artisan. The compensation cost in relation to the SAYE options amounted to £417,000 in 2005 (2004: £341,000; 2003: £310,000), in relation to
the LTIP scheme of £3,814,000 (2004: £619,000; 2003: £241,000) and in respect of the Artisan assumed options of £5,496,000 (2004: £nil; 2003: £nil).
In-process research and development During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. (now ARM Physical
IP Inc.). Those intangible assets that were still in development (known as in-process research and development) were charged directly to the income
statement, amounting to £0.4 million and £3.2 million for Axys and Artisan respectively. A further £0.3 million of Artisan in-process research and
development was charged to the income statement in 2005 as the final valuation of intangibles was completed. All acquired in-process research and
development from the Axys and Artisan acquisitions are progressing as expected with some still incomplete as at 31 December 2005.
Amortization of intangible assets Various licenses to use third party technology have been signed over the past several years, with their values being
capitalized and amortized over the useful economic period that the Company is expected to gain benefit from them (generally between three and five years).
Licenses totaling £4.7 million were purchased during 2001 to 2004 with amortization of these licenses amounting to £0.5 million in 2005 (2004: £0.5 million;
2003: £1.2 million). A further license for £1.0 million was purchased in 2005 and is being amortized over five years with £0.3 million being charged in 2005.
Following the out-of-court settlement of the Company’s litigation against picoTurbo, Inc. in December 2001, picoTurbo assigned its intellectual property rights
to the Company for a payment of £7.5 million. This is being amortized over four years and £1.5 million was charged to the income statement in 2002 
and £2.0 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The Company also purchased a patent for £0.7 million in 2002 which is being amortized over five years. 
The amortization charge was £0.1 million in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
During 2003, the Company purchased Adelante Technologies NV (now ARM Belgium NV). Included with the assets purchased were £0.3 million of intangible
assets comprising developed technology and customer relationships which are being amortized over five years and two years respectively. The amortization
charge for the assets during 2005 and 2004 was £0.1 million in each year (2003: less than £0.1 million). During 2004, the Company purchased Axys Design
Automation Inc and Artisan Components Inc. (now ARM Physical IP Inc.) Intangibles acquired and capitalized as part of these business combinations totaled
£1.9 million and £70.9 million respectively and are being amortized over five years and between one and six years respectively (see note 6 for further
details). The total charge during 2004 was £0.1 million and £0.3 million for Axys and Artisan respectively, and during 2005 was £0.4 million and 
£16.5 million. 
During 2005, the Company purchased Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. Intangibles acquired and capitalized consisted of developed technology,
customer relationships and tradenames and totaled £8.7 million. These are being amortized between two and five years and the amortization during 2005
totaled £0.4 million.
Interest Interest receivable increased from £4.8 million in 2003 to £6.9 million in 2004, but fell to £5.3 million in 2005. The growth in interest in 2003 and
2004 was due to higher average cash balances and increasing interest rates, but fell in 2005 as a result of the cash outflow at the end of 2004 for the
acquisition of Artisan. The Company invested cash balances over periods of up to one year during 2005, although most were for periods less than six months.
Income before income tax Income before income tax was £22.0 million in 2003, £38.5 million in 2004 and £53.2 million in 2005, representing 17%, 25%
and 23% of total revenues respectively. The increased margin in 2004 was due to higher revenue and continued cost control, and would have been higher
without non-recurring and acquisition-related charges of £9.7 million during the year (comprising £4.5 million of a non-recurring technology license charge,
£3.6 million of in-process research and development write-off, £0.6 million of business combination intangible amortization and £1.0 million of deferred
stock-based compensation). Similarly the primary reason for the fall in margin in 2005 was due to acquisition-related charges (in-process research and
development of £0.3 million and £17.4 million of business combination intangible amortization) and deferred stock-based compensation of £10.4 million.
Tax charge The Company’s effective tax rates were 40.7% in 2003, 27.2% in 2004 and 21.3% in 2005. The effective tax rate fell in 2004 with additional
costs being allowable for research and development tax credits, additional deferred tax credits arising from employee share options and some of the non-
cash accounting charges being claimed in 2004. It fell further in 2005 primarily as a result of benefits arising from the structuring of the Artisan acquisition.
Liquidity and capital resources The Company’s operating activities provided net cash of £38.7 million, £46.5 million and £47.2 million in 2003, 2004 and
2005 respectively. 
Accounts receivable fell by £4.5 million in 2003 but increased by £1.4 million in 2004 and £21.2 million in 2005. This is partly due to the overall increasing
revenues earned in the periods leading up to the end of the respective years and also partly due to foreign exchange translation of the underlying dollar
balances. Prepaid expenses fell by £2.8 million in 2003, increased by £3.4 million in 2004 and fell by £1.4 million in 2005. The Company entered into
several leases for design automation tools during 2002, which resulted in an initial large increase in prepaid expenses, but fell in 2003 as a result of the
lease payments being for shorter prepaid periods than in previous years. This has been similar in 2004 and the increase was due to a technology license
agreement signed in the year under which amounts representing prepaid royalties will be released over the next several years. The fall in 2005 reflected
this amortization.
Accounts payable reduced by £2.5 million in 2003, increased in 2004 by £1.2 million but were £1.9 million lower in 2005. This is purely related to the timing
of receipt of supplier invoices in the respective years. Accrued liabilities increased by £7.0 million in 2003, increased by a further £2.8 million in 2004 but fell
by £5.6 million in 2005. The significant increase in 2003 was primarily as a result of the accrual for the Herodion legal settlement of £6.4 million which was
paid early in 2004, and increased in 2004 as a result of provisions for staff costs and further payments on a technology license agreement signed in the
year. These have fallen in 2005 as some payments on the technology license agreement have been made. In addition, accrued employee compensation was
lower in 2005 than in 2004.
82 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Operating and financial review and prospects/US GAAP/continued At 31 December 2005, the Company recorded approximately £20.4 million in deferred revenues which represented cash or receivables scheduled to be
recognized as revenues in varying amounts after 31 December 2005. At 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003, the Company recorded approximately
£21.4 million and £11.1 million respectively in deferred revenues. Deferred revenues are an element of customer backlog, and represent amounts invoiced
to customers not yet recognized as revenues in the income statement. As such this balance fluctuates due to the maturity profile of ARM's products, and
invoicing milestones within contracts. The significant increase in 2004, though, was predominantly due to the acquisition of Artisan.
The Company believes that, given its current level of business, it has sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
Cash flow from operations has been used to fund the working capital requirements of the Company as well as capital expenditure. Capital expenditure in
2005 was £6.1 million, compared with £5.0 million in 2004 and £3.6 million in 2003. Capital expenditure increased in 2004 with increases in both levels 
of staff and a new IT system being designed and implemented during the year. This continued into 2005 as staff levels increased and general operational
assets were replaced.
In 2003, the Company acquired the 15% minority interest in ARM Korea Limited for cash consideration of £3.0 million bringing its holding to 100%. The
Company also acquired the entire share capital of Adelante Technologies N.V. (now renamed ARM Belgium N.V.) for total consideration of £0.4 million.
In 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capitals of Axys Design Automation Inc. and Artisan Components Inc. for total consideration of £6.9 million
and £481.7 million respectively, with cash consideration comprising £6.9 million and £122.3 million respectively. Cash acquired with these businesses
amounted to £82.7 million.
In 2005, the Company made final payments relating to acquisition costs for Artisan of £14.4 million, as well as £1.7 million of contingent consideration from
the Axys acquisition as a result of performance conditions being achieved. A further £4.3 million (net of cash acquired) was paid for the acquisitions of Keil
Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc. The Company envisages making further strategic investments in the future, in situations where the Company can
broaden its product portfolio, where it can obtain skilled engineering resources and where the potential for furthering ARM core-based design wins is improved
significantly.
In 2003 the Company invested a further £1.2 million in Superscape Group plc as part of a further funding round, thus maintaining its holding. In 2004, the
Company invested a total of £0.2 million in two small unlisted companies, Zeevo Inc. and Reciva Limited, giving a minority holding of less than 3% in both
companies. In 2005, £0.3 million was invested via convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc., a small unlisted company.
During 2005, the Company initiated a share buyback program to supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders. During 2005, the Company
bought back over 13.9 million shares at a total cost of £16.2 million. Dividends totalling £10.4 million were also paid to shareholders during the year (2004:
£9.0 million). Share option exercises during the year gave rise to £13.9 million cash inflow to the Company compared to £1.3 million in 2004.
Cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term investment and marketable securities balances at 31 December 2005 were £160.9 million compared to 
£142.8 million at 31 December 2004 and £159.8 million at 31 December 2003.
Foreign currency fluctuations The Company’s earnings and liquidity are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the US dollar
rate, reflecting the fact that most of the Company’s revenues and cash receipts are denominated in US dollars while a high proportion of its costs are in sterling. 
The Company reduces this US dollar/sterling risk where possible by currency hedging. Due to the high value and timing of receipts on individual licenses and
the requirement to settle certain expenses in US dollars, the Company reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a transaction-by-transaction basis. It then
hedges this exposure using forward contracts for the sale of US dollars, which are negotiated with major UK clearing banks. The average size of each forward
contract was $4.6 million in 2003, $5.1 million in 2004 and $4.3 million in 2005. The Company also uses currency options as a further translation instrument
for limited proportions of its dollar exposure. The fair values of the financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 are disclosed 
in note 15 to the financial statements. The settlement period of the forward contracts outstanding at 31 December 2005 is between 12 January 2006 and
29 March 2006. The settlement period of the option contracts outstanding at 31 December 2005 is between 10 January 2006 and 27 December 2006.
Quantitative and qualitative information on market risk During the preceding fiscal year, the Company was exposed to foreign currency exchange risk
inherent in its sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than sterling. ARM transacts
business in approximately eight foreign currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to the Company's operations were the US dollar, the euro and
the Japanese yen for 2005. For most currencies, the Company is a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefits from a weaker sterling and is
adversely affected by a stronger sterling relative to those foreign currencies. The Company has performed a sensitivity analysis at 31 December 2005, 2004
and 2003, using a modeling technique that measures the changes in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of
foreign currency exchange rates relative to sterling with all other variables held constant. The analysis covers all of the Company's foreign currency contracts
offset by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at 31 December 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of
ARM's foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of £3.9 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: £8.6 million, 2003: £0.7 million).
Risk factors The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which is characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change,
short product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition. The Company believes that its future operating results
will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors. These include the timing of entering into agreements with new
licensees, the mixture of license fees, royalties and fees from services, the introduction of new technology by the Company, the timing of orders from, and
shipments to, systems companies of ARM core-based microprocessors from the Company’s semiconductor partners and sudden technological change in the
microprocessor industry. 
Other risks include the reliance on semiconductor partners, dependence upon systems companies, patent protection, attraction and retention of employees,
management of growth, competition and vulnerability to general economic conditions. Risk factors are more fully discussed in the Company’s annual report
on Form 20-F.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements. 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies
The business of the Company ARM Holdings plc and its subsidiary companies (“ARM” or “the Company”) design reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
microprocessors, physical IP and related technology and software, and sell Development Systems, to enhance the performance, cost-effectiveness and
power-efficiency of high-volume embedded applications. The Company licenses and sells its technology and products to leading international electronics
companies, which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard
processors (ASSPs) based on the Company’s architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products. By creating a network
of Partners, and working with them to best utilize the Company’s technology, the Company is establishing its architecture as a RISC processor for use in many
high-volume embedded microprocessor applications, including digital cellular phones, modems and automotive functions and for potential use in many
growing markets, including smart cards and digital video. The Company also licenses and sells Development Systems direct to systems companies and
provides consulting and support services to its licensees, systems companies and other systems designers. The Company’s principal geographic markets are
Europe, the US and Asia Pacific.
Incorporation and history ARM is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. The Company was formed on 16 October
1990, as a joint venture between Apple Computer (UK) Limited, and Acorn Computers Limited, and operated under the name Advanced RISC Machines
Holdings Limited until 10 March 1998, when its name was changed to ARM Holdings plc. Its initial public offering was on 17 April 1998.
Group undertakings include ARM Limited (incorporated in the UK), ARM Inc. (incorporated in the US), ARM Physical IP Inc. (formerly Artisan Components Inc.,
incorporated in the US), Axys Design Automation Inc. (incorporated in the US), Keil Software Inc. (incorporated in the US, acquired during 2005), ARM KK
(incorporated in Japan), ARM Korea Limited (incorporated in South Korea), ARM France SAS (incorporated in France), ARM Belgium N.V. (incorporated in
Belgium), ARM Germany GmbH (incorporated in Germany, renamed during 2005), Keil Elektronik GmbH (incorporated in Germany, acquired during 2005),
ARM Embedded Technologies Pvt Limited (incorporated in India, renamed during 2005), ARM Physical IP Asia Pacific Pte. Limited (incorporated in Singapore,
renamed during 2005), ARM Taiwan Limited (incorporated in Taiwan) and ARM Consulting (Shanghai) Co. Limited (incorporated in PR China). All entities are
100% owned.
Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP).
The Company maintains its accounting records and prepares its financial statements in UK sterling. Purely for the convenience of the reader, the 
31 December 2005 consolidated financial statements have been translated from sterling at the closing rate on 31 December 2005 of £1.00 = $1.7168. 
Such translations should not be construed as representations that the sterling amounts represent, or have been or could be so converted into US dollars 
at that rate or at any other rate.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. Intra-group
transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on consolidation. The results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are
included in the income statement from the date they are acquired. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities that exist at the date of
acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Investments Publicly traded investments are classed as available for sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.115,
“Accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities”, and are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities are
included, net of related taxes, in other comprehensive income. Other-than-temporary impairment losses and realized gains and losses of such securities are
reported in earnings. Equity securities that are not publicly traded are recorded at cost less permanent diminution in value; at 31 December 2005 and 2004,
the estimated fair value of these investments approximated their recorded basis, based on estimates determined by management. 
During 2002 and 2003, the Company made investments in Superscape Group plc, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The approximate holding
at 31 December 2005 is 8%. In 2004, the Company made a less than 1% investment in Zeevo Inc., and a less than 3% investment in Reciva Limited. In
2005, the Company made an investment by way of convertible loan notes in Luminary Micro Inc.
Intangible assets Purchased patents and licenses to use technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the
time that the Company is expected to benefit from them. 
Although an independent valuation is made of any intangible assets purchased as part of a business combination, management is primarily responsible for
determining the fair value of intangible assets. Such assets are capitalized and amortized over a period of one to six years, being a prudent estimate of the
time that the Company is expected to benefit from them, with the exception of in-process research and development which is written off immediately. 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid on acquisition of a business over the fair value of the assets, including
any intangible assets identified and liabilities acquired. 
Prior to 2002, purchased goodwill was capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over a prudent estimate of the time that the Company is expected
to benefit from it. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, on 1 January 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill. The value of goodwill carried forward at the
end of 2001 has been frozen at £2,274,000. This goodwill, together with goodwill arising on acquisitions since 2002, will be tested for impairment at least
annually. An annual impairment review in 2005 determined that there was no indication of impairment with respect to goodwill. The estimates of future
cash flows involve considerable management judgement and are based on assumptions about expected future operating performance. The actual cash
flows could differ from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. 
88 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
In accordance with SFAS 131 "Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information", the Company has identified its operating segments
based on the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in monitoring the business. For the purposes of assessing the carrying value of
goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to reporting units. Based on the nature and extent of discrete information available to management,
the Company believes that, for ARM, each operating segment consists of a single reporting unit. Goodwill has been allocated to the two reporting units on
the “with and without” basis in accordance with SFAS 142.
Impairment charges The Company reviews long-lived assets, identifiable intangibles and related goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) of the long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets, an impairment loss would be
recognized, and the assets would be written down to their estimated fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements with customers to enable them to use the
Company’s intellectual property (IP), which may be customized to each customer’s manufacturing process. The Company receives royalties on sales by the
Company’s customers of products containing ARM technology. It also supplies off-the-shelf software tools, bought-in boards and toolkits, training and
consultancy services. 
The Company primarily earns revenues from licensing its IP to leading electronics companies which in turn manufacture, market and sell microprocessors,
ASICs and ASSPs based on the Company’s architecture to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products. The Company’s IP consists
of software and related documentation which enables a customer to design and manufacture microprocessors and related technology and software. Most
licenses are designed to meet the specific requirements of each customer and are generally not time limited in their application. In general, the time between
the signing of a license and final validation of the customer’s ARM-compliant product is between six and 15 months. Upgrades or modifications to the licensed
IP are not provided. Following validation of the customer’s ARM-compliant product, the Company has no further obligations under the license agreement.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, “Accounting for performance of construction-type and certain production type contracts”, when license agreements include
deliverables that require “significant production, modification or customization”, contract accounting is applied. Revenues from license fees are recognized
based on the percentage-of-completion method over the period from signing of the license to validation of the customer’s ARM-compliant product and the
completion of all outstanding obligations. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the total license fees under the license agreement, or that portion
of the total license fees which is determined to be fixed or determinable in arrangements involving extended payment terms and the percentage-of-
completion achieved. Those amounts that are not deemed fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement are recognized as the payments become
due. Where an arrangement is for multiple elements, each requiring significant production, modification or customization, the Company evaluates whether
the bifurcation criteria of SOP 81-1 are met, and if so, the total arrangement fee is allocated accordingly. The percentage-of-completion is measured by
monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project, compared with the total estimated project requirement. Revenues are
recognized only when collectability is probable. Estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization, delivery and
validation of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management. Under the percentage-of-completion method,
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined.
Agreements that include rights to unspecified products (as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements) are accounted for using subscription
accounting, revenue from the arrangement being recognized over the term of the arrangement, or an estimate of the economic life of the products offered
if no term is specified, beginning with the delivery of the first product. 
In accordance with SOP 97-2, “Software revenue recognition”, where agreements involve multiple elements that do not require “significant production,
modification or customization”, the Company recognizes license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
product has been shipped or electronically delivered, the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Where
arrangements include multiple elements, the revenue recognition criteria for each element are typically met within the same accounting period, ie. on delivery
of the elements. If an element is undelivered at a period end, the Company determines whether it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE)
of fair value in order to make an allocation amongst the elements. With the exception of post-contract support (PCS) and certain recharacterization services
undertaken by the Company’s Physical IP division, the Company does not currently believe it has sufficient VSOE to make such allocations. Accordingly, no
revenue is recognized on arrangements where deliverables other than PCS and those recharacterization services that are deemed to provide VSOE of their
fair value remain outstanding.
License fees are considered fixed or determinable if they are not dependent on customers completing specific milestones and they are not subject to extended
payment terms, i.e. the payment terms do not extend over a substantial period when compared to the payment terms in similar license arrangements and
when compared with the licensed products’ life cycles. If all the fees in an arrangement are deemed to be fixed or determinable, the Company recognizes
revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The excess of revenue recognized in respect of such fees over fees invoiced is recorded
as an accrued revenue asset. Where an arrangement includes fees that are not deemed fixed or determinable, revenue from the arrangement is recognized
as the payments become due and the excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
PCS consists of an identified customer contact at the Company, and telephone or e-mail support (including certain bug fixes). PCS is generally priced
separately from the initial licensing fee. Revenue allocated to PCS is determined based on VSOE. VSOE is determined with reference to contractual renewal
rates, or, if none are specified, by reference to the rate actually charged on renewal for the same level of support and for the same or similar technologies 
for PCS arrangements. PCS revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which support and maintenance is contractually agreed by the
Company with the licensee.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 89 1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Certain products have been co-developed by the Company and a collaborative partner, with both parties retaining the right to sell licenses to the product. 
In those cases where the Company makes sales of these products and considers itself to be the principal under EITF 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal versus Net as an Agent", the total value of the license is recorded as revenue and the amount payable to the collaborative partner is recorded as
cost of sales. Where the collaborative partner makes sales of these products, the Company records as revenue the commission it is due when informed by
the collaborative partner that a sale has been made and cash has been collected.
Sales of boards and toolkits are recognized upon delivery. While some arrangements with distributors provide very limited rights of return, the Company's
history is that actual returns are negligible and accordingly no provisions are deemed necessary.
Services, such as consulting and training are typically sold in stand-alone arrangements. Where they are sold in conjunction with other deliverables and they
are not considered essential to the functionality of those other deliverables, they are accounted for separately based on VSOE, if VSOE has been established.
Revenue for these services is recognized as the services are performed and collectability is probable. If VSOE for the services does not exist or the services
are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the other deliverables in the arrangement, the entire arrangement fee is recognized as the services are
performed. The excess of fees invoiced over revenue recognized in respect of such fees is recorded as a deferred revenue liability.
Revenues from consulting projects, which are typically of a short duration, are recognized when the service has been provided and all obligations to the
customer under the consulting agreement have been fulfilled. For longer term and more complex consulting projects, typically containing several project
milestones, where significant modification to ARM core-based IP is required, revenues are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as milestones 
are achieved. This method approximates to percentage-of-completion based on labor inputs.
Royalty revenues are earned on sales by the Company’s customers of products containing ARM technology. Revenues are recognized when the Company
receives notification from the customer of product sales, or receives payment of any fixed royalties. Notification is typically received in the quarter following
shipment of product by the customer.
Where the Company enters into more than one agreement with the same customer in the same, short time frame, an assessment is made to establish
whether the group of agreements is so closely related that they effectively form a single multiple-element arrangement. The factors considered in making
this assessment include, but are not limited to:
– whether the different elements are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of design, technology, or function;
– whether the fee for one or more of the agreements is subject to a refund or forfeiture or other concession if one of the other contracts is not completed
satisfactorily;
– whether one or more elements in one agreement are essential to the functionality of an element in another agreement;
– whether payment terms under one agreement coincide with performance criteria of another agreement; and
– whether the negotiations are conducted jointly with two or more parties to do what in essence is a single project.
Where the Company enters into a license arrangement in exchange for a license to the customer's technology, in the absence of evidence of fair value of
the arrangement, the transaction is recorded at carry-over basis.
Research and development All ongoing research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Costs include salaries of
engineers and associated staff, relevant EDA tools costs and other directly related expenditure, such as contractors, as well as a proportion of central facilities
costs. The facilities costs for each office are allocated according to the proportion of employees in engineering functions within these offices.
Grants Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are receivable from the European Commission, a European organization which funds
certain research and development activities on application to it for the purposes of furthering research and development activities within the European
Union. The Company retains significant rights to IP developed under projects which are funded under these arrangements. Grants received are intended to
cover 50% of expected project costs. Grant income is recognized over the period of the project in line with the costs incurred. Unconditional undertakings
have been received from the European Commission to provide the funding, and there is no obligation to refund any amounts already received. Amounts
receivable under these arrangements in the year ended 31 December 2005 were £nil (2004: £338,000; 2003: £226,000) and were netted against related
research and development costs.
Pension costs The Company contributes to defined contribution plans substantially covering all employees in Europe and the US and to government pension
schemes for employees in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, PR China and Israel. The Company contributes to these plans based upon various fixed percentages 
of employee compensation and such contributions are expensed as incurred. The amount of contributions expensed by the Company for the years ended 
31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005 were £1,848,000, £2,067,000 and £3,371,000 respectively.
Loss contingencies The Company accrues an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
Cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short-term investments and marketable securities The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of greater than 
three months but less than one year to be either short-term investments (when invested on deposit with major clearing banks) or short-term marketable
securities (when custodied with major financial institutions). Any investments with a maturity date of greater than one year are classified as long-term
marketable securities.

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 91
1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
Allowance for doubtful debts Allowance is made for doubtful debts following reviews of individual customer circumstances by management. 
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. In general, cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes transport
and handling costs. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property and equipment The cost of property and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. Costs that are directly
attributable to the development of new business application software and which are incurred during the period prior to the date that the software is placed
into operational use, are capitalized. External costs and internal costs are capitalized to the extent they enhance the future economic benefit of the business.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of property and equipment, less their estimated residual values, on a straight-line basis over the
expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal economic lives used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 25 years
Leasehold improvements Five years or term of lease, whichever is shorter
Computers and software Three to five years
Fixtures and fittings Five to ten years
Motor vehicles Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of property and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Currency translation The functional currency for the Company’s operations is the local currency in which each operation operates.
The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Statements of income of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the monthly exchange rates during the year. Translation differences are taken to the
cumulative translation adjustment.
The Company utilizes forward exchange contracts and currency options to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable,
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business. The Company’s forward exchange contracts do not subject the Company to
risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
Because the Company does not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the forward and option contracts and the related accounts receivable are recorded at
fair value at each period end. All recognized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative
costs in the income statement. The fair value of derivative instruments are disclosed within either prepaid expenses and other assets or accrued liabilities on
the balance sheet and within net cash provided by operating activities in the cash flow statement. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange
contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Other transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences have
been included in general and administrative costs.
From time to time, the Company enters into sales contracts denominated in a currency (typically US dollars) that is neither the functional currency of the
Company nor the functional currency of the customer. In accordance with SFAS 133, “Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities”, where
there are unpaid amounts on such contracts, the Company carries such derivatives at fair value. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income
statement under general and administrative costs. For the year ended 31 December 2005 the gain on exchange is £2,101,000 (2004: loss £732,000; 2003:
loss £1,141,000).
Income taxes Income taxes are computed using the liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the asset will not be realized.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed by including potential common shares where the effect of their inclusion would be dilutive. The diluted share base for the 
year ended 31 December 2005 excludes incremental shares of approximately 39,614,000 (2004: 38,143,000; 2003: 18,948,000) related to employee 
stock options. These shares are excluded due to their antidilutive effect as a result of the exercise price of these shares being higher than the market 
price. The ordinary equivalent shares for share options were determined using the treasury stock method.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company has elected to use the intrinsic value-based method to account for all its employee stock-based
compensation plans, under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for stock issued to employees”, and related
interpretations. Stock-based employee compensation cost in respect of certain SAYE options (see below) of £417,000 (2004: £341,000; 2003: £310,000), in
respect of the LTIP of £3,814,000 (2004: £619,000; 2003: £241,000) and in respect of stock options issued as part of a business combination of £5,496,000
(2004: £nil; 2003: £nil) is reflected in net income. Approximately £3.2 million of the charge for the LTIP in 2005 was due to an increase in the number of
awards that were expected to vest, predominantly from the 2003 scheme, due to an improvement in the Company’s total shareholder return compared to The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
the comparator groups in the year. No compensation cost is recorded in respect of the other stock option plans, as all options granted under those plans had
an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Apart from certain options issued to executive directors,
there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options. For executive directors, discretionary share options of up to two times base salary
may be issued each year that will vest after seven years. If, however, the Company achieves defined levels of EPS growth above the rate of inflation over 
a period of three years, then the options are exercisable after three years.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB

The fair value of options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003: risk-free interest rate of 4.0% (2004: between 4.0% and 4.5%; 2003: between 3.2% and 4.9%); expected life of between
one and five years; between 40% and 50% (2004: between 44% and 96%; 2003: between 60% and 127%) volatility; and dividend yield of 0.7% (2004:
between 0.5% and 0.7%; 2003: nil). The grant date fair value of options granted during 2005 ranged from £0.21 to £0.54 (2004: £0.30 to £0.88; 2003:
£0.21 to £0.55).
The Company operates Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the US. Options under these schemes
are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue,
which stipulates that the savings period must be at least 36 months. During 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus, contained
within EITF 00-23, that savings plans which have a savings period in excess of 27 months should be treated as compensatory. In accordance with EITF 00-23,
which applies to new offers after 24 January 2002, the Company has recognized a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans offered since that
date. The compensation charge is calculated as the difference between the market price of the shares at the date of grant and the exercise price of the
option and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the savings period. The compensation charge recorded in 2005 is £417,000 (2004: £341,000; 2003:
£310,000). The deferred compensation at 31 December 2005 was £329,000 (2004: £599,000; 2003: £1,081,000). 
In addition, the EITF reached a consensus that an employer’s offer to enter into a new SAYE contract at a lower price than an existing contract causes
variable accounting for all existing awards subject to the offer. Variable accounting commences for all existing awards when the offer is made, and for those
awards that are retained by employees because the offer is declined, variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire
unexercised. New awards are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are canceled. The compensation charge recorded in
2005 as a result of these provisions is £206,000 (2004: £115,000; 2003: £109,000). The number of options to which variable accounting applies is
approximately 867,000 (2004: 908,000; 2003: 950,000).
The Company has an LTIP on which it is also required to recognize a compensation charge calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the
fair market value of the shares at the period end, over the vesting period of the share awards. During 2005, a charge of £3,814,000 (2004: £619,000; 2003:
£241,000) was incurred and deferred compensation at 31 December 2005 was £1,233,000 (2004: £1,905,000; 2003: £1,418,000).
As part of the consideration for Artisan, the Company granted approximately 90.4 million options over shares in ARM Holdings plc to employees of Artisan
with substantially the same terms of those enjoyed when they were options over Artisan shares. As a result, a significant proportion of the options were
already vested at acquisition. The intrinsic value of the unvested options was recorded as reduction in shareholders' funds and a reduction in goodwill. This
amount is then charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options. During 2005, a charge of £5,496,000 was incurred and
deferred compensation at 31 December 2005 was £2,842,000 (2004: £9,579,000).
Treasury stock Treasury stock represents the cost of shares in the Company held by the Company, the Employee Benefit Trust (ESOP) and the QUEST.
During 2005, to supplement the payment of dividends to shareholders, the Company began a rolling share buyback programme under the shareholder
authority conferred at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The quantum and frequency of share repurchases is not predetermined and will take into account
prevailing market conditions, the short-to-medium-term cash needs of the business and the level of employee share-based remuneration going forward.

1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
In 2005, a total of 13,868,000 shares were repurchased in the market at a cost of £16,211,000. At 31 December 2005, there were 12,751,107 shares in the
Company still held from these purchases with a market value of £15,429,000.
The ESOP was set up on 16 April 1998 to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of employees. Under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan,
7,760,881 shares could be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and treasury stock held by the Company. The market value of unearned
shares at 31 December 2005 was £6,050,000.
All costs relating to the schemes are recognized in the income statement as they accrue and the ESOP has waived the right to receive dividends of over and
above 0.01 pence per share on all shares held. For the purpose of earnings per share calculations, the shares are treated as canceled until such time as they
vest unconditionally.
The Company also has a QUEST which was established to acquire new shares in the Company for the benefit of employees and directors of the Company.
No shares were purchased in 2005, 2004 or 2003. During 2005, 713,034 shares (2004: 8,046) were allocated from the QUEST following the exercise of
share options granted under the Company’s SAYE schemes. Under the terms of the trust deed, dividends have been waived on the shares held by the
QUEST, and all costs relating to the scheme are dealt with in the income statement as they accrue. Following the allocations in 2005, the QUEST held no
further shares in the Company and is in the process of being wound-up.
Employer’s taxes on share options Employer’s National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of
certain share options issued to employees in certain tax jurisdictions. In accordance with EITF 00-16 no provision has been made for the employer’s taxes 
on these share options. These amounts are recognized in the consolidated income statement when payable.
Recently issued accounting standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No.
123R) “Share-based payment”. SFAS No. 123R will require the Company to expense share-based payments, including employee stock options, based on
their fair value. 
SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods. The first adoption method is a “modified prospective”
method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (i) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and (ii) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective
date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The second adoption method is a “modified retrospective” method, which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under
SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures, either (i) all prior periods presented or (ii) prior interim periods in the year of adoption. 
ARM is required to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective as of 1 January 2006, and plans to utilize the modified prospective method of adoption. As permitted by
SFAS No. 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees under APB No. 25 using the intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options except the LTIP and SAYE Schemes. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R’s fair
value method will have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, although it will have no impact on the Company’s overall financial
position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior years, the impact of that adoption would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as currently presented. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption and, upon adoption in 2006, the Company
will restate its prior consolidated statements of cash flows to reflect this classification. 
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153 (FAS 153) “Exchanges of non-monetary assets” – an amendment of APB opinion No. 29 “Accounting 
for non-monetary transactions” (APB 29). FAS 153 is based on the principle that non-monetary asset exchanges should be recorded and measured at the
fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain exceptions. This standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be accounted for at fair value, rather
than at carryover basis, unless (i) neither the asset received nor the asset surrendered has a fair value that is determinable within reasonable limits or (ii)
the transactions lack commercial substance (as defined). In addition, the FASB decided to retain the guidance in APB 29 for assessing whether the fair value 
of a non-monetary asset is determinable within reasonable limits. The new standard is the result of the convergence project between the FASB and the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). We will adopt this standard for non-monetary asset exchanges beginning in 2006. The adoption of FAS 153
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47 “Accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” (FIN 47) which clarifies that the term “conditional asset
retirement obligation” as used in FASB Statement No. 143 “Accounting for asset retirement obligations” (SFAS No. 143), refers to a legal obligation to
perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the entity. FIN 47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the
liability can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 was effective as of 31 December 2005, and has had no impact on the consolidated results.
In May 2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 154 “Accounting changes and error corrections” a replacement of APB opinion No. 20 and FASB statement
No. 3 (SFAS No. 154). Previously, APB No. 20 “Accounting changes” and SFAS No. 3 “Reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” required
the inclusion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in net income of the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires companies to
recognize a change in accounting principle, including a change required by a new accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include
specific transition provisions, retrospectively to prior periods’ financial statements. ARM will assess the impact of a retrospective application of a change 
in accounting principle in accordance with SFAS No. 154 when such a change arises after the effective date of 1 January 2006.  94 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued
1 The Company and a summary of its significant accounting policies continued
In November 2005, FASB finalized FSP FAS 115-1 “The meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments”. The FSP
provides guidance on the recognition of impairments deemed other-than-temporary. FSP 115-1 is effective for other-than-temporary impairment analysis
conducted in periods beginning after 15 December 2005. We believe that our current policy on other-than-temporary impairments complies with FSP 115-1.
Accordingly, the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Companies Act 1985 These financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the Companies Act 1985 of Great
Britain (the Companies Act). The Company’s statutory accounts, which are its primary financial statements, are prepared in accordance with International
Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS) for consolidated accounts and accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP) for ARM
Holdings plc company-only accounts. They are prepared in compliance with the Companies Act and are presented in pounds sterling. Statutory accounts
(upon which the auditors gave unqualified reports under Section 235 of the Companies Act and which did not contain statements under sub-sections 237(2)
and (3) of the Companies Act) for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 have been, and those for the year ended 31 December 2005 will be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales. Dividends are required to be declared in sterling out of profits available for that purpose as
determined in accordance with UK GAAP and the Companies Act.
2 Related party transactions
During the year, the Company paid royalties of £33,000 (2004: £411,000; 2003: £nil) and made cross-license payments of £26,000 (2004: £14,000; 2003:
£453,000) to Superscape Group plc, a company in which Mike Inglis is a non-executive director. £nil (2004: £nil) was owed to Superscape at 31 December
2005. Also during 2005, the Company received license fees of £321,000 (2004: £209,000; 2003: £157,000) and support and maintenance income of
£37,000 (2004: £37,000; 2003: £nil) from CSR plc, a company in which John Scarisbrick is an executive director. £nil was owed by CSR at 31 December 2005

UK income taxes have not been provided at 31 December 2005 on unremitted earnings of approximately £14,958,000 (2004: £5,670,000; 2003:
£6,891,000) of subsidiaries located outside the UK as such earnings are considered to be permanently invested. If these earnings were to be remitted
without offsetting tax credits in the UK, withholding taxes would be approximately £2,379,000 (2004: £1,122,000; 2003: £347,000). The valuation allowance
relates to net operating loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, where management believes it is more likely than not such amounts will not be realized.
None of the loss carryforwards expires before 2018. The future use of the net operating losses carried forward in ARM Inc. may be restricted in the event of
a purchase by a third party, whereby the level of losses to be utilized on an annual basis would be limited to 4% of the market value of ARM Inc. at the
date of the transaction.
As at 31 December 2005 the Company had federal net operating losses of £26,808,000 and a deferred tax asset thereon of £9,115,000. These losses begin
to expire in 2023.
The Company also had state net operating losses of £16,816,000 and a deferred tax asset of £808,000 which begin to expire in 2013.
In addition to the net operating losses the Company also had unutilized federal R&D tax credits of £4,105,000 which will begin to expire in 2012 and
unutilized state R&D tax credits of £4,388,000 which have no expiration date.

5 Business risks and credit concentration
The Company operates in the intensely competitive semiconductor industry which has been characterized by price erosion, rapid technological change, short
product life cycles, cyclical market patterns and heightened foreign and domestic competition. Significant technological changes in the industry could affect
operating results.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk comprise principally cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term
investments and marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable, as many of the
Company’s customers are large, well-established companies. The Company has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or
groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
The Company markets and sells to a relatively small number of customers with individually large value transactions. For further information see footnote 13.
At 31 December 2003, 2004 and 2005, no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. 
At 31 December 2004 and 2005, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments and marketable securities were deposited 
with major clearing banks and building societies in the UK and US in the form of money market deposits and corporate bonds for varying periods up 
to two years.
6 Acquisitions
Keil Elektronik GmbH and Keil Software Inc.
On 27 October 2005, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Elektronik GmbH (KEG), a company incorporated in Germany for total
consideration of $10.9 million (£6.1 million), comprising $10.4 million cash consideration and $0.5 million of related acquisition expenses. On the same day,
the Company purchased the entire share capital of Keil Software Inc. (KSI), a US company, for total consideration of $5.2 million (£2.9 million), comprising
$5.0 million cash consideration and $0.2 million of related acquisition expenses. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 97
6 Acquisitions continued
The Company has identified the MCU market as a critical growth area for the Company’s future business and with this acquisition, the Company will be able
to accelerate progress in that market by offering a more complete solution. As the MCU applications shift from 8/16-bit to 32-bit solutions, the combination 
of the ARM® Cortex™-M3 processor, which was specifically designed for microcontroller applications, the RealView® high-performance compiler, and Keil’s
complementary MCU tools for ARM, will enable new generations of ARM MCU solutions.
The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the
acquisition date. A further $2.3 million for KEG and $1.0 million for KSI is potentially payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial
milestones and will be accrued when payable. Keil is a leading independent provider of software development tools for the microcontoller (MCU) market.
The operating results for Keil have been included in these financial statements for the period from 27 October 2005 to 31 December 2005. The acquisition
was accounted for under SFAS 141.

The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Keil and those intangible assets of Keil that could be
clearly identified. These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Keil concerning development projects,
their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income generating ability. There were no
other contractual or other legal rights of Keil clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below. The provisional allocation of the
purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:

Deferred tax liability (2,673) (663)
Goodwill 2,178 1,764
Purchase price 6,137 2,919
KEG made a profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of £1.0 million and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a profit after tax
of £1.0 million. KSI made a loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2004 of £95,000 and for the period from 1 January 2005 until acquisition a loss
after tax of £40,000. The results of the Company would not have been significantly different had the acquisition of KEG and KSI occurred on 1 January 2005.
Axys Design Automation Inc. 
On 16 August 2004, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Axys Design Automation Inc., a US company, for total consideration of $12.5 million
(£6.9 million), comprising $11.6 million cash consideration and $0.9 million of related acquisition expenses. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible
and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. A further $3 million was potentially
payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones. These were achieved during 2005 and were accrued and paid during the year.
Axys is a provider of fast, accurate, integrated, processor and system modeling and simulation solutions and adds electronic system level expertise to ARM’s
design tools portfolio.
The acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141. The operating results for Axys have been included in these financial statements for the period 16 August
2004 to 31 December 2004 in the 2004 comparatives and for the entire year in 2005. 98 ARM Annual report and accounts 2005

As noted above, a further $3 million consideration was paid during 2005 following the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones. As a
result, total consideration and resultant goodwill increased by £1,690,000 during the year, as reflected in note 9.
Artisan Components Inc. 
On 23 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire share capital of Artisan Components Inc., a leading provider of physical IP components for the
design and manufacture of complex system-on-chip (SoC) integrated circuits. The acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry’s
broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer base, with highly complementary sales channels combining ARM’s
channel to more than 170 silicon manufacturers with Artisan’s channel to more than 2,000 companies. It better positions the combined company to benefit
from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases, and strengthens the links between the key aspects of SoC
development, enabling the combined company to deliver solutions that are further optimized for power and performance.
The acquisition was accounted for under SFAS 141. The operating results for Artisan have been included in these financial statements for the period 
23 December 2004 to 31 December 2004 in the 2004 comparatives and for the entire year in 2005.
The total consideration paid was $926.9 million (£481.7 million), comprising cash of $235.4 million (£122.3 million), 324,399,411 ordinary shares in the
Company with a fair value of $524.2 million (£272.4 million), approximately 90.4 million share options issued to existing Artisan employees with fair value
of $151.9 million (£79.0 million) and related direct acquisition fees of $15.4 million (£8.0 million) including legal, valuation and accounting fees. The
purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their estimated fair values on the
acquisition date. These provisional fair values were subsequently amended during 2005 as noted below.
The shares issued in the acquisition were valued in accordance with Emerging Issues Take Force Issue No. 99-12 (EITF 99-12), “Determination of the
measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination”. In accordance with EITF 99-12, the Company
established the first date on which the number of the Company shares and the amount of other consideration became fixed as of 23 August 2004.
Accordingly the Company valued the transaction using the average closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares two days before and after 23 August  ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 99
6 Acquisitions continued
2004, or $1.616 per share. The assumed options to acquire ordinary shares were valued using the Black-Scholes valuation model with volatility of between
80% and 94%, an average risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, an estimated life of between zero and six years, and dividend yield of 0.7%.
The following table sets out the provisional fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition as reported in the 2004
annual report:
Fair value to Company

Total liabilities assumed 23,464
Net assets acquired 95,361
The intangible assets recognized, apart from goodwill, represented contractual or other legal rights of Artisan and those intangible assets of Artisan that
could be clearly identified. These intangibles were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data provided by Artisan concerning
development projects, their stage of development, the time and resources needed to complete them, and if applicable, their expected income-generating
ability. There were no other contractual or other legal rights of Artisan clearly identifiable by management, other than those identified below. The provisional
allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:
Useful estimated life
years £000
Fair value of net assets acquired 95,361
Intangible assets acquired:
Developed technology 4 – 5 18,177
Patents/core technology 5 – 7 11,719
Existing agreements and customer relationships 3 – 8 36,354
Trademarks/tradenames 4 – 5 2,500
Order backlog 0 – 1 1,354
In-process research and development 3,229
Deferred stock-based compensation 9,579
Deferred tax liability (28,042)
Goodwill 331,432
Purchase price 481,663
Developed technology Developed technology of £18.2 million and patents and core technology of £11.7 million included intellectual property components
for use in SoC integrated circuits and consisted of the following: embedded memory, standard cell, input/output components, and analog and mixed-signal
products. In addition, developed technology included a combination of processes, patents, patent applications, core modular architecture and trade secrets
that are the buildings blocks of the technology. At the date of acquisition, the developed technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the developed technology and will be expensed as incurred. To estimate the fair
value of the developed technology, an income approach was used with a discount rate of 14% for existing technology and 16% for patents and core
technology, which included an analysis of future cash flows and the risks associated with achieving such cash flows. All developed technologies are being
amortized over the estimated useful lives of four to five years.
Existing agreements and customer relationships and order backlog The customer base of £36.4 million and order backlog of £1.4 million represented
the fair value of existing customer relationships and contracts, royalty arrangements, and support and maintenance agreements. To estimate the fair value of
the customer base and order backlog, a cost approach (replacement value) was used. The customer base and order backlog are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives of three to six years for customer base and one year for order backlog.
Trademarks and tradenames The fair value assigned to trademarks and tradenames, including the company name Artisan, was estimated using the
income approach, which discounts the present value of attributable cash flows at a discount rate of 16%. 
In-process research and development Development projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as developed technology and the
value assigned to developed technology was capitalized. Expensed in-process research and development of £3.2 million reflected certain research projects  6 Acquisitions continued
that had not yet reached technological feasibility and commercial viability or had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition. The fair value
assigned to in-process research and development was estimated using the income approach, which discounts to present value the cash flows attributable 
to the technology once it has reached technological feasibility using a discount rate of 19%. In-process research and development has been written-off
immediately to the income statement.  
Goodwill of £331.4 million represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible sets acquired. As stated, the
acquisition enables the combined company to deliver one of the industry's broadest portfolios of SoC intellectual property to their extensive, combined customer
base and it better positions the combined company to benefit from growth opportunities across multiple industries as system design complexity increases.
These, combined with the ability to hire the entire Artisan work force, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting
in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company is not amortizing goodwill relating to the acquisition. It is
being carried at cost and the Company will test it for impairment annually and whenever events indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
The pro forma results of the Company for the current year, had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2004, and for the prior year, had the acquisition
occurred on 1 January 2003, would have been:
2003 2004
Unaudited Unaudited
£000 £000
Revenues 173,277 197,852
Income from operations 3,730 15,973
Net income 1,650 16,365
Diluted earnings per ordinary share 0.1p 1.2p
Net income has been reduced in these pro forma results in relation to reduced interest income as a result of the cash portion of the acquisition consideration,
amortization of intangibles acquired and amortization of deferred compensation.
During 2005, the provisional fair values were adjusted resulting in an increase in the net assets acquired of $2.9 million (£1.5 million) with a corresponding
decrease to goodwill. The principal adjustments were an increase to the deferred tax asset (representing deductions arising on exercise of options issued in a
business combination, in accordance with EITF00-23) of £4.8 million, an increase in intangible assets acquired (including in-process research and development
but net of deferred tax) of £0.8 million, a reduction in deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses of £1.4 million, and additional provisions for
unaccrued costs of £2.7 million. See note 9 for subsequent revisions to acquired intangible assets on finalization of the purchase price allocation.

Until the adoption of SFAS 142 on 1 January 2002 (see footnote 1), goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to three years,
determined in each case by reference to employee turnover rates in the industry and the individual technology acquired with the acquisitions. In accordance
with SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, and is tested for impairment at least annually.
The split of goodwill by segment is shown in note 14. Additions in the year relating to KEG, KSI and Axys have all been allocated to the Processor division.
The foreign exchange difference arises as goodwill on Artisan, Axys and KSI is denominated in US dollars and thus is subject to revaluation at the period-end
rates. Changes in the carrying amount for the year are as follows:

Licenses to use technology are being amortized over periods of three to five years. The amortization periods for licenses have been determined according to
their estimated useful economic life.
Patents are being amortized over four to five years, developed technology (the main IP of the company existent at acquisition and generating revenue) over
five years and customer relationships (relationships with customers which were generating revenue at acquisition) over two years, being the periods over
which the Company is expected to derive benefit from them.
The estimated amortization expense of intangible assets in each of the next five years is set forth below:

2007 18,519
2008 17,077

10  Accounts receivable
Included within accounts receivable at 31 December 2005 are £20.5 million (2004: £5.9 million) of amounts recoverable on contracts.
11  Accrued liabilities
Included within accrued liabilities at 31 December 2005 are £nil million (2004: £14.3 million) of acquisition-related expenses, £0.7 million 
(2004: £4.4 million) for staff costs and £0.7 million (2004: £2.8 million) representing the fair value of embedded derivatives.
12  Shareholders’ equity
Share options The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share
capital in any five-year period. Options issued prior to the listing of the Company are excluded from this calculation.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan (the “Executive Scheme”), the Company may grant options to employees meeting
certain eligibility requirements. Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the
options expire.
Under the Company’s Unapproved Scheme (the “Unapproved Scheme”), for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are
exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire. The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially
the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue. Under both of these
schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary,
100% maximum on fourth anniversary. Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met
are exerciseable after three years, otherwise they will become exerciseable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees (the “French Scheme” and the “Belgian Scheme”). In the French Scheme, options are
exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third
anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition. The schemes remained substantially the
same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc. The
number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement. The schemes assumed were the "1993
Plan", the "1997 Plan", the "2000 Plan", the "2003 Plan", the "Director Plan", the "Executive Plan" and the "ND00 Plan".
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods. The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most
common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years. Some options vest on
a monthly basis, and some vest over five years. All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company. The number of options
granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee. The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM Inc. and ARM
Physical IP Inc. where the period is two years. The option price is currently set at 85% of the market share price prior to the grant, and the right to exercise
normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. and ARM Physical IP Inc. where the right to exercise
normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed. The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each
year up to and including 2005 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up 
in 1998.

In May 2002, Nazomi Communications, Inc. (“Nazomi”) filed suit against ARM alleging willful infringement of Nazomi’s US Patent No. 6,332,215. ARM
answered Nazomi’s complaint in July 2002 denying infringement. ARM moved for summary judgment and a ruling that the technology does not infringe
Nazomi’s patent. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted ARM’s motion, and Nazomi appealed the District Court’s ruling.
On 7 September 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the appeal and issued its decision on 11 April 2005. Because, in the opinion of 
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District Court did not construe the disputed claim term in sufficient detail for appellate review, the Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the dispute back to the District Court for further analysis. A supplementary “Markman” hearing was held on 
11 October 2005 and we are presently awaiting the ruling of the District Court. Based on legal advice received to date, ARM has no cause to believe that
the effect of the original ruling by the District Court will not be upheld.
Guarantees It is common industry practice for licensors of technology to offer to indemnify their licensees for loss suffered by the licensee in the event that
the technology licensed is held to infringe the intellectual property of a third party. Consistent with such practice, the Company provides such indemnification
to its licensees but subject, in all cases, to a limitation of liability. The obligation for the Company to indemnify its licensees is subject to certain provisos 
and is usually contingent upon a third party bringing an action against the licensee alleging that the technology licensed by the Company to the licensee
infringes such third party's intellectual property rights. The indemnification obligations typically survive any termination of the license and will continue 
in perpetuity.
The Company does not provide for any such guarantees unless it has received notification from the other party that they are likely to invoke the guarantee.
The provision is made if both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it
is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements; and (ii) the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Any
such provision is based upon the directors’ estimate of the expected costs of any such claim.
The total provision for such guarantees was £nil million on 31 December 2005 (2004: £0.5 million), and a table showing the movement of the provision
during the year is as follows:
Utilized in the
At 1 January Provided in the year Released in year through At 31 December

At 31 December 2005, ARM had provided in aggregate £0.8 million (2004: £1.3 million) in relation to legal matters, being the expected future costs to be
incurred. 
At 31 December 2005, the Company had outstanding purchase commitments of £1,371,000 (2004: £1,179,000).

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued 14  Geographic and segment information
The directors are of the opinion that the Company had only one class of business during 2004 and before, but that following the acquisition of Artisan
Components Inc. in December 2004, the Company now has two reportable business segments, namely the Processor division and the Physical IP division.
Although the Chief Operating Decision Maker and the rest of the board are provided with analyses of revenues by the different revenue streams (licensing,
royalties, development systems and services), costs, operating results and balance sheet items are only analyzed into two divisions, namely Processors and
Physical IP . As such these are currently the only two reportable segments. The Physical IP division consists of the business stream previously undertaken by
Artisan and the revenues from the Physical IP division are derived from the sale of legacy Artisan products and services. The Processor division’s revenues
comprise legacy ARM products and services, including those from development systems products, including those of Axys. During the year, the Company

ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 105 15  Fair values of financial instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of those instruments.
Long-term marketable securities The carrying amount approximates fair value because these instruments are marked-to-market.
Foreign currency forward contracts The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts and embedded derivatives is estimated using the settlement rates
prevailing at the period end.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Notes to the financial statements/US GAAP/continued To the board of directors and shareholders of ARM Holdings plc In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flow present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ARM
Holdings plc and its subsidiaries at 31 December 2005 and 2004 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended 31 December
2005, 2004 and 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), which require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion expressed above.

The financial statements on pages 108 to 114 were approved by the board of directors on 6 March 2006 and were signed on its behalf by:
Sir Robin Saxby Director 1 Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the UK. A summary of the
more important accounting policies, which have been consistently applied and reviewed by the board of directors in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard (FRS) 18, “Accounting policies”, is set out below together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the
adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Changes in accounting standards The Company has adopted FRS 20 “Share-based payments”, FRS 21 “Events after the balance sheet date”, FRS 22
“Earnings per share”, FRS 23 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, FRS 25 “Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation”, FRS 26
“Financial instruments: Measurement” and FRS 28 “Corresponding amounts” in these financial statements. The adoption of each of these standards
represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly. Details of the effect of the prior-year adjustments 
are given in note 8.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at cost. Where an acquisition satisfied the provisions of sections 131 to 134 
of the Companies Act 1985 for merger relief, the investment is stated at the nominal value of shares issued plus the fair value of any other consideration.
Short-term investments Bank deposits which are not repayable on demand are treated as short-term investments.
Cash flow statement The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Revised 1996 “Cash flow statements” which provides that where 
a company is a member of a group and a consolidated cash flow statement is published, the company does not have to prepare a cash flow statement.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at actual rates of exchange ruling at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange
differences have been included in operating profit.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Financial instruments The Company does not have any financial instruments.
Share schemes The Group’s Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) and Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (QUEST) are separately administered 
trusts which are funded by loans (the ESOP) and loans and gifts (the QUEST) from the Group, and the assets of which comprise shares in the Company. In
accordance with UITF 38, “Accounting for ESOP trusts”, the Company recognises the assets and liabilities of the ESOP and the QUEST in its own accounts and
shares held by the trusts are recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to
employees.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments, including an LTIP , to certain employees of subsidiary undertakings. In accordance with FRS 20,
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The
fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on
the Company’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company operates Save As You Earn (SAYE) schemes in the UK and an Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the US. Options under these schemes
are granted at a 15% discount to market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. The UK SAYE schemes are approved by the Inland Revenue,
which stipulates that the saving period must be at least 36 months. The Company has recognised a compensation charge in respect of the UK SAYE plans
and US ESPPs. The charges for these are calculated as detailed above.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available, and has applied the provisions of FRS 20 only to those options granted after 7 November
2002 and which were outstanding at 31 December 2004. The Company does not have any employees and as such all share-based compensation has been
recharged to subsidiary undertakings by way of capital contributions to those subsidiaries.
Treasury shares The Company has a share buyback programme under which the Company purchases its own shares and holds them as treasury shares.
These shares will be used to satisfy employee share option exercises. In accordance with UITF 38, the Company recognises these shares at cost as a
deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds.
2 Profit for the financial year
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent company’s profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The parent company’s profit after taxation, including dividends receivable and before dividends payable was £19,908,000 (2004: £17,279,000). Apart from
seven directors who have contracts of service with ARM Limited, the Company has no employees. All emoluments of these directors are paid by ARM Limited
and are disclosed in the remuneration report within these financial statements.

The ESOP trust has waived its right to receive dividends of over 0.01 pence per share, and the QUEST has waived its right to receive any dividends. As such,
dividends will not be payable on the 5,000,000 shares currently held within ESOP . The QUEST had no shares remaining at the balance sheet date. Also, 12,751,107
shares were held as treasury stock by ARM Holdings plc and the Company has waived its right to dividends on these shares.
The directors have recommended the payment of a final dividend of 0.5 pence per share in respect of 2005, bringing the total dividend payable in respect of 2005
(including the interim of 0.34 pence per share) to 0.84 pence per share. This will be paid to shareholders after approval by the shareholders at the 2006 AGM.
4 Fixed asset investments
The cost and net book value of interests in Group undertakings held by the Company was £491,179,000 at 31 December 2005 and £202,898,000 at 
31 December 2004. The Company took advantage of merger relief in 2004 and did not record the premium on the issue of shares for the acquisition 
of Artisan Components Inc. (now ARM Physical IP Inc.) and thus did not record the premium within the value of the investment in the Company balance
sheet at that time.

Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan (the Executive Scheme), the Company may grant options to directors and employees meeting
certain eligibility requirements. Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire. ARM Annual report and accounts 2005 113
7 Called-up share capital continued
Under the Company’s Unapproved Scheme (the Unapproved Scheme), for which it has not sought approval from the UK Inland Revenue, options are
exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire. The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially
the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue. Under both of these
schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary,
100% maximum on fourth anniversary. Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met
are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for our French and Belgian employees (the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme). In the French Scheme, options are
exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third
anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition. The schemes remained substantially 
the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc. 
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement. The schemes assumed were the
“1993 Plan”, the “1997 Plan”, the “2000 Plan”, the “2003 Plan”, the “Director Plan” and the “ND00 Plan”.
Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods. The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most
common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years. Some options vest 
on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years. All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
The Group also operates savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Group (SAYE). The number of options granted
is related to the value of savings made by the employee. The period of savings is either three or five years, except under the US scheme where the period
is two years. The option price is normally 85% of the market share price at grant, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once
the savings have been completed, except for the US scheme where the right to exercise only arises for a three-month period.
Under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan, a further 7,760,881 shares could be awarded to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a
three-year period as detailed in the remuneration report. These shares will be awarded from shares already issued within the ESOP and treasury stock.

The Company has taken advantage of merger relief and not recorded the premium on the issue of shares for the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc.
(now ARM Physical IP Inc.). The option reserve represents the fair value of options granted on the acquisition of Artisan Components Inc. in 2004. The other
reserve represents the unrealised profit on the intra-Group sale of investments.
The Company has adopted FRS 20 and FRS 21 during the year, resulting in the following prior-year adjustments:
– increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings and increase in the profit and loss reserve of £11,729,000 reflecting the cumulative share option
compensation charge up to 2004 recharged on to subsidiary undertakings by way of a capital contribution; and
– the final dividend proposed for 2004 of 0.42 pence per share that was previously shown within the profit and loss account for 2004 has now been
reclassified and shown within the profit and loss account for 2005. Prior to the adoption of FRS 21, dividends were recorded in the year to which they
related, even if they were declared after the period end.
The current-year impact of adopting FRS 20 is an increase in investments in subsidiary undertakings and in the profit and loss reserve of £20,863,000. 
The current-year impact of adopting FRS 21 is to reduce creditors for proposed dividends and increase the profit and loss reserve by £6,842,000. 8 Share premium account and reserves continued
During 2005, to supplement the payment of dividends to shareholders, the Company began a rolling share buyback programme under the shareholder
authority conferred at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The quantum and frequency of share re-purchases is not predetermined and will take into account
prevailing market conditions, the short- to medium-term cash needs of the business and the level of employee share-based remuneration going forward. In
2005, a total of 13,868,000 shares (with nominal value of £6,934) were re-purchased from the market at a cost of £16,211,000. At 31 December 2005,
there were 12,751,107 shares in the Company still held from these purchases with a market value of £15,429,000.
Offset within the profit and loss account is an amount of £16,315,000 (2004: £7,485,000) representing the cost of own shares held with the ESOP , QUEST
and treasury shares. This comprises £1,438,000 (2004: £1,438,000), being the cost of 5,000,000  (2004: 5,000,000) shares held within the ESOP , £nil (2004:
£6,047,000), being the cost of nil (2004: 713,034) shares within the QUEST and £14,877,000 (2004: £nil) being the cost of 12,751,107 (2004: nil) shares
held as treasury shares.

Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders of ARM Holdings plc/UK GAAP
We have audited the parent company financial statements of ARM Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the balance sheet
and the related notes. These parent company financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited
the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of ARM Holdings plc for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the directors’ remuneration report and the parent company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent company financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the parent company financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial statements. The
other information comprises only ARM at a glance, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations, the operating and financial
review, directors and advisors, the corporate governance statement, the corporate social responsibility statement, the directors’ report, the unauditable part
of the remuneration report, and the statement of directors’ responsibilities. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of
the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
l the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the
state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and
l the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.

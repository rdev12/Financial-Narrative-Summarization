Chairman’s Statement
Results
I am pleased to report another
strong set of results for the year,
with growth in every division. 
Revenue for 2005 was £580.1m,
an increase of 16.1% over 2004.
Underlying operating profit,
stated before the amortisation 
of intangible assets and the
impairment of goodwill and after
adjusting for the hurricanes and
other non-recurring items, was
£92.9m, 11.9% up on last year.
Group operating profit was
£83.0m, an increase of 1.7%. 
A reconciliation of the underlying
figures to the statutory figures is
set out on page 8 of the
performance review.
Acquisitions and disposals
An important part of Intertek’ s
strategy to add value to our
customers, is to widen the range
of services in the Group and
extend the geographic coverage
by acquiring complementary
businesses which can be
leveraged through the global
network. During 2005, the Group
made 12 acquisitions for a total
consideration of £46.9m. Apart
from Omega Point Laboratories,
which was acquired in April 2005,
the other acquisitions were made
in the second half of 2005, so the
full impact on trading results will
not be realised until 2006. 
I am pleased to
report another
strong set of 
results for the 
year, with growth 
in every division.
The largest transaction was the
acquisition of Automotive
Research Laboratory (ARL) from
PerkinElmer in November 2005,
for consideration of £20.1m.
ARL which is based in T exas, is a
market leader in the provision of
testing services on automotive
fuels and oils. This fits well with
the existing Caleb Brett business
and complements the PARC
business which was acquired in
August 2005 and Entela, which
was acquired in 2004.
Acquisitions are described in
more detail in the performance
review. 
At the end of November, the
Group sold its 49% shareholding
in the German company, DEKRA
Intertek Certification GmbH, to
DEKRA AG for £2.7m and
acquired the remaining 51% of
the shares not already owned by
Intertek in the Swedish company
DEKRA-SEMKO Certification AB
for £0.9m. This deal ended the
joint venture between Intertek
and DEKRA and enables both 
parties to focus on growing 
their certification businesses
independently.
Accounting Standards
This is the first Annual Report
prepared by the Group under
Adopted International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
Previously, the Group’ s accounts
were prepared in compliance
with UK Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (UK
GAAP). The 2004 comparatives
have been restated except where
permitted by IFRS 1: First Time
Adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards.
The adoption of international
standards has some impact on
the presentation of our financial
statements but does not
fundamentally change our
strategy, business and economic
risks, financial position, or our
cash flows. A reconciliation 
of the impact on the income
statement and the balance 
sheet is given in note 29 to 
the financial statements. 
Dividends
During the year, the Group paid
total dividends of 10.9p per
share (2004: 9.3p) comprising
the final dividend for 2004 of
7.0p per share and the interim
dividend for 2005 of 3.9p per
share. Since the balance sheet
date, the Directors proposed a
final dividend of 8.1p per share
(2004: 7.0p) which combined
with the interim dividend of 
Sustainable shareholder value

8185_Intertek_AR_p01_07_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  11:21 am  Page 04 3.9p (2004: 3.4p) makes a full
year dividend of 12.0p per share
(2004: 10.4p), an increase of
15.4% over last year. The final
dividend, which is subject to
shareholder approval, will be
paid on 16 June 2006, to
shareholders on the Register
at 2 June 2006. 
Board changes
2005 was a year of change on
the Intertek Board. After leading
the Group for more than 20
years, Richard Nelson retired as
Chief Executive Officer in March.
I would like to thank Richard on
behalf of the Board for his
outstanding personal
contribution in building the
Group and I am pleased that he
has remained on the Board as
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman.
Wolfhart Hauser succeeded
Richard as Chief Executive Officer;
the transition was seamless and
the Group has continued to
perform well and grow under
Wolfhart’ s leadership. 
It is with much regret that I have
to report the sudden death of
Ross Sayers on 25 November
2005. Ross served as a Non-
Executive Director of Intertek for
the past three years and I speak
for the Board and my colleagues
at Intertek when I say that his
good humour, friendship and
valuable contribution to the
Group will be sadly missed.
I am delighted to announce that
Debra Rade joined the Intertek
Board as a Non-Executive
Director on 1 January 2006.
Debra is currently a Partner in
Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP
a major national US law firm,
based in Chicago. Debra’ s
practice focuses primarily on
corporate governance and
compliance as well as product
safety and certification. Until
2002, Debra was a senior officer
of Underwriters Laboratories Inc.
a provider of product safety and
certification. Debra’ s extensive
experience within the inspection
and testing industry, as well 
as her legal and corporate
governance background, will
strengthen the Board.
Employees
One of Intertek’ s key strengths is
the dedication and expertise of
the Group’ s employees around
the world. At the end of 2005,
the Group employed over
15,500 people in 108 countries,
an increase of 2,000 over last
year. This increase was partly due
to acquisitions made in the year
and I would like to extend a
warm welcome to all new
Intertek colleagues. On behalf of
the Board I would like to thank
all of the Group’ s staff for their
contribution during the year and
congratulate them on another
excellent performance.
Outlook
Intertek is very well positioned in
many of its industries and the
continued active marketing of
our services should ensure we
have another year of favourable
results with good organic
growth rates complemented by
acquisition growth. 
We strive to support and add
value to our customers by
continuing to align ourselves
with them and offering bundled
solutions to increase efficiency
and reduce their costs while at
the same time improving their
products. By offering good value
to our customers, we are
confident that Intertek will
continue to prosper in the years
to come.
Vanni Treves
Chairman
Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005 05
An important 
part of Intertek’ s
strategy to add
value to our
customers, is to
widen the range 
of services in the
Group and extend
our geographical
coverage.
8185_Intertek_AR_p01_07_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  11:21 am  Page 05 more important to combine
our services and, in this way,
offer excellent value. We win
most business not by taking
market share from our
competitors but by gaining
additional business through
existing customers. 
Q
What do you enjoy about
being CEO of Intertek?
A
Intertek is a very exciting
company. I like the fact that
we are creating so much value
for our customers and,
through that, for our investors
and employees. I also like the
variety – not many companies
cover so many different
industries. And of course as
Chief Executive, you can get
close to the customers and
industries we serve and gain a
very good understanding of
every market. I enjoy the fact
that we are involved in nearly
every technical area and all
areas in natural science –
that’ s very challenging and
interesting. Finally, as we are a
people business, I enjoy
nurturing the cultural identity
and passion of our employees
to succeed.
Annual Report 2005
Q 
What does Intertek do?
A
We help our clients achieve
success in the global market
place. We do this by providing
testing, inspection and
certification services, but we
also go further. We add value
to our clients’ businesses and
their products – we become a
vital part of their success.
Q
How is Intertek helping
customers achieve
their goals?
A
Our clients face many global
challenges. Trading and
manufacturing is continually
shifting across borders.
Customer demands in both
developed and developing
nations change on a regular
basis. New legislation is
constantly being introduced
covering quality, safety,
environmental and social
compliance. At the same
time, new products must be
designed and introduced into
these markets as quickly as
possible. 
We provide the support that
keeps our clients ahead of the
game. We take care of all the
non-core activities related to
their products and commodities.
This frees them to focus on
running their business and
makes sure their brand image
is protected when it comes to
quality, safety and
environmental issues.
Q
How is Intertek structured?
A
Our business units are
focused on the broad range
of industries we serve:
Consumer Goods;
Commercial & Electrical
products; Oil, Chemical & Agri
Services; and Government
Services. In each industry we
have experts who live and
breathe the needs of our
clients. These experts
combine our different services
to provide solutions that meet
our clients’ needs. 
Q
What are Intertek’s main
strengths?
A
We are very strong on both a
global and local level. Our
local management are leaders
in their industries. We enjoy
solid relationships with our
customers, be they a multi-
national retailer or a local
manufacturer with a single
product line. And in many
industries we are in a leading
position. It’ s a position we’ve
gained through providing
quality, adding value and
building long-term
relationships.
Q
Are there any weaknesses
you are looking to address?
A
If we have a weakness, it’ s
that we are not always the
leader in our industry sectors.
I’d like to see Intertek being
first or second in all our core
service industries. And there
are still regions where we are
some way from being in the
top two – in Japan for
example. But I see this as an
opportunity for growth. 
Q
Where do you see the main
areas of expansion?
A
Intertek is supporting global
trade – which grows faster
than GDP – so our underlying
markets will continue to show
good growth. We will also
improve our competitive
position in these markets. But
the growth ultimately comes
from persuading our clients
that outsourcing their quality,
safety and environmental
services to us will make them
more successful. 
Q
Are you concerned about
the increasing competition?
A
It has always been a
competitive market and this
will continue. We have to
innovate and increase
productivity to keep ahead of
the competition – just like any
other business. But for us it’ s

Q&A with the Chief Executive
8185_Intertek_AR_p01_07_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  11:21 am  Page 06 Strategic drivers
• unrivalled global
resource
• key industry focus
• adding value
through synergy
Q
What’s your
management style?
A
In a business with over
15,000 employees you have
to be flexible and use a range
of different management
styles. For me, active listening
and leading by example is
very important. I always try to
put myself in the shoes of our
customers, managers and
employees. I expect everyone
at Intertek to follow this
service-led mindset. 
Q
What have Intertek’s
biggest achievements been
over the past year?
A
We’re now promoting
Intertek as a single company.
Our employees no longer see
just their traditional divisions –
they are proud of Intertek as a
whole. It’ s been very
important to develop this
single brand and it’ s not just
about a brand image, this
‘one company’ ethos has also
helped us work together
more effectively. One example
of this is the RoHS Directive.
This legislation, relating to the
restriction of hazardous
substances in electrical
products, is covering
numerous industries and our
labs are set up to address
that. We also made good
progress by making
acquisitions in the oil and
chemical industry and the
electro-technical industry.
Q
Any downsides?
A
The only downside has been
that we lost two contracts in
the Government Services
division. These contracts
provided excellent value for
our clients, but unfortunately
other considerations can play
a part. However, I think we’re
in a good position to win new
contracts, particularly in cargo
scanning services. 
Q
What’s your view on the
future and the year ahead
for Intertek?
A
We are very well prepared for
the year ahead. In Consumer
Goods, we have the capacity
to keep up with growth in
developing countries. We
have a very good approach to
all different industries in the
Commercial & Electrical sector
and the success we have seen
to date in executing our
strategy in this area will
continue. And in Oil,
Chemical & Agri, we will
continue to increase the
breadth and depth of our
analytical services and push to
do more upstream work
relating to the cargo side of
the business.
Crucially, we will continue to
offer our existing services but
we will also do more. We will
add more value, we will
combine our services, and
eventually become number
one in more industries.
Intertek is a business that
strives to add value for our
customers – and through that
approach, we’re adding value
for our investors and
shareholders.

Performance
Review
Cautionary statement
This Annual Report contains
certain forward-looking
statements with respect to 
the financial condition, results,
operations and business of
Intertek Group plc. These
statements and forecasts involve
risk and uncertainty because
they relate to events and depend
upon circumstances that will
occur in the future. There are 
a number of factors that 
could cause actual results or
developments to differ materially
from those expressed or implied
by these forward-looking
statements and forecasts.
Nothing in this Annual Report
should be construed as 
a profit forecast.
Overview
In order to present a more
meaningful comparison of the
Group’ s revenue and operating
profit in 2005 compared to
2004, the revenue and operating
profit in this performance review
have been adjusted for certain
material, non-recurring items. 
In addition, throughout this
discussion, operating profit is
stated before the amortisation
of intangible assets and the
impairment of goodwill.
The underlying growth in revenue,
which is after adjusting the 2005
revenue to include £1.8m of
revenue lost due to the impact 
of the hurricanes in the US, was
16.5%. Our underlying growth
in operating profit, which is
stated before the amortisation 
of intangible assets of £2.1m
(2004: £1.4m) and the impairment
of goodwill of £2.0m (2004: £nil)
and after adding back lost profit
due to the hurricanes of £1.2m
and other non-recurring costs 
of £4.6m, was 11.9%. Labtest
maintained a good level of
growth, despite challenging
conditions in some of its markets,
ETL SEMKO and Caleb Brett both
performed very strongly and FTS
had a good year but suffered
contract losses which will affect
its performance going forward.
A substantial portion of the
Group’ s revenue is denominated
in US dollars or currencies linked
to the US dollar therefore, the
Group’ s results when translated
into sterling are exposed to
changes in the value of the 
US dollar. In order to compare
the Group’ s results for 2005 
with 2004 at constant exchange
rates, the reported results for
2004, have been retranslated into
sterling using the 2005 average
exchange rates. The table below
shows growth in revenue and
operating profit at both actual
and constant exchange rates. 
Revenue reported in the income
statement for 2005 was £580.1m,
16.1% higher than 2004 and
Group operating profit was
£83.0m, an increase of 1.7%. 
A reconciliation of the underlying
figures to the statutory figures is
set out in the table above.

Underlying Performance
8185_Intertek_AR_p08_23_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  11:39 am  Page 08 Acquisitions and disposals
The Group made one acquisition
in the first half of 2005, and 11
acquisitions and one disposal 
in the second half of the year.
The Group includes the results 
of acquisitions from the date of
acquisition and excludes the
results of disposals from the date
of disposal. At actual exchange
rates, underlying organic
revenue increased by 13.6% and
underlying organic operating
profit increased by 7.2%. 
At constant rates underlying
organic revenue increased by
12.2% and underlying organic
operating profit increased by
5.7%. A more detailed discussion
of the acquisitions is given in the
divisional review that follows.
Non-recurring items
The results for 2005, were
impacted by a number of events
that were non-recurring and
outside the normal course of
trading. Firstly, the Gulf Coast in
the United States was devastated
by hurricanes Rita and Katrina
and subsequent flooding in the
New Orleans area in the second
half of 2005, which caused Caleb
Brett’ s operation in this region to
lose revenue of approximately
£1.8m and operating profit of
£1.7m. The Group is seeking
recovery of its losses from its
insurers and an initial payment of
£0.5m was received in February
2006. This amount was accrued
in the accounts for 2005, so the
net reduction of operating profit
in the year was £1.2m. The Group
will include any further insurance
recoveries in 2006. Secondly,
operating profit was reduced 
by costs of £2.6m following 
an unexpected adverse court
judgment in connection with 
an old claim. The judgment has
been appealed but the outcome
is unknown at the current time.
Thirdly, two major government
contracts were terminated in 
the FTS division which resulted 
in closure costs of £2.0m.

Labtest
Consumer goods
Labtest services consumer goods
industries including those
producing textiles, footwear,
toys, food and hardlines in the
areas of testing, inspection,
auditing, training and certification
for quality, safety, health,
environmental and corporate
social accountability. Its clients
include the world’ s largest retail
organisations, manufacturers
and international traders.
Labtest had a challenging year in
2005 but still achieved organic
growth of 8.7% in revenue and
0.9% in operating profit, at
constant exchange rates. In total,
revenue increased 7.1% in 2005
over 2004 and operating profit
increased 2.3%. Labtest’ s organic
operating margin was 31.7% 
in 2005, compared to 34.2% 
in 2004. This was primarily due
to lower than expected revenue
and higher costs in certain
countries, particularly in Europe
and the Americas. 
Performance in the division was
mixed, with very strong growth
in China (including Hong Kong),
which accounts for more than
half of Labtest revenue, tempered
by challenging market conditions
in many other countries. Changes
to the World Trade Organisation’ s
Strong growth in
all industry sectors
in China. Excellent
growth in toys
worldwide.
Agreement on T extiles and
Clothing (ATC) ended more than
40 years of quota restrictions on
textiles and clothing and resulted
in turbulence in the global textile
market in 2005, with increased
revenue in China and a decline 
in revenue in the rest of Asia,
Europe and the Americas. 
T oys, food and hardline testing
performed well in all regions,
mainly due to increased
European Union (EU) regulations
on safety and environmental
factors which increased the
requirements for testing for
various hazardous substances.
For example, companies
manufacturing or shipping
electronic products into the EU
have been preparing to comply
with the new Restriction of
Hazardous Substances (RoHS)
directive which becomes
mandatory on 1 July 2006. 
At the end of November, Labtest
sold its 49% shareholding in 
the German company, DEKRA
Intertek Certification GmbH 
to DEKRA AG for £2.7m and
acquired the remaining 51% of
the shares not already owned by
Intertek in the Swedish company
DEKRA-SEMKO Certification AB
for £0.9m. This deal ends the
joint venture between Intertek
and DEKRA AG and enables
both parties to focus on growing
their certification businesses
independently. From 1 January
2006, the systems certification
business in Labtest will be aligned
with the product certification
business in ETL SEMKO, under
the management of ETL SEMKO.
The key growth drivers in Labtest
remain strong, principally the
sourcing of products from China,
the increasingly wide range of
products being sold by retailers,
shorter product lifecycles and 
the growth in demand from
consumers and regulatory bodies
for quality and safety. The growth
strategy will be to concentrate
on higher growth markets and
to reposition in lower growth
regions and strengthening
marketing centres in major
western countries. On 1 January
2006, Paul Yao was appointed
Chief Operating Officer for
Labtest, reporting to Raymond
Kong, Executive President China
and Asia and Chief Executive
Labtest.

ETL SEMKO
Commercial & electrical
ETL SEMKO provides services 
to a wide range of industries
including those in the electrical,
electronic, medical, building,
industrial and automotive
component sectors. ETL SEMKO
had an excellent year in 2005,
with organic growth of 12.4% in
revenue and 19.8% in operating
profit, at constant exchange
rates. In total, revenue increased
16.9% in 2005 over 2004 and
operating profit increased
25.0%. ETL SEMKO’ s organic
operating margin was 15.2% 
in 2005, compared to 14.3% 
in 2004. The margin increase
was due to operational
efficiencies and the turnaround
of underperforming areas. 
China continued to report
excellent organic growth driven
by the increase in exports of
consumer and commercial goods,
North America also performed
well with the implementation 
of a more focused business
development strategy and
improvements in efficiency,
leading to organic growth in all
service sectors. A new automotive
component testing laboratory
was opened in Shanghai at the
end of the year and is already
generating revenue.
Excellent growth
across all industry
sectors.
In line with the Group’ s strategy
of expanding services to clients,
ETL SEMKO made two infill
acquisitions in the US in 2005.
Omega Point Laboratories (OPL)
was acquired in April for £2.9m.
OPL provides building products
services in T exas, US and extends
the territory covered by the
Group’ s existing services.
International Approvals
Laboratory based in Colorado,
which provides electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC) testing, was
acquired in December for £0.6m.
At the end of 2005, Intertek
acquired KPMG’ s systems
certification businesses in 
India and the Middle East 
for consideration of £4.6m. 
As explained earlier, from 
1 January 2006, all Intertek’ s
systems certification business 
will be amalgamated within ETL
SEMKO. This acquisition provides
Intertek with entry into the
systems certification market in
key territories from which other
Intertek services can be offered. 
The outlook for ETL SEMKO is
good, with the growth trend 
in China expected to continue
and further development of key
industry sectors and country
markets where Intertek is
currently under represented. 
On 22 February 2006, Intertek
acquired the EMC business of
AKZO NOBEL in Japan for £9.0m.
The business enjoys a strong local
market position and will give ETL
SEMKO more coverage in a key
target country and market.

In addition to the above, Caleb
Brett made three other infill
acquisitions in the US and Europe
for consideration of £1.0m.
The outlook for Caleb Brett is
positive with organic growth
expected from underlying growth
in the market, new regulations
such as the EU RoHS directive
and the Ultra Low Sulphur
regulations in the US and
increased operational efficiencies.
The results in 2006, will benefit
from the inclusion of a full year’ s

made in 2005 and the new
outsourcing contracts. The
pipeline of potential outsourcing
projects remains strong and the
strategy of supplementing
organic growth with acquisitions
will continue.

Strong underlying
growth.
Caleb Brett 
Oil, chemical & agri
Caleb Brett offers inspection and
analytical services to the oil, gas,
chemical, agricultural, mineral
and pharmaceutical industries.
Caleb Brett performed strongly ,
with underlying organic growth 
of 15.4% in revenue and 8.1% 
in operating profit, at constant
exchange rates. The underlying
organic margin was 7.9%,
compared to 8.4% in 2004. 
The main reason for the decline in
operating margin was increased
investment in marketing for global
agri services and the Eastern
European region. Revenue from
analytical services (including
outsourcing agreements), which
accounted for about 36% (2004:
31%) of Caleb Brett’ s revenue in
2005, increased by 41.2% in
2005 over 2004.
Favourable market conditions
helped to drive a very strong
performance in the Americas.
Property damage was suffered as
a result of the hurricanes and the
subsequent flooding of the New
Orleans area, the closure of oil
refineries and the disruption to
transport, communications and
accessibility, meant that Caleb
Brett and its clients could not
operate from the affected areas.
It is estimated that revenue was
reduced by £1.8m and operating
profit was reduced by £1.7m.
Recovery is being sought from
the Group’ s insurers and an initial
payment of £0.5m was received
in February 2006. Apart from 
the £0.5m, no recovery of 
costs has been included in the
above figures.
Asia and Europe also performed
well in many areas, particularly
analytical services. In 2005, 
new outsourcing contracts were
gained with Rolls-Royce in the UK
and Kodak in the UK and France.
Caleb Brett made seven
acquisitions in 2005 costing
£33.9m in total. The largest
acquisition was Automotive
Research Laboratories (ARL) 
in the US which was acquired in
November for £20.1m. ARL is one
of only two international market
leaders providing independent
testing services for automotive
fuels and lubricants for regulatory
and performance standards. 
ARL complements the existing
downstream oil and chemical
business in Caleb Brett by
extending its range of support
testing services from the refinery
into the automotive industry .
PARC T echnical Services business
was acquired in August for
£4.1m. PARC operates pilot
plants that simulate oil refineries,
chemical plants and automotive
test engines. Its world class
expertise and equipment strongly
supplements the current
downstream testing and
inspection services provided 
by Caleb Brett, extending
significantly the reach of Caleb
Brett into this industry and further
up the value chain of supply .
Caleb Brett acquired the
Westport T echnology Center
from Halliburton in October for
£5.4m. Westport, based in T exas,
provides high end exploration
production laboratory services 
to Halliburton and the upstream
oil industry, including consulting
and project management. 
This acquisition follows Intertek’ s
outsourcing strategy of operating
customers’ analytical laboratories
which are critical but not core to
the customers’ business. As well
as widening Caleb Brett’ s
upstream analytical services,
Westport also brings new and
unique analytical technology 
into the Group, which can be
developed internationally.
In November , Caleb Brett acquired
Lintec T esting Services Ltd in the
UK for consideration of £3.3m.

FTS
Government services
FTS works with governments 
to check the safety and quality of
imports, verify duty collection
and provide cargo security
services. FTS also provides
technical inspection services.
FTS reported excellent growth in
2005 over 2004, with 10.2%
growth in revenues and 31.7%
growth in underlying operating
profit, at constant rates. The
underlying margin was 24.6%,
up from 20.6% in 2004. 
The pre-shipment inspection
(PSI) contracts in Venezuela 
and Nigeria, which accounted
for 37% of FTS revenue in 
2005, terminated in the year.
The Venezuelan contract ended
on 31 August 2005 and the
Nigerian contract ended on 
31 December 2005, resulting in
closure costs of approximately
£2.0m. Excluding these costs,
operating profit increased 31.7%
at constant exchange rates.
Good results in 
the year.
New contracts gained in the 
year were a cargo scanning
contract in Guinea and standards
contracts in Nigeria and Kenya.
These did not have a material
impact on 2005 results. Pre-
shipment inspection contracts
with the governments of
Bangladesh, Ecuador , Malawi and
Mozambique were renewed. 
The loss of the Nigeria and
Venezuela contracts will
significantly impact the results 
of FTS in 2006. PSI contracts
provide a valuable service to
client governments and they 
are expected to continue in 
the future, albeit in a variety 
of forms. The Group’ s strategy 
is to continue providing these
services and to develop new 
and existing PSI and standards
contracts, implementing cargo
scanning solutions for clients,
developing new customs services
and expanding technical
inspection services.

as the Board, Group finance, treasury and tax, investor relations,

* growth at actual and constant exchange rates is the same.
Underlying central costs increased by 65.2% to £11.4m in 2005.
Central costs increased by about 25% due to increased headcount
in human resources and the business development and website
development teams, a donation to the T sunami appeal and costs
associated with the installation of a new global consolidation system.
The balance was due to a high level of legal costs in the defence of
ongoing claims which are described as contingent liabilities in note
27 to the financial statements. The Group’ s policy is to charge costs
incurred in connection with claims which arise from discontinued
business and from events prior to the Group’ s flotation in 2002, to
central overheads. Costs for claims arising in subsequent years and for
continuing business are charged to the operating division concerned.
The adjustment of £2.6m relates to an old claim dating back to 1996,
which was contested in court and unexpectedly resulted in an adverse
judgment. The judgment has been appealed and is scheduled to be
heard in May 2006. 
Net financing costs
As set out in note 6 to the financial statements, the Group reported
finance income in 2005 of £3.5m (2004: £4.2m). This comprised the
expected return on pension assets, interest on bank balances and 
a gain on the re-measurement of interest rate swaps to fair value. 
The Group’ s finance expense for 2005 was £9.4m compared to £12.1m
in 2004. The charge comprised interest on borrowings, pension
interest costs and other financing fees. The decrease was primarily
due to the non-recurring amortisation of debt issuance costs in 2004
of £3.4m following the refinancing that took place in December 2004.
Profit before taxation
Profit before tax was £79.4m compared to £74.4m in 2004, mainly
due to the good trading performance in the year and a profit of £1.6m
on the disposal of the Group’ s interest in an associate company .
Taxation
As set out in note 7 to the financial statements income tax expense for
2005, was £18.7m (2004: £19.6m), comprising a current tax charge 
of £24.1m (2004: £19.5m) less a deferred tax credit of £5.4m (2004:
charge £0.1m). The effective tax rate was 23.6%, down 2.7% from
2004. The main reason for the reduction in the effective tax rate 
was the recognition of deferred tax assets due to improved taxable
income in certain jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is expected to be
sustainable at close to current year levels for the short to medium-term.
Profit for the year
Profit for the year after tax was £60.7m (2004:£54.8m) of which £57.1m
(2004: £52.0m) was attributable to equity holders of the Company . 
Minority interests
As set out in note 20 to the financial statements, profit attributable
to minority shareholders was £3.6m in 2005 (2004: £2.8m). The
increase was mainly due to the strong growth in the Group’ s non-
wholly owned subsidiaries in China.
Earnings per share
As set out in note 8 to the financial statements, basic earnings per
share in the year were 36.8p (2004: 33.7p), an increase of 9.2%. 
An underlying earnings per share calculation is also shown which
removes the impact of amortisation of intangibles and impairment 
of goodwill to give basic underlying earnings per share of 39.5p
(2004: 34.6p), an increase of 14.2%.
Dividend 
During the year, the Group paid total dividends of £16.9m (2004:
£14.4m), which comprised £10.8m in respect of the final dividend
paid on 6 May 2005, at the rate of 7.0p per share and £6.1m being
the interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005,
paid on 15 November 2005 at a rate of 3.9p per share. These amounts
were charged to retained earnings (see note 19 to the financial
statements). Since the balance sheet date, the Directors proposed 
a final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005, 
of 8.1p per share (2004: 7.0p) making a full year dividend of 12.0p
per share (2004: 10.4p), an increase of 15.4% over last year. 
Cash and liquidity
Cash generated from operations was £96.7m for 2005, compared 
to £101.9m for 2004. The decline of 5.1% was mainly due to an
increase in trade and other receivables of £23.7m. In February 2006,
the Group received £4.5m from the Government of Nigeria which
reduced FTS debtors and £0.5m from the Group’ s insurers in connection
with the hurricane claim. Cash outflows from investing activities in
2005 were £71.0m (2004: £52.2m), up 36.0%. The main outflows
were £44.5m (2004: £26.6m) for the acquisition of subsidiaries and
£31.3m (2004: £28.2m) for the acquisition of property, plant and
equipment. The Group received £2.7m (2004: £nil) for the disposal
of its interest in an associate. Net cash outflows from financing
activities were £6.3m (2004: £53.7m), which comprised proceeds
from the issue of share capital following the exercise of employee
share options of £3.8m (2004: £1.1m) and the draw down debt of
£62.8m (2004: £165.7m), less the repayment of borrowings £53.1m
(2004: £202.0m), dividends paid to minorities £2.9m, (2004: £4.1m)
and dividend paid to Group shareholders £16.9m (2004: £14.4m). 
As set out in note 15 to the financial statements, interest bearing loans
and borrowings were £190.7m at 31 December 2005, an increase 
of 15.6% over 2004. The increase comprised cash out flow of 
£9.7m which was mainly used to finance acquisitions and exchange
adjustments of £16.1m principally due to the retranslation into sterling
of borrowings denominated in US dollars and HK dollars. Cash and
cash equivalents at 31 December 2005, were £50.8m, a decrease of
3.2% over 2004.

As described earlier , during 2005 the Group made 12 acquisitions and
one disposal. The net cash outflow was £44.5m (2004: £26.6m) for
the acquisition of subsidiaries and the Group received £2.7m (2004:
£nil) for the disposal of its interest in an associate. Additional deferred
consideration of £1.1m has been accrued, which may be payable if
performance targets are met by certain of the acquired companies.
Impact of IFRSs as adopted by EU
Operating profit for 2004, previously reported under UK GAAP , 
has been restated under Adopted IFRSs. The table below shows the
impact of the restatement together with the equivalent 2005 figures
for comparative purposes. The UK GAAP figures reflect the adoption
of FRS 17.

Group operating profit under IFRSs 83.0 81.6 1.7
A detailed reconciliation of the impact on the income statement is
given in note 29 to the financial statements. The key areas of impact
are described below:
Share-based payments
A charge is made to the income statement for share options issued
post November 2002. The charge is based on the fair value of
options at the grant date, with the fair value being determined by an
option pricing model. The charge was £1.9m in 2005 for options
issued in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and £1.0m in 2004 for options issued
in 2003 and 2004. 
Business combinations/intangible assets
As permitted by IFRSs 1, business combinations that took place prior
to 1 January 2004, have not been restated. Goodwill is no longer
amortised and instead is subject to annual impairment reviews.
Goodwill amortisation of £1.5m charged to the income statement 
in 2004 was reversed. In 2005, an impairment charge of £2.0m was
recognised due to a decline in the carrying value of an acquisition
made in 2003. 
As required by Adopted IFRSs, goodwill on acquisitions from 1 January
2004, was re-examined and analysed into separately identifiable
intangible assets which are amortised over their estimated useful lives
and capitalised goodwill which is unamortised. This review for 2004,
identified intangible assets such as covenants not to compete, know
how and customer relationships with a value of £4.9m, therefore
capitalised goodwill was reduced by this amount. In 2005, 12
businesses were acquired generating goodwill of £21.7m and intangible
assets of £10.7m. An analysis of the intangibles is set out in note 10
to the financial statements. The income statements for 2005 and 2004
were charged with £2.1m and £1.4m, respectively , for the amortisation
of intangible assets. 
Financial instruments
As permitted by IFRSs 1, comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39 have not
been restated and therefore these standards were adopted in full
from 1 January 2005. A charge of £1.0m was made to the hedging
reserve in shareholders’ funds to reflect the fair value of the derivative
financial instruments at 1 January 2005 (see note 19 to the financial
statements). Derivative financial instruments are brought onto the
balance sheet at their fair value. At 31 December 2005, the fair value
of the derivative financial instruments was £1.7m. This was included
within current assets on the balance sheet.
Hedge accounting has been adopted for four financial derivatives which
qualify as cash flow hedges under IAS 39. These financial derivatives
hedge the variable interest rate on the Group’ s external borrowings.
The effective portions of the movement in the fair value of the financial
derivatives that are hedge accounted were recognised directly in the
hedging reserve. As shown in note 19 to the financial statements, this
movement in 2005 was £2.6m. The ineffective portion of the movement
in the fair value of the financial derivatives was taken to the income
statement which in 2005, resulted in a credit of £0.1m to finance
income (see note 6 to the financial statements). 
Hedge accounting has also been adopted for the foreign currency
external borrowings which hedge the Group’ s net investment in its
foreign subsidiaries. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the
hedging instruments that are hedge accounted is recognised directly
in the translation reserve. 
The foreign exchange contracts undertaken by the Group to hedge
foreign currency transaction exposures were not hedge accounted
under IAS 39. This is because the fair value movements are expected
to be immaterial. The fair value movements on these foreign exchange
contracts are therefore charged or credited to the income statement. 
Tax
Adjustments arising from Adopted IFRSs have been tax effected as
appropriate. Under UK GAAP , the pension fund deficit was disclosed
net of deferred tax. Under Adopted IFRSs, the pension deficit is
disclosed gross of tax and the tax is shown as a deferred tax asset.

Performance Review
continued
Dividends
Dividends are presented as a deduction in shareholders’ equity when
they have been declared or ratified by shareholders rather than as a
deduction in the income statement when they have been proposed.
The income statement for 2004 has been restated to remove the
dividends of £16.1m. 
Segment analysis
The Group’ s primary basis of segmentation is by business and its
secondary basis is by geography. 
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of capitalised goodwill was reviewed for impairment
and a charge of £2.0m was made to operating profit in 2005 (2004:
£nil) to reduce the goodwill to its fair value. The impairment related
to an acquisition made in 2003 by Labtest in the UK.
Treasury controls
Policy
The Group’ s treasury and funding activities are undertaken by 
a centralised treasury function. Its primary activities are to manage
the Group’ s liquidity, funding and financial risk, principally arising
from movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. The Group’ s policy is to ensure that adequate liquidity and
financial resource is available to support the Group’ s growth and
development while managing these risks. The Group’ s policy is not 
to engage in speculative transactions. Group Treasury operates as 
a service centre within clearly defined objectives and controls and 
is subject to periodic review by internal audit.
Foreign currency exposure
Translation exposure: the results of the Group’ s overseas activities are
translated into sterling using the cumulative average exchange rates
for the period concerned. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries
are translated at closing exchange rates. The Group’ s policy is not to
hedge this translation exposure which can therefore create volatility
in the results when they are translated at actual exchange rates.
The Group’ s borrowings are principally denominated in US dollars
and HK dollars.
Transaction exposure: the Group’ s policy requires overseas subsidiaries
to hedge all significant transaction exposures with Group Treasury
where they are managed centrally. Subsidiaries’ transaction exposures
include committed foreign currency sales and purchases together with
the anticipated transactions reasonably expected to occur during
future periods. The Group’ s policy is also to hedge transaction
exposures arising from the remittance of overseas dividends and
interest as soon as they are committed. Committed transaction
exposures are hedged forward using forward currency contracts.
Interest rate risk and exposure
The Group’ s policy is to maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and
variable rate debt to minimise interest expense while managing interest
rate exposure. This balance will be periodically adjusted on the basis
of prevailing and anticipated market conditions and the Group’ s
gearing and interest cover, which are monitored by Group Treasury.
Liquidity risk
The multi-currency senior debt facility that was placed in December
2004, has substantially reduced the interest margin in 2005. 
The margins currently paid on borrowings are about 0.4% over
LIBOR. The facility was extended at the end of 2005 for another year,
so there are still five years left to run. 
At 31 December 2005, there was £190.7m of debt outstanding
(2004: £165.4m), the increase was partly due to exchange losses
resulting from a stronger US dollar and partly due to increased
expenditure on acquisitions in 2005. At 31 December 2005, the
undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2010,
were £95.5m (2004: £135.1m) of which £5.8m (2004: £5.0m) 
was utilised for letters of credit and guarantees. These facilities are
expected to be adequate to support the Group’ s medium-term
funding requirements. Surplus cash is placed on deposit with short-
term maturities providing liquidity when required.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group monitors the distribution of cash deposits, borrowings
and hedging instruments which are assigned to each of the Group’ s
counterparties and which are subject to periodic review.
Litigation
From time to time, the Group is involved in claims and lawsuits
incidental to the ordinary course of the business, including claims for
damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection
and testing and disputes with former employees. The Group is not
currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation
incidental to the conduct of business.
As set out in note 17 to the financial statements, at 31 December 2005,
the Group had provisions against future claims of £8.0m (2004: £4.8m).
The amount provided for claims and litigation relies on management’ s
informed judgment of the circumstances surrounding the claim, the
costs likely to be incurred in defending the claim and advice from
legal experts. 
The majority of claims made against Intertek’ s subsidiary companies
fall within the Caleb Brett division. While commercial disputes are
often settled, occasionally Caleb Brett will enter into a trial process. 
In November 2005, one claim in Caleb Brett, dating back to 1996,
was contested in court and unexpectedly resulted in an adverse
judgment. This decision is being appealed but in the meantime, costs
of £2.6m were incurred in 2005, by way of judgment and legal fees. 
In 1999, Caleb Brett Canada (now called Intertek T esting Services
Canada) entered into Collateral Management Agreements (CMA)
with two trading companies. The agreements provided for Caleb
Brett India to manage the storage and release of vegetable oil from
warehouses in India. As a result of the actions of a former rogue
employee of Caleb Brett India, various quantities of oil were released
without authorisation, leading to the commencement of recovery
actions against Caleb Brett in Singapore and London. The Singapore
proceedings were resolved by an out of court settlement with the
involvement of insurers. However, the London proceedings, which
comprise subrogated claims by Marine Cargo Underwriters against
Intertek T esting Services (ITS) Canada Ltd and Caleb Brett India Pvt
Ltd, claiming reimbursement of US$6.9m, have not resulted in a
20 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005
8185_Intertek_AR_p08_23_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  2:27 pm  Page 20 settlement and a trial is scheduled to commence on 20 March 2006.
Caleb Brett believes that it had adequate insurance in place to cover
the CMA work and has a strong legal defence against these claims.
Between 1992 and 2001, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority
(PREPA) contracted Caleb Brett to perform independent testing services.
In August 2002, PREPA filed a lawsuit against Caleb Brett in the
federal district court of Puerto Rico. PREPA is seeking unspecified
damages, alleging that Caleb Brett falsified test results and engaged
in a conspiracy with fuel suppliers to provide off-specification fuel for
on-specification prices during the 1992-2000 period. 
Caleb Brett has filed a motion to dismiss PREPA’ s complaint, on the
grounds that the claims are time barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. Caleb Brett believes that it has substantial defences to 
the plaintiff’ s claims and continues to defend itself vigorously. At this
point in the litigation however, it is impossible to predict the outcome
with any degree of certainty. A process of fact and expert discovery
began in earnest in the second half of 2005. The court has set a
deadline of 30 June 2006, for the conclusion of this discovery. No trial
date has been set.
In May 2004, Caleb Brett filed a petition in T exas state court against
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’ s of London and other underwriters
seeking a declaration that certain policies issued by the Underwriters
are in full force and effect, and that the insurers subscribing thereto
must indemnify and defend Caleb Brett in the case of PREPA v Caleb
Brett USA Inc in federal court in Puerto Rico. At this time, only limited
discovery has taken place and it is impossible to predict the outcome
with any degree of certainty.
The outcome of the litigation to which Intertek Group companies 
are party to, cannot be readily foreseen. Based on information
currently available, the directors consider that the cost to the Group
of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to
have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group
in the foreseeable future.

Directors’ Report
The Directors of Intertek Group plc have the pleasure in presenting
their Annual Report and the audited financial statements (Annual
Report) for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Principal activities and review of business
The Group’ s principal activities are the testing, inspection and certification
of products and commodities against a wide range of safety , regulatory ,
quality and performance standards. A review of the Company and 
its subsidiaries’ businesses and likely future developments is given in
the Performance Review. This includes, where appropriate, details of
financial instruments, financial risk management, significant events
since year end, as well as any research and development activities.
Dividends
During the year, the Group paid total dividends of 10.9p per share
(2004: 9.3p), comprising the final dividend for 2004 of 7.0p per share
and the interim dividend for 2005 of 3.9p per share. The Directors
now propose a final dividend of 8.1p per share (2004: 7.0p) making
a full year dividend of 12.0p per share (2004: 10.4p), an increase of
15.4% over last year . The final dividend, which is subject to shareholder
approval, will be paid on 16 June 2006, to shareholders on the Register
at 2 June 2006. 
Share capital
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company, together
with details of the movements in the Company’ s issued share capital
during the year, are shown in note 18 to the financial statements.
Purchase of own shares
The Company is, until the date of the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting, generally and unconditionally authorised to buy back a

issued share capital at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 
12 May 2006.

(appointed 1 January 2006)
On 1 March 2005, WG Hauser was appointed joint Chief Executive
Officer. On 31 March 2005, RC Nelson ceased to be joint Chief

Other than employment contracts, none of the Directors of the

or its subsidiary undertakings, other than WG Hauser who, until

provide support to assist the Group in its expansion. The terms of the
Directors’ service contracts and the Directors’ interests in the shares
and options of the Company are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
Directors’ indemnities
The Companies (Audit, Investigations and Community Enterprise) Act
2004, which came into force on 6 April 2005, changes the provisions
of section 310 of the Companies Act 1985, and gives companies 
the power to extend indemnities to Directors against liability to third
parties (excluding criminal and regulatory penalties) and also to pay
Directors’ legal costs in advance, provided that these are reimbursed
to the Company should the individual Director be convicted or, in an
action brought by the Company, where judgment is given against 
the Director. The Company currently has a Directors’ and Officers’
Insurance policy in place, which provides this cover.
Employment policy
The Group’ s employment policy is to ensure that all employees are
assessed solely in terms of their ability irrespective of their race, religion,
colour, age, disability, gender or sexual orientation.
In accordance with the Group’ s equal opportunities policy, people
with disabilities are given the same consideration as others when they
apply for jobs. Depending on their skills and abilities, they enjoy the
same career prospects as other employees. Where employees become
disabled, every effort will be made to retain them in their current role
or to explore possibilities for retraining or redeployment within the
Group. Where necessary, the Group aims to provide such employees
with facilities, equipment and training to assist them in doing their jobs.
The Company is committed to offering its key employees the opportunity
to align themselves more closely with the interests of shareholders
and the Company’ s performance, through the ownership of the
Company’ s shares. The Company operates share schemes for key
employees and details are contained in the Remuneration Report.
The health and safety of the Group’ s employees is a matter of primary
concern. Accordingly, it is the Group’ s policy to manage its activities
so as to avoid any unnecessary or unacceptable risks and to have in
place procedures that conform to best practice in this area.
A small number of the Group’ s employees are members of trade
unions and work councils, mostly in continental Europe. The Group
communicates regularly with the union representatives and aims to
maintain good labour relations with all its employees.

Policy and practice on payment of suppliers
The Group does not follow any code or standard on payment practice
but has a variety of payment terms with its suppliers. Payment terms
are agreed at the commencement of business with each supplier 
and it is the policy of the Group that payment is made accordingly,
subject to the terms and conditions being met. The Company has 
no trade creditors.

share capital.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and
the Group and parent Company financial statements, in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law
the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and have elected to
prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with
UK Accounting Standards.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in
relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant
part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements are required by law to give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent
Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible
for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report
and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law 
and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’ s
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.

Remuneration Report
This report sets out the Group’ s policy and disclosures in relation to
Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2005 and,
as required by schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, The Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the Regulations), will be
subject to shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting (AGM). The report fully complies with the requirements of
the Regulations and the Combined Code (the Code) and has been
audited by KPMG Audit Plc to the extent required by the Regulations. 
The Group has applied the Principles of Good Corporate Governance
relating to the remuneration of its Directors and this report outlines
how the Group has complied with the provisions of the Combined
Code as well as some of the guidelines issued by institutional bodies.
Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
The Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Company’ s
policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior
management. The Committee determines their total remuneration
packages, including any compensation on termination of office. 
The Committee also provides advice and consults with the Chief
Executive Officer on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of
senior executives. T o ensure that the Group’ s remuneration practices
are market competitive, the Committee takes advice from various
independent sources. The Committee met six times during 2005.
The Remuneration Committee was comprised of the following Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. 
DP Allvey (Chairman)
RE Sayers (until 25 November 2005)
VE Treves
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other
than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided. No Director plays
a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration. They give
due regard to the interests of shareholders and the requirements of
the Listing Rules and associated guidance. T o help achieve its objectives,
the Committee has appointed and taken independent advice from
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (New Bridge Street), remuneration
consultants, in relation to remuneration matters and on share
incentive arrangements. New Bridge Street do not have any other
connection with the Company. 
The Board, with the support of external professional advice, determines
the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration policy 
The Committee’ s principal objective is to attract, retain, motivate and
reward high calibre individuals to ensure the future success of the
business and to deliver both short and long-term shareholder value.
The objective is to maintain a competitive package of pay and benefits,
commensurate with comparable packages of pay and benefits
provided by other companies of comparable size and complexity in
the FTSE 250 index. For overseas executives, the objective is to provide
a competitive package that is commensurate with comparable
packages paid to employees of other overseas organisations doing 
a similar sized job in that region. 
Through use of bonus incentives, the policy provides the opportunity
to earn upper quartile remuneration in return for exceptional
performance; median remuneration in return for median performance;
whilst poor performance will result in remuneration significantly
below the pay comparator group median. This strong alignment 
with performance is demonstrably in the interests of shareholders
and provides the senior executives with unambiguous signals about
the importance of delivering success to the Company’ s shareholders
in both the short and long-term.
The Company anticipates that its policy for 2006 and for the foreseeable
future will remain the same.
Executive Directors 
Base salary 
The base salary is set by the Remuneration Committee and is targeted
at the market median and annual increases are linked to:
• Annual market movement
• Demonstrable efforts and results in team building and leadership;
and
• Demonstrable efforts and results in contributing to the building 
of Intertek Group efficiency, synergy and strategy.
Performance bonuses
The Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible for annual
incentive payments for the achievement of annual financial and
strategic goals of the Group and its businesses. The financial targets
are derived from the strategic planning process for the Group and its
businesses which is the cornerstone of the Group’ s results culture. 
All Executive Directors and senior executives’ bonus criteria contain
Group performance elements. This typically accounts for between
20% and 90% of the total bonus achievable, although for Executive
Vice Presidents, it is proposed to increase the Group performance
element to 25% in 2006 and 30% in 2007. During 2005, the Group
performance bonus targets focused on increasing Group Earnings
per Share (EPS), operating profit growth, operating cash flow as 
a percentage of operating profit and return on tangible business
assets, as compared to the previous year. In conjunction with the
introduction of the Intertek Deferred Bonus Plan (the Plan), the
maximum annual cash bonus potential of the Executive Directors
decreased from 70% to 50% of salary in the case of the Chief
Executive and from 50% to 40% of salary in the case of the two
remaining Executive Directors. These amounts include a modest
discretionary element, payable in appropriate circumstances, subject
to Committee approval. 
The Group bonus for all Executive Directors and senior management
is apportioned as follows:
Measure Notes Percentage of group bonus 
EPS 1 50%
Operating profit growth 2 25%
Operating cash flow/operating profit 15%
Return on tangible business assets 3 10%
Total 100%

1 Basic earnings per share.
2 Operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets and goodwill impairment,

3 Return on operating assets excluding goodwill (based on Labtest division for R Kong).
All targets are established and approved by the Committee and 
the bonus paid is dependant on the achievement of appropriate
thresholds for each relevant measure. Based on the above measures,
for 2005 bonuses of 27.3%, 21.9% and 10.4% of salary were
accrued for WG Hauser, W Spencer and R Kong, respectively.
Bonuses are not pensionable.
Pensions 
WG Hauser has a personal pension arrangement, to which the
Company contributes 20% of his base salary. RC Nelson also had a
private pension arrangement, to which the Company ceased making
contributions on 8 April 2005. Contributions for WG Hauser and 
RC Nelson were within Inland Revenue limits. W Spencer participates
in the Company’ s UK final salary pension scheme on the same basis
as other eligible employees. R Kong participates in the “Intertek
Hong Kong Retirement Scheme” on the same basis as other eligible
local executive employees in Hong Kong. See page 30 to 32 for 
more information.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors
of the Company. Following a review by New Bridge Street, fees
increased during the year, as disclosed in the notes to the Directors’
remuneration summary on page 29. Remuneration is neither
pensionable nor eligible for annual incentive payments. The Non-
Executive Directors are not allowed to participate in the Company’ s
share incentive plans. Other than VE Treves, who has the benefit of 
a company car, and RC Nelson, for whom the Group maintains a life
insurance policy , no other benefits in kind are provided.
Service contracts
Details of the service contracts currently in place for Directors who
have served during the year are as follows:
Executive Directors 
RC Nelson ceased to be Chief Executive Officer on 31 March 2005.
WG Hauser was appointed Chief Executive Officer with effect from 
1 March 2005 and has a service contract from that date, whilst 
W Spencer has a service contract dated 24 May 2002. The service
contract of R Kong is dated 14 May 2002. All are 12-month rolling
contracts terminable by either party on 12 month’ s notice and
contain provisions by way of compensation for loss of office, limited
to payment of salary and bonus over a 12-month period, and benefits
in lieu of notice. None of the Directors’ service contracts contain
provisions regarding a change of control.
Non-Executive Directors 
RC Nelson was appointed Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, effective
8 April 2005 and a further Non-Executive Director, D Rade, was
appointed on 1 January 2006. The Non-Executive Directors do not
have service contracts with the Company. The letter of engagement
for each Non-Executive Director states that they are appointed for an
initial period of three years. At the end of the initial period the contract
may be renewed for a further period if the Company and the Director
agree. WG Hauser had a consultancy agreement with the Company
until 1 March 2005, the details of which are disclosed in note 28 to
the financial statements.
Policy on external appointments
The Company recognises that, during their employment with the
Company , Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive
Directors of other companies and that such duties can broaden their
experience and knowledge. Executive Directors may, with written
consent of the Company, accept one such appointment outside the
Company. WG Hauser is Chairman of an advisory consultancy board
of Dragenopharm GmbH & Co KG.
Share incentives 
The Company believes that share ownership by employees is an
integral part of its programme to incentivise, reward and retain
employees as it strengthens the link between the employee’ s personal
interest and that of the shareholders and enables them to benefit
from the growth of the Company. In order to encourage share
ownership, the Company established a share option scheme for
senior management in March 1997. This scheme was discontinued
and replaced by the Intertek Group plc 2002 Share Option Plan (the
2002 Plan) and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option
Plan (the Approved Plan) on 9 May 2002, under which options were
granted by either the Board or the Employee Share Ownership Trust
on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. All awards
were discretionary. 
During 2005, the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of
the Company’ s long-term incentive arrangements, in conjunction with
New Bridge Street. This review concluded that the Company should
adopt a new long term incentive plan, linked to the existing cash
bonus arrangement, ‘the Intertek Deferred Bonus Plan’ (the Plan).
Shareholders approved the adoption of this Plan at the AGM in May
2005. The Plan will operate from 2006 onwards, based on bonuses
payable in respect of the financial year ending 31 December 2005.

Remuneration Report
continued
The Deferred Bonus Plan (the Plan) 
The Plan has two elements:
• Deferred Shares will be awarded to executives based on their
annual bonus out-turn. Executives will therefore be rewarded for
the achievement of performance which is directly within their
sphere of influence and the Remuneration Committee believes
that this will provide a simple and well-targeted form of reward.
• Matching Shares will be awarded to the most senior executives in
the Company. Awards of Matching Shares will be linked to awards
of Deferred Shares and will vest depending on the Company’ s
relative total shareholder return measured against the FTSE Mid 250,
in conjunction with an underlying increase in EPS. This measure 
of performance is considered relevant to the most senior executives
in the Company.
The annual maximum value of Deferred Shares will be the amount 
of the annual cash bonus to which it is linked or, 50% of basic salary,
whichever is the lower. In certain exceptional circumstances, such 
as recruitment or retention, the Remuneration Committee will have
discretion to make an award of Deferred Shares which is not linked
to the out-turn of the annual bonus but the same maximum salary
limit will apply. For executives who are not members of the Company’ s
Management Board it is intended that in most cases the limit for the
first grant of Deferred Shares will be up to 10% of salary, based on
the annual bonus out-turn.
The maximum number of Matching Shares which may be awarded to
an individual will be up to twice the number of their corresponding
Deferred Shares (i.e. a 2:1 match). It is currently intended that this level
of Matching Shares will be awarded to members of the Company’ s
Management Board while for other participants the level will be 1:1.
The first awards of Deferred Shares will be made around April 2006,
and will be based on bonuses for the year ended 31 December 2005.
In conjunction with the introduction of the Plan and with effect from
the 2005 financial year, the maximum annual cash bonus potential 
of the Executive Directors and the two other most senior executives
in the Company (being the members of the Company’ s Management
Board) has decreased from 70% of salary in the case of the Chief
Executive Officer and 50% of salary in the case of the other members
of the Management Board, to 50% and 40% respectively.
The Committee also introduced a shareholding retention requirement
for the Management Board and other senior executives. They are now
expected, within five years, to build up a shareholding in the Company
over shares worth at least 100% of base salary for the members 
of the Management Board and 35% of base salary for other senior
executives. T o assist in the building of this holding, it is expected that,
after allowing for tax and similar liabilities, 100% of the shares subject
to each vested award under the Plan will be retained by the executive
until the ownership target is attained.
The 2002 Plan
Only Executive Directors or employees of the Group were eligible to
participate in the 2002 Plan. The exercise price is determined by the
average of the closing middle market quotations of an ordinary share
in the Company on the five dealing days immediately prior to the
date of grant and the options are exercisable between three and ten
years after the date of grant, provided the performance condition has
been satisfied. The Remuneration Committee will decide whether the
performance condition has been met at the appropriate time.
Options have been granted annually, with each tranche equating to
approximately 1% of the Company’ s issued share capital. No individual
has been granted options with a value of more than their annual base
salary in each year. The options are subject to performance criteria
unless there are regulatory or legal difficulties in jurisdictions where
the employee is based. The performance condition requires that the
growth in the Company’ s EPS outperforms the growth in the UK
Retail Price Index (RPI) by a minimum of 5% per annum over a three
year period. If the condition is met, 25% of the options become
exercisable. If the growth rate is 8% then 66.6% of options become
exercisable. 100% of the options would only become exercisable 
if the Company’ s growth in EPS outperformed the growth in the UK
Retail Price Index by 11% per annum over a three year period. For
growth rates between 5% and 8%, and 8% and 11%, the
percentage of options exercisable is calculated on a sliding scale. 
In respect of options granted prior to 2005, if the performance targets
are not met in full for the initial performance period of three years,
the performance period may be extended by one further period of 
12 months, to ascertain whether the balance of the unvested options
can be exercised. The grant of options in 2005 did not have a re-testing
provision. The above performance criteria were selected to closely
link improvement in performance with increase in shareholder value.
Other than in the case of hardship, senior executives are required to
retain 25% of their shares acquired upon the exercise of their options
(ignoring shares sold to meet any tax liability and the financing cost
on exercise), for a period of up to two years following exercise, in order
to demonstrate their commitment to the Group.
The Approved Plan
The key features of the Approved Plan (which has been approved 
by the Inland Revenue) are broadly the same as for the 2002 Plan,
except that options are granted subject to the requirement that the
aggregate exercise price of all the subsisting options granted to an
employee under the Approved Plan must not exceed £30,000.
No further awards are to be made under the 2002 Plan or the
Approved Plan. 
The Committee regularly reviews the appropriateness of the Company’ s
share incentive arrangements and targets to ensure that they remain
stretching. It considers that the existing performance conditions and
vesting schedules remain appropriate and in line with the Company’ s
current circumstances, business outlook and strategy. In addition, the
Committee can confirm that a consistent approach to performance
measurement has been adopted, following the implementation of
Adopted International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other
than those described above. Other than as stated above, no significant
amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions
of any entitlement of a Director to share incentives.

Benefits in kind
The principal benefits in kind for Executive Directors are a company
car, private medical and permanent health insurance, life assurance
and personal accident insurance. In addition, WG Hauser received
payments for a limited time in respect of relocation, housing allowance
and flights for himself and his family, as well as payment in lieu of 
a company car. R Kong is provided with a housing allowance, club
membership and an air ticket between London and Hong Kong for
himself and his spouse every two years. VE Treves is provided with 
a company car. There is also a life assurance policy for £1,000,000 
on behalf of RC Nelson to be maintained for the whole of his life and
payable to his beneficiaries on his death.
Pensions
Details of the Executive Directors’ pension arrangements are shown
below. In order to ensure that there is no adverse impact on liabilities,
the Group plans to make certain modifications to its UK pension
schemes as a result of changes in UK pensions’ legislation, which
take effect from April 2006. The majority of the Group’ s employees
are non-UK and are therefore unaffected. Further details of the Group’ s
pension schemes, including the funding position, are disclosed in
note 22 to the financial statements.
WG Hauser
WG Hauser is not a member of a Group company pension scheme.
Instead, the Group contributes 20% of his base salary in respect of
a personal pension arrangement. During 2005, this amounted to
£66,667 (2004: £nil). WG Hauser is entitled to a death in service
benefit comprising a lump sum payment equivalent to four times 
his base salary.
RC Nelson
Until 8 April 2005, the Group made contributions into a private
pension arrangement on behalf of RC Nelson. T otal contributions
were £44,413 (2004: £173,737), contributions being based on the
greater of:
• Inland Revenue contribution limits allowed under retirement annuity
contracts, currently 27.5% of relevant earnings (base salary plus
bonus); or
• Inland Revenue contribution limits allowed under personal pension
schemes (currently 40% of relevant earnings) on the maximum
earnings on which contributions attract relief, currently £105,600
for 2005/2006 plus 40% of the excess to base salary.
A death in service benefit comprising a lump sum payment equivalent
to four times base annual salary, was also provided to RC Nelson until
8 April 2005.

Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance
and this report outlines where the Company has complied with the
provisions of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 (the Code).
During 2005, the Company complied with almost all the provisions
of the Code. Those areas of non-compliance are described in this
report. The Board is accountable to the Company’ s shareholders for
good corporate governance and this statement describes how the
relevant principles of governance have been applied to the Company.
The Board
An effective Board is in place, which provides entrepreneurial
leadership and controls the Group. The Board’ s main roles are to create
value for shareholders, to lead the Group, to approve the Group’ s
strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary financial and other
resources are made available to enable them to meet those objectives.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of
the Group. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of
the Annual Report and financial statements (Annual Report) is set out
on page 25. All Directors have a wide range of experience, bringing
independent judgment to bear in the interests of the Company on
issues of strategy , performance, resources and standards of conduct,
and the Board has the appropriate wide range of skills, which is vital to
the success of the Group. 
There were nine scheduled Board meetings held in 2005. Outside
these, there was frequent contact between Directors to discuss the
Company’ s affairs and develop its business. Directors’ attendance at
Board meetings is shown in the table on page 35. Also, on more than
one occasion, the Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors
without the Executive Directors being present. 
The Group has identified a number of key areas that are subject to
regular reporting to the Board and this enables the performance of
management to be reviewed and monitored by the Board. A Board
matrix is in place which formally outlines the matters specifically
requiring the consent of the full Board and includes, inter alia, the
approval of Group strategy and operating plans, the annual budget,
the Annual Report, the Interim Report and related announcements,
major divestments and capital expenditure, large acquisitions and
disposals, the recommendation of dividends and the approval of
treasury and risk management policies. 
The Board matrix also identifies areas where executive management
can grant approval subject to certain financial limits. Where any of
the activities involve amounts greater than the limits laid down for
executive management approval they are referred to the Board.
The authorities in the Board matrix are reviewed regularly and any
changes are approved by the Board. The Board matrix is
communicated to all senior management to ensure that throughout
the Group it is known when Board approval is required. 
During the year, the Board consisted of the Chairman VE Treves, the
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman RC Nelson, the Chief Executive
Officer WG Hauser, two Executive Directors, W Spencer and R Kong,
and, following the death of RE Sayers on 25 November 2005, one
independent Non-Executive Director, DP Allvey, who is also the Senior
Independent Director. A further independent Non-Executive Director,
D Rade, was appointed on 1 January 2006. The Directors’
biographies appear on pages 22 and 23. 
Each Director will ensure that if he/she has any concerns which
cannot be resolved about the Company or a proposed action, that
such concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Appropriate insurance
cover is in place in respect of legal action against the Directors.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and
the Chief Executive Officer and they have been set out in writing and
approved by the Board. The Chairman met the independence criteria
set out in the Code on appointment to the Board in May 2002.
The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy
and in the achievement of its objectives. The Chairman is responsible
for organising the business of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness
and setting its agenda. The Chairman has no involvement in the day
to day business of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the effective
contribution of the Non-Executive Directors, and constructive relations
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors, ensures Directors
receive accurate, timely and clear information and effective
communication with shareholders. The Chief Executive Officer has
direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable
to the Board for the financial and operational performance of
the Group.
The Board comprises a balance of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors who bring a wide range of skills and experience to the
deliberations of the Board. The Non-Executive Directors fulfil a vital
role in corporate accountability.
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to ensure
that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are fully
discussed and critically examined, not only in the best long-term
interests of shareholders, but also to ensure that they take proper
account of the interests of customers and employees. The Non-
Executive Directors are all experienced and influential individuals and
through their mix of skills and business experience they contribute
significantly to the effective functioning of the Board and its
committees, ensuring that matters are fully debated and that no one
individual or group dominates the decision making process.
The Board considers DP Allvey and D Rade to be independent Non-
Executive Directors. With effect from 1 March 2005, WG Hauser was
appointed Chief Executive Officer , whilst RC Nelson was appointed
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman on 8 April 2005. Under the provisions
of the Code, RC Nelson is not considered to be independent because
of his previous service as an executive. However , the Board believes that
during the year ended 31 December 2005, RC Nelson continued to
bring valuable expertise to the Board through his extensive knowledge
of the business and was also instrumental in ensuring a smooth
transition during the change in Chief Executive Officer .
D Rade was appointed on 1 January 2006, following a review of the
Board’ s composition, and after consulting with advisors as to suitable
candidates. Despite this appointment, the Board, excluding the
Chairman, does not meet the requirements of the Code, which
requires the Board to comprise at least half independent Non-
Executive Directors. However, the Board believes that its current
composition, taking into account the overall balance of skills,
knowledge and experience, still resulted in an efficient and effective
board operation, whilst maintaining an appropriate balance between
Executive and Non-Executive Directors.

T o enable all the Directors to discharge their duties, they have full and
timely access to all relevant information. The Board papers are
circulated well before the Board meetings to ensure that Directors
have the necessary time to read and review the papers. The Non-
Executive Directors receive monthly management accounts and
regular management reports and information which enable them to
scrutinise the Group’ s and management’ s performance against
agreed objectives and prior performance.
A formal induction programme has been established for new
Directors and this is tailored to suit the individual to ensure that it is
appropriate for their level of previous experience. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary who will assist in arranging any additional information as
required. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is
a matter for the Board as a whole.
Each year a conference is held, attended by the Board and senior
management from each division and geographic area, in order to
discuss strategy and policy. In 2005, the Board also visited
Manchester, UK and Shanghai, China to tour some of the Group’ s
facilities and meet local management. These meetings help to ensure
that the Directors continue to develop their knowledge of the
Group’ s business and get to know its senior management.
All Directors are entitled to obtain independent professional advice,
at the Company’ s expense, in the performance of their duties as
Directors. No such advice was sought during the year. 
During 2004, a performance evaluation process led by the Chairman,
was established for each Director, Committee and the Board as a
whole. This comprised a series of questionnaires which provide a
framework for the evaluation process, and provide the Chairman
with a means of making year-on-year comparisons. There are five
questionnaires in total, one for each of the following: the Board; each
individual Director; the Remuneration Committee; the Nomination
Committee; and the Audit Committee. 
This annual evaluation process ensures that the performance of each
individual Director and the functioning and constitution of the Board
and each Committee are properly measured. The Chairman assessed
the individual performance of each Director, in consultation with the
other Directors. The Senior Independent Director, taking into account
the views of the Executive Directors, had discussions with the other
Non-Executive Directors without the Chairman being present in order
to appraise the Chairman’ s performance during the year. These
assessments concluded that the performance of the Board, each
Committee and each Director was and is effective and that all
Directors demonstrate full commitment in their respective roles to 
the Company. The Board will continue to develop this process as
necessary in order to ensure that it can properly review, on an 
annual basis, its performance and that of its Committees and
individual Directors.
Board Committees
The Board has established several Committees, each with clearly
defined terms of reference, procedures and powers. All Committees
operate in accordance with the relevant terms of reference as approved
by the Board. Copies of the terms of reference for each of these
Committees are available on request from the Secretariat Department
at the registered office or can be downloaded from www.intertek.com.
The number of full Board meetings and Committee meetings attended
by each Director during the year was as follows:

Figures in brackets indicate the maximum number of meetings in the period during which the relevant individual was a Director or 
Committee member.
Membership of the three relevant Board Committees is set out below.
As reported earlier, sadly RE Sayers, who was a member of all Board
Committees, died on 25 November 2005.
The Remuneration Committee 
This Committee currently comprises two Non-Executive Directors, 
DP Allvey (Chairman) and VE T reves. Prior to his death on 25 November
2005, RE Sayers was also a member of the Committee. Under the Code,
VE Treves is not viewed as independent as he is Chairman of the
Company, therefore the Company was not in full compliance with the
Code, which requires the Remuneration Committee to have at least
three independent Non-Executive Directors. The composition of this
Committee is being reviewed following the death of RE Sayers, however ,
during 2005, the Remuneration Committee was evaluated and the
Board agreed that membership of the Committee was appropriate
and effective and also deemed that VE Treves exercised independent
judgment on all remuneration matters referred to that Committee. 
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to
the Board on the Group’ s policy for the remuneration of the Executive
Directors and senior executives and for the determination, within
agreed terms of reference, of additional benefits for each of the
Executive Directors, including pension rights and any compensation
for loss of office. The Committee is also responsible for the
implementation and operation of employee share incentive
arrangements. During 2005, the Remuneration Committee
met six times.
8185_Intertek_AR_p34_39_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  12:00 pm  Page 35 The Nomination Committee
This Committee currently comprises two Non-Executive Directors, 
VE T reves (Chairman) and DP Allvey . Prior to his death on 25 November
2005, RE Sayers was also a member of the Committee. Under the
Code, VE Treves is not viewed as independent as he is Chairman of
the Company, therefore after 25 November 2005, the Company was
not in full compliance with the Code, which requires a Nomination
Committee to have a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors.
The composition of this Committee is being reviewed following the
death of RE Sayers, however, during 2005, this Committee was
evaluated and the Board agreed that membership of the Committee
was appropriate and effective and also deemed that VE T reves exercised
independent judgment on the issues presented to that Committee. 
This Committee, which met once during the year, nominates
candidates to fill Board vacancies, reviews succession planning and
makes recommendations to the Board on the balance and composition
of the Board in order to ensure that the Board is effective in discharging
its responsibilities. Bearing in mind the balance of skills, knowledge
and experience on the Board, a job description is prepared for any
new Board position and when a Non–Executive Director is appointed,
the Committee will ensure that he or she has confirmed that they can
devote sufficient time to fulfil the commitments of the role. The terms
and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are
available for inspection by any person at the Company’ s registered
office during normal business hours and at the Annual General
Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting).
All new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first
AGM after their appointment and then are subject to re-election by
shareholders once every three years. 
The policy on Directors’ service contracts is set out in the
Remuneration Report.
The Audit Committee 
This Committee currently comprises two Non-Executive Directors, 
DP Allvey (Chairman) and VE T reves. Prior to his death on 25 November
2005, RE Sayers was also a member of the Committee. Under the
Code, VE Treves is not viewed as independent as he is Chairman of
the Company, therefore the Company was not in full compliance
with the Code, which requires an Audit Committee to have at least
three independent Non-Executive Directors. The composition of this
Committee is being reviewed following the death of RE Sayers,
however, during 2005, the Audit Committee was evaluated and the
Board agreed that membership of the Committee was appropriate
and effective and also deemed that VE Treves exercised independent
judgment on all issues presented to that Committee. DP Allvey has
recent and relevant financial experience as detailed in his biography
on page 23.
The Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the Group’ s financial
statements and any formal announcements relating to the Group’ s
performance. The Committee is responsible for monitoring the
effectiveness of the external audit process and making recommendations
to the Board in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and
remuneration of the external auditor. It is responsible for ensuring
that an appropriate relationship between the Group and the external
auditors is maintained. It also reviews annually the Group’ s systems of
internal control and the processes for monitoring and evaluating the
risks facing the Group. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of
the internal audit function and is responsible for approving 
the appointment and termination of the head of that function. 
The Committee meets with Senior Compliance and Internal Audit
members at least once a year without management present.
The Group’ s auditors, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
Vice President Financial Control, Vice President Compliance and the
Head of Internal Audit, usually attend Committee meetings. The
Group’ s auditors meet with the members of the Audit Committee
alone at least once a year.
The Audit Committee seeks to ensure the continued independence
and objectivity of the Group’ s auditors and in this regard, monitors
the level of non-audit work undertaken for the Group. In 2004, 
a policy on the provision of non-audit work by the external auditor
was approved by the Board to ensure that auditor objectivity and
independence is safeguarded. The policy highlights those areas
where the external auditor cannot provide services to the Group and
they include inter alia, the provision of Group management functions,
internal audit outsourcing, provision of legal advice and recruitment
and remuneration advice. A breakdown of the audit and non-audit
fees paid to the Group’ s auditors during the year is set out in note 4
to the financial statements.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual
Report and the Interim Report remains with the Board. During 2005,
the Audit Committee met five times. The Chairman and other
Committee members when available, also attend meetings held with
the external auditor and management to discuss any accounting
issues associated with the full-year audit and half-year review. 
Internal Control 
Many of Intertek’ s primary business objectives relate to compliance:
we ensure that we conform to local, national and international laws
and we require our employees to show integrity and honesty in 
all business dealings. Risk management and internal controls are
therefore embedded in the running of each division, assuring the
accuracy and validity of reports and certificates that we provide to
customers. Although the Directors are ultimately responsible for
establishing and maintaining the Group’ s system of internal control
and for reviewing its effectiveness, such a system is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and can only provide reasonable assurance against
material mis-statement or loss.
The Board can confirm that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks to the Group’ s short and
long-term value, including those arising from social, environmental
and ethical matters. This process has been in place for the year under
review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report is regularly
reviewed by the Board, and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. 
No material breaches of any internal controls were identified during
the year. In carrying out the risk review the Board is satisfied that it
received adequate information from the operations around the world.
Training is provided to Directors on these matters where necessary.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the system
of financial and non-financial internal control. In particular, it has
reviewed and continues to seek to improve the process for identifying
and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the

policies and procedures by which these risks are managed. This has
been reinforced by the adoption of a Code of Ethical Business Conduct,
approved by the Board, which provides practical guidance 
and instruction for staff. A copy of this Code is available on
www.intertek.com. 
The Group operates a zero tolerance policy in regard to breaches of
ethics and employees are required to sign a certificate confirming their
understanding that any breaches of the Group’ s code of ethics will result
in disciplinary action that may include dismissal of the employee
concerned. T o support Group policies and raise concerns about possible
improprieties in matters of financial reporting and other matters there 
is an independent e-mail and telephone hotline so that staff may report
anonymously any inaccurate or unethical working practices. The telephone
hotline is managed by an independent third party .
In carrying out its review, the Audit Committee endeavours to ensure
that the Group has in place the most appropriate and effective controls,
checks, systems and risk management techniques so as to be in line
with best practice on such matters. 
Each operating division is responsible for the identification and
evaluation of significant risks applicable to that area of business
together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated
with a variety of internal or external sources including control
breakdowns, disruption of information systems, competition, natural
catastrophe and regulatory requirements.
A process of control using self-assessment and hierarchical reporting has
been established which provides a documented trail of accountability.
These procedures are applied across Group operations and provide 
for continuing assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels of
management and finally, to the Board. This process is facilitated by
internal audit which also provides assurance as to the operation and
validity of the system of internal control. Planned corrective actions are
independently monitored for timely completion.
Each division reports annually to the Audit Committee via the Chief
Financial Officer on its review of risks and how they are managed.
Each year senior managers throughout the Group confirm the adequacy
of their systems of internal controls, compliance with Group policies,
local laws and regulations and report any control weaknesses identified
in the past year . The Audit Committee’ s main role is to review, on behalf
of the Board, the key risks inherent in the business and the system of
controls necessary to ensure such risks are properly managed. 
The Chief Financial Officer heads a central compliance team, which
co-ordinates the quality assurance function and claims management.
Quality assurance audits are carried out by the divisions and the
findings reported to divisional management and to centrally controlled
compliance officers who report to the Chief Financial Officer. Each
division has at least one dedicated compliance officer who undertakes
investigations of issues that arise either from quality assurance audits
or by other means such as the employee hotline. Reports of significant
findings are presented to the Audit Committee. Each geographic
region has an internal auditor who is independent of the divisions. 
The main reporting sites are reviewed annually. The other sites are
reviewed regularly on a schedule based on materiality and risk.
Reports of significant findings are presented to the Audit Committee
and it monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit
function. The international internal audit department was awarded
ISO 9001: 2000 accreditation in 2004, one of the few internal audit
teams in the UK to have achieved this standard.
The Group has implemented internal audit systems to facilitate
compliance with applicable requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development and similar laws and
regulations affecting the conduct of its business.
The Group will, from time to time, be required by its customers to
operate in countries where there is potential political and economic risk.
In doing so, the Group maintains a policy of facilitating international
trade inspection and audit services that help to prevent corruption and
assist with humanitarian aid. Where there are no laws in place that
prohibit business dealings in certain countries, the Group will consider
operating in those countries, but only in strict accordance with its
stringent Code of Ethics and Compliance.
The Audit Committee reviews the assurance procedures, ensuring that
an appropriate mix of techniques is used to attain the level of assurance
required by the Board.
The Chief Executive Officer also reports to the Board on significant
changes in the business and the external environment, which could
impact on risk. The Chief Financial Officer provides the Board with
monthly financial information, which includes the comparison of key
performance figures against budget and forecasts, risk indicators and
compliance with covenants. Where areas for improvement in the
system are identified, the Board considers the recommendations made
by management and the Audit Committee. The Board approves the
treasury policy and that department’ s activities are also subject to
internal audit.
Relations with Shareholders
Full details are disclosed in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
Going Concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Group’ s financial statements.
Corporate Social Responsibilty
The Board recognises that the Group has a responsibility to act ethically
in relation to the physical and social environment in which it operates
and that failure to do so could adversely impact on the Group’ s long
and short-term value, as a result of financial penalty and loss of
customer support. It takes such responsibilities seriously paying due
regard to international and local laws in all its dealings. Further details
are disclosed in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report
Introduction
At Intertek Group plc, we take our duty to behave responsibly in
governance and ethics seriously . We will continue to build our corporate
social responsibility commitments in the coming years, in addition to
fulfilling national and international legal requirements. Our policy can
be summarised as follows:
Governance
Intertek is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
as outlined in the Corporate Governance Report and the Board is
accountable to the Company’ s shareholders for ensuring that principles
of good governance are applied. 
Ethics
At Intertek, and as individuals, we:
• Value trust and personal responsibility;
• Act with integrity, honesty and respect;
• Deliver excellent services that add value to our customers’ business;
• Focus on continual growth and outstanding performance;
• Strive to create a safe work environment;
• Value each employee’ s contribution toward achieving our 
business objectives;
• Promote a culture where motivated customer-orientated
employees can flourish, experience professional fulfilment 
and reach their highest potential; and
• Respect diverse perspectives, experiences and traditions as essential.
The foundation of the policy rests with the Group’ s employees, each
of whom must sign a Code of Ethics, as detailed in the Corporate
Governance Report.
Our Stakeholders
We aim to be as responsive as possible and to engage with a wide range
of stakeholders.
• Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given a high priority. The
Company produces an Annual Report, which is sent to shareholders.
At the half year, an Interim Report is published. The Company also
has a website (www.intertek.com) which contains up-to-date
information on the Group’ s activities and published financial results.
Shareholders can subscribe via the Investor Relations section of
www.intertek.com/investors/subscribeto/ to receive e-mail alerts 
of important announcements made by the Company.
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders. This includes
presentations after the Company has published its full year and half
year results, as well as on specific issues during 2005, such as the
review of share incentives and also on the change in Chief Executive
Officer. The Chairman ensures that any feedback from the institutional
shareholders is communicated directly to the Board and all the analysts’
and brokers’ reports on the Group are e-mailed directly to each
Director. The Chairman, Senior Independent Director and other Non-
Executive Directors have also attended meetings with institutional
shareholders during the year.
The Board views the Annual General Meeting as a valuable opportunity
to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes
their participation. All Board members attend the Annual General
Meeting and in particular, the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination
and Remuneration Committees are available to answer questions. 
At General Meetings, a schedule of the proxy votes cast is made
available to all shareholders. The Company proposes a resolution 
on each substantially separate issue and does not combine
resolutions inappropriately.
• Customers
Intertek is built upon a strong ethos of customer service. Years of
experience, detailed knowledge of testing and certification, local
legislation, culture and market conditions, comprehensive training
programmes and world class laboratories mean that clients receive
the most professional service to give them a competitive edge. 
We conduct internal and external customer care surveys and 
regular client contact reports. Listening to our customers helps us
understand what they expect from us and how we can meet and
exceed their expectations. 
• Employees
The Group provides equal opportunities for its staff as disclosed in
the Directors’ Report. 
Employees have regular appraisals with their line managers in order
to address any concerns and each division has a Human Resources
Director who can be contacted in the event of dissatisfaction. There is
also an externally managed telephone hotline, which employees can
use to anonymously report any matters of concern. 
Those employees affected by Hurricane Katrina were given access to
counselling and the Group has donated the equivalent of £70,000 
to affected employees and their families.
Diversity
Intertek has 15,500 employees in 108 countries and, together with
our policy to recruit local people, this diversity is one of our biggest
assets. Combined with pursuing practices that are sensitive to the
needs and cultures of our staff, diversity allows us to be adaptable
and more open to different ways of doing business, in line with local
practices and customs.
The Group provides equal opportunities for its entire staff, irrespective
of their ethnic or religious background, sex, sexual orientation or
disability, as disclosed in the Directors’ Report. 
Intertek employs only the best people for their role irrespective 
of gender; nevertheless we are keen to see the ratio of women 
in senior positions improve and have recently appointed a female
Non-Executive Director.

Community
Operating in many regions, we respect the rule of law within these
jurisdictions and support appropriate internationally accepted 
human rights.
• No use of live animals is made in any of the tests carried out 
by the Group;
• We offer independent Social Compliance Monitoring to our
customers through our Labtest division which monitors
manufacturers within developing countries, ensuring that work
practices and factory conditions are legal, humane and ethical,
including ensuring that no enforced or child labour is used. 
Intertek is also a Social Accountability 8000 certification body,
accredited by Social Accountability International in 1999, and was
the first external monitor to receive accreditation to the Worldwide
Responsible Apparel Production Certification Program (WRAP).
Intertek has also been accredited in multiple countries by the Fair
Labor Association (FLA) program, Außenhandelsvereinigung des
Deutschen Enzelhandels (AVE) program, and the International
Council of T oy Industries (ICTI) Code of Business Practices.
• Intertek aims to develop relationships with its suppliers that are
based upon mutual trust. It undertakes to pay suppliers on time
and according to agreed terms of trade. Our awareness of the
importance of prompt payment especially to small businesses is
demonstrated by this policy.
Environment
The Group is committed to preventing any adverse impact on the
environment as a result of its operations. The Group’ s worldwide 
risk management team is tasked with identifying all potential risks
and introducing procedures to prevent such an occurrence. Following
a review of policy on the audit of environmental risks, the Chief
Financial Officer will choose, typically, 10 to 15 sites per annum 
for review to determine whether procedures are being properly
implemented, and to advise on further precautionary measures. The
procedure for the disposal of samples is audited to ensure compliance.
A policy of zero tolerance for non-compliance with such procedures
is enforced and regular checks are carried out to ensure compliance.
In certain cases, the Group occupies facilities where pollution occurred
prior to the Group’ s use of the site. In each case the Group has
implemented remedial works, on the advice of third party specialists,
to minimise further damage to the environment. Environmental due
diligence is carried out before the acquisition of any new sites.
Intertek’ s Head Office was awarded a certificate of achievement for
office recycling, saving the equivalent in paper of 46 trees in 2005
and is expanding the range of products able to be recycled for 2006.
Health and Safety
Appropriate health and safety measures have been established and
are operated throughout the Group. Local compliance officers keep
the operation of such measures under regular review. Any incidents
are investigated by a central team of specialists, which makes
recommendations to avoid a repetition.

Notes to the financial statements
1 General
Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The Group
financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account
the Group’ s interest in associates. The parent company financial
statements present information about the Company as a separate
entity and not about its Group.
2 Significant accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs). The Company has
elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in
accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 72 to 73.
(b) Basis of preparation
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and
in preparing an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004, for the
purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRSs. The principal exception is
that, as more fully explained below, financial instruments accounting is
determined on different bases in 2005 and 2004 due to the transitional
provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Judgments made by the Directors in the application of these accounting
policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year
are discussed in note (v) below.
Transition to Adopted IFRSs
The Group is preparing its financial statements in accordance with
Adopted IFRSs for the first time and consequently has applied IFRS 1.
An explanation of how the transition to Adopted IFRSs has affected
the reported financial position and financial performance of the
Group is provided in note 29.
In addition to exempting companies from the requirements to restate
comparatives for IAS 32 and IAS 39, IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions
from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The
following exemptions have been taken in these financial statements:
• Business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2004, have
not been restated.
• Cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations have
been set to zero at 1 January 2004. 
The impact of the first time adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January
2005, is set out in the Consolidated statement of recognised income
and expense and in note 29. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis
except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair
value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments
classified as fair value through the income statement. Non-current assets
are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell. 
(c) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control exists
when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from
its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently
are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant
influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’ s share of 
the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity
accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences
until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’ s share
of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group’ s carrying amount
is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued
except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate. The Group
does not consider the associate to be an integral part of the Group’ s
operations and therefore its results are presented outside of the Group
operating profit.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and
losses or income and expenses arising from intra group transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated
to the extent of the Group’ s interest in the entity . Unrealised losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment.
(d) Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the
income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and
fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues
and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average
rates of exchange during the year . Foreign exchange differences arising
on translation are recognised directly in equity in a translation reserve.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations,
and of related qualifying hedges are taken directly to the translation
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1, to deem
the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be
zero at the date of transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
44 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005
8185_Intertek_AR_p44_71_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  1:05 pm  Page 44 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005 45
Prior to 1 January 2004, exchange differences arising from the translation
of foreign operations were recognised in retained earnings. 
(e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to economically hedge
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with 
its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.
The accounting policy up to 1 January 2005, was as follows:
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the
inception of contracts. Interest differentials on derivative instruments
and amounts receivable and payable on interest rate instruments are
recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the
contracts. Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised
on maturity of the underlying transaction. Gains and losses arising 
on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of
the underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss immediately.
The accounting policy from 1 January 2005, is as follows:
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are
stated at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. However, where
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant
gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see
accounting policy (f)). Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the
Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current
creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of forward
exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet
date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted
forward price and the exercise price of the contract. 
(f) Hedging
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of 
the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly
probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss
on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the
hedging reserve. The ineffective part of any gain or loss on the derivative
financial instrument is recognised in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,
or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the
hedged transaction is still expected to occur , the cumulative gain or loss
at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with
the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative
unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income
statement immediately .
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge
the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability ,
no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net
investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective
hedge is recognised directly in equity in a translation reserve. The
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed
cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses
(see accounting policy (I)).
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Where land
and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment
of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased
assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal
to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of items of property , plant and equipment.
Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings 50 years
Short leasehold land and buildings T erm of lease
Plant and equipment 3 – 10 years
Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets
are re-assessed annually.
(h) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase
method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 
1 January 2004, goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition 
of subsidiaries and associates, being the difference between the cost
of acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses
(see accounting policy (l)). Goodwill is allocated to cash generating
units (CGUs) and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included 
in the carrying amount of the investment in associate.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included
at 1 January 2004, on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents
the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable
save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was
amortised. On transition, certain items recognised as other intangibles
under Adopted IFRSs (but not all such items) have been separately
accounted for with appropriate adjustments against goodwill and
amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IFRS 1.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised in the 
income statement.
8185_Intertek_AR_p44_71_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  1:05 pm  Page 45 Annual Report 2005
Notes to the financial statements
continued
Purchased goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998,
was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition, in accordance
with the accounting standard then in force. 
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. If at the
balance sheet date the amounts of fair values of the acquiree’ s identifiable
assets and liabilities can only be established provisionally then these
values are used. Any adjustments to these values made within 12 months
of the acquisition date are taken as adjustments to goodwill. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group
are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of other intangible assets from the date
they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer relationships Up to 10 years
Know how Up to 5 years
Licenses Contractual life
Covenants not to compete Contractual life
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment
losses (see accounting policy (l)).
(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business
in bringing inventories to their present condition and location and net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated selling costs.
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part
of the Group’ s cash management are included as a component of cash
and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(l) Impairment
The carrying amount of the Group’ s assets other than inventories 
and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of
the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A cash generating unit
is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows
that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at 1 January 2004, the date 
of transition to Adopted IFRSs even though no indication of
impairment existed.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’ s net selling price
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate
largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined
for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Receivables
with a short duration are not discounted.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’ s
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no
impairment loss had been recognised. An impairment loss in respect
of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment
loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss
may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the recoverable amount.
(m) Dividends
Dividends are reported as a movement in equity in the period in which
they are approved by the shareholders.
(n) Interest-bearing borrowings
The accounting policy up to 1 January 2005, was as follows:
Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at face value less directly
attributable costs. The finance costs of the debt are allocated to
periods over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying
amount. All finance costs are charged to the income statement.
The accounting policy from 1 January 2005, is as follows:
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, less
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in
the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an
effective interest basis.
(o) Employee benefits
Defined contribution plan
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans
are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’ s net obligation in respect of significant defined benefit
pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for
their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted
to determine the present value, and the fair value of any plan assets
(at bid values) is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance
sheet date on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates
approximating to the terms of the Group’ s obligations. The calculation
is performed by a qualified actuary using the attained age method for
closed schemes and projected unit credit method for open schemes.
The resultant pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are
considered recoverable, or deficits, are recognised in full on the face
of the balance sheet. 
46 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005
8185_Intertek_AR_p44_71_KM_02_03.qxp  3/3/06  1:07 pm  Page 46 Intertek Group plc Annual Report 2005 47
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise
from the employees’ services in the accounting period is charged to
the income statement. The expected return on the schemes’ assets
and the interest on the present value of the schemes’ liabilities during
the accounting period are shown as finance income and finance
expense respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the
Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. 
The amendments in revised IAS 19 have been applied from 1 January
2005.
Share based payment transactions
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares
of the company. The fair value of options is recognised as an expense
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at
grant date and spread over the period during which the employee
becomes unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the
options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model. The
amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual
number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1: First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and has
recognised an expense only in respect of share options granted since
7 November 2002.
Own shares held by ESOT trust
Transactions of the Group sponsored ESOT trust are included in the
Group financial statements. In particular, the trust’ s purchase of shares
in the Company are debited directly to equity.
(p) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation.
(q) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
(r) Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered or
goods sold, excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement
when the relevant service is completed or in certain circumstances, in
proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the
balance sheet date. 
(s) Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease
incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an
integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated
using the effective interest rate method, amortisation of debt issuance
costs, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, income and
expense relating to pension assets and liabilities and gains and losses
on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement
(see accounting policy (f)). Interest income is recognised in the income
statement as it accrues using the effective interest method. The
interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in
the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
(t) Income tax 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
year , using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are
not provided for: initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit,
overseas retained earnings the distribution of which is under the control
of the Group and which are not likely to be distributed in the foreseeable
future, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the
extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the
balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends
are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
(u) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged
either in providing services (business segment) or in providing services
within a particular economic environment (geographic segment),
which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of
other segments.
(v) Significant accounting judgments and estimates
Judgments
In applying the Group’ s accounting policies described above,
management has made the following judgments that have a significant
impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

2005 and note 27 explains contingent liabilities in respect of certain
litigation. In making provision for claims, the management bases its
judgment on the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal
and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets,
prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents. The Group’ s legal
and warranty claims are reviewed, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis
by senior management.
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation at the balance sheet date that have a risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Intangible assets
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the
business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible
assets should be recognised separately from goodwill. If such an asset
is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of
the asset. Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic
benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation. Details
of intangible assets are given in note 10.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a minimum on
an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the
cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the
value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected
future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill
at a determined discount rate to calculate the present value of those
cash flows. Note 10 sets out details of impairment in the year. 
Recoverability of trade receivables
Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for
doubtful accounts. This provision is based primarily on the Group’ s
ageing policy guidelines and on individual customer analysis.
Employee post retirement benefit obligations
The Group has two principal defined pension benefit plans. The
obligations under these plans are recognised in the balance sheet and
represent the present value of the obligation calculated by independent
actuaries, with input from management. These actuarial valuations
include assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary
progression and mortality rates. These assumptions vary from time to
time according to prevailing economic and social conditions. Details
of the assumptions used are provided in note 22. 
(w) Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
The following Adopted IFRSs were available for early application but
have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements:
IFRS 7: Financial instruments: Disclosure.
This is applicable for years commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The application of IFRS 7 in 2005, would not have affected the
balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned only
with disclosure. The Group plans to adopt it in 2007.
Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4
The Company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in
relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to
guarantee the indebtedness of other Companies within its group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a
payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on
the financial statements for the period commencing 1 January 2006.

(see notes 12 and 19).
The effective tax rate was 23.6% (2004: 26.3%). The main reason for the reduction in the effective tax rate was the recognition of deferred
assets due to improved taxable income in certain jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is expected to be sustainable at close to current year levels
for the short to medium-term.

8 Earnings per ordinary share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit
attributable to equity holders of the Company and the weighted
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. In addition
to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings per share, an
underlying earnings per share has also been calculated and is based
on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of intangibles, and
goodwill impairment. It has been calculated to allow shareholders to
gain a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the underlying earnings per share are set out below:
2005 2004
Based on the profit for the year: £m £m

An impairment charge of £2.0m was made against the goodwill relating to Fastech, a UK Labtest business acquired in 2003. This was necessitated
by lower than expected trading results in the period since acquisition. The goodwill impairment was based on a calculation of the recoverable
amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Fastech CGU discounted by a pre-tax rate of 12%. The charge of £2.0m
represents the shortfall of the recoverable amount to the carrying value.

There is a temporary difference of £8.4m which relates to unremitted post acquisition overseas earnings. No deferred tax is provided for on this
amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from or sell

The facility comprises three tranches. Facility A is now a £56m multi-currency term loan with bi-annual amortisations over the remaining four
years. Facility B is a £150m multi-currency revolving credit, available up to 15 December 2010. Facility C is a 364 day, £80m multi-currency
revolving credit facility, with the option to convert this into a one year loan by the end of the 364 day period.
Advances under Facilities A and B bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted) plus a margin of 0.45%. The margin over LIBOR is in the
range of 0.6% to 0.4% in accordance with a leveraged grid. At 31 December 2005, the margin was 0.45 %. Advances under Facility C initially
bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (as adjusted) plus a margin of 0.35%. The margin over LIBOR is in the range 0.5% to 0.3% in accordance
with a leveraged grid. At 31 December 2005, the margin was 0.35%. 
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities, which mature in 2010 amounted to £95.5m (2004: £135.1m) of which £5.8m (2004: £5.0m) has
been utilised for letters of credit and guarantees.

From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The outcome of such
litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings. Based on information
currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have
a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
The provision for claims of £8.0m (2004: £4.8m) represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from
customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs. The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is
uncertain but is likely to be within one year. Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 27.

During the year the company issued 613,339 1p ordinary shares in respect of the share options exercised, for a consideration of £3.8m settled in cash.
None of the zero coupon redeemable preference shares were allotted at 31 December 2005, or 31 December 2004. Ordinary shareholders have a
right to attend and vote at a general meeting and may receive a dividend, if declared. Rights are determined by ordinary resolution of the members.
Preference shareholders have the right to a return of capital on winding up but receive no priority over ordinary shareholders with respect to
repayment of capital paid up and have no further rights to participate in the profits or assets of the company.
At 31 December 2004, the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), held 87,000 ordinary shares of the company at a cost of £0.1m which was
included within retained earnings. In 2005, these shares were utilised on exercise of share options (see note 25). At 31 December 2005, no
shares were held by the ESOT . The ESOT is managed and controlled by an independent offshore trustee. The total ESOT costs charged to the
Group profits for 2005 were £15,000 (2004: £15,000) of which £7,000 (2004: £6,000) was interest expense.

Dividends
The dividends paid of £16.9m (2004: £14.4m) represents £10.8m (2004: £9.1m) being the final dividend in respect of the year ended 31
December 2004, paid on 6 May 2005, at the rate of 7.0p per ordinary share (2004: 5.9p) and £6.1m being the interim dividend in respect of the
year ended 31 December 2005, paid on 15 November 2005, at the rate of 3.9p per ordinary share (2004: 3.4p).

Pension schemes
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom and in Hong Kong. These two are funded schemes, with assets held
in separate trustee administered funds. Other funded defined benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted
for as if they were defined contribution schemes. The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants with effect
from 1 April 2002 and 1 December 2002, respectively.
In 2005, 45 former Avecia employees had the option to transfer past service pension benefits to the UK scheme following an acquisition which
took place on 13 May 2004. Approximate assets and liabilities in respect of the 34 members who have elected to transfer are included in the
IAS 19 figures below.
The Group recognises any actuarial gains and losses, in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.

Annualised expected return on scheme assets 6.8% 6.9% 6.5% 5.8% 6.7% 6.6%
The expected rates of return on scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices. The overall expected rate of return is calculated
by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plan’ s investment portfolio.
Where investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long-term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on such
assets at the balance sheet date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments. This is based on an out-performance assumption
over gilt yields.

Share-based payments
The company has share option schemes, details of which are contained in the Remuneration Report and in note 25.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for share options granted to employees, is measured by reference to 
the fair value of share options granted. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2, the recognition and measurement
principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to share option grants made prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005. 
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes formula, a financial model used to calculate 
the fair value of options. 
During the year ended 31 December 2005, the Group recognised an expense of £1.9m (2004: £1.0m) in respect of outstanding share awards
granted from 7 November 2002 onwards.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of options are set out below:
Date of share option grant 7 April 2003 12 Sept 2003 7 April 2004 14 Sept 2004 7 April 2005 13 Sept 2005
Fair value of option at measurement date (pence) 130.3 139.4 163.9 185.9 240.2 189.8
Share price (pence) 375 456 527 611 790 703
Exercise price (pence) 359 462 523.5 607 778 711
Expected volatility 31.4% 30.1% 28.2% 26.2% 25.4% 24.9%
Dividend yield 1.4% 1.8% 1.7% 1.5% 1.3% 1.6%
Risk free interest rate 4.3% 4.4% 4.8% 4.9% 4.6% 4.2%
Time to maturity (years) 666666
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available
information.
Current share options are granted under a service condition and a non-market performance condition. Such conditions are not taken into
account in the grant date fair value measurement for the services received. There are no market conditions associated with the current share
option grants.

The fair value adjustment to property, plant and equipment relates to the revaluation of the acquired freehold land and buildings.
The profit before tax of Automotive Research Laboratory for the period 1 January 2005 to 11 November 2005 was £1.9m. The contribution
(EBITA) to the Group from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 was £0.6m. After amortisation of intangibles it was £0.5m. 
(b) In addition to the above acquisition there were eleven other acquisitions. The main ones were: Omega Point Laboratories (USA), PARC
T echnical Services (USA), Westport (USA), Lintec (UK) and KPMG certification business in India and Dubai.
The provisional analysis of net assets acquired and the fair value to the Group in respect of the other 11 acquisitions made during the year is set

acquired freehold land and buildings.
These acquisitions contributed earnings before interest and tax to the Group from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2005 of £1.3m. 
After amortisation of intangibles it was £0.9m. 
(c) The Group revenue and operating profit before amortisation would have been approximately £605.7m and £92.0m respectively if all the
acquisitions made in 2005, were assumed to be made on 1 January 2005.

T otal goodwill of £16.8m represents the value of anticipated synergies, future profits and the value of qualified workforce that do not meet the
criteria for recognition as separate intangible assets.
(e) On 22 February 2006, the Group acquired AKZO NOBEL ’ s electromagnetic compatibility business and assets in Japan. The cost of the
acquisition, excluding associated costs, was £9.0m. The value of assets acquired and fair value adjustments have not yet been determined.
25 Share option schemes
The Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997. The maximum number of options that can be granted
under the scheme have been allocated and that scheme has been discontinued. In May 2002, the Intertek Group plc 2002 Share Option Plan
(the 2002 Plan) and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option Plan (the Approved Plan) were established for employees to be granted
at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. These plans have also been discontinued and the last grants under these plans were made 
in September 2005.

2005 IAS 32 disclosures
Exposures to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Group’ s business. Derivative financial instruments are used
to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
(a) Credit risk
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with counterparties who have sound credit ratings. Given their high credit ratings,
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the
carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
(b) Interest rate risk
Hedging
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 30% and 80% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate
basis. Interest rate swaps, denominated in various currencies, have been entered into to achieve an approximate mix of fixed and floating rate
exposure within the Group’ s policy. The swaps mature over the next two years and have fixed swap rates ranging from 2.9% to 3.6%. At 31
December 2005, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of £110.4m.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. 
The net fair value of swaps at 31 December 2005, was £1.7m comprising assets of £1.7m and liabilities of £nil. These amounts were recognised
as fair value derivatives.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. The interest rate profile of the Group’ s
financial assets at 31 December 2005, is set out below:

Notes to the financial statements
continued
(c) Foreign currency risk
A substantial portion of the Group’ s revenue is derived from customers
located outside the United Kingdom. In addition, the net assets of
foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Company’ s
shareholders’ funds. The Group’ s administrative operations are
conducted in several countries outside of the United Kingdom and
operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling. Because
of the high proportion of international activity, the Group’ s income is
exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. T wo types of risk arise as a
result: ‘transaction risk’ , that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will
have a negative effect on the value of the Group’ s commercial cash
flows in various currencies, and ‘translation risk’ , that is, the risk of
adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency
operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign
currency risk.
Recognised assets and liabilities
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that
economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the
income statement. The fair value of forward exchange contracts used
as economic hedges of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
at 31 December 2005, was £nil recognised in fair value derivatives.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries
The Group’ s foreign currency denominated loans are designed as 
a hedge of the Group’ s investment in its respective subsidiaries. 
The carrying amount of the loans at 31 December 2005, was £190.7m.
A foreign exchange loss of £16.1m was recognised in the translation
reserve in equity on translation of the loans to sterling.
(d) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce
the impact of short term fluctuations on the Group’ s earnings. Over
the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange
and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2005, it is estimated that a general increase of one
percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Group’ s profit
before tax by approximately £0.5m. Interest rate swaps have been
included in this calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in the
value of sterling against the dollar (the main currency impacting the
Group) would have decreased the Group’ s profit before tax 
by approximately £0.6m for the year ended 31 December 2005.
The forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
2004 FRS 13 disclosures
(a) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate
and foreign currency risks. Whilst these hedging instruments are subject
to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are offset by the value of the
underlying exposures being hedged. The Group is not a party to any
leverage derivatives and does not hold derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.
The notional amount of derivatives summarised in this note does not
represent amounts exchanged by parties and, thus, is not a measure
of the exposure of the Group through its use of derivatives. The amounts
exchanged are calculated on the basis of the notional amount and 
the other terms of the derivatives, which relate to interest rates or
exchange rates.
Counterparties to financial instruments expose the Group to credit
related losses in the event of non-performance, but the Group does
not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given
their high credit ratings. The Group does not demand collateral when
entering into derivative financial instruments. The credit exposure of
interest rate and foreign currency contracts is represented by the fair
value of contracts with a positive fair value at the end of each period.
The following numerical disclosures relate to the Group’ s financial assets
and liabilities as defined in FRS 13: Derivatives and other financial
instruments. For all the numerical disclosures, short term debtors and
creditors have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
(b) Foreign exchange risk management
A substantial portion of the Group’ s turnover is derived from customers
located outside the United Kingdom. In addition, the net assets of
foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Company’ s
shareholders’ funds. The Group’ s administrative operations are
conducted in several countries outside of the United Kingdom and
operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling. Because
of the high proportion of international activity, the Group’ s income 
is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. T wo types of risk arise as 
a result: ‘transaction risk’, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations
will have a negative effect on the value of the Group’ s commercial
cash flows in various currencies, and ‘translation risk’, that is, the risk
of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency
operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain
firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Some of the
contracts involve the exchange of two foreign currencies, according to
local needs in foreign subsidiaries. The term of the currency derivatives
do not exceed one year.
The table below summarises by major currency the contractual amounts
of the Group’ s forward exchange contracts in sterling. The ‘buy’ amounts
represent the sterling equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign
currency, and the ‘sell’ amounts represent the sterling equivalent of
commitment to sell foreign currencies.

Total 161.3
Borrowings are excluded from the above table as they are used to
finance foreign currency investments.
Net assets are after deducting minority interests.
(d) Currency exposure of the Group’s 
net monetary assets/(liabilities)
These exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the
Group that are not denominated in the operating (or ‘functional’)
currency of the operating units involved. In view of the hedges taken
out by the Group, the currency exposure i.e. those transactional
exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised
in the income statement, of the Group’ s net monetary assets/(liabilities)
are not material.
(e) Interest rate risk management
The Group has a significant amount of borrowings bearing interest 
at variable rates. T o reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations,
the Group enters into interest rate swap agreements.
The interest rate swap agreements convert certain long-term borrowing
at floating rates (based on inter-bank borrowing rates in various
countries) to fixed rates that are lower than those available to the
Group if the fixed rate borrowing were made directly. 
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other
parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference
to an agreed notional principal amount. The interest rate profile of the
Group’ s financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2004,
is set out below:

Financial liabilities
The fair values, maturity, interest rate and exchange rate profiles of
borrowings is shown in the table under the exchange rate sensitivity
section below.
The maturity profile of other financial liabilities of £0.5m are disclosed
in note 15 as non current payables and are due to mature in 1-2 years.
This liability is mainly US dollar denominated and is non-interest bearing.
The fair value approximates its carrying value of £0.5m.
(f) Fair value of financial instruments
The Group’ s on-balance sheet financial instruments, with the exception
of borrowings, are generally short-term in nature. Accordingly, the fair
value of such instruments approximates their carrying value. The fair
value of variable rate borrowings approximates carrying value because
such loans re-price at market rate periodically. The fair value and
carrying value of long-term borrowings, including the current portion
was £164.9m.

with two trading companies. The agreements provided for Caleb Brett
India to manage the storage and release of vegetable oil from
warehouses in India. As a result of the actions of a former rogue
employee of Caleb Brett India, various quantities of oil were released
without authorisation, leading to the commencement of recovery
actions against Caleb Brett in Singapore and London. The Singapore
proceedings were resolved by an out of court settlement with the
involvement of insurers. However, the London proceedings, which
comprise subrogated claims by Marine Cargo Underwriters against
Intertek T esting Services (ITS) Canada Ltd and Caleb Brett India Pvt Ltd,
claiming reimbursement of US$6.9m, have not resulted in a settlement
and a trial is scheduled to commence on 13 March 2006. Caleb Brett
believes that it had adequate insurance in place to cover the CMA
work and has a strong legal defence against these claims. 
b) Between 1992 and 2001, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority
(PREPA) contracted Caleb Brett to perform independent testing services.
In August 2002, PREPA filed a lawsuit against Caleb Brett in the federal
district court of Puerto Rico. PREPA is seeking unspecified damages,
alleging that Caleb Brett falsified test results and engaged in a conspiracy
with fuel suppliers to provide off-specification fuel for on-specification
prices during the 1992-2000 period. 
Caleb Brett has filed a motion to dismiss PREPA’ s complaint, on the
grounds that the claims are time barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. Caleb Brett believes that it has substantial defences to the
plaintiff’ s claims and continues to defend itself vigorously. At this point
in the litigation however , it is impossible to predict the outcome with any
degree of certainty. A process of fact and expert discovery began in
earnest in the second half of 2005. The court has set a deadline of 30
June 2006, for the conclusion of this discovery . No trial date has been set.
In May 2004, Caleb Brett filed a petition in T exas state court against
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’ s of London and other underwriters
seeking a declaration that certain policies issued by the Underwriters
are in full force and effect, and that the insurers subscribing thereto
must indemnify and defend Caleb Brett in the case of PREPA v Caleb
Brett USA Inc in federal court in Puerto Rico. At this time, only limited
discovery has taken place and it is impossible to predict the outcome
with any degree of certainty.
(h) Counterparty risk
All the foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are governed
by ISDA (International Swap Dealers Association Inc) agreements with
the counterparties. Accordingly , the counterparty risk is reduced from
the nominal to the fair value of the derivatives. Therefore, the Group’ s
counterparty exposure under foreign exchange contracts was £nil and
interest rate swaps was £nil. 
(i) Unrecognised gains and losses
There are no material unrecognised gains or losses arising from the use
of financial assets and financial liabilities as hedges.

Litigation
From time to time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits
incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for
damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection
and testing and disputes with former employees. The Group is not
currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation
incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of the litigation to which Intertek Group companies 
are party cannot be readily foreseen. Based on information currently
available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an
unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation, is unlikely to have
a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in
the foreseeable future.
The Group holds a professional indemnity insurance policy that
provides coverage for certain claims from customers. The Directors
consider this policy adequate for normal commercial purposes.
The majority of claims made against Intertek’ s subsidiary companies
fall within the Caleb Brett division. While commercial disputes are
often settled, occasionally Caleb Brett will enter into a trial process.

Identity of related parties
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries (see
note 31), associates (see note 31) and with its Board of Directors 
(see the Remuneration Report).
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been
eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Transactions with key management personnel
Until his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 1 March 2005,
WG Hauser, a Non-Executive Director of Intertek Group plc had 
a consultancy agreement to assist the Group in its expansion for
which he received a fee of £1,000 per working day plus an annual
bonus of up to 25% of the consultancy fees payable on the satisfactory
completion of the tasks assigned to him. T otal consultancy fees in
2005 were £19,700 (2004: £36,700).
In addition to their salaries, the Group also provides non-cash benefits
to Directors and contributes to post-employment benefit schemes 
on their behalf. Directors also participate in the Group’ s share option
programme (see note 25). The share based payments are valued at their
fair value at the date of grant. Full details of Directors’ compensation,
including post-employment benefits is given in the Remuneration Report.
The key management personnel compensations are as follows:

Details of key managements’ interests in the Company’ s shares and
share options are set out in the Remuneration Report.
During 2005 and 2004, no member of the Board of Directors had a
personal interest in any business transactions of the Group.
29 Explanation of transition to IFRSs as adopted by EU
As stated in note 1, these are the Group’ s first consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRSs. The comparative
information for the year ended 31 December 2004, previously prepared
under UK GAAP , has been restated under Adopted IFRSs. An explanation
of how the transition from previous GAAP to Adopted IFRSs has
affected the Group’ s financial performance is shown in the table below.

* As permitted, does not include IAS 32 and IAS 39 adjustments. 
a) Under UK GAAP , there was a charge to profit in respect of
amortisation of goodwill. Under Adopted IFRSs, there is no such
charge. However, under Adopted IFRSs there is an annual review
required of goodwill which could result in an impairment charge. 
b) Adopted IFRSs requires qualifying intangibles, previously included
within goodwill under UK GAAP , to be separately identified and
amortised over their useful economic lives. 
c) Adopted IFRSs requires a charge to be made for the fair value of
options granted to employees.
d) Under Adopted IFRSs, the movement in fair values of financial
derivatives in respect of an ineffective hedge is taken to the income
statement.
e) Under UK GAAP , minority interest was deducted in arriving at profit
for the period. Under Adopted IFRSs, the minority interest is not
deducted but is disclosed by way of a note. 
Impact on the balance sheet
A reconciliation between UK GAAP and Adopted IFRSs balance sheets
at 1 January 2004 and at 31 December 2004, is set out on page 70,
together with an explanation of the Adopted IFRSs adjustments.
Impact on the cash flow statement
The move from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRSs does not change any of
the cash flows of the Group. The Adopted IFRSs cash flow format is
similar to UK GAAP but presents various cash flows in different
categories and in a different order from UK GAAP .

Notes to the IFRSs adjustments
a. Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP since 1 January 2004, (the IFRSs transitional date) is reversed, as under Adopted IFRSs goodwill is not amortised. Adopted IFRSs requires 
a review for impairment of goodwill. This review did not result in any impairment loss in the periods covered by the tables above. 
In addition, specific intangible assets, previously included within goodwill under UK GAAP , have been separately identified and shown as ‘Other intangibles’.
b. The deferred tax asset netted off against the pension liabilities under UK GAAP , is now shown separately under Adopted IFRSs. In addition the deferred tax asset includes tax on the share
option charge.
c. Under Adopted IFRSs, a dividend accrual is only made when the dividend is declared payable. Under UK GAAP dividends had been accrued although they had not been declared.
d. Under Adopted IFRSs, foreign exchange translation differences, previously included in retained earnings under UK GAAP , are shown in a separate translation reserve within ‘Other reserves’.
e. The adjustment to retained earnings represents the sum of the adjustments explained in the notes (a) to (d) above and are detailed in the next table:

Notes to the financial statements
continued
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and under the
historical accounting rules. The following principal accounting policies
have been applied consistently throughout the year and preceding
year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’ s financial statements. 
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is
exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from
the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds
that it is included in the consolidated accounts which it has prepared. 
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling
at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date or at 
the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward
exchange contract. All foreign exchange differences are taken 
to the income statement. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the
balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. Deferred
tax assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the
extent that it is more likely than not there will be suitable taxable
profits to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Dividends 
Dividends from subsidiary undertakings are accounted for when
declared payable. Dividends payable are recognised when paid 
or proposed.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions 
for impairment.
33 Employees
The Company does not employ any staff.
Details of the remuneration of the Directors are set out in 
the Remuneration Report.

32 Accounting policies – Company 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently 
in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the Company's financial statements, except as noted below. In these
financial statements the following new standards have been adopted
for the first time:
• FRS 21: Events after the balance sheet date;
• The presentation requirements of FRS 25: Financial instruments:
presentation and disclosure; and
• FRS 28: Corresponding amounts.
The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below
together with an indication of the effects of their adoption. FRS 28:
Corresponding amounts has had no material effect as it imposes the
same requirements for comparatives as hitherto required by the
Companies Act 1985.
The corresponding amounts in these financial statements are restated
in accordance with the new policies.
In 2005, the Company adopted FRS 21: Events after the balance
sheet date which requires recognition of dividends as a liability in the
period in which they are paid or proposed. A prior year adjustment has
been made not to recognise the final dividend previously recognised
at 31 December 2004, in the financial statements for that year.

* During the year the Company adopted FRS 21: Events after the balance sheet date which
superseded SSAP 17. Under the new standard, final dividends payable are recognised only
in the period in which they are approved in the Annual General Meeting and therefore
become a liability and interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are
paid, whereas under SSAP17 dividends were accrued for when proposed. This has resulted
in an increase of £10.8m in the retained profit for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Details of share capital are set out in note 18 and details of share
options are set out in note 25 to the Group financial statements.
A profit and loss account for Intertek Group plc has not been
presented as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act
1985. The profit for the financial year, before dividends of £16.9m,
was £12.5m which was mainly in respect of dividends received 
from subsidiaries.
40 Related party transactions
Details of related party transactions are given in note 28 of the Group
financial statements.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 8: Related Party Disclosures, 
the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from disclosing
transactions with other group companies.
41 Contingent liabilities
The Company is a member of a group of UK companies that are part
of a composite banking cross guarantee arrangement. This is a joint
and several guarantee given by all members of the Intertek UK cash
pool guaranteeing the total gross liability position of the pool which
was £19.3m at 31 December 2005 (2004: £13.9m).
From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company may
give guarantees in respect of certain liabilities of subsidiary companies.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Intertek Group plc 
We have audited the Group and parent Company financial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of Intertek Group plc for the year ended 
31 December 2005 which comprise the Consolidated income
statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets, the
Consolidated statement of cash flows, the Consolidated statement of
recognised income and expense and the related notes. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’ s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’ s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’ s
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the Company and the Company’ s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company financial
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page 25. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and whether, in addition, the Group financial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the Company’ s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’ s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the Group’ s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any
other information. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant
to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments
made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group’ s and Company’ s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state 
of the Group’ s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit 
for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; 
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of
the state of the parent Company’ s affairs as at 31 December 2005;
and
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Next Fifteen continues to look at the most  
effective way to communicate with its  
shareholders and other stakeholders. Following 
positive feedback, we have once again created 
an enhanced online annual report that can be 
found on our website, www.nextfifteen.com and 
would urge you to take a look at the case studies 
showing some of the work we do for our clients.
It would be great to hear feedback from shareholders 
on the Annual Report or any other aspect of the  
business. We would be happy to answer questions 
from shareholders at any time rather than waiting  
for the Annual General Meeting in January.
We look forward to hearing from you.

possibility of further acquisitions where the strategic fi t and value 
are compelling.

over 300 provides some of the highest quality PR,

in the marketplace. 
United Kingdom
The United Kingdom remains an important market 
for the Group with more than 200 employees in 
fi ve brands, providing PR, research and digital 
communications to some of the world’s largest

(‘Next Fifteen’ or ‘the Group’), the global public 
relations consultancy group, is pleased to report its 
results for the year to 31 July 2010. The Group has 
emerged from the global recession to produce 
record results and continues to trade well despite 
ongoing uncertainties in the western economies. 
The Group has reported revenues up 10.6% to 
£72.3m (2009: £65.4m). Profi tability has recovered 
well, with profi t before tax up 68% to £5.3m 
(2009: £3.2m), while adjusted profi t was up 26% 
to £6.6m (2009: £5.2m) (see note 5). Basic earnings 
per share rose 84% to 6.75p (2009: 3.67p), with 
adjusted basic earnings per share up 30% at 8.45p 
(2009: 6.48p) (see note 10). The Group continues to 
have a strong balance sheet, ending the year with 
net debt of £0.9m (2009: net cash of £1.8m) (see note 
1 9), achieved after making £5.1m of acquisition-
related payments. In view of these results and the 
current trading, the Board has proposed a fi nal 
dividend of 1.375p per share, which sees dividends 
increase 9% to 1.85p for the year (2009: 1.70p). 
The Group has recently acquired an 85% stake in 
San Francisco-based The Blueshirt Group, LLC, 
an investor relations company that services 
the technology market (see note 29). 
The Blueshirt acquisition will give opportunities 
for cross referrals between the Group’s existing US 
businesses, whilst also opening up a revenue 
stream in a new sector of communications.
Corporate activity
At the start of the fi nancial year, the Group 
announced the acquisition of New York-based 
consumer agency M Booth & Associates, Inc. This 
was followed in October 2009 by the acquisition of 
the Asian PR assets of AIM-listed Upstream Marketing 
and Communications, Inc, which expands the 
Group’s operations in Asia Pacifi c. Upstream has 
been integrated into Bite’s business, to complement 
its existing US and European operations. During the 
year the Group purchased a further 36% stake in 
463 Communications, LLC, a US-based policy 
communication consultancy, increasing its holding 
to 76%. Just after the year end, the Group launched 
Beyond, a digital agency which has offi  ces in 
London, New York and San Francisco. This was 
created by combining the Group’s existing Context 
Analytics business and Type 3 Limited, a digital 
agency acquired in August 2010. This new venture 
has already secured clients that include Google, 
Cisco, Hilton Hotels and Virgin America. Lastly, the 
Group recently acquired OneXeno Limited, a digital 
marketing agency in Hong Kong, which has been 
integrated with Bite’s operations in that region.

The US and Canada PR business was strengthened 
by the addition of M Booth and now delivers around 
half the revenue for the Group and more than half its 
profi ts. The UK PR segment remains the second 
biggest despite a year-on-year decline, but grew 
7 .5% in the second half, showing good momentum. 
Europe and Africa had stable revenue aided by 
a stronger euro, and it was pleasing to see an 
improvement in the operating margin. The Asia 
Pacifi c segment showed 30% revenue growth 
aided by stronger currency and the acquisition of 
Upstream, which added £2m of revenue, but as a 
break-even business it had the eff ect of reducing 
segment margins. The Upstream business is now in 
profi t, which will help segment margins improve 
in the future. The other segments are research 
and digital consultancy, where good progress 
is being made.
Client-base continues to improve
The Group has an impressive client-base that 
includes IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Facebook, HP , AMD, 
Unilever and Coca-Cola. This has been further 
improved by the addition of TiVo, Allied Bakeries, 
Hershey’s, Alibaba, Bloom Energy, Trend Micro and 
Schneider Electric. The top ten clients accounted for 
32% of revenues at the year end: this compares to 
36% in 2009. Unlike some other marketing services 
groups, Next Fifteen has no direct exposure to 
government spending and will therefore be largely 
unaff ected as western governments cut back on 
expenditure in this area.
Strategy
The Group continues to explore organic growth 
opportunities supported by selective acquisitions 
of specialist agencies in growth sectors, hence the 
acquisitions of M Booth, Upstream, OneXeno, Type 3 
and Blueshirt mentioned above. The creation of 
digital agency Beyond, which increases the Group’s 
capabilities in social media and related digital 
services, is further evidence that the Group 
continues to focus on long-term growth. 
With strong cash-generation from operations and 
existing acquisition facilities, the Group remains 
well placed to make additional targeted acquisitions 
of a size that would maintain a strong balance sheet, 
an approach that the Board continues to feel is 
prudent given the current economic climate.
Prospects
The Group has recovered well from the economic 
slowdown and has continued to invest in its future, 
while maintaining one of the most conservative 
balance sheets in the UK marketing services sector. 
It remains highly ambitious and believes it has 
signifi cant opportunities for growth over the 
medium term, through both organic growth and 
selective acquisitions. The Group is experiencing an 
improvement in trading conditions, particularly in 
North America and Asia but will continue to manage 
the business in a way that refl ects the general 
uncertainty that surrounds the pace of economic 
recovery. That said, in the fi rst two months of the 
current fi nancial year, the Group has seen good 
momentum and the Board remains optimistic 
about prospects for the year.

for doing great work. I also referenced the growing 
role digital communications was playing in the 
marketing world. In the last 1 2 months, digital 
has become the focus of all forms of marketing 
as companies grapple with the shift away from 
traditional media towards social networks, social 
media and the growing consumption of web-based 
content from both traditional and completely new 
sources. This is a shift that creates a great opportunity 
for an agency group like ours. It is forcing brands 
to completely rethink the way they tackle their 
marketing. In the past, brands have ‘controlled’ their 
messaging and brand positioning through a series 
of controlled events, such as placed advertising, 
press conferences and product placement. Today, 
consumers are starting their own conversations 
about products and brands on places such as 
Facebook or on vertical social networks through 
Ning or Grouply. As a result, brands now have 
to fi gure out how to shape a conversation they 
didn’t start and can’t control. These are, in short, 
exciting times.
Digital from every angle
Against this backdrop of change, the agency world 
has had to cope with global economic uncertainty, 
making the bets we have had to take feel all the 
more challenging. I’m pleased to report that as a 
Group our results show that we are already seeing 
returns on the investments made in digital, and I am 
excited to see the doors that digital is starting to 
open for our business. We are approaching digital 
from every angle. We are embedding digital thinking 
and products into our traditional services but we 
have also created a specialist digital agency to off er 
advanced digital services to all the Group’s clients. 
This new agency is called, appropriately, Beyond, and 
it has offi  ces in London, San Francisco and New York. 
It brings together traditional web developers, 
graphic designers, analysts, search specialists and 
PR consultants in the creation of a set of services that 
are closer to digital advertising than PR in the way 
they look, but fully embrace the infl uence model at 
the core of public relations. This may be why it has 
already secured clients that include Cisco, Virgin 
America, Google and Hilton Hotels.
More than just technology
When the dot com bubble burst in 2001, we were 
a technology specialist group. Today, we derive a 
quarter of our revenues from clients that include 
Unilever, Boots, Hershey's and, most recently, Dyson 
(and no, I’m not related). In the next few years, we will 
look to invest in the corporate PR and healthcare 
arena, further diversifying our client-base, while still 
remaining highly specialised in the services we off er 
these customers. These moves, coupled with the 
continued expansion of the technology industry, 
ensure that there is no reason why our business 
should stop expanding.

While our industry has been tackling digital, it can’t 
ignore the importance of emerging markets and
the desire of large companies to manage their 
communications globally. These shifts are 
understandable. First, the importance of markets 
such as China and India cannot be overstated right 
now. Second, the shift towards the internet being 
the new platform for communications is breaking 
down traditional geographic borders, particularly in 
developed countries. This is why we have continued 
to invest in emerging markets with the acquisitions 
of Upstream Asia that extends our Bite business 
into the Asia Pacifi c region, and of OneXeno, which 
adds to our ability to provide digital services in 
those markets.
More growth to come
While there is still some uncertainty around the 
global economy, I am confi dent that our business 
will deliver robust growth in the coming year. 
The investments of the last few years are already 
providing revenue growth and that will only 
continue, which should again lead to record results 
in the year to 31 July 201 1. To be in this position is 
testament to the quality of the businesses that make 
up the Group and the decisions they’ve made. 
I’m pleased to say that all of our businesses are set 
to expand, which should only be good news for 
our shareholders. 
To end this review, I would like to thank all the 
people who make up Next Fifteen for their eff orts 
in the last year to deliver the strong recovery we 
achieved. I would also like to thank you as 
shareholders for your continued support. 
We have ambitious plans for the Group which 
we hope you will all be a part of.

Introduction
The US market remains the most important for the 
Group, generating 52% of Group revenue in the 
year ended 31 July 2010. The year started with Bite 
having to adjust to the loss of its biggest client, 
Sun Microsystems, following Sun's takeover by 
Oracle. Text 100 also started the year on the back 
foot with the focus rightly on client retention and 
cost containment. Despite these challenges both 
businesses responded extremely positively, with 
Bite winning the HP corporate account (focusing 
on innovation and sustainability) and Text 100 
winning Schneider Electric and a number of project 
assignments from existing large clients such as IBM, 
Lenovo and Cisco. OutCast had the most successful 
year, developing new business and cultivating 
stronger relationships with existing clients such 
as AdMob, Intuit/T urbo T ax and Yahoo!, which 
signifi cantly increased their budgets helping to drive 
1 5% revenue growth for OutCast despite a faltering 
recovery in the US economy.

In August 2009, the Group welcomed New York- 
based consumer agency M Booth & Associates to 
its US interests, and it made a very successful start 
to life within the Next Fifteen family. During the year 
the Group also increased its investment in policy 
communications company 463 Communications 
to 76%. In August 2010, Beyond was formed by 
bringing together the existing Context Analytics 
business and combining it with the recently acquired 
Type 3, to create a specialist digital consultancy with 
a base in San Francisco and an offi  ce in New York. 
In November 2010, the Group acquired 85% of The 
Blueshirt Group, LLC, a technology-focused fi nancial 
communications company based in San Francisco 
and New York. These investments demonstrate the 
Group’s commitment to and confi dence in the US 
market. The Group now has 1 5 offi  ces in the US and 
Canada region and employs over 300 members 
of staff .
Client wins and extended relationships
In tough economic times the focus is rightly on 
keeping existing clients happy. However, to grow 
their business the Next Fifteen brands were also 
busy pitching and winning some exciting new 
clients. M Booth added Schwan’s, Pirate’s Booty, 
Hershey’s and Evenfl o, whilst also extending its 
relationship with American Express. OutCast won 
new clients including Acadia, Bloom Energy, 
kaChing, Netfl ix and VEVO and extended existing 
relationships with Autodesk, salesforce.com and 
EMC. Bite’s year was dominated by bedding in the 
new global HP Corporate account but it also won 
new retainer accounts from EZShield, Mocana, 
Parallels and TiVo. In addition to Schneider Electric, 
Text 100’s other new clients included 
Communispace, Kroll Ontrack and NVIDIA.

Social media and digital communications
The biggest trend in the last year has been the 
widespread acceptance of digital and social 
media as a phenomenon that has changed the 
communication landscape forever. Overall, 
clients’ understanding of social media and digital 
communications has moved from a tactical 
consideration to a strategic imperative that 
underpins most, if not all, communications 
programmes. Whether it is corporate and senior 
executive blogs, Facebook and T witter management, 
building online communities, iPad and iPhone 
application launches or search-engine optimisation, 
clients are looking for better ways to engage with 
their target audiences and measure the return on 
investment from PR that is searchable and sociable. 
As summed up by an OutCast senior executive, 
“We live and breathe social media everyday – from 
our work with Facebook, to building social media 
communities for Netfl ix, to pioneering new 
measurement tools. We are all Social OutCasts!”
Working together 
The Next Fifteen brands in the region have had a 
successful year working together. M Booth is working 
with Bite to support AMD in its VISION technology 
work. Beyond has supported M Booth in its 
work with American Express and Evenfl o. 
463 Communications and Bite have worked 
together on Verisign’s '25 years of .com' campaign 
and 463 Communications also supported Text 100 in 
Schneider Electric’s 'One Government' programme 
aimed at driving energy effi  ciency awareness 
among key stakeholders in Washington, DC. On a 
broader front, OutCast used Text 100 in the 
international launch of the Amazon Kindle.
Recognition
Doing great work is important for clients and 
rewarding when recognised by others. Text 100 was 
honoured for corporate media relations work for 
‘Recasting IBM’s Image for a Smarter Planet’ and for 
business-to-business marketing with Xerox. Bite won 
SABRE’s Hardware Technology Campaign of the Year 
for an AMD campaign on battery life.
People
As the new fi nancial year started there were two 
signifi cant changes to the senior management in 
the US. Firstly, The Outcast Agency welcomed Alex 
Constantinople who joined as a partner in the role 
of Chief Operating Offi  cer from Conde Nast’s WIRED 
Magazine, but that news was tempered by the 
decision of co-founder Margit Wennmachers to 
leave the agency for a career in venture capital with 
client Andreessen Horowitz. Over at Bite the search 
for a new leader of the US business was concluded 
with the appointment of Michelle Herman, who 
brings a wealth of experience from her roles both 
in-house and within the agency world, most 
recently at Waggener Edstrom.
The year ahead
With the recent acquisition of The Blueshirt Group, 
LLC, Next Fifteen has a strong business in the 
fi nancial PR fi eld and the opportunity to off er a 
broader portfolio of skills to its clients in the US. 
As calendar year 2010 unfolded, momentum 
was building and our expectation is that 
notwithstanding the economic risks the US 
businesses should see a progressive year with 
organic growth returning in the fi rst half of the 
current fi nancial year to add to the boost provided 
by the acquisitions of Blueshirt and Type 3.

The UK is the second most important revenue 
market for the Group, representing over 20% of total 
revenue. It is also the place where the Group was 
founded back in 1 981, and although Tim Dyson, the 
Group CEO, has been based in the US for the last 
1 5 years, most of the remaining central functions are 
in London. The UK had a tough calendar year 2009, 
which resulted in revenue for the year to 31 July 2010 
being down 9.8%. There was a focus on cost 
reduction so that the businesses can benefi t faster 
from operational gearing as revenue growth returns.
Client wins
Despite the economic climate and the clear need to 
deliver outstanding work to existing clients, there 
was still a desire to pitch and win new clients. 
This resulted in new business from MTV, Psion, 
Kroll Ontrack, SafeNet, HP , Harman International 
and Allied Bakeries.
Research
Research agency Redshift has a diff erent business 
model, being almost exclusively reliant on ad hoc 
projects. Therefore the success of this business 
depends on its ability to win, deliver and secure 
repeat commissions from clients. Working with 
other parts of the Group was a key objective when 
Redshift was formed, and this has been extended 
of late through its work with M Booth in New York. 
Redshift now generates 30% of its revenue from 
international clients and the growth and 
eff ectiveness of its online consumer panel has 
been critical to this international expansion. 
Increased momentum in social media 
With client budgets under pressure, greater 
emphasis was placed on return on investment and 
metrics to prove wise spending. This has coincided 
with the industry reaching tipping-point in social 
media and digital communications, which are now 
embedded in over 90% of client PR programmes. 
The mass penetration of the internet means 
that consumers can easily access opinion on 
organisations and their products. Opinion became 
a critical factor in any purchase decision, and PR 
is ideally placed to infl uence opinion.

to marketing disciplines to one of truly integrated 
campaigns whereby traditional media, infl uencer 
engagement and social media work to complement 
the complete marketing mix. Bite has embraced this 
change with its 'Point of View' methodology, which 
is a specialist-driven approach encompassing digital 
strategy and execution, sales and marketing 
programmes, design, and written and visual content 
creation. The client’s story is clearly defi ned in terms 
of the target community and the conversations they 
are having, with the aim of presenting relevant and 
compelling content across multiple channels.
London hub
As well as being an important market in its own 
right, London acts as lead offi  ce for a number of 
pan-European and global programmes. Text 100 
delivers over 60% of its UK client campaigns across 
multiple markets; these campaigns including IBM, 
SanDisk and AMD, where it works alongside Bite – 
which itself runs signifi cant European campaigns 
for new clients HP and Harman International 
from London.
Recognition
The UK businesses have been through a diffi  cult year 
but they all recognise the continued need to put HR 
at the heart of their business. T alented people attract 
the best clients and that combination has again 
resulted in some great client work for brands such
as NXP Semiconductors, Guinness World Records 
and Channel 4, which was shortlisted for awards. 
Text 100, Lexis and Bite all featured in The Sunday 
Times 'Best Small Company to work for' list in the UK, s
with Bite coming 7th.
The year ahead
The year ended 31 July 2010 has been diffi  cult but 
the new fi nancial year started with momentum. 
The UK businesses of Next Fifteen have weathered 
the downturn and taken the right action, and are 
well positioned to benefi t from the improving 
outlook, albeit with an increase in the level of project 
work rather than retainers. Next Fifteen invested in 
the UK market with the recent Glasshouse 
Partnership acquisition for Lexis and the creation 
of Beyond, following the acquisition of Type 3, and 
the Group is confi dent that good progress will be 
achieved in the UK during the current fi nancial year.

Introduction
The Europe and Africa region represented 1 3.5% 
of Group revenue in the year ended 31 July 2010. 
Parts of the region were aff ected in a similar way to 
the United Kingdom in terms of client budget cuts in 
the calendar year 2009 although the overall impact 
was mitigated by pleasing performances from Paris, 
Madrid, Milan and Munich. For Text 100, the region 
was restructured into two regions and resulted in 
senior staff  being closer to the business and its key 
clients. The Amsterdam offi  ce is now managed as
 a branch offi  ce of Paris and the three Nordic offi  ces 
of Text 100 are now managed under a unifi ed 
leadership structure. The cost of making these 
changes had an impact on margins but has resulted 
in a stronger, growth-oriented culture and will 
benefi t the business in the coming year.
Clients become more global
The Group has a strong balance between local, 
regional and global client wins within the region. 
Local clients include Litex in Norway and LG in Italy. 
New regional clients included MTV, Kroll Ontrack and 
SafeNet. New international client relationships in the 
region include Schneider Electric, a signifi cant US 
client expanding into the Nordics. The Johannesburg 
offi  ce started to work with Cisco; four years after Text 
100 won the account in North America. Cisco is its 
second-largest global account. Europe is also a vital 
region for Bite’s global clients HP and AMD.
Clients become more social
Europe is no diff erent to the rest of the world in 
the extent to which clients are embracing the need 
to adopt social media practices. Digital activity is 
becoming integrated into daily client programmes 
rather than being just one-off  creative executions. 
Bite gained industry recognition for a campaign it 
ran for Nuance and Text 100 expanded its social 
media practice and now has a team of six specialists 
across the region.
Ambitions grow in Europe
Europe is a key region, and the Group is investing 
through the Bite brand where the region has an 
important role to play in Bite’s global network and its 
consistent approach to client experience. Bite has a 
short-term plan to build a strong European off er 
based on offi  ces in UK, France, Germany and 
Sweden. The Swedish offi  ce is long established and, 
under new leadership, is providing strategic counsel 
to leading brands such as Warner, Xerox, Iomega and 
Checkpoint. The French business has been launched 
as Soundbite Communications and already has HP 
and Parallels as founding clients. The next piece of 
the European jigsaw is Germany, where a Bite offi  ce 
presence is anticipated in 201 1, to complement the 
established Text 100 offi  ce.
The year ahead
The Group has set modest growth expectations 
for the region. There is recovery underway but it 
remains fragile and there is anxiety as to how the 
austerity measures imposed by many European

Asia Pacifi c represents one of our biggest 
opportunities but also one of our principal 
management challenges because of the geographic 
and cultural diversity of the region. Asia Pacifi c 
increased its share of Group revenue from 1 2% in 
the year ended 31 July 2009 to 14% in the year 
ended 31 July 2010, with a reported growth rate of 
30%. This growth came largely from the acquisition 
of Upstream Asia in late October 2009 (see note 26), 
which has been integrated into Bite, but also from 
strong recovery in Australia, Singapore and Malaysia. 
Next Fifteen now has 16 offi  ces spread from India in 
the west to China in the north and Australia in the 
south, plus a further three licensed partners, and has 
a medium-term goal to increase the region’s share 
of Group revenue to 20%, which will include ASEAN 
markets such as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam 
as they open up.
Client activity
Both Text 100 and Bite have an established 
technology strength in the region. For example Text 
100 helped launch the FLIP pocket video camera for 
Cisco in Australia and Singapore, and in India helped 
to promote a successful visit from Yahoo!’s Carol 
Bartz. On the more traditional technology front, IBM’s 
SmarterPlanet has been a key thought leadership 
focus in the region and Bite has been working to 
promote Skype for business, mobile and video 
as well as CSR activities that took Skype into 
the education and healthcare sectors. However, both 
brands extend beyond technology with clients in 
the automotive, consumer, food, healthcare, travel 
and fi nancial sectors, which provides a greater scope 
for revenue growth.
Social media and digital communications
The markets in the region are progressing at diff erent 
speeds in the integration of social media into PR 
campaigns, but growth will continue in social 
media, networking and infl uencer campaigns as 
the blurring of lines between advertising, digital 
and PR continues. Our businesses ensure that their 
consultants are trained to deliver integrated digital 
programmes. Bite has also seen demand for 
dedicated social media and digital support, and 
so recently acquired digital marketing boutique 
OneXeno to help deliver this capability.
The year ahead
Next Fifteen continues to believe in the long-term 
growth prospects in China and the Asia Pacifi c 
region. China is a market in which organic growth 
has been diffi  cult to achieve at a suffi  cient rate to 
improve market share, so further acquisition activity 
in this country is under review. For the region as a 
whole, strong organic revenue growth is expected 
in the current year as the service capability and 
geographic spread continue to open up new 
growth opportunities.

The year to 31 July 2010, was a year which started in 
the wake of the world fi nancial crisis but ended with 
an increasing momentum, as the Group saw more 
encouraging signs of optimism from some of its 
clients. Full-year comparisons do not reveal the full 
story as the Group experienced little impact from 
the fi nancial crisis until January 2009, the sixth month 
of the comparative period. Revenue grew by 10.6% 
to £72.3m (2009: £65.4m) but when adjusting for 
the acquisitions of M Booth and Upstream Asia and 
currency movements, underlying activity was down 
5.5%. This reduced underlying activity came in the 
fi rst half of the year and growth returned in the 
second half, by 3.6%. There are a number of 
accounting adjustments that distort the underlying 
performance of the Group and in this review the 
adjusted profi t and earnings numbers have been 
used. Adjusted profi t before income tax increased 
by 26%, to £6.6m (2009: £5.2m) (see note 5), and the 
adjusted EPS rose by 30%, to 8.45p (2009: 6.48p) 
(see note 10). The Group EBITDA
1
A A was £8.4m 
(2009: £5.5m) and it generated £5.1m from operating 
activities (after tax) (2009: £4.8m). However, £5.1m 
expended on acquisition-related payments resulted 
in a Group net debt position of £0.9m compared to 
a positive net funds position of £1.8m in 2009
2
. 
This level of debt represents gearing of only 3% 
and still leaves the Group with an extremely strong 
base from which to deliver further growth.
Geographic and client analysis
The Group has 48 offi  ces in 1 9 countries and a 
further four licensed partners.
During the last year the proportion of the Group’s 
revenue outside the UK was 79%. US and Canada 
remained the largest geographic region, accounting 
for almost 52% of revenue, including digital and 
research. With the UK share of revenue being 21%, 
the Group generated around 73% of its revenue in 
the two strongest markets for public relations and 
marketing services. The US and Canada PR region 
grew by 1 9% to £36.3m (2009: £30.5m), following the 
acquisition of M Booth, which added £7 .3m. The UK 
PR revenue declined almost 10% on last year but 
when taking the second half over the fi rst half, the 
UK PR business grew by 7 .5%, showing that the 
region is clearly in recovery in calendar year 2010. 
In Europe and Africa, the businesses experienced a 
downturn in activity in the year but the stronger 
euro reduced the reported fall in revenue to only 
0.5% at £9.7m (2009: £9.8m). The Asia Pacifi c region 
grew by 30%, to £10.2m (2009: £7 .8m), thanks to the 
acquisition of Upstream Asia which added £2m, 
stronger currency translation and good results 
posted by our operations in Australia, Malaysia 
and Singapore.
It is also pleasing to note that the concentration of 
the Group’s key clients reduced further. The top ten 
clients now represent approximately 32% of the 
revenue of the business (2009: 36%), with no single 
client accounting for more than 6% of the total. 
The Group still has an impressive list of global blue 
chip clients with all of the top ten clients generating 
annual fees in excess of £1.3m.
The number of clients rose by 1 7% following the 
acquisitions referenced above but there was a more 
signifi cant 34% rise in the number of project clients.
The average client size fell by 6% to £96,000 because 
of the increased number of projects but it was 
pleasing to see a 25% increase in the number of 
clients that we represent in more than one country. 
These international clients represent 22% of total 
clients but more signifi cantly they are almost three 
times the size of the average client, so provide a 
better opportunity for revenue growth.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group has established treasury policies and 
procedures which monitor exposure to the US dollar 
and euro, which are the two main operating 
currencies other than sterling. Following the world 
fi nancial crisis and the sharp movement in currency 
rates, the Group reassessed its policy on placing 
forward cover. The result is that cover periods have 
shortened and cover is now based on the expected 
surplus cash receipts returned to the UK within the 
current fi nancial year only. As a result of this policy 
change there should be much reduced volatility in

The adjusted profi t before tax margin of the Group 
increased to 9.1% from 8.0% last year, following the 
recovery and increasing momentum in the second 
half of the fi nancial year. Excluding head offi  ce costs, 
the adjusted operating profi t margin was 1 5.4%, 
compared to 16.7% last year. The Group’s businesses 
have worked very hard in diffi  cult economic 
circumstances to remain close to the target 
minimum margin threshold of 16%, before head 
offi  ce costs. The US and UK are operating above 
this level, at 20.1% and 16.5% respectively, but there 
is still much to achieve in some of the smaller and 
less sophisticated markets in the Asia Pacifi c region 
and in the small non-PR businesses. The staff  cost 
to revenue ratio is critical to managing margin 
performance but this increased to 68.8% (2009: 
67 .0%), which is 3.8% higher than our medium-term 
target of 65%. The main reasons for the increase in 
the year are increased bonus payments in some 
businesses, higher share scheme charges for the 
modifi ed Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), higher 
staff  cost ratios in the acquired Upstream Asia 
business and salary pressures in some markets 
running ahead of client budgets.
Cash fl ow
The net cash generated from operations (before 
tax payments) was strong once again at £6.6m 
(2009: £6.3m), which was 101% of operating profi t. 
The main investment activities in the year requiring a 
cash payment were £3.1m for the initial payment for 
M Booth in August 2009, £1.0m for the purchase of 
the increased 36% stake in 463 Communications and 
£0.7m for the purchase of Upstream Asia in October 
2009. Dividends paid to Next Fifteen shareholders 
totalled £0.9m. This has undoubtedly been a much 
more diffi  cult year for working capital. The Group has 
faced pressure on payment terms from some clients, 
particularly those fi nanced by debt. It would appear 
that they have turned to their suppliers for fi nance 
where bank refi nancing has been more diffi  cult and 
more expensive. Typically, these are large companies 
with professional procurement teams who still 
off er a good credit risk but who unilaterally extend 
payment terms on a take it or leave it basis. In the 
face of these pressures, the fi nance teams within 
the Group have done a great job in managing 
the debtor profi le and bad debt exposure.
Balance sheet
The key movements in the Group’s balance sheet 
are the goodwill arising from the acquisitions of 
M Booth and Upstream Asia, and the increased 
receivables and payables consolidated following 
these acquisitions. The cash balances were £7 .3m 
compared to £7 .1m last year with the acquisitions 
largely funded from drawing down £3m from the 
bank facilities described below. The net debt 
position after deducting bank borrowings and 
fi nance leases was £0.9m (2009: £1.8m net cash). 
Net assets at 31 July 2010 were £27 .6m 
(2009: £24.9m).
Treasury and funding
The Group has a revolving-credit facility from
Barclays Bank of £5m until March 201 1, which it 
used to fund the purchases of Lexis and OutCast. 
The facility is available in a combination of sterling, 
US dollar, and euro at an interest rate of 1.25% over 
LIBOR. In addition, the Group has a £6m revolving-
credit facility with Barclays Bank, repayable in 
December 201 1, to help fund any future acquisitions, 
at a rate of 2.25% over LIBOR, of which £2.6m 
was used to fund the initial consideration for the 
purchase of M Booth in August 2009. Also available 
is an overdraft facility of £1.5m, available in sterling, 
US dollar and euro. All of the UK businesses are part 
of a composite accounting system which allows the 
off set of UK overdrawn and credit balances. In the 
US, the Group has consolidated facilities with Wells 
Fargo, supported by a US$2.7m credit line for letters 
of credit and working capital purposes. In addition 
Wells Fargo provided a US$1m loan facility at LIBOR 
plus 2.5% repayable over fi ve years, to partly fund 
the purchase of the additional stake in 463 
Communications. The Group aims to return any 
surplus cash to the UK subject to any local transfer 
restrictions, and as far as possible to hold only 
moderate non-deposit cash balances in overseas
subsidiaries, subject to working capital needs.

The total tax charge for the year is £1.6m 
(2009: £0.9m) on consolidated profi t before tax 
of £5.3m (2009: £3.2m). This represents an eff ective 
tax rate of 30%, being 2% higher than last year, 
refl ecting the higher tax rates in the US where an 
increasing proportion of our profi ts are made 
following the acquisition of M Booth. There were 
also losses in some of the individual entities that 
make up Upstream Asia. The higher tax charge also 
refl ects a decline in the value of our UK deferred tax 
asset, as corporate tax rates are set to fall.
Earnings
Basic earnings per share, adjusted for the highlighted 
items shown in note 5, rose 30% to 8.45p (see note 
10). This rise refl ects the increased profi t levels but 
was mitigated by the worsening of the tax charge in 
the year and the increased number of shares used 
in the calculation. This arises from shares issued in 
relation to the acquisition of a further stake in 463 
Communications and also takes into account shares 
issued after the year end in relation to the M Booth 
contingent consideration earned during the year. 
The calculation is also impacted by shares issued 
from the ESOP during the year when employees 
exercised share options.
The diluted adjusted earnings per share rose by 1 7%, 
to 7 .53p and this is 10.9% less than the adjusted basic 
fi gure. This increased level of dilution is coming from 
the options and performance shares outstanding 
under the LTIP , which are now expected to vest 
following modifi cations to the scheme approved by 
shareholders at the AGM in January 2010. Dilution 
also arises as a result of taking into account shares 
that are expected to be issued in the future as part 
  of the contingent consideration for the M Booth 
acquisition made in August 2009.
Dividends
The proposed fi nal ordinary dividend per share is 
1.375p, which takes the total for the year to 1.85p, a 
9% increase on the total dividend of 1.70p last year. 
It will be paid on 4 February 201 1, assuming that 
it is approved at the AGM on 25 January 201 1. 
The Board continues to review its dividend policy 
over the medium term and aims to strike a balance 
between the relevance placed on dividends by 
shareholders and the needs of the Company to 
invest for future growth.

(2009: 28 days).  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Subsequent events 
On 4 August 2010, Beyond Corporation Limited acquired the entire issued share capital of UK-based Type 3 Limited, while Beyond 
International Corporation acquired the entire issued share capital of US-based Type 3 Limited. Consideration of £300,000 in cash 
was paid on completion. The Company owns 51% of both Beyond Corporation Limited and Beyond International Corporation 
(together referred to as ‘Beyond’), while the residual is owned by three employee shareholders. The Company has entered into a 
shareholders’ agreement under which the non-controlling interest holders have the option to sell half of their shareholding back to 
the Company in either October 2013, October 2014 or October 2015, based on the profitability of each business. The consideration 
is uncapped. By October 2015, the Company will have acquired half of their shareholding, bringing the Company’s holding to 75.5%. 
On 1 September 2010, Lexis Public Relations Limited (‘Lexis’) acquired the entire issued share capital of UK-based Glasshouse 
Partnership Limited. The initial consideration paid on completion was £80,000. Contingent consideration may be payable in cash 
and the Company’s shares over the course of the next two years subject to the achievement of certain revenue and staff metric 
performance targets. 
On 1 September 2010, Bite Communications Hong Kong Limited acquired the business and assets of OneXeno Limited, a Hong 
Kong company. This business was integrated into Bite Communications Group Limited’s Asia Pacific operations. The initial 
consideration paid in cash on completion was HK$1,105,000, with further consideration payable based on the revenue of retained 
clients over the 12 months following completion.  
On 1 November 2010, the Group acquired an 85% stake in US-based investor relations company, The Blueshirt Group, LLC 
(‘Blueshirt’). The initial consideration paid in cash on completion was US$3m. Contingent consideration will be paid over the course 
of four years based on a multiple of average profits and margin performance. These contingent payments are estimated to total 
US$8m. There is an option for the sellers to sell the remaining 15% stake in Blueshirt after five years from completion and an option 
for the Company to acquire the remaining 15% after six years from completion provided that the value of the business at the 
relevant time has reached a certain level.   Overview

Corporate governance  
The Company’s statement on corporate governance is set out in pages 40 to 42 of these financial statements and forms part of this 
Directors’ report. 
Additional information for shareholders 
The following information is provided to shareholders as a result of the implementation of the European Directive on Takeover Bids 
(2004/25/EC) into English Law. This is a summary only. The relevant provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association (‘the 
Articles’) and the Companies Act (‘the Act’) should be consulted if further information is required.  
Share capital 
Details of changes in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company during the year are set out in note 20 of the financial 
statements.  
Rights and obligations attached to shares 
The rights attached to the Company’s Ordinary Shares, being the only share class of the Company, are set out in the Articles. 
Subject to the Act and applicable law, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution determine (or if the Company has not determined, as the Board may determine). There is currently no applicable 
resolution in effect.  
Voting rights 
At a general meeting of the Company, on a show of hands, every member present or by proxy shall have one vote. On a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he or she is a holder. No member may attend 
or vote nor exercise any other rights conferred by being a holder of Ordinary Shares unless all calls or other sums payable on every 
share held have been paid. A member may lose the entitlement to vote at a general meeting where that holder has failed to 
respond to a disclosure notice made by the Company under the Act with information concerning interests held in those shares.  
Restriction on transfer of shares 
The Directors may refuse, provided such refusal does not prevent dealings in the shares of the Company from taking place in an 
open and proper manner, a transfer of certificated shares unless it is:  
i) in respect of a share which is fully paid; 
ii) in respect of a share on which the Company has no lien; 
iii) in respect of only one class of shares; 
iv) in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees; and 
v) duly stamped (if required) and delivered for registration at the place designated by the Board accompanied by the 
certificate of shares and such other evidence of title as may be reasonably required to show the right of the transferor to 
make the transfer. 
The Board may refuse the registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated 
share is to be transferred exceeds four.  
Dividends 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by ordinary resolution declare a final dividend to be paid to members 
according to their respective rights and interests in the profits of the Company, but no such dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay such interim dividends as appear to the Board to be justified by the profits of 
the Company available for distribution.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Subject to the Act, the Company’s Memorandum of Association and the Articles and to any directions given by special resolution 
of the Company, the business of the Company shall be managed by the Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company 
whether relating to the management of the business or not.  
Amendment to the Articles

shareholders. 
Any shares which have been bought back may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be cancelled immediately upon 
completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the Company’s issued share capital. The Company has the power to buy back up to 
5,488,839 during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The maximum price per Ordinary Share which can be paid on 
any occasion is limited to 105% of the average of the middle-market quotations, as derived from the London Stock Exchange’s Daily 
Official List, for the five business days prior to the date of the purchase being made.

needed by the Group’s auditors for the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
The Directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware. 
The auditors, BDO LLP, have indicated a willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be reappointed will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Remuneration report 
 
35 
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and its role 
For the year ended 31 July 2010, the Committee consisted of the Company’s two non-executive Directors, Ian Taylor (Committee 
Chairman) and Will Whitehorn. The Chief Executive attends certain meetings of the Committee by invitation to discuss other 
executives’ performance, as appropriate. During the year the Committee received advice from the Chief Executive in respect of 
the remuneration of the Finance Director. The Committee takes professional advice as and when it considers this necessary.  
The Committee’s principal function is to determine the remuneration packages of the Company’s senior executives and executive 
Directors, and make recommendations to the Board concerning the allocation of bonuses and long-term incentive rewards to the 
two executive Directors and to senior executives in the Group. In addition, it considers the objectives set for each senior executive 
and how he or she has performed against these targets. Its key terms of reference are to: 
• determine and agree with the Board a general policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors and senior executives; 
• determine the total individual remuneration package of each executive Director;  
• determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for executive Directors; and 
• determine and approve the long-term performance incentive arrangements for executive Directors and senior executives 
of the Group. 
It takes into consideration the performance of the senior executives and Directors and sets the scale and structure of their 
remuneration and the basis of their service agreements, with due regard to the interests of shareholders. No one may participate in 
decisions regarding his or her own remuneration. The Committee’s terms of reference are published on the Company’s website. 
Remuneration policy 
The Group’s remuneration policy aims are to: 
• attract, develop, motivate and retain at all levels, talented people, of the calibre required to continue the Group’s growth 
and development; 
• ensure that key executives are appropriately rewarded for their contribution to the Group; and 
• encourage the holding of Company shares as an effective way of aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders. 
In framing this policy, the Remuneration Committee and the Board have given consideration to the provision of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance and the QCA guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies. In arriving at its recommendations, the 
Committee considers salary surveys covering AIM, small cap, and international PR companies. 
Remuneration package for executive Directors  
The policy for executive Directors’ remuneration is to ensure they are fairly rewarded for their individual contribution to the 
Group’s performance. This is done through a combination of a competitive salary and the opportunity to increase remuneration 
with short-term and long-term incentives. Executive remuneration packages are reviewed each year. The remuneration package 
for executive Directors consists of a basic salary, benefits, an annual performance-related bonus, pension and participation in 
a long-term incentive plan. Details for each Director are set out below. As the Chief Executive has a large shareholding in the 
Company, this is also taken into consideration when decisions are made regarding short-term and long-term incentives for him.  
Short-term incentives  
Executive Directors’ remuneration includes an element of performance-related pay so that awards can be aligned to improvements 
in shareholders’ value. The level of bonuses is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Bonuses are based on the 
performance of the Group as a whole, against budgets, and the Committee’s assessment of the performance of individuals against 
the personal objectives they have been set.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc
Annual Report 2010
Remuneration report continued

Long-term incentives 
The Remuneration Committee recommends the award of share options and performance shares to executive Directors and senior 
executives to incentivise and retain them. The current plan in place is the Next Fifteen Communications Group plc Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), which provides share option and performance share awards to Directors and senior employees.  
Under the terms of the LTIP, participants are either awarded share options with a grant price equal to the market price on the day 
before the grant date, or are awarded performance shares in the Company which are released to the participant upon both the 
satisfaction of certain performance conditions and the participant remaining an employee of the Group. During the year, the 
following performance shares were awarded to Directors: 
Name of Director Number of shares Grant date 
End of 
performance 
period 
Executive Directors   
Tim Dyson 150,000 February 2010 31 July 2013 
David Dewhurst 150,000 February 2010 31 July 2013 
In October 2008, the Company granted performance shares to non-executive Directors but has not granted any new awards to 
them this year and following consultation with some shareholders, will not grant any such awards in the future.  
At the Next Fifteen General Meeting held on 26 January 2010, shareholder approval was obtained to modify the performance 
conditions relating to all new awards under the LTIP from February 2010 and to apply the changes to grants made in financial years 
ended 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2009. The new performance conditions will be based upon two measures – an adjusted earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) measure and a budgeted profit measure. The performance shares under the LTIP are subject to the following 
new conditions: 
• The EPS growth of the Group must exceed the Retail Prices Index (‘RPI’) by an average of 10% or more per annum over the 
performance period for 50% of the award to vest. 
• If there is an average of between 3% and 10% EPS growth over RPI per annum over the performance period, between 10% 
and 50% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis. 
• If EPS does not grow an average of 3% or more over RPI per annum over the performance period, the full 50% of the award 
measured by reference to the EPS measure will lapse. 
• The remaining 50% of an award may vest if the profit of the particular business in which a participant is employed meets its 
budgeted profit before management charges, interest and tax targets over the performance period. 
• To the extent that the budgeted profit targets are not met, for every 1% below budget, 5% of an award will lapse on a straight-
line basis. 
• If a business’ adjusted profit before management charges, interest and tax is 10% or more below budget over the performance 
period, the full 50% of the award measured by reference to the budgeted profit measure will lapse.  
Performance will be measured over a period of four consecutive financial years of the Group, commencing with the financial year 
in which the award was granted. The level of vesting will be determined using the best three of the four years’ performance for 
each performance measure. 
EPS growth will be calculated from the information published in the Group’s accounts. The awards will vest when the preliminary 
results for the final financial year of the relevant performance period are released.  Overview

Various employees and Directors still have options that were issued under previous Next Fifteen Executive Share Option Schemes. 
Under such schemes, share options were issued at the market price on the day before the option was granted (or on another date 
no more than 30 days prior to the grant date). The share options become exercisable on the following dates: 
• The first one-third of the total number granted on the third anniversary of the date of granting. 
• The second one-third of the total number granted on the fourth anniversary of the date of granting. 
• The final one-third of the total number granted on the fifth anniversary of the date of granting. 
The share options will lapse on the date of cessation of the participant’s employment with the Group or ten years after the date on 
which the options were granted. 
For all options granted after 30 November 1999 there is a performance criterion that the options may not be exercised unless the 
Group’s EPS has, over a three-year period beginning not earlier than the financial year in which the option is granted and ending on 
the financial year preceding the year in which the option is exercised, grown by at least 30%. Options granted before this date did 
not have specific performance criteria. Share price growth was expected to be derived from EPS growth but without a hurdle-rate 
for exercise. 
For more information on share options and performance shares, see note 21 and 22.  
Directors’ service contracts 
All executive Directors have rolling contracts that are terminable on six months’ notice. There are no contractual entitlements to 
compensation on termination of the employment of any of the Directors other than payment in lieu of notice at the discretion of 
the Company. The executive Directors are allowed to accept appointments and retain payments from sources outside the Group, 
provided such appointments are approved by the Board in writing. Details of the executive Directors’ current service contracts are:

under letters of appointment terminable on three months’ notice at any time. Owing to his length of service as a non-executive 
Director, Ian Taylor has a letter of appointment that is renewable by the Company annually after each Annual General Meeting.

appointment. Details of the date of the current letters of appointment for non-executive Directors are:

Directors’ statement on corporate governance 
 
40 
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance. The Company is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance throughout the Group and has adopted appropriate measures for a Company of its size. 
This report sets out the measures it has taken. 
The Board  
The Board of Directors is responsible for the strategic direction, investment decisions and effective control of the Group. 
As Tim Dyson, the Chief Executive, is located in San Francisco, the Board meets mainly by telephone conference (at least monthly 
and at other times when required). They meet face-to-face when possible and aim to do so at least quarterly. There is a schedule 
of matters reserved for Board approval which is regularly reviewed and includes, among other things, the Group’s annual budget, 
establishment of new subsidiaries, property leases, significant acquisitions or disposals of fixed assets, and significant client 
contracts. During the year, 16 Board meetings were held, which included five face-to-face meetings (the others being by telephone 
conference). All Directors attended all meetings, save for Will Whitehorn who was unable to attend one meeting. 
The Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee comprise the two non-executive Directors, Ian Taylor (Committee Chairman) 
and Will Whitehorn. The Nomination Committee comprises Will Whitehorn (Committee Chairman), Ian Taylor and Tim Dyson. 
There were two Remuneration Committee meetings and two Audit Committee meetings during the year, and these were attended 
by all members. 
Prior to each Board meeting, every member of the Board receives an agenda, supporting documents and when relevant, monthly 
trading results, together with a detailed commentary. The non-executive Directors are encouraged to ask for further information 
if necessary. 
The non-executive Directors held meetings during the year without the executives present to discuss, among other things, the 
performance of the Company and that of the executive Directors. 
Chairman and Chief Executive  
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined. The Chairman, Will Whitehorn, is responsible for 
the leadership of the Board and the Chief Executive, Tim Dyson, is responsible for managing the Group’s operations. 
Board balance and independence  
There were no changes to the Board during the year to 31 July 2010. The Board comprises two executive Directors: Tim Dyson, 
Chief Executive, and David Dewhurst, Finance Director. There are two non-executive Directors: Will Whitehorn, Chairman, and 
Ian Taylor, who is the Company’s senior independent Director. Biographies of all the Directors are set out on page 27. The Board 
considers that the current Board structure is appropriate, and it complies with the QCA guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies 
which permits an independent Chairman to be counted as one of the two independent non-executive Directors. The Board 
considers that notwithstanding their interests in the shares and performance shares of the Company as set out on page 39, the 
non-executive Directors are independent of the management of the Group. The Long-Term Incentive Plan awards to the non-
executive Directors in 2008 provide a basis for aligning the interests of the non-executive Directors with those of the Company’s 
shareholders. The Company has not granted any new performance shares to the non-executive Directors and will not grant any 
such awards in the future. 
The Board has considered whether the length of service of Ian Taylor (11 years) has compromised his independence. Ian Taylor 
continues to be an effective Director and his long association with the Company has provided him with detailed understanding of 
the Company’s operations, its market and the issues determining its success. He constructively challenges recommendations made 
before making decisions. The Board does not consider his long service as a Director to be detrimental to his objectivity and it should 
not raise any concerns about his ability to perform his duties.  
Appointments to the Board 
Appointments to the Board are the responsibility of the Board upon recommendation of the Nomination Committee. There was 
no requirement for a Nomination Committee meeting during the year.  
Information and professional development 
The Directors have adopted a number of policies and procedures to help them operate effectively. These include access to 
independent professional advice. Appropriate training for new and existing Directors is provided where necessary.  Overview

Re-election of Directors 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation each year. This year, 
David Dewhurst will retire and be subject to re-election. As Ian has been a non-executive Director for 11 years, he will, in 
accordance with good corporate governance, retire and offer himself for re-election every year.  
Remuneration 
The Remuneration report on pages 35 to 39 sets out details of the Directors’ remuneration and the work of the Remuneration 
Committee. 
Financial reporting 
The statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 43. The Directors have 
reviewed the Group’s budget and cash requirements for the year ending 31 July 2011 and considered outline plans for the Group 
thereafter. The Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. 
Internal control and principal risks  
The Directors have responsibility for the system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. It is the 
responsibility of management to implement Board policies on risk and control. The Group’s system of internal control is designed 
to manage and reduce, rather than eliminate, risk. 
The Board assesses key areas of internal control and risk management and sets policies accordingly. At least once a year each of 
the core businesses is given the task of identifying and setting out its own key risks. The resulting document must contain a review 
of the extent and likelihood of each risk and the effectiveness of the controls that manage these risks. The Board also requires the 
businesses to identify and report any significant risks that arise during the year as soon as they arise. The Audit Committee reviews 
the businesses’ risk documents and produces a significant-risks document for the Group which is considered and approved by the 
Board. It identifies ways to manage and control these risks and sets policies accordingly. 
The Board can therefore confirm that there is a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks facing the 
Group. It has been in place throughout the year, and is up-to-date (as at the date of approval of these financial statements) and is 
regularly reviewed.  
The Board considers the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group to be: 
• Employee risk – the ability of the Group to continue to recruit new talent and retain existing employees. As a public relations 
business, the Group is very reliant on highly skilled employees who are vital to its success. Even in the current economic climate 
the competition for this talent is high. Steps are continually taken to ensure high levels of staff motivation and development. 
The Group’s HR teams regularly consider the remuneration and benefits offered to employees and seek to ensure all businesses 
provide exciting and challenging career development.  
• Client risk – the loss of clients unpredictably or for reasons outside the Group’s control. The loss of significant clients continues to 
be a risk to the Group. It has successfully reduced its reliance on a few key clients through a process of adding new businesses 
to the Group, but losing a major client unexpectedly can have a significant impact on resourcing and revenue. Ensuring a good 
marketing plan and identifying new business opportunities is key to all businesses as is taking all appropriate steps to retain 
existing clients.  
• Currency risk – as a global business, currency fluctuations continue to be a feature of the Group’s translated results. Most of the 
Group’s revenue is matched by costs arising in the same currency. The Company is listed in the UK but makes much of its profit 
outside of the UK. The Board continues to consider if and when hedging policies should be in place and to take steps to reduce 
this risk where it is considered appropriate. Ultimately, as a global business, the Group is well placed to take advantage of growth 
opportunities in the other parts of the world.  
The Board has considered the need for a separate internal audit function but has decided that, because of the size of the Group, this 
function will continue to be carried out by existing finance staff. This decision will continue to be reviewed annually.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Audit Committee and auditors  
The Audit Committee meets periodically and at least twice per year with the external auditors, and with other Directors and 
management attending by invitation. The primary role of the Committee is to keep under review the Group’s financial reporting 
procedures and financial systems and controls and to ensure the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. 
Its key terms of reference are: 
• reviewing the findings of the audit work undertaken by the Group’s auditors; 
• reviewing the effectiveness of the financial reporting and internal control procedures; 
• reviewing the relationship with external auditors; and 
• determining the level of the auditors’ fees. 
Its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website at www.nextfifteen.com. The independence and objectivity of 
the auditors is considered by the Committee on a regular basis. The split between audit and non-audit work for the year is set 
out in note 4 to the financial statements. The non-audit fees were in respect of non-audit tax services, advice on the Company’s 
share option and long-term incentive schemes and corporate finance advisory work. This work is not considered to affect the 
independence or objectivity of the auditors. The Committee also receives an annual confirmation of independence from the 
auditors. 
Environment 
Due to the nature of its businesses, the Board considers that its direct or indirect impact on the environment is minimal and of 
low-risk. However, the Company still seeks to minimise the environmental impact of its activities and its business practices support 
environmental good practice, such as reducing paper wastage through reuse, recycling, use of electronic communications and 
reducing business travel by replacing face-to-face meetings with conference calls. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Company meets regularly with its institutional shareholders and is keen to encourage shareholder participation at the Annual 
General Meeting, at which the Chief Executive makes a presentation summarising the progress of the Group throughout the year 
and invites any questions from attendees. Proxy votes are disclosed following a show of hands on each resolution. Shareholders 
were encouraged to submit questions to the Board throughout the year which were responded to promptly. The Company also 
publishes its annual and interim reports on its website, as well as the Company’s regulatory news announcements and some 
analyst reports. The Company also adds video clips to its website when it announces its interim and full-year results to explain 
the results further. These measures enable information on the Company to reach a greater number of investors and interested 
stakeholders. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly attend one-to-one meetings with key institutional shareholders after 
the publication of the Company’s interim and preliminary results. While the other non-executive Director does not ordinarily attend 
meetings with major shareholders, he would do so if requested by the shareholders.  Overview

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
 
43 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare 
the financial statements for the Group in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative 
Investment Market. The Directors have chosen to prepare financial statements for the Company in accordance with UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice. 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial period the Group’s financial 
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually 
all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards. 
A fair presentation also requires the Directors to: 
• consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit and loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going-concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.  
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing 
integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in preparation of the Parent Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to

Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion:  
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31July 2010 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company’s financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  Overview

received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1 Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below. 
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
A. Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by 
the European Union (‘adopted IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRSs. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention as modified by financial assets 
and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) at fair value through profit and loss. 
The segment information for the year ended 31 July 2009 has been restated in line with IFRS 8, Operating Segments which 
replaces IAS 14 to present the segment information based on the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. This restatement amends the disclosure of segmental performance and does not have any effect on the Group’s overall 
reported results. 
B. New and amended standards adopted by the Group  
IFRS 3 (revised), Business Combinations is effective prospectively to business combinations made in the year to 31 July 2010. 
The revised standard was applied to the acquisition of M Booth & Associates, Inc. (‘M Booth’) on 3 August 2009 and Upstream 
Marketing and Communications, Inc. (‘Upstream Asia’) on 27 October 2009. Initial consideration paid in cash was recorded at fair 
value at the acquisition date with contingent consideration and share purchase obligation classified as debt to be subsequently 
re-measured through the income statement, which would previously have been recognised through equity. Acquisition costs 
were also expensed, rather than being included within the cost of acquisition. The Group has recognised the non-controlling 
interest in relation to the Upstream Asia business combination at its acquisition date fair value rather than the proportionate share 
of net assets.  
IAS 27 (revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, treats transactions with non-controlling interests where there is 
no change in control as transactions with equity owners of the Group which will no longer result in goodwill or gain and losses. 
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the 
carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost, 
which has not occurred in the year. Any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised 
in profit or loss. There have been no transactions whereby an interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity; 
IAS 27 (revised) has been applied to the increased equity acquired in 463 Communications, LLC (‘463 Communications’). 
IAS 1 (revised), Presentation of Financial Statements. As a result of the application of this Amendment the Group has elected to 
present two separate statements, an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income; previously it presented an 
income statement and a statement of recognised income and expense. In addition, a statement of changes in equity is now 
presented as a primary statement where previously the information was included in a note. The Amendment does not change 
the recognition or measurement of transactions and balances in the financial statements. 
IFRS 8, Operating Segments. Operating segments have been reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision maker. Comparative information has been restated in line with the revised standard. 
The restatement amends the disclosure of segmental performance and does not have any effect on the Group’s overall reported 
results. The introduction of IFRS 8 has led to disclosure of an additional operating segment ‘Other segments’ as detailed in note 2. 
The segmental disclosures do not include total segment assets as they are not regularly reported to the chief operating decision 
maker, an exemption which has been adopted early following the 2009 IASB improvement project.  
No other standard or amendments that have become effective in the year have resulted in a material effect on the Group. 
C. Basis of consolidation 
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the results of Next Fifteen Communications Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings using the acquisition method of accounting. 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.  Overview

C. Basis of consolidation (continued) 
In the consolidated balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at 
their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the date on which control is obtained.  
Where the Group obtains and recognises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an associate undertaking, 
the associate becomes a subsidiary. The assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities and results are accounted for in line with subsidiary 
accounting discussed above, effective from the date in which control is recognised (the acquisition date). Control can be gained 
where the right to purchase the majority shareholding exists, whether or not that right is exercised. Where the recognition of 
control is accompanied with a purchase of a shareholding in the now subsidiary, goodwill is calculated at the acquisition date. 
All acquisition costs are expensed.  
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the parent’s ownership 
interests in them. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Non-controlling interests 
are subsequently measured as the amount of those non-controlling interests at the date of the original combination and the 
non-controlling interest’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.  
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies (Next Fifteen 
Communications Group plc and its subsidiaries) are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies for subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. 
D. Merger reserve 
Where the conditions set out in section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 after 
1 October 2009) are met, shares issued as part of the consideration in a business combination are measured at their fair value in 
the consolidated balance sheet, and the difference between the nominal value and fair value of the shares issued is recognised 
in the merger reserve. 
E. Revenue 
Billings represents amounts receivable from clients, exclusive of VAT, sales taxes and trade discounts in respect of charges for fees, 
commission and rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients. 
Revenue is billings less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part 
of a specific client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses. Revenue is 
recognised on the following basis: 
• Retainer and other non-retainer fees are recognised as the services are performed, in accordance with the terms of the 
contractual arrangement. 
• Project fees are recognised on a percentage of completion basis as contract activity progresses, if the final outcome can be 
assessed with reasonable certainty. The stage of completion is generally measured on the basis of the services performed 
to date as a percentage of the total services to be performed. 
• Expenses are recharged to clients at cost plus an agreed mark-up when the services are performed. 
F. Intangible assets 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration payable, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired. The fair value of consideration payable includes assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued. The amount relating to the non-controlling interest is measured on a transaction-by-transaction basis, at either 
fair value or the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of net assets acquired. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset 
with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated income statement.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
F. Intangible assets (continued) 
Software Licences for software that are not integral to the functioning of a computer are capitalised as intangible assets. 
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, 
and that are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. 
Direct costs include software development employee costs. 
Amortisation is provided on software at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly 
over its expected useful life of five to seven years.  
No amortisation is charged on assets in the course of construction until they are available for operational use in the business. 
Capitalised computer software that is not an asset in the course of construction is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful 
economic life. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Trade names Trade names acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trade names 
have a finite useful life and are carried at costs less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate the cost of trade names over their estimated useful lives of 20 years. 
Customer relationships Contractual customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at 
the acquisition date. The contractual customer relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the customer relationship 
of three to five years. 
G. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and 
equipment at annual rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected 
useful life as follows: 
Short leasehold improvements – Over the term of the lease, or until the first break clause. 
Office equipment  – 20% – 50% per annum straight-line. 
Office furniture – 20% per annum straight-line. 
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum straight-line. 
H. Impairment 
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets (including investments 
in associates but excluding deferred tax) are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is measured as the higher of value in use and fair value 
less costs to sell, the asset is impaired accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the asset’s 
cash-generating unit, defined as the lowest group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows. Goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination giving rise to the goodwill. 
Impairment charges are included within amortisation in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent they reverse 
gains previously recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed.  Overview

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
I. Foreign currency 
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
they operate (their ‘functional currency’) are recorded at the exchange rates ruling when the transactions occur. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising 
on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Foreign exchange movements on intercompany loans with indefinite terms, and for which there is no expectation of a 
demand for repayment, are recognised directly in equity.  
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the accounting 
period. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are 
translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets 
at opening rates and the results of overseas operations at average rates are recognised directly in the foreign currency translation 
reserve within equity. The effective portion arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings which are designated as a 
qualifying hedge is recognised within equity. See hedging activities for more detail.  
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative translation differences recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve 
relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated income statement as part of the profit or 
loss on disposal. 
J. Operating segments 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.  
K. Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the asset or liability. The Group’s accounting policies for different types of financial asset and liability are described 
below. 
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and will subsequently be measured at amortised cost less 
allowances for impairment. An allowance for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
(such as significant financial difficulties on the part of the counterparty, or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of the allowance is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows associated with the impaired 
receivable. Such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised as an expense in the other 
operating charges line in the consolidated income statement. On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the 
gross carrying value is written off against the associated allowance. 
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term call deposits held with banks. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, except where there 
is a pooling arrangement with a bank that allows them to be offset against cash balances. In such cases the net cash balance will 
be shown within cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group are protection contracts on US dollar interest 
rate contracts (cap-and-collar) and US dollar and euro foreign exchange contracts. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date, with gains and losses 
on revaluation being recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. The fair value of derivative financial liabilities 
is determined by reference to third party market valuations.  
Hedging activities The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and 
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of hedged items.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc
Annual Report 2010
Notes to the accounts continued 
 
56  
1 Accounting policies (continued) 
K. Financial instruments (continued) 
Where a foreign currency loan is designated as a qualifying hedge of the foreign exchange exposure arising on retranslation of 
the net assets of a foreign operation, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in other comprehensive income, so as to offset the foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the 
foreign operation’s net assets. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement 
within finance income/expense.  
Gains and losses accumulated in equity on retranslation of the foreign currency loan are recycled through the income statement 
when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. At this point the cumulative foreign exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of the net assets of the foreign operation are similarly recycled through the income statement. Where the hedging 
relationship ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains and losses remain within the foreign currency translation 
reserve until control of the foreign operation is lost; subsequent gains and losses on the hedging instrument are recognised in the 
income statement. Where there is a change in the ownership interest without effecting control, the exchange differences are 
adjusted within reserves.  
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised at their fair value net of direct issue costs and, thereafter, 
at amortised cost. Finance costs are charged to the consolidated income statement over the term of the debt so that the amount 
charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Finance costs include issue costs which are initially recognised as a reduction 
in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument and unwound over the term of the debt. 
Share purchase obligation Put option agreements that allow the Group’s equity partners to require the Group to purchase the 
non-controlling interest are recorded in the balance sheet as liabilities. On initial recognition, the liability is measured at the present 
value of the ultimate expected payment with the corresponding debit included in the share purchase reserve. Subsequent 
movements in the present value of the ultimate expected payment are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and, thereafter, at amortised cost. 
L. Provisions for other liabilities and charges  
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle that obligation, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. 
Provisions are created for vacant or sublet properties when the Group has a legal obligation for future expenditure in relation 
to onerous leases. The provision is measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required 
to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. 
M. Retirement benefits 
Pension costs which relate to payments made by the Group to employees’ own defined contribution pension plans are charged 
to the consolidated income statement as incurred. 
N. Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. The share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of the grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The cumulative expense is adjusted 
for failure to achieve non-market performance vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model on the grounds that there are no market-related vesting conditions. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Board’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.  Overview

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
O. Leased assets 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group 
(a ‘finance lease’), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the 
lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the 
lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. 
The interest element is charged to the consolidated income statement over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it 
represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor. 
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Group (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives is recognised as a reduction to the rental expense over the lease term 
on a straight-line basis. 
The land and buildings elements of property leases are considered separately for the purposes of lease classification. 
Where Group assets are leased out under operating leases with the Group acting as lessor, the asset is included in the balance 
sheet and lease income is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.  
P. Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet differs from 
its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal 
of the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. 
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
• the same taxable group company; or 
• different group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be settled or recovered. 
Where a temporary difference arises between the tax base of employee share options and their carrying value, a deferred 
tax asset should arise. To the extent the future tax deduction exceeds the related cumulative IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments (‘IFRS 2’) 
expense, the excess of the associated deferred tax balance is recognised directly in equity. To the extent the future tax deduction 
matches the cumulative IFRS 2 expense, the associated deferred tax balance is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Q. Dividends 
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. 
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Notes to the accounts continued

R. Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) 
As the Group is deemed to have control of its ESOP trust, the trust is treated as a subsidiary and consolidated for the purposes of the 
Group accounts. The ESOP’s assets (other than investments in the Company’s shares), liabilities, income and expenses are included 
on a line-by-line basis in the Group financial statements. The ESOP’s investment in the Group’s shares is deducted from equity in 
the consolidated balance sheet as if they were treasury shares and presented in the ESOP reserve. 
S. Treasury shares 
When the Group re-acquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s treasury shares. Such treasury 
shares may be acquired and held by other members of the Group. Consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity. 
T. Significant estimates and judgements 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make certain estimates and assumptions that 
have an impact on the application of the policies and amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and 
judgements are evaluated based on historical experiences and expected outcomes and are believed to be reasonable at the time 
such estimates and judgements are made, although actual experience may vary from these estimates. 
I. Impairment of goodwill. In line with lAS 36, Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to test the carrying value of goodwill, 
at least annually, for impairment. As part of this review process the recoverable amount of the goodwill is determined using 
value-in-use calculations, which requires estimates of future cash flows and as such is subject to estimates and assumptions. 
Further details are contained in note 11. 
II. Taxation. The Group is subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgement is required in determining the 
provision for income taxes. The Group recognises assets/liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the tax treatment. 
Where the final tax outcome is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax 
and deferred tax provisions. 
The Group has provided in full for what it considers to be the likely outcome of ongoing overseas tax litigation based on the 
evidence available at the present time. In the event that the overseas tax litigation is resolved in the Group’s favour there will be 
a material credit to the Group’s income statement tax charge in a future accounting period.  
III. Contingent consideration, share purchase obligation and valuation of put options. Contingent consideration and share purchase 
obligation relating to acquisitions has been included based on discounted management estimates of the most likely outcome. 
The difference between the fair value of the liabilities and the actual amounts payable is charged to the income statement as 
notional finance costs over the life of the associated liability. Where the agreement gives rise to an obligation that is settled by the 
delivery of a variable number of shares to meet a monetary defined liability, these amounts are disclosed as debt. Changes in the 
estimates of contingent consideration payable and the share purchase obligation is recognised in finance income/expense.  
U. New standards and amendments not applied. Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been 
published as mandatory for later accounting periods but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows: 
IAS 24, Related Party Transactions (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011) clarifies and simplifies the 
definition of a related party. 
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments will eventually replace IAS 39 in its entirety. IFRS 9 as issued on 12 November 2009 (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013) addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets. Classification of a financial 
asset is on the basis of an entity’s business model for managing them and the contractual cashflows characteristic of the asset. IFRS 9 
outlines the conditions to measure a financial asset at amortised cost and subsequent measurement at amortised cost or fair value as well 
as subsequent reclassification between categories. The held to maturity and available for sale classifications have been eliminated. IFRS 9 
requires that changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss which relate to changes in own 
credit risk should generally be recognised directly in other comprehensive income.  
All other standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards published as mandatory for this accounting periods or 
later accounting period would not have a material effect.   Overview

2 Segment information 
Description of the types of services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues 
The Board of Directors has identified the operating segments based on the reports it reviews as the chief operating decision maker 
to make strategic decisions, assess performance and allocate resources.  
The main activity of the Group is the provision of public relations services in key regions across the globe. Other operating segments 
are research and digital consultancy.  
The Group’s business is organised into four reportable segments, being the provision of public relations services in the UK, 
Europe and Africa, US and Canada, and Asia Pacific. Within these segments the Group operates a number of separate competing 
businesses in order to offer services to clients in a confidential manner where otherwise there may be issues of conflict. 
Measurement of operating segment profit  
The Board of Directors assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted operating profit 
before reorganisation costs and intercompany recharges, which reflects the internal reporting measure used by the Board of 
Directors. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring charges, such as movement in fair value of financial 
instruments, unwinding of the discount on contingent and deferred consideration, unwinding of the discount on the share 
purchase obligation, amortisation of acquired intangibles, and goodwill impairment charges. Other information provided to 
them is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial statements.  
Head office costs relate to group costs before allocation of intercompany charges to the operating segments.  
Intersegment transactions have not been separately disclosed as they are not material. The Board of Directors does not review 
the assets and liabilities of the Group on a segmental basis and therefore this is not separately disclosed.  
Segmental information for the year ended 31 July 2009 has been restated as a result of the change in accounting policy as 
explained in note 1.

recognised within finance income/expense in the income statement. These financial instruments comprise financial products used to manage the interest rate risks of the 
Group’s long-term debt obligations. The movement in fair value of the interest rate cap-and-collar contract since 31 July 2009 is a credit of £38,000 (2009: charge of 
£255,000).  
2
Forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Group are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet at each reporting date and the movement on such contracts is 
recognised within operating expenses in the income statement. These financial instruments comprise financial products used for hedging currency exposure on US dollar 
and euro. The movement in fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts since 31 July 2009 is a credit of £158,000 (2009: credit of £325,000). 
3
Reorganisation costs in the year to 31 July 2010 are not considered significant. The reorganisation costs of £1,950,000 in 2009 related to redundancies across the Group, 
the closure of the Text 100 Seattle office and the costs associated with the merger of Inferno Communications Limited into Bite Communications Limited (‘Bite’) on 
1 May 2009.  
4
A finance expense of £645,000 has been recognised during the year in relation to the unwinding of the discount on the contingent consideration payable for M Booth, a 
wholly owned subsidiary of the Group since August 2009, and £14,000 in relation to the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration payable for The OutCast 
Agency (‘OutCast’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group since June 2005 (2009: in relation to OutCast only). The final deferred consideration payment for OutCast was 
made in October 2009.  
5
A finance expense of £140,000 has been recognised during the year in relation to the unwinding of the discount on the share purchase obligation for Upstream Asia 
(£92,000) and 463 Communications (£48,000) (2009: in relation to Lexis Public Relations Limited only).  
6
A finance expense of £63,000 has been recognised during the year in relation to a change in the estimate of the contingent consideration payable for M Booth.  
7
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment. An impairment charge 
has been made for the goodwill recognised by Bite on acquisition of Credo Communications Limited (‘Credo’) on 31 December 2005. The operations were transferred 
into Bite and as a result the decision has been made to write down the goodwill by £116,000. As a result of this write down, the Credo goodwill is now fully impaired. 
8
A total amortisation of acquired intangibles charge of £526,000 has been recognised in the year in relation to M Booth (£334,000), 463 Communications (£125,000), AimPR 
Public Relations AB (£38,000) and Upstream Asia (£29,000). These are significant non-cash charges which arise as a result of acquisitions, and were not considered 
significant in the year to 31 July 2009.   Overview

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year   
The tax assessed for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28%  
(2009: 28%). The difference is explained below:   
Profit before income tax 5,304 3,158 
Corporation tax expense at 28%  1,485 884 
Effects of:   
Disallowed expenses 277 167

Deductions for overseas taxes (621) (597) 
Adjustments in respect of prior years (201) (16) 
 1,591 884 
The Group’s effective corporation tax rate for the year ended 31 July 2010 (30%) is slightly higher than the prior year (28%) and 
standard UK rates due to acquisitions undertaken by the Group in the year and the impact of the reduction in the UK corporation 
tax rate. As a result of the acquisitions, a greater proportion of Group profit was generated in higher tax regimes and losses arose in 
territories in which it would not be prudent to recognise deferred tax assets. 
As a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% that was substantively enacted on 27 July 2010 and 
effective from 1 April 2011, the UK deferred tax balances have been remeasured.  
Further reductions to the UK corporation tax rate have been announced. The changes, which are expected to be enacted 
separately each year, propose to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 24% by 1 April 2014. These changes had not been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in the financial statements.  Overview

1The Group acquired control of 463 Communications as at 1 August 2008. During the year, a profit share was paid to the holders of the non-controlling interest of £256,000 
(2009: £226,000).  
The ESOP waived its right to dividends in the financial year ended 31 July 2010 (£9,000) and the year ended 31 July 2009 (£18,000). 
A final dividend of 1.375p per share (2009: 1.25p) has been proposed. This has not been accrued. The interim dividend was 0.475p 
per share (2009: 0.45p), making a total for the year of 1.85p per share (2009: 1.70p). The final dividend, if approved at the AGM on 
25 January 2011, will be paid on 4 February 2011 to all shareholders on the Register of Members on 7 January 2011. The ex-dividend 
date for the shares is 5 January 2011.

Relates mainly to performance shares on which the performance criteria are expected to be met and will vest. In the year to 31 July 2009, it was deemed that the 
performance criteria would not be met and therefore the performance shares were not expected to vest. At the Next Fifteen Annual General Meeting held on  
26 January 2010, shareholder approval was obtained to modify the performance conditions relating to all new awards under the Next Fifteen Long-Term Incentive Plan 
from February 2010 and to apply the changes to grants made in the financial years ended 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2009.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

11 Intangible assets (continued) 
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs have been determined from value-in-use calculations using a projection period of five years 
for each cash-generating unit. The basis for this is the 2011 budget approved by the Board, with a further four years based on 
projected pre-tax cash flows extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.5%. After the initial projection period, a steady long-term growth 
rate of 2.5% and no improvement in operating margin has been applied to the pre-tax cash flow forecast into perpetuity. This is 
considered prudent based on experience and current expectations of the long-term industry growth rate. A pre-tax discount rate, 
being the Group’s weighted average cost of capital of 11.0% (2009: 10.0%), has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. 
The Board has considered reasonable possible sensitivities in key assumptions on which the value-in-use calculations are based. 
If growth rates reduced to 0%, or if the discount rate increased to 20%, this would not cause the carrying values of the groups of 
CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts in all cases except for Lexis. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the discount rate is 
increased in isolation to 18%, the estimated recoverable amount of Lexis is equal to carrying value. 
The goodwill impairment review performed at year end has resulted in an impairment charge for the goodwill recognised by Bite 
on acquisition of Credo on 31 December 2005, part of the Bite (UK) CGU. The operations were transferred into Bite and as a result 
the decision has been made to write down the goodwill by £116,000. As a result of this write down, the Credo goodwill is now fully 
impaired. 
There was no other impairment of goodwill as the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value in all other cases.

Provisions comprise liabilities where there is uncertainty about the timing of settlement, but where a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount. The provision covers the cost of rent, rates and dilapidations on an unoccupied leasehold property due 
to the merger of Inferno Communications Limited into Bite Communications Limited on 1 May 2009, for which the lease runs 
to December 2010. No reimbursement for a sub-lease is expected, and the effect of discounting is deemed immaterial.

Deferred consideration on acquisitions.  
In October 2009, US$312,000 (£199,000) of final deferred consideration was paid for The OutCast Agency, and SEK569,000 (£50,000) of final deferred consideration was 
paid for AimPR Public Relations AB. These both settle the deferred consideration liability outstanding at 31 July 2009.  
2
Contingent consideration on acquisitions.  
On 3 August 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of New York-based M Booth & Associates, Inc. (‘M Booth’). The acquisition of M Booth 
includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by the Company based on achievement of certain revenue and 
performance targets, over the course of the next four years.  
3
Share purchase obligation.  
On 27 October 2009, the Group acquired 55% of Upstream Marketing and Communications, Inc. (‘Upstream Asia’). The Group has entered into an option deed under 
which it has an obligation to acquire the residual 45% over a five-year period based on the profitability of the acquired businesses, leading to a share purchase obligation 
of US$1,213,000 (£736,000) arising on the acquisition date.  
On 31 October 2009, the Group acquired a further 30% holding in 463 Communications, taking the Group’s total holding to 70%. At this point the Group was obliged to 
purchase 100% of the business over a seven-year period, leading to a share purchase obligation of US$1,035,000 (£628,000) arising on the acquisition date. A further 6% 
was acquired on 28 May 2010, for consideration of US$120,000 (£83,000).

Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is 
supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned. 
19 Financial instruments 
Financial risk management, policies and strategies 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases, cash and short-term deposits and derivative 
financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and payables, which arise directly from 
operations. 
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily cap-and-collar interest rate and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The purpose of such contracts is to protect the profits and surplus funds arising in principal markets from currency fluctuations 
and to manage the interest rate risks on the Group’s sources of finance.  
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. 
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with 
floating interest rates and cap-and-collar interest rate derivatives. 
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest costs arising on variable rate debts by entering into interest rate cap-and-collar 
contracts. These agreements are designated to protect underlying debt obligations against significant increases in interest rates as 
required under the terms of the Group’s revolving loan facility with Barclays Bank. At 31 July 2010 US$8m of US dollar borrowings 
have been capped at 6.25% through to March 2012. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s profit before tax at 31 July 2010 based on year end balances and rates.

A rise in US interest rates of 2% would give a positive movement of £148,000 (2009: £240,000) in the fair value of the interest rate 
cap-and-collar contract. 
The interest rate cap-and-collar contract is categorised as a level two financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages its risk to a shortage of funds with a mixture of long and short-term committed facilities. As at 31 July 2010 
the Group had undrawn committed facilities of £4,040,000 (2009: £6,000,000). In addition, the Group has an overdraft facility with 
Barclays Bank, of £1,500,000 (2009: £1,500,000) at a rate of 2.25% above Barclays Bank’s base rate, available in sterling, US dollar 
and euro, and a credit line with Wells Fargo Bank of US$2,735,000 (£1,746,000) (2009: US$2,000,000 (£1,206,000)) at the prime rate 
(currently 3.25%) available in US dollars. The Barclays Bank’s overdraft facility is reviewed at the bank’s discretion with no expiry date. 
The Wells Fargo Bank’s overdraft facility is reviewed on an annual basis and expires in January 2011. The following table summarises 
the maturity profile based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date of the Group’s

Currency risk 
As a result of significant global operations, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the foreign 
exchange rates against sterling. This is largely through the translation of balances denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of an entity. The Group has transactional currency exposures in the Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific region, 
including foreign currency bank accounts and intercompany recharges. The Group uses currency derivatives to protect significant 
US dollar and euro currency exposures against changes in exchange rates. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonable possible changes in exchange rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group’s profit before tax at 31 July 2010 based on year end balances and rates.

Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. 
It is the Group’s policy that customers who wish to trade on credit terms be subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, 
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been 
significant. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of provisions for impairment of trade receivables, estimated by 
the Group’s management based on experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are reputable banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies, although the Board recognises that in the current economic climate these indicators cannot 
be relied upon exclusively.

Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. Total capital of the Group is calculated as total 
equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings and finance leases, less 
cash and cash equivalents.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

Externally imposed capital requirement 
Under the terms of the Group’s banking covenants the Group must meet certain criteria based on gross borrowings to earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, interest cover and guarantee ratios on turnover, operating profit, 
total assets and total operating cash flows to consolidated gross financing costs. There have been no breaches of the banking 
covenants in the current or prior year. 
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument can be exchanged in an arm’s-length transaction between informed 
and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale. 
The book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities equals the fair value of such items as at 31 July 2010, with the exception 
of obligations under finance leases. The book value of obligations under finance leases is £134,000 (2009: £267,000) and the fair 
value is £140,000 (2009: £291,000).  Overview

Hedge of net investment in foreign entity 
A proportion of the Group’s US dollar-denominated borrowings amounting to US$4,000,000 is designated as a hedge of the net 
investment in the Group’s US subsidiary M Booth & Associates, Inc. The fair value of the borrowings at 31 July 2010 is US$4,000,000 
(£2,554,000). The foreign exchange loss of £111,000 on translation of the borrowing to functional currency at the end of the 
reporting period is recognised in a hedging reserve, in shareholders’ equity.

The Group uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of options on grant date for new issues and modifications. 
At each year end the cumulative expense is adjusted to take into account any changes in estimate of the likely number of shares 
expected to vest. Details of the relevant option schemes are given in note 22. All the share-based payment plans are subject 
to non-market performance conditions such as adjusted earnings per share targets and continued employment. All schemes 
are equity-settled. The key inputs are listed below and market price on each grant date is obtained from external, publicly 
available sources.

Performance criteria modified on 26 January 2010. 
Under the Next Fifteen Executive Share Option Schemes, save as explained hereafter, all options are normally exercisable on or after 
the third anniversary of the date of grant and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant, to the extent 
that they have vested. Options will vest in respect of one-third of the shares on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of 
their date of grant. Options granted to employees in California from 23 October 2001 are exercisable at a rate of 20% per year over 
five years from the date of grant. The vesting of all share options granted after 30 November 1999 is conditional on achievement of 
a performance criterion of the Group’s earnings per share growing over a three-year period after the grant by at least 30%. 
4,915,432 share options/performance shares/conditional shares issued by the Company under the Next Fifteen Communications 
Executive Share Option Schemes, Long-Term Incentive Plan and Restricted Stock Grant Agreement are options/performance 
shares/conditional shares over unissued shares. The remaining 1,665,155 options/performance shares/conditional shares will be 
largely satisfied by either shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (500,897) or by shares held by the Company in 
treasury (1,164,258) (see note 23). 
At the Next Fifteen General Meeting held on 26 January 2010, shareholder approval was obtained to modify the performance 
conditions relating to all new awards under the Next Fifteen Long-Term Incentive Plan from February 2010 and to apply the 
changes to grants made in the financial years ended 31 July 2008 and 31 July 2009. Performance will be measured over a 
period of four consecutive financial years of the Group, commencing with the financial year in which the award was granted. 
The new conditions are based upon two measures – an adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) measure and a budgeted profit 
measure. The level of vesting will be determined using the best three of the four years’ performance for each performance measure. 
The growth of adjusted EPS of the Group must exceed the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) by an average of 10% or more per annum over 
the performance period for 50% of the award to vest. If the growth of adjusted EPS over RPI is between an average of 3% and 10% 
per annum over the performance period, between 10% and 50% of the award will vest on a straight-line basis. The remaining 50% 
of an award may vest if the profit of the particular business in which a participant is employed meets its budgeted profit targets 
over the performance period. To the extent that the budgeted profit targets are not met, for every 1% below budget, 5% of the 
award will lapse on a straight-line basis. Employees who work in group roles will be measured by reference to whole group 
performance, rather than any particular business unit. 
On 1 May 2009, Inferno Communications Limited (‘Inferno’), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, merged into Bite 
Communications Limited (‘Bite’), also a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Following the merger there was a one-off grant 
of performance shares to two senior members of Inferno who transferred to Bite. The extent to which the award would vest is 
determined by reference to the retention of key clients by Bite for which the participants are the key account directors. On 1 May 
2010, 60% of the award vested as the clients remained with Bite, and the final 40% will vest if the clients still remain on 1 May 2011.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

22 Share options (continued) 
On 3 August 2009 the Group acquired M Booth & Associates, Inc. (‘M Booth’) and entered into a Restricted Stock Grant Agreement 
of US$200,000. The number of shares granted was determined by reference to the average of the mid-market price of the 
Company’s shares for the ten trading day period ended four days prior to issuance, leading to a total of 262,796 shares granted. 
The fair value of the shares was based on the market value at the date of grant. The grant shares will vest in equal amounts on each 
of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, provided that each participant remains a full-time employee of M Booth as of the 
anniversary vesting date.  
23 Investment in own shares 
Employee share ownership plan (ESOP) 
The purpose of the ESOP is to enable the Company to offer participation in the ownership of its shares to Group employees 
principally as a reward and incentive scheme. Arrangements for the distribution of benefits to employees, which may be the 
ownership of shares in the Company or the granting of options over shares in the Company held by the ESOP, are made at 
the ESOP’s discretion in such manner as the ESOP considers appropriate. Administration costs of the ESOP are accounted for 
in the profit and loss account of the Company as they are incurred. 
At 31 July 2010 the ESOP held 500,897 (2009: 951,061) Ordinary Shares in the Company, which represents 0.9% (2009: 1.7%) of the 
Ordinary Share capital. The ESOP reserve of £162,000 (2009: £644,000) represents the cost of these shares held by the ESOP in the 
Company at 31 July 2010. The nominal value of shares held was £12,522 (2009: £23,777), and the market value at 31 July 2010 was 
£300,538 (2009: £456,509). The right to receive dividends on all shares has been waived. 
During the year to 31 July 2010, a number of employees exercised their options. In total 317,664 (2009: 190,000) ESOP options were 
exercised, for proceeds of £109,800 (2009: £63,301), as were 132,500 performance shares. 
Treasury shares 
The Group holds 1,164,258 (2009: 1,164,258) treasury shares at a cost of £595,000 (2009: £595,000). The nominal value of shares held 
at 31 July 2010 was £29,106 (2009: £29,106), and the market value was £698,555 (2009: £558,844). The right to receive dividends on 
all shares has been waived.

26 Acquisitions 
1. On 3 August 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of New York-based M Booth & Associates, Inc. (‘M Booth’), 
a leading PR consultancy in North America, as part of the next step in the Group’s strategy to build a global consumer agency. 
The initial consideration paid in cash on completion was US$4,000,000 (£2,554,000). A balance of US$790,000 (£504,000) excess 
working capital acquired which was paid to the vendors is also treated as consideration. Further consideration of up to a 
maximum of US$13,250,000 (£8,461,000) may be payable over the course of the next four years subject to the achievement 
of certain revenue and profit performance targets. The total maximum consideration is therefore US$17,250,000 (£11,015,000), 
excluding the payment for excess working capital. The first US$11,250,000 (£7,184,000) of contingent consideration that may be 
payable can be satisfied by cash or up to 25% in shares, at the option of the Group. The final US$2,000,000 (£1,277,000) that may 
be payable can be satisfied 100% in shares, at the option of the Group.  
From 3 August 2009 to 31 July 2010, M Booth contributed US$11,500,000 (£7,343,000) to revenue and US$1,688,000 (£1,078,000) 
profit before tax.  
Acquisition costs of US$184,000 (£117,000) were paid in relation to the purchase of M Booth, US$154,000 (£98,000) recognised in 
the income statement for the year ended 31 July 2009 and US$30,000 (£19,000) recognised in the income statement for the year 
ended 31 July 2010. 
Goodwill arises from anticipated profitability and future operating synergies from combining the operations with the Group.  
The fair value of the assets acquired includes trade receivables of US$3,692,000 (£2,357,000). The gross amount due under 
contracts is equal to this balance, and is all expected to be collectable.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

The fair value adjustment relating to intangible assets is due to the recognition of US$1,818,000 (£1,161,000) in respect of the M Booth trade name and US$2,171,000 
(£1,386,000) in respect of customer relationships, which have been independently valued. There is a related deferred tax liability fair value adjustment of US$1,082,000 
(£691,000). The trade name will be amortised over its useful economic life of 20 years, and the customer relationships will be amortised over five years.  
2 
The acquisition of M Booth includes a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid by the Group based on achievement 
of certain revenue and performance targets, over the course of the next four years. The range of undiscounted amounts the Group could pay under the contingent 
consideration agreement is between US$0 and US$13,250,000. The fair value of the contingent consideration recognised on the acquisition date of US$8,459,000 
(£5,401,000) was estimated by applying the income approach, by calculating the fair value of the future estimated payments. 
2. On 31 October 2009, the Group acquired a further 30% stake in 463 Communications, LLC (‘463 Communications’), taking the 
Group’s total holding to 70%. The Group is now obliged to purchase 100% of the business over a seven-year period. The holding 
was acquired for a total consideration of US$2,139,000 (£1,365,000), of which US$1,426,000 (£910,000) was satisfied in cash and 
US$713,000 (£455,000) in shares (805,095 shares). 
On 28 May 2010, the Group acquired a further 6% stake in 463 Communications, taking the Group’s total holding to 76%. 
The holding was acquired for a total consideration of US$120,000 (£77,000) which was satisfied in cash. There were no 
acquisition costs incurred in relation to the further interest acquired. 
No goodwill has been recognised on the acquisition of the further equity interest in 463 Communications. The effect of this 
transaction is recorded in equity as there is no change in control.  
3. On 27 October 2009, the Group acquired the marketing communications trading subsidiaries of Upstream Marketing and 
Communications, Inc. (‘Upstream Asia’), which has been integrated into the Bite Communications Group. The initial consideration 
was US$900,000 (£575,000) paid in cash and the assumption of US$200,000 (£128,000) of Upstream Asia’s liabilities (of which 
US$120,000 (£77,000) were paid on completion). The Group owns 55% of Upstream Asia, and a Hong Kong based company 
Asset Pioneer Limited (‘Asset Pioneer’) owns the residual 45%. The Group has entered into an option deed under which it has 
a obligation to acquire Asset Pioneer’s shares over a five-year period based on the profitability of the acquired businesses.  
In the post acquisition period, Upstream Asia contributed £2,016,000 to revenue and £18,000 loss before tax. If the acquisition 
had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been £73,000,000 and profit 
before income tax would have been £5,298,000. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies 
and pro-rating the nine-month results across 12 months.   Overview

Acquisition costs of US$123,000 (£79,000) were paid in relation to the acquisition of Upstream Asia, and recognised within the

Goodwill arises from anticipated profitability and future operating synergies from the combination. 
The fair value of the assets acquired includes trade receivables of £549,000. The gross amount due under contracts totals £582,000, 
of which £549,000 is expected to be collectable.

The fair value of the non-controlling interest of £774,000 in Upstream Asia was estimated by calculating the fair value of the future payment obligations.  
4. On 9 October 2009, the Group paid US$312,000 (£199,000) in cash relating to the final deferred consideration for the purchase 
of The OutCast Agency (‘OutCast’). OutCast is a wholly owned subsidiary acquired in June 2005.  
5. On 30 October 2009, the Group paid SEK569,000 (£50,000) in cash relating to the final deferred consideration for the purchase 
of the business and certain assets of AimPR Public Relations AB, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. This business was 
integrated into Bite’s existing Swedish operation.  Next Fifteen Communications Group plc

except for Lexis Public Relations Limited and M Booth & Associates, Inc., which work for clients predominantly in non-technology

On 4 August 2010, Beyond Corporation Limited (previously Project Metal Limited) acquired the entire issued share capital of 
UK-based Type 3 Limited, and on the same date, Beyond International Corporation (previously Context Analytics Corporation) 
acquired the entire issued share capital of US-based Type 3 Limited. Both Type 3 companies offer a fully integrated web design 
service, and were acquired as part of the Group’s strategy to build a digital consultancy. The initial consideration paid in cash 
on completion was £300,000. The Group owns 51% of both Beyond Corporation Limited and Beyond International Corporation 
(together referred to as ‘Beyond’), while the residual is owned by three employee shareholders. The Group has entered into a 
shareholders’ agreement under which the non-controlling interest holders have the option to sell half of their shareholding back

is uncapped. By October 2015 the Group will have acquired half of their shareholding, bringing the Group holding to 75.5%.  
Acquisition costs of £89,000 were paid in relation to the purchase of Beyond, of which £76,000 were recognised in the 
consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 July 2010, and the remainder recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in August 2010.

consideration will be paid over the course of four years based on a multiple of average profits and margin performance.

for the year ended 31 July 2010

1 Accounting policies  
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has not 
presented its own profit and loss account.  
Merger reserve  
In accordance with the provisions of merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 (section 612 of the Companies 
Act 2006 after 1 October 2009), where the Company issues shares as part of an acquisition the Company records the cost of the 
investment at the nominal value of the shares issued and records the excess of fair value over nominal value as a merger reserve. 
This is applicable where equity interest is greater than 90%. 
Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at annual rates 
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows:  
Office equipment   20% – 50% per annum straight-line.  
Computer software   14% – 20% per annum straight-line.  
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.  
Foreign currencies  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are expressed in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are expressed in sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange gains and losses and translation differences are taken directly to the profit and loss account.  
Financial instruments  
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate cap-and-collar contracts and forward foreign exchange 
contracts. The Company does not enter into speculative derivative contracts. All such instruments are used to alter the risk profile 
of an underlying exposure of the Company in line with the Group’s risk management policies. Premiums payable under foreign 
exchange contracts are expensed over the life of the contract and any gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred 
and are recognised in the profit and loss account only when the protected transaction has itself been reflected in the Company’s 
financial statements.  
Leasing transactions  
Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet. The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the estimated 
useful economic life and the period of the lease. The interest element on these obligations is charged to the profit and loss account 
so as to approximate a constant interest rate over the life of each agreement. Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and 
loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.  
Pension costs  
Pension costs, which relate to payments made by the Company to employees’ own defined contribution pension plans, are 
charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.  
Investments  
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.   Next Fifteen Communications Group plc
Annual Report 2010
Notes forming part of the Company financial statements continued

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred taxation  
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, 
or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law. 
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from 
those in which they are included in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from 
the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where 
there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.  
Share-based employee remuneration  
There are share options granted prior to 7 November 2002 which remain outstanding at 31 July 2010. Details of all grants are 
disclosed in note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.  
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model on the grounds that there are no market-related vesting conditions. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the Board’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Details of the risk-free rate and dividend yield used to underpin these 
assumptions are included in note 21 of the consolidated financial statements. The market price on the grant date is obtained 
from external publicly available sources.  
Employee share ownership plan  
The cost of the Company’s shares held by the ESOP is deducted from shareholders’ funds in the Company and Company balance 
sheet. Any gain or loss made by the ESOP on disposal of the shares it holds is also recognised directly in shareholders’ funds. 
Other assets and liabilities of the ESOP (including borrowings) are recognised as assets and liabilities of the Company.  
Finance costs  
Finance costs are charged to profit over the term of the debt so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying 
amount. Finance costs include issue costs which are initially recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital 
instrument.  
Dividends  
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. 
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting as required by FRS 21 
Events After the Balance Sheet Date.  
Dividends receivable from investments are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they are paid.  
Treasury shares  
When the Company re-acquires its own equity instruments, those instruments (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s treasury shares. 
Such treasury shares may be acquired and held by other members of the Group. Consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in equity. 
Cash flow statement  
The Company has applied the exemption allowed under FRS 1 and has not presented a cash flow statement. The cash flow 
statement has been presented in the Group financial statements.  
2 Profit and loss account of the Parent Company  
The Parent Company’s profit after tax for the financial year was £30,578,000 (2009: loss of £313,000). This includes a gain 
of £28,566,000 in relation to the waiver of amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings as part of an intercompany debt 
simplification exercise.  Overview

	 a nd	 give	 us	 your	 	 	
	 thoughts.
Next Fifteen continues to look at the most  
effective way to communicate with its  
shareholders and other stakeholders. Following 
positive feedback, we have once again created 
an enhanced online annual report that can be 
found on our website, www.nextfifteen.com and 
would urge you to take a look at the case studies 
showing some of the work we do for our clients.
It would be great to hear feedback from shareholders 
on the Annual Report or any other aspect of the  
business. We would be happy to answer questions 
from shareholders at any time rather than waiting  
for the Annual General Meeting in January.
We look forward to hearing from you.

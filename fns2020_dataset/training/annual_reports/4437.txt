INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to present Datong’s maiden results for the year ended 31 March 2006 
following its Admission to London’s AIM market on 7 October 2005. £2.75m (after 
expenses) of new money was raised for the Company and this is being used to fund 
the expansion of the business.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The principal business of Datong is the development, design and manufacture 
of a range of advanced high performance surveillance products. The products 
are principally sold to government, military and federal law enforcement 
agencies to assist their operatives in covertly tracking hostile vehicles, packages, 
containers and mobile phones. Datong is headquartered in Leeds, employs 
80 people and has a sales and service ofﬁce in Virginia, USA. 
YEAR IN REVIEW
In the 12 months to 31 March 2006, Datong’s turnover grew by 12.3% to £7 .3m 
(2005: £6.5m). Before the exceptional charge of £1.9m, operating proﬁt was £1.2m 
(2005: £1.5m) and earnings per share were 7 .2p per share (2005: 8.2p per share). 
These results are in line with the expectations adjusted in January 2006 when the 
Board announced the disappointing delays in the receipt of a signiﬁcant US order 
and in the delivery of a UK development contract. 
Datong released four new products during the year, all of which have been 
well received by customers. One of these products is manufactured by a third 
party, resulting in a lower margin than Datong’s proprietary products.  
This successful launch expands the Company’s market reach and complements 
its existing product range. 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“ DATONG RELEASED FOUR NEW PRODUCTS DURING 
THE YEAR, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED 
BY CUSTOMERS… THIS SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH EXPANDS 
THE COMPANY’S MARKET REACH AND COMPLEMENTS 
ITS EXISTING PRODUCT RANGE.”
SUMMARY OF CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Successful Admission to AIM. 
Turnover up 12.3%.
Four new products successfully launched and 
well received.  Datong Electronics PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Further new product launches are due to be completed in the ﬁ rst half of 
the year ending 31 March 2007 . 
Datong’s business is back-end weighted with around 65%–70% of sales 
revenue occurring in the second half of the year. This is due to EU, US and 
UK Governments’ spending trends being biased towards procurement in the 
months leading up to March, and we expect this trend to continue for the 
year ended 31 March 2007 .
DIVIDEND
A special dividend of £0.6m was paid to the previous 100% shareholder 
prior to Admission. As we wish to apply our cash resources to fund growth, 
we do not anticipate paying any further dividends in the foreseeable future. 
BOARD CHANGES
In line with our strategy, the Board is also pleased to welcome Grant Ashley to 
the Board as a Non-executive Director. Based in the US, Grant was until recently 
executive assistant director of the FBI and is currently a vice president (Corporate 
Security, Surveillance and Investigations) of Harrah’s Entertainment Inc.
The depth of experience and knowledge that Grant brings to the Company will 
be invaluable both internationally and in assisting us with the further growth of 
our US operations. Grant joined Datong on 6 June 2006.
PEOPLE
This has been an exciting and challenging year for the business and I would 
like to thank my fellow Board members and staff for their hard work, effort 
and enthusiasm over the last year.
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued interest 
and investment in the Group.
PAUL LEVER
CHAIRMAN Datong Electronics PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Turnover for the year grew by 12.3% to £7 .3m (2005: £6.5m) with 
funded development contract revenues representing £1.1m of this amount 
(2005: £0.1m). 
Gross proﬁt is £3.8m or 51.5% of turnover (2005: £3.8m or 58.4% of turnover). 
The principal changes in the gross proﬁt margin can be explained by the 
combination of three factors:
  a change in the sales mix, principally the sale of third party products 
totalling £1.1m (2005: £Nil) which had the effect of reducing margins by 4.1%;
  in line with our strategy, an increase in research and development costs 
(driven by an increase in headcount) reducing gross proﬁt by 1.3%; and 
 increase in headcount of the production facility reducing gross proﬁt by 1.3%.
Order intake for the year rose by 13.2% to £7.7m (2005: £6.8m), driven 
by strong market demand from the UK and the Rest of the World (‘RoW’). 
As notified previously, we were disappointed by the delay in the receipt 
of a significant US order and in the delivery of a UK development contract 
which adversely affected turnover for the year. I am pleased to announce 
that both the UK and US contracts will be delivered in the ﬁrst half of 2006/07 .
During the year we invested £1.0m in research and development, representing 
approximately 14.3% of turnover. This investment enables us to maintain our 
leading position within our homeland security and defence core markets whilst 
also gaining a foothold in new markets using the next generation of tracking 
systems and related products. 
Our market is split into four geographical regions: UK, US, Europe and the 
RoW. Datong has ofﬁces in the UK and US and is represented by a network 
of 24 distributors in the remaining territories. We continue to expand our 
geographical reach as we move into new countries and sign additional 
agreements with key distributors.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
“ WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR LEADING POSITION IN EACH 
OF OUR KEY GEOGRAPHIES. IN ORDER TO REMAIN AT 
THE FOREFRONT OF THESE MARKETS, WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND EXPAND 
OUR PRODUCT OFFERING.”
SUMMARY OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Continued operations into new markets. 
Increased investment in research and development.
Strategic alliances with key customers ensure 
new products are developed.  Datong Electronics PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006
UK
UK turnover for the year increased by 125% to £2.7m (2005: £1.2m) due 
to the UK funded development contract discussed above. We are now 
re-organising and expanding the research and development facility to target 
such contracts in the future and are becoming proactive in our search for this 
type of business. 
US
US turnover fell to £2.6m (2005: £4.0m), primarily as a result of the delayed 
US order discussed above. Revenue from other US customers remained strong 
during the year and the current US pipeline is very healthy, with a number 
of signiﬁcant contracts expected within the year ending 31 March 2007 . 
The delayed US order is expected in the near future.
EUROPE
European turnover remained constant at £1.0m (2005: £1.0m). Sales of an  
add-on product to give legacy equipment additional GPS functionality were 
offset by a decrease in the sales of the core receiver equipment in advance 
of a product refresh in the coming year. We anticipate European sales increasing as 
the new products are accepted by the customers.
REST OF THE WORLD (‘ROW’)
Over the last year, we extended our geographic reach, particularly concentrating 
on the Middle and Far East. We are pleased to report that as a result 
of these efforts we quadrupled our sales within the RoW region to £1.0m 
(2005: £0.26m). During this ﬁnancial year we intend to build on this success, 
increasing both brand and product penetration.
MARKET DRIVERS
We continue to beneﬁt from the increase in spend in the defence and 
security industries following the recent major terrorist attacks in the US, 
UK and Indonesia, the continued spread of organised crime throughout 
the world and the current conﬂicts in the Middle East and Asia.
The Homeland Security (‘HLS’) & Homeland Defense (‘HLD’) Global Market 
Outlook 2006–2015 study reported that over the next ten years spending in 
homeland security and defence is forecast to grow at 12.1% per annum in the 
USA and 17 .2% per annum in the EU. Expenditure in emerging markets such 
as Middle and Far Eastern countries is expected to achieve even higher growth.
The United States Quadrennial Defense Review, published on 6 February 2006, 
clearly indicates a US Government commitment to the ongoing development 
of the Special Forces Operations in the ﬁght against terrorism.
Datong’s sophisticated and ﬁeld-proven products directly address this growing 
market dedicated to the ﬁght against terrorism and organised crime.
NEW NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
The Board is delighted to welcome Paul Lever as our Non-executive Chairman. 
As former chairman of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, Paul brings 
considerable industry knowledge and has already made a significant 
contribution to our activities. I would like to thank him for his assistance since 
he joined Datong on 9 September 2005.

STRATEGY FOR GROWTH 
It is our primary aim to continue to grow the business organically and we 
will consider bolt on acquisitions and new complementary technologies 
where appropriate. To this end we were pleased to sign a contract with 
the UTEK Corporation in June 2006 which will enable us to increase our 
networking capabilities within research establishments and universities relevant 
to our business around the world. We expect this arrangement to result in 
access to a greater range of new technological innovations than we could 
achieve by ourselves and to potential acquisitions.
We seek to maintain our leading position in each of our key geographies. 
In order to remain at the forefront of these markets, we will continue to 
invest in research and development and expand our product offering.  
We have a number of new products in development which are currently 
being funded by the new money raised on Admission to AIM. It is vital that 
we maintain our reputation for developing products that are robust, reliable 
and resilient and that precisely meet the needs of our customers. 
We have an active sales force and an established distributor network, 
but referrals and recommendations from existing customers also play a key 
role in developing new business. It is our policy to work closely alongside our 
most signiﬁcant customers and distributors during the product development 
stage, ensuring that even the most exacting speciﬁcations can be rigorously 
met. We have enjoyed close working relationships with some of our military 
customers for over 20 years.
In addition, we intend to target further funded research and development 
contracts as we believe there are signiﬁcant development budgets available 
in the US and UK which will assist us in fulﬁlling our growth strategy.
OUTLOOK
Datong’s sophisticated and ﬁeld-proven products directly address the rapidly 
expanding markets dedicated to the ﬁght against terrorism and organised 
crime. We are well placed to take advantage of these growth markets and 
our application of the various tracking technologies (radio frequency, GPS 
and GSM) alone or in combination allows us to develop products speciﬁcally 
for these different markets. This will ensure our future success.
It has been a period of signiﬁcant change for the Company since our 
Admission to the AIM market on 7 October 2005. The funds raised at that 
time will be used to expand the capabilities of our business, in particular in 
research and development, sales and enhancements to the manufacturing 
and test facilities in order to meet the challenges of our customers and their 
evolving needs in a rapidly changing world.
CURRENT TRADING
Current trading for the period since 1 April 2006 is in line with 
management expectations.

FINANCE REVIEW 
RESULTS
An analysis of revenue has been provided in the Chief Executive’s statement.
Operating profit before exceptional items was £1.2m (2005: £1.5m) 
as distribution and administrative costs increased by £0.3m as compared 
to the prior year. Distribution costs increased to £1.0m (2005: £0.8m) with 
administrative expense remaining constant at £1.5m. Distribution costs have 
increased as a result of the addition of three sales managers and the higher 
travel costs associated with the increased sales to the RoW. Administrative 
expenses have remained constant as the increase in establishment, IT support 
costs and professional fees of £0.2m, the additional costs associated with 
being a public company of £0.15m and the increased depreciation charge as 
a result of the increased investment in the capacity of the business of £0.1m 
have been offset by a decrease in the bonus payment to staff of £0.5m.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
During the year, the Group incurred two exceptional costs totalling £1.9m, 
detailed below: 
  Listing expenses of £0.6m
  The listing expenses of £0.6m contain all expenses relating to the Admission 
of the Company to AIM on 7 October 2005. In addition to this cost, placing 
commission of £0.2m was incurred at Admission but this has been 
deducted from the share premium account (see note 22 to the ﬁnancial 
statements) rather than through the proﬁt and loss account.
  Obligation arising from previous owners to management team of £1.3m
  The previous 100% shareholder of Datong had an undertaking to provide 
executive management shares in consideration for performance while 
the Company was under its ownership. Consequently 900,000 shares  
were issued on 30 September 2005 at a cost to the Company of £1.3m  
at the Admission price of £1.28 per share.
SUMMARY OF THE FINANCIAL REVIEW
Gross proﬁt 51.5%. 
Operating proﬁt £1.2m.

TAXATION
There is a Group tax credit of £93,000 this year (2005: charge of £416,000). 
There is a UK tax credit for the Company of £56,000 (2005: charge of £347 ,000) 
which has arisen due to the issue of shares to executive management and 
the fact that the Company is able to claim the research and development 
UK tax credit at the larger company rate of 25%. The large company status 
is a result of the Group being a subsidiary of a large group as at 1 April 2005. 
The overseas tax credit attributed to Datong Electronics Inc. was £37 ,000 as 
the company made losses this year.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The Group invested £0.5m in capital expenditure this year. Funding raised at 
the time of the Admission to AIM is being used to both expand and upgrade 
the research and development and production equipment. 
CASH FLOW AND FINANCING
The cash balances increased by £1.0m over the course of the year 
as detailed in the cash flow statement on page 23 to these financial 
statements. Although the operating proﬁt before exceptional items was 
£1.2m, the business generated £41,000 of cash from its trading operations 
before exceptional items. The principal cause of this cash requirement was 
the need to fund two research and development contracts totalling £1.1m. 
By the year end, £0.3m of these contracts had been invoiced. 
Additionally the business funded the payment of a special dividend to the 
previous 100% shareholder prior to Admission to AIM of £0.6m.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
In the year to 31 March 2006, 36% (2005: 62%) of the Group’s turnover 
was generated in US dollars. The Group, therefore, has signiﬁcant exposure 
to translation risk. The Group uses forward exchange contracts to manage 
this risk. In the year the effect of this exposure was a gain of £24,000 
(2005: gain of £58,000).
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Share-based payments under the Group’s Share Option Scheme have been 
accounted for under Financial Reporting Standard 20 which has resulted  
in a charge of £24,000. This charge has been included in administrative 
expenses for the year.
TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING 
STANDARDS (‘IFRS’)
As an AIM listed company, Datong will adopt IFRS for the year ending 
31 March 2008. The IFRS evaluation is ongoing but the main effect will be 
the capitalisation of research and development expenditure associated with 
commercially viable products and the subsequent amortisation of that asset 
over the product life cycle. Currently all research and development expenditure 
is written off to the proﬁt and loss account (as a cost of sale) in the year in 
which it is incurred.

ROBERT COHEN
CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law they have elected to prepare the Group and 
parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent company 
and of the proﬁt or loss for that year.
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
●  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue 
in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent 
company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Directors’ report includes that speciﬁc information presented in the operating and ﬁnancial review that is cross referenced from the business review section of the 
Directors’ report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. We read the 
Directors’ report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements within it.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant 
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
●  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s and the 
parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
●  the ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
●  the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2006 Datong Electronics PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. 
In these ﬁnancial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the ﬁrst time: 
● Financial Reporting Standard 20 ‘Share-based payments’;
● Financial Reporting Standard 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’; and
● Financial Reporting Standard 28 ‘Corresponding amounts’.
The accounting policies under these new standards have had no material effect on their adoption in both the current and prior year. Financial Reporting Standard 28 
‘Corresponding amounts’ has had no material effect as it imposes the same requirements for comparatives as hitherto required by the Companies Act 1985. 
The impact of Financial Reporting Standard 20 ‘Share-based payments’ is discussed under ‘Share Options’ on page 25.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2006. The acquisition 
method of accounting has been adopted. Under this method, the results of the subsidiary undertaking acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the 
consolidated proﬁt and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own proﬁt and loss account.
TURNOVER
Turnover is the amount derived from the provision of goods and services falling within the Company’s ordinary activities excluding Value Added Tax.
LONG TERM CONTRACTS
Contracts which are long term in nature are accounted for in accordance with Statements of Standard Accounting Practice 9. Revenue is recognised only to 
the extent that it is considered to be recoverable and the associated costs related with that revenue are transferred to cost of sales. Any work done not yet 
recognised as revenue is included in stock.
Amounts recoverable under long term contracts are included within debtors after deducting cash received on account. Where cash received on individual 
contracts is greater than the value attributed the difference is included within creditors. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Costs incurred in respect of research and development are written off in the year in which they are incurred.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of ﬁxed assets to their estimated residual values by instalments over their expected useful lives which 
are considered to be:
Plant and machinery – 3 and 5 years 
Motor vehicles – 5 years 
Freehold buildings – between 25 and 50 years 
Leasehold improvements – over period of the lease
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost.
TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes 
which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by Financial Reporting Standard 19.
STOCKS AND WORK IN PROGRESS
Stocks and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost where appropriate includes a proportion of work overheads. Provision 
is made for obsolete and slow moving stock.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Datong Electronics PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
SHARE OPTIONS
Share options granted are accounted for in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 20 under which a charge is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account based 
on the fair value (the economic value) of the grant, measured at the grant date. The charge is spread over the vesting period and may be subject to adjustment if the 
number of options or shares actually vesting differs from that assumed at the outset. The valuation methodology takes into account future share price volatility, future 
dividend yield, future risk-free interest rate, an estimate of the earnings per share and exercise behaviour and is based on the binomial lattice method. The ﬁnancial 
impact of this policy was a £24,000 charge in administrative expenses. There was no charge in the prior year as there were no outstanding options.
LEASE AND HIRE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS
Assets held under ﬁnance agreements that give rights approximating to ownership are treated as if they had been purchased outright at the present value  
of the total amount payable during the primary period of the agreements.
The corresponding ﬁnancial commitments are shown as creditors. The interest element of payments under these agreements and depreciation on the relevant 
assets are charged to the proﬁt and loss account.
The rentals arising under operating lease agreements are charged to the proﬁt and loss account over the terms of the agreements.
PENSIONS
The Group operates a series of personal plans administered by trustees independently of the Company. The Company’s contributions are determined by contractual 
arrangements referenced to the employees’ own contributions and are reﬂected in the ﬁnancial statements for the period in which they are paid.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.

10. LOSS FOR THE YEAR ATTRIBUTABLE TO DATONG ELECTRONICS PLC
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act, the proﬁt and loss account of the parent company is not presented separately as part of these ﬁnancial 
statements. The parent company’s loss after tax for the year ended 31 March 2006 was £479,000 (2005: proﬁt of £1,114,000).
11. LOSS PER ORDINARY SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year.
As a result of the Admission to AIM on 7 October 2005 there was a signiﬁcant re-structuring of the share capital of the Company to make it more suitable for 
a publicly traded company. Details of this are disclosed in note 20. In order that the earnings per share calculation below is more meaningful, the loss per share 
is based on the number of shares in existence since Admission to AIM rather than the weighted average. The comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2005 
are also based on this number.

ordinary shares of 0.5p each; and
●  the sum of £50,400 (standing to the credit of the revenue reserves of the Group) was capitalised, such sum being distributed to the holders of the issued 
ordinary shares (on the register at close of business on 6 September 2005), by paying in full 10,080,000 ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the proportion of 
84 new ordinary shares for every one ordinary share of 0.5p held on such date.

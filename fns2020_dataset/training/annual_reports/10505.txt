Introducing MoneySavingExpert.com
In September 2012, MoneySupermarket.com acquired 
MoneySavingExpert.com for consideration of up to £92.5m 
with an initial consideration of £65.5m paid on completion and 
deferred consideration of up to £27.0m payable dependent in 
part on the achievement of certain non-ﬁnancial performance 
criteria and in part at MoneySupermarket.com’s discretion.
MoneySavingExpert.com was founded in 2003 by personal 
ﬁnance journalist, Martin Lewis. It operates one of the leading 
UK based personal ﬁnance journalism websites, providing its 
users with free online access to a wide range of services and 
information related to saving money and personal ﬁnance 
including guides, tips, tools and techniques.
MoneySavingExpert.com’s website is complemented by features 
such as a weekly email newsletter, a user forum, and bespoke 
online tools. MoneySavingExpert.com also provides information 
on and promotes topical consumer focused issues such as 
reclaiming payment protection insurance.
It primarily derives revenue from the MoneySavingExpert.com 
website and weekly email newsletters through revenue-sharing 
arrangements with intermediary providers such as price 
comparison websites and, to a lesser extent, through direct 
arrangements with product providers.

For our customers
Times are tough out there for British households. Last 
year, we saved our customers £1 billion. It’s a huge 
amount, but we want even more people to save even 
more money and feel great with our help. We give more 
choice to our customers, helping them to save money on 
all of their household bills by providing a free, easy to use 
online service so they can search for a wide range of 
products in one place and ﬁnd the product most suited 
to their needs. Our size means we are able to offer our 
customers exclusive, market-leading deals, including 
some they can’t even get direct from providers.
For our providers
We offer our providers an efﬁcient and cost-effective way 
to reach considerable volumes of informed customers. 
Our customers, across all of our channels, are actively 
looking for products and are ready to purchase. This 
enables our providers to target their marketing spend in 
an effective, efﬁcient and completely measurable way, 
and allows them to reach a highly targeted audience.
Our revenue comes predominantly from fees paid to us 
by product providers when a customer clicks through to 
their website and purchases a product. It is a success-
based marketing fee.
We utilise our core strengths in 
digital marketing, managing data 
and building our brand to help both 
our customers and our providers to 
make the most of their money.

Our mission and strategy has served us 
well over the past four years. We call it 
our ‘house model’ and it’s on just about 
every wall of our offices. Our mission is 
to help every household make the most 
of their money. Looking ahead to 2013, 
we see no reason to change either our 
mission or our vision.
Strategic objective Progress Next steps
Best Shop
Be the easiest way for customers to shop 
for insurance, money, home services and 
travel products.
We continued our IT investment 
programme during 2012. The result is that 
we ﬁnished the year with ﬁve of our key 
shops being voted by an independent third 
party as the best shop compared to our 
competitors.
Our team are focused and resourced to 
move all of our core shops to the market 
leading position over the next 18 months.
Preferred Partner
Be the best way for our providers to 
acquire new customers.
Our independence and dedicated 
commercial teams have continued to 
build strong relationships with our 
providers during 2012. Our annual 
provider satisfaction survey shows that 
many of our providers are either satisﬁed 
or very satisﬁed with our service, 
particularly insurance providers.
As a business we constantly challenge 
ourselves to add value to our providers. 
In 2012 we built a new insight and data 
analytics team who we expect will build 
deeper relationships with our providers in 
2013 and beyond.
Data
Use data to help customers save more 
money.
We look after customer data for more than 
14m customers. We spent 2012 building a 
new insight and data analytics team who 
will be able to provide customers with 
money saving information targeted to 
their interests and needs.
We believe in putting customers in charge 
of their data. In 2013, we will further 
enhance the ability for customers to update 
all aspects of their data including contact 
preferences.
Build Brand
Be an everyday brand for our customers. MoneySupermarket.com is the most 
trusted brand in our category, something 
we are very proud of, and something we 
intend to preserve. In 2012, we welcomed 
MoneySavingExpert.com to our Group, 
a brand focused on ﬁghting the 
consumer’s corner.
The Group expanded its team of experts 
and journalists during 2012, with the single 
objective of writing more guides and 
content to help customers save more 
money in 2013. Our brands are now known 
for much more than just motor insurance, a 
theme we expect to continue during 2013.

2012 saw us introduce more information 
in our TV advertising campaigns about 
the different ways we can help our 
customers save money on their 
household bills. We kicked off the year 
with our ‘Vegas’ campaign, where the 
hero, ‘Brian’ saved on everything from 
energy to credit cards, before ending the 
year with ‘Gary’, as the £1,000 man who 
managed to save £1,000 on all his 
household bills.
‘You’re so MoneySupermarket’
Our brand building activity 
ensures that more customers 
visit us to save money than any 
of our competitors.
“ In 2012, by using 
MoneySupermarket.com, British 
households saved £1 billion. That’s a 
huge amount of money, and something 
our customers should feel very proud 
of. We want to celebrate just how good 
it feels to save in these tough times.”
Our advertising and public relations activity builds 
brand recognition and brand trust with our customers 
so that more people know they can save money on 
their household bills with us and trust us to help them 
make those savings. 
You’re So MoneySupermarket
In 2012, we continued to celebrate the amazing feeling 
you get when you save money, with our ‘You’re So 
MoneySupermarket’ campaign. We evolved the campaign to 
focus on more than motor insurance, showing the UK that we 
can help them save money on a wide range of their household 
bills. Times are pretty tough right now for families in the UK 
and comparing the cost of household bills can make a real 
difference to every day family budgets.
Public relations – building trust in our expertise
Our public relations campaigns ensure that our expert 
spokespeople are regularly on TV, online and in the 
newspapers, helping our customers to make the most of 
their money. This helps to build trust in our brand and 
position MoneySupermarket.com as the go-to destination 
for all of our customers’ money saving needs. In 2012, 
MoneySupermarket.com was in the news more than 3,000 
times, and was on the broadcast airwaves talking about 
money saving issues for more than 40 hours in total.  14 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Chairman’s Statement
2012 has been another year of solid progress for the Group. 
We continued to invest heavily in our brand, our marketing, 
our site and our people. The strong ﬁnancial results reﬂect 
this commitment and the consistency with which we have 
followed and executed our strategy. This will remain 
unchanged in 2013.
Results and strategic progress
2012 was another good year for the Group as revenue 
increased by 13% from £181.0m to £204.8m and adjusted 
EBITDA increased by 26% from £52.5m to £66.5m. Our largest 
verticals, Money and Insurance, delivered solid growth during 
the year with revenue in the Money vertical increasing by 9% 
from £52.6m to £57 .4m and revenue in the Insurance vertical 
increasing by 17% from £102.7m to £120.4m.
Together with the signiﬁcant growth achieved in our Home 
Services vertical and the return to growth of our Travel vertical 
in the second half of the year, these results demonstrate the 
continuing strength and diversity of our business model.
The Group also completed its ﬁrst major strategic acquisition 
with the purchase in September of MoneySavingExpert.com 
for consideration of up to £92.5m. MoneySavingExpert.com 
operates one of the leading personal ﬁnance journalism 
websites and their principal activity is the provision of 
consumer information in relation to saving money and 
personal ﬁnance. It has a very strong brand and its strategy of 
helping the consumer ﬁrst complements the Group’s strategy 
of ‘helping every household to make the most of their money’. 
During 2012 we continued to make signiﬁcant investments in 
our marketing strategy, including the strengthening of our 
digital marketing capability and the continuation of our ‘You’re 
So MoneySupermarket’ advertising campaign, both of which 
helped to drive visitor growth to the Group’s websites. We 
have continued the ‘You’re So MoneySupermarket’ theme in 
the early part of 2013 with the launch of our latest advertising 
campaign demonstrating how we continue to help our 
customers save money on their household bills.

Dividend
Having reviewed the cash required by the business and the 
performance of the Group, the Company paid an interim 
dividend of 1.8p per ordinary share on 14 September 2012. 
This represented an increase of 20% on the interim dividend 
(excluding the special dividend) paid in 2011 and is consistent 
with the Company’s progressive dividend policy. 
During the year, the business continued to generate 
cash, and, despite the completion of the acquisition of 
MoneySavingExpert.com where the Group paid £35.0m in 
cash on completion, we ended the year with cash balances 
of £18.7m. With the business growing, the Board is 
recommending a ﬁnal dividend of 3.94p per ordinary share, 
representing an increase of 30% on the ﬁnal dividend in 2011.
This is consistent with the Company’s progressive dividend 
policy and is a statement of the Board’s conﬁdence in the 
Company’s earning progression in the year ahead. If 
approved by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, this will bring the total dividend for the year to 5.74p 
per ordinary share and will be paid on 26 April 2013 to all 
shareholders on the register at 22 March 2013.
Outlook
The new year has begun positively and, whilst we remain 
alert to the continuing uncertainty in the wider economic 
environment, including the impact of the ‘Funding for Lending’ 
scheme on our Money business, we are conﬁdent that we will 
continue to grow in 2013. Our great brands, including 
MoneySavingExpert.com, strong market positions, experienced 
people and scale are the basis on which our business is built 
and will remain key strengths in the coming year.
Governance and the Board
Since the Group listed on the London Stock Exchange in 
2007, our Board and executive governance structures have 
continually developed and improved. We believe that good 
governance reduces risk and adds value to the business.
As such, the Board is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and supports the principles laid  15 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Gerald Corbett  
Chairman 16 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Business Overview Business Review
2012 has been a good year for MoneySupermarket.com.
We saved British households £1 billion in 2012. That’s over 
£200 for each of the one in ﬁve British households who 
purchased a product through MoneySupermarket.com last 
year. We are proud of having achieved the goal we set 
ourselves back in 2009.
Much has happened since I joined the business in 2009. 
Reassuringly, our strategy hasn’t needed to change and our 
market continues to grow as more and more customers gain 
the conﬁdence to shop for insurance, ﬁnancial, travel and 
home services products online. I see no reason to expect 
this trend to change in the future.
Our business philosophy is the foundation of everything we do:
 Be the easiest way for our customers to shop for products 
 Be the best way for our providers to acquire new customers
It is against this that I look back and summarise our 
achievements during 2012.
At the heart of our business lies the curiosity of how to help 
more families save more money by shopping online to 
reduce their household bills and make the most of their 
money.
Marketing plays a major role in attracting more visitors to our 
site. But it is the site design, the expert content, the 
presentation of product options and features, and the ease 
of navigation that really makes the difference in helping 
customers ﬁnd the right product for them and then clicking 
through to purchase from the provider.
Therefore in 2012 we invested an additional £6m to 
accelerate our IT development programme as part of our 
‘Best Shop’ strategy. Credit cards was the ﬁrst channel to 
be launched on the new platform. This proved the platform’s 
capabilities and robustness. A key advantage is the new 
platform delivers each channel automatically as a mobile 
friendly service, no matter what device a customer is using. 
We can now retire old legacy infrastructure and simplify our 
more insight/ more  
opportunity/more innovation/
IT operation while improving the shopping experience for 
our customers.
Our technology investments have also supported our 
relationships with providers. Having consolidated our 
customer information into a single customer view and built 
a new analytics team around the data, we can now 
understand customer trends and behaviour in greater detail. 
This will ensure we can tailor our services to our customers 
in a more targeted manner and help our providers gain 
unique insights into our customers. This is an example of 
how we challenge ourselves to add value to the service we 
deliver to our providers.
To help more customers make the best and most informed 
decision possible about which products to purchase, we 
expanded our team of expert content writers, thereby 
increasing the quantity and quality of help and guidance on 
our site. We have also expanded our telephone support 
service hours and introduced live chat. This is all part of our 
strategy to make MoneySupermarket.com the easiest way 
for customers to understand, research and purchase what 
are often complex products.
Marketing is vital for telling people about our brand and that 
most households can save over £1,000 a year by spending a 
small amount of time switching their insurance, energy and 
banking services. This message was delivered by our 
successful ‘Vegas’ and ‘£1000 Man’ TV campaigns of 2012, 
extending our brand proposition beyond motor insurance.
We were still able to grow revenues by 13% while holding 
our TV brand advertising spend broadly ﬂat in 2012, thanks 
to the investment made in 2011 and 2012 in building a world 
class digital marketing team. Our digital experts have 
managed to make our paid search with Google work much 
harder in 2012 than in previous years, while retaining 
important leadership positions in Google’s organic search 
across our core channels. This demonstrates the expertise 
of our team given that Google continues to change and 
evolve its search algorithms at an ever increasing pace.

continued investment and development.
Our biggest investment for growth in the year was the 
acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com in September. I am 
impressed by the tenacity of the MoneySavingExpert.com 
team, who, week after week, search for the best deals and 
ﬁll their site and weekly email with fantastic money saving 
tips. Over 7m people subscribe to the weekly email, which 
is the best endorsement of the team’s focus on ﬁghting the 
user’s corner. New services have already been launched by 
the team. For example, in response to the escalation of energy 
prices in the UK, MoneySavingExpert.com has launched its 
unique energy help tool: Cheap Energy Club. Users sign up to 
the club and in return will be offered the best energy rates 
available on the market, plus an ongoing personalised service 
that will track all tariff and price movements, regularly informing 
users of the best deals.
2012 has been a good year for the Group and most 
importantly, a good year for our customers, who between 
them have saved over £1 billion.
Looking forward to 2013, I see no reason to change our 
strategy. It has served us well for the last four years and, 
having performed our annual strategic review, I am 
conﬁdent it will serve us well for the next three years:
 Our shop must continue to lead the market as voted by 
customers
 Our providers must continue to rate 
MoneySupermarket.com as their preferred partner
 Our data insights will add value to our providers and 
support a personalised customer service
 Our brand must remain the most trusted by customers 
to save money on their household bills 18 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Business Overview Business Review
Chief Executive’s Report continued
The strength of MoneySupermarket.com as a business is 
the breadth of services we offer customers. As we have 
seen over the last four years, different years have different 
dynamics, but as a whole, the Group’s diversity is its great 
strength.
Motor insurance is our largest channel. Motor insurance 
policy premiums ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly during 2012. There is 
no real structural solution on the horizon to curb increasing 
prices during 2013 and beyond. The Ofﬁce of Fair Trading 
(‘OFT’) studied the private motor insurance market in 2011 
and referred it to the Competition Commission for further 
investigation in September. It was encouraging to see that the 
outcome of the OFT study acknowledged the positive role 
price comparison services had brought to customers. 
However, one of the key drivers of price increases, that of 
escalating personal injury claims, has not yet been fully 
addressed but is being considered by the Ministry of Justice. 
There is no obvious simple solution.
Our Money business however is in for a more challenging 
2013. The Government’s ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme has 
had a negative impact on the country’s savers by reducing 
the competition for bank deposits. Easy access savings 
rates are at their lowest rate for ﬁve years at around 2% 
compared to rates greater than 3% a year ago. Most 
forecasters believe this scheme will continue well into 2013.
 
However, for borrowers, 2013 is shaping up to be a good 
year with credit cards and personal loans starting the year 
competitively. A 24 month 0% interest rate credit card is now 
available and personal loans are at their cheapest rates for 
over 10 years, at 5.1%.
Rising energy costs are not only becoming a big issue for 
British households, but they became a political issue in 
2012. Average energy prices rose by 17% during 2012. While 
the Government strives to meet challenging renewable 
energy generation targets by 2020, it is unlikely that these 
rising prices will slow. Government initiatives to reduce tariff 
complexity might go some way to help. However, most of 
the biggest savings to be made by our customers are by 
switching to online monthly direct debit tariffs and then by 
changing energy provider, with varied launch dates and 
durations of ﬁxed price tariffs making a difference. With door 
to door sales of energy now banned we see online energy 
switching as a major opportunity for customers to save 
money on their household bills.
My conﬁdence in looking ahead comes from the security of 
having a great team at the MoneySupermarket.com Group. 
Our recruitment this year has been extensive, from customer 
service staff to data analysts. We invest in the best people we 
can ﬁnd and give them the infrastructure investment and 
support to thrive and pioneer. I am delighted to welcome the 
165 new members of our team who joined last year, including 
two new executives: Kenny Jacobs, our Marketing Director, 
and Vic Darvey, our Director of New Business and Travel.
We have much more to do in 2013. However, we are on 
the right track, we have a great team and we have the 
right strategy.
My thanks to all our customers and providers for their 
support during 2012. As a group, we look forward to saving 
more people, more money in 2013.

Notes
Basis of Preparation
The results show the trading results for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 
31 December 2011. The following adjustments have been made in arriving at 
adjusted EBITDA:
1 Amortisation of Intangible Assets

Company prior to listing gave rise to £207.2m of intangible assets. These will be 
written off over a period of 3-10 years with a charge of £23.0m expensed in both 
2012 and 2011.
 
and a sole trader business from Martin Lewis (together ‘MSE’) on 
21 September 2012 by the Group gave rise to £12.9m of intangible assets. 
These will be written off over a period of 3-10 years with a charge of £0.5m 
included within 2012 (2011: nil).

gave rise to £6.1m of intangible assets. These were to be written off over a 
period of 3-10 years with a charge of £0.7m in both 2012 and 2011.

related intangible assets.
2 Impairment of Intangible Assets, and adjustments to deferred 
consideration, related to aquisitions in prior periods

comprised a number of direct match domain names. The acquisition gave rise to 
£6.1m of intangible assets which were to be written off over a period of 3-10 years 
and £2.2m of goodwill. During 2011, the Group reassessed how much of the 
contingent consideration related to the FSN acquisition it expected to become 
payable based on the then current forecast. As a result the Group recognised a credit 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2011 of £2.2m. In light of 
this, the Group also performed an impairment review of FSN’s assets and identiﬁed 
an impairment charge of £2.2m relating to goodwill which was also recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2011.
 At the end of 2012, the Group has again assessed the expected trading performance 
of FSN, taking into account the impact of the lower importance that direct match 
domain names now have in natural search algorithms. Consequently the Group 
has recognised an impairment charge of £4.4m in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in relation to its intangible assets, being the net book value 
of those assets as at the end of 2012. In addition, in light of the trading performance 
referred to above, the Group has also reassessed the amount of contingent 
consideration that it expects to become payable, and as a result, has recognised 
a credit of £0.2m in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 20 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Deals Limited (‘LDD’) for an initial consideration of £1m, rising to a total 
consideration of up to £11m payable on the third anniversary of its acquisition 
depending on the achievement of certain ﬁnancial targets. 

of the trading performance the Group has performed a review of the carrying 
value of goodwill (£0.6m) identiﬁed upon the acquisition of LDD. As a result of 
this review the Group has recognised an impairment charge of £0.6m (2011: nil) 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period. The 
Group has also performed a review of the value of contingent remuneration 
held on its balance sheet that may have become payable to the vendors of the 
business at the end of the earnout period. As a result of this exercise the Group 
has lowered its estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration that will be 
payable to nil. Consequently, having recognised a charge for £0.1m in the prior 
period, a credit of £0.1m (2011: nil) has been included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the current period.

a portion of the technology related intangible assets.
3 VAT recovery

 The Group received written notiﬁcation in June 2011 that it had been successful 
in challenging the VAT treatment of the supply of certain of its lead services. 
Following a ruling received in March 2008 from HMRC the Group had treated 
the supply of its lead services as a standard rated supply for VAT purposes 
rather than as an exempt supply that the Group believed to be correct. £3.1m is 
deducted from statutory proﬁt in 2011 representing the amount of the total 
credit received that related to periods prior to 2011.
 In July 2012 the Group reached agreement with HMRC that enabled it to apply a 
new method to determine the proportion of VAT it was able to recover on expenses 
it incurred. The Group recognised a net credit of £10.6m in its Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income representing the total value of the beneﬁt 
to the Group from 1 April 2008 to 31 December 2012. All amounts owing by 
HMRC relating to the claim had been received by the Group by the year end. 
 The Group has included within adjusted EBITDA in 2012 and 2011 that proportion of 
the credit received that relates to 2012 and 2011 being £4.5m and £1.9m respectively 
to present the results on a consistent basis. As a result of this adjustment the 
previously reported adjusted EBITDA for 2011 has been increased by £1.9m.
4 Costs incurred relating to acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012

incurred charges in connection with the acquisition of £0.5m. These were 
added back in calculating adjusted EBITDA in 2011. 
 Group incurred £3.4m of costs in 2012 and £1.1m in 2011 relating to the 
acquisition. These have been added back in calculating adjusted EBITDA in 
2012 and 2011. As a result of this adjustment the previously reported adjusted 
EBITDA for 2011 has been increased by £1.1m.
5 Contingent Payable
 MSE
 The Group has recognised an administrative expense relating to deferred 
consideration which is linked to continued employment in its Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2012 of £2.3m relating to the 
employment of an individual within administrative expenses. 
Reference is made in the Overview and Financial Highlights sections to adjusted 
revenues, adjusted gross margin, adjusted cost base, and adjusted distribution and 
administration expenses. These measures represent the revenue generated and costs 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, less intangible 
amortisation, adjustments relating to VAT recoveries, costs incurred in relation to 
acquisitions made in 2011 and 2012, costs recognised in respect of deferred 
consideration relating to acquisitions and the write down of investments made in prior 
periods, referred to above.
Overview
We present a strong set of ﬁnancial results for the year ended 
31 December 2012. Adjusted revenue for the year increased by 
15% to £204.8m (2011: £178.5m), generating adjusted EBITDA 
which was 26% higher at £66.5m (2011: £52.5m). This included 
external revenues of £1.8m and EBITDA of £2.8m respectively, 
resulting from the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com (‘MSE’) 
described below, which was acquired on 21 September 2012.
During 2012 the Group has continued to see good growth. 
Trading during the second half of the year improved relative to the 
comparable ﬁrst half performance in the Insurance, Home 
Services and Travel verticals. Revenues in the Money vertical 
however were broadly ﬂat in the second half of the year as savings 
revenues declined as a result of the introduction of the Bank of 
England’s ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme, which enables ﬁnancial 
institutions to seek low cost funding centrally rather than through 
retail deposits from the consumer markets.
The Group acquired MSE on 21 September 2012 for a total 
consideration of up to £92.5m including deferred consideration of 
up to £27.0m. The MoneySavingExpert.com brand is recognised 
in the UK as the trusted brand to help consumers ﬁnd the very 
best deals available in a number of different areas and sits very 
much in line with the Group’s stated ambition of helping every 
household make the most of their money. Trading since 
acquisition has been strong.
Consistent with prior years the Group has continued to invest in 
its technology platforms and its brand. The Group capitalised 
£3.5m in 2012 investing in platforms that will enable the Group 
to more readily deploy changes to its website and replace some 
of the legacy technology that exists today. This will increase 
ﬂexibility and lower the cost of ownership, and builds upon the 
investments made in 2011 which improved the Group’s data 
acquisition capabilities. The Group expects this investment to 
continue through 2013.
Distribution costs were only 2% ahead of 2011. The Group 
launched the ‘You’re So MoneySupermarket’ campaign in the 
second half of 2011 and continued to run a number of iterations 
during 2012, including the launch of the £1,000 household 
savings message in the second half of the year which helped 
drive up visitor numbers and revenues. Supporting its ofﬂine 
marketing efforts the Group has also invested in key skill sets in 
online marketing, particularly digital marketing and analytics. 
This helped continue to increase marketing efﬁciencies and 
improve operating margins.

Business Overview Business Review
Financial performance
Adjusted Group revenue increased by 15% to £204.8m 
(2011: £178.5m) and adjusted EBITDA increased by 26% to 
£66.5m (2011: £52.5m). Excluding the contribution from MSE 
from the date of acquisition (21 September 2012) adjusted 
revenues increased by 14% to £203.0m (2011: £178.5m) and 
adjusted EBITDA increased by 21% to £63.7m (2011: £52.5m). 
The Group saw solid revenue growth in its Insurance, Money and 
Home Services verticals, whilst Travel revenues were broadly 
ﬂat. Trading improved in the second half of the year in Home 
Services and Travel whilst Insurance traded well throughout the 
year. Revenues in the Money vertical which were 19% ahead in 
the ﬁrst half were broadly ﬂat in the second half of the year.
Group adjusted gross margins increased from 71.9% to 74.1%. 
The Group increased its proportion of direct to site revenues to 
69% (2011: 67%) partly as a result of the acquisition of MSE which 
from the date of acquisition has been classiﬁed as direct to site 
revenues, having previously been classiﬁed as portal partner 
revenues. Had the Group owned MSE from 1 January 2012 
direct to site revenues would have represented 74% of revenues. 
Paid search continued to represent 22% of revenue in the year 
(2011: 22%).
Adjusted administrative and distribution costs increased by 
12% from £75.9m to £85.3m. Distribution expenses increased 
by 2% to £30.5m with marginally higher spends on creative and 
media costs. Adjusted administrative costs increased by 17% 
from £49.9m to £58.4m in 2012. Adjusted staff costs (including 
contract resource) were 18% higher at £35.4m. Headcount 
increased from 439 to 529 from December 2011 to December 
2012, as the Group increased its resources in digital marketing 
and analytics as it continues to drive more efﬁciency from its 
marketing investments; in addition the acquisition of MSE added 
a further 45 heads to the Group headcount.
Other administrative costs, including irrecoverable VAT, increased 
by £3.4m, the largest part of which related to the implementation 
of a number of digital marketing solutions to support the Group’s 
online marketing efforts. As noted above, the Group reached 
agreement with HMRC relating to the methodology used to 
calculate the proportion of VAT that it can recover on expenses it 
incurs. This lowered the irrecoverable VAT charge by £4.5m in 2012 
and £1.9m in 2011 compared to the previous method used by the 
Group. The Group has restated its adjusted administrative costs in 
2011 to present the results on a consistent basis.
Adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 29.4% to 32.5% 
against the same period last year. Excluding MSE, Group 
EBITDA margins would have been 31.4%.

Money vertical were 15% higher than last year.
The Group saw growth across its credit business and more 
generally from other banking products, particularly savings, 
which performed very strongly in the ﬁrst half of the year. 
Revenues from credit products, deﬁned as secured and 
unsecured loans, credit cards, pay day loans, debt solutions and 
mortgages (excluding impression based advertising) were 6% 
ahead of last year whilst non-credit products grew by 17%. 
Revenues in the second half of the year in the savings channel 
were markedly lower than the same period last year, particularly 
in the fourth quarter of the year. Revenues were impacted by 
lower competition for retail deposits among ﬁnancial institutions, 
many of whom sought low cost funding from the Bank of 
England’s ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme rather than through the 
retail deposits market.
Other revenue, which includes revenue from the sale of leads 
through PAA, commission based sales through SAS for 
mortgages and loans, and advertising revenue, declined by 
approximately £0.7m, or 16%, over the year. The Group has, 
consistent with prior periods, continued to focus upon improving 
its click based offering encouraging consumers to click through 
and transact with providers rather than through its lead 
businesses or through advertising.
Insurance
The Insurance vertical offers customers the ability to search for 
and compare insurance products such as breakdown, dental, 
home, life, medical, motor, pet and travel insurance, amongst 
other things. It also includes elements of the Group’s leads

being motor, home, travel and life insurance, with motor 
continuing to perform particularly strongly. 
Visitors increased by 14% over the period driven by both 
effective online and ofﬂine marketing campaigns.

Trading within the Travel vertical improved throughout the course 
of the year quarter on quarter, relative to the same period last 
year. Revenues in the second half of the year were approximately 
5% ahead of the same period last year. Package holidays 
revenue improved substantially in 2012 as the technology 
investments made in 2011 bedded in and the site was continually 
optimised to improve the user experience. Car hire revenues also 
held up well. Revenues from ﬂights and hotels were weaker year 
on year continuing to reﬂect lower consumer demand, although 
improvements made to the hotels channel in the second half of 
the year helped boost revenues.
The Group has demonstrated that investments in technology in the 
Travel vertical can signiﬁcantly improve revenues and continues to 
see good opportunities for future growth in the Travel business.
Other revenue, representing impression based advertising, fell by 
25% as, consistent with the rest of the business, management 
reduced the amount of real estate available for advertising.

Revenue in the Home Services vertical increased by 24% from 
£9.2m to £11.4m in the year. Visitors increased by 12%. 
Revenues from utilities, which is the largest channel in the 
vertical, were particularly strong in the second half of the year as 
utilities prices increased, driving an increase in switching 
volumes. The increase in utilities revenue relative to other 
sources of revenue in the Home Services vertical increased RPV 
in the period.
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
The Group acquired MSE on 21 September 2012. MSE 
generated £3.9m in revenues for the Group of which £2.1m 
related to revenues also recognised within MoneySupermarket.com, 
from trafﬁc referred to it from MSE. MSE contributed £2.8m to 
Group EBITDA since it was acquired.
Trading trends have largely reﬂected those experienced by 
MoneySupermarket.com with revenues from money products, 
particularly savings, being challenged whilst revenues from 
utilities switching were buoyant, aided by a number of the major 
providers raising their prices during the fourth quarter. 
Overall the MSE business has performed well since acquisition 
and is well placed, with support from the wider Group, to 
continue to grow its customer base.
VAT
In the ﬁrst half of 2011 the Group reached agreement with HM 
Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) that a number of its income 
streams had been classiﬁed incorrectly by HMRC as standard 
rated supplies rather than exempt. The Group recognised a one 
off credit of £3.5m in the ﬁrst half of 2011 within its statutory 
numbers of which £3.1m related to prior periods. 24 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Business Overview Business Review
Financial and Business Review continued
In July 2012, the Group received formal approval from HMRC for 
the use of a new VAT recovery method. The Group had ﬁled claims 
dating back to 1 April 2008. The claims were settled in December 
2012 and the Group has consequently recognised a credit of 
£10.6m in its Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income of 
which £4.5m relates to the year ended 31 December 2012 and 
£1.9m to the year ended 31 December 2011. These amounts have 
been included in adjusted EBITDA in the respective periods.
Acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com, 
Local Daily Deals Limited and Financial Services 
Net Limited
On 21 September 2012 the Group acquired the trade and certain 
assets of MoneySavingExpert.com and a sole trader business from 
Martin Lewis for a total consideration of up to £92.5m including 
deferred consideration of up to £27 .0m. The initial consideration of 
£65.5m was settled by an upfront cash payment of £35.0m and 
£30.5m of equity represented by 22.1m shares in the Company. 
The deferred consideration is payable in part against the 
achievement of certain non-ﬁnancial metrics over a three year 
period and in part at the Board’s discretion. The deferred 
consideration will be settled on the third anniversary of completion.
The Group expects to be able to claim a corporation tax 
deduction of £20.0m over a ﬁve year period representing the tax 
effect of the amortisation of an element of the value of goodwill 
and intangible assets identiﬁed on the acquisition of the trade 
and assets of the sole trader business from Martin Lewis.
The MoneySavingExpert.com website offers free online content, 
which MoneySavingExpert.com has researched, on areas such as 
credit cards and loans, shopping, deals and vouchers, utilities and 
phones, banking and saving, travel and motoring, insurance, 
mortgages and homes, and income and family.
MoneySavingExpert.com’s offering includes a range of online tools, 
researched articles in respect of speciﬁc products, personal ﬁnance 
guides, weekly newsletter emails which are sent to subscribers, 
and online forums. Martin Lewis and the MoneySavingExpert.com 
website also provide information and promote topical consumer 
focused issues such as ﬁnancial education in schools and 
reclaiming payment protection insurance.
The business will be run separately for a period of at least 
three years according to an editorial code to ensure that 
MoneySavingExpert.com remains independent. The Board 
believes that the acquisition will help the combined Group reach 
a wider range of consumers, increase the proportion of revenues 
which are derived from direct to site sources and contribute 
signiﬁcantly to the Group’s goal of helping every household make 
the most of their money.
On 31 August 2011 the Group completed the acquisition of 51% 
of Local Daily Deals Limited (“LDD”) for an initial consideration of 
£1m, rising to a total consideration of up to £11m payable on the 
third anniversary of its acquisition depending on the achievement 
of certain ﬁnancial targets.
LDD owns and operates a website and technology platform 
that features discounted retail offers from local and national 
companies. The business has not performed in line with 
management expectations and following the acquisition of MSE 
referred to above the Group has decided to refocus its resources 
in supporting MSE. Consequently the Group has performed a 
review of the value of contingent remuneration held on its balance 
sheet. As a result of this exercise the Group has lowered its 
estimate of the fair value of the contingent payable, and 
consequently, a credit of £0.1m (2011: £0.1m charge) has been 
included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the period.
In light of the trading performance referred to above the Group 
has separately performed a review of the carrying value of 
goodwill identiﬁed upon the acquisition of LDD. As a result of this 
review the Group has recognised an impairment charge for the full 
amount of £0.6m (2011: nil) in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income in the period.
On 14 October 2010 the Group completed the acquisition of 
Financial Services Net Limited (‘FSN’) which owns and operates a 
number of websites in the Money and Insurance verticals for an 
initial consideration of £4.4m, rising to a total consideration of up 
to £8.8m payable over three years depending on the achievement 
of certain ﬁnancial targets and the conclusion of outstanding tax 
matters. 
Trading of the FSN business has been below management 
expectations. In 2011 the Group performed a review of the value 
of contingent consideration held on its balance sheet. As a result 
of this exercise the Group lowered its estimate of the fair value of 
contingent consideration that would have been payable from 
£2.4m to £0.2m, and consequently recognised a credit for £2.2m 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2011.
In light of the trading performance referred to above the Group 
separately performed a review of the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangible assets identiﬁed upon the acquisition of FSN. As a 
result of this review the Group also recognised an impairment loss 
of £2.2m in 2011 in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income in the period.
During 2012 the Group has again assessed the trading 
performance of FSN. At the end of 2012, performance had been 
impacted by the lower importance of direct match domain 
names in natural search algorithms. The Group has now 
refocused a number of its resources that were dedicated to the 
FSN business to supporting MSE. Consequently the Group has 
recognised an impairment charge of £4.4m in fully writing down 
its intangible assets. Alongside this, the Group also reviewed,  25 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

and subsequently reduced to £nil, the fair value of contingent 
consideration, and as a result has recognised a credit of £0.2m 
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Investment in HD Decisions
On 25 March 2011 the Group invested £1m in acquiring a 25% 
stake in HD Decisions Limited (‘HD’). HD provides credit decision 
support technology, which allows consumers to better 
understand the probability of being approved for a credit product 
before making a formal application for credit. This improves the 
user’s experience on the Group’s websites by matching 
consumers with credit products that they are eligible for and 
increases the number of relevant applications for individual 
providers which improves conversion. Importantly a credit 
footprint is not left on the consumer’s proﬁle at the point of initial 
enquiry. Furthermore providers are able to reduce the cost of 
credit searches at the application stage if consumers proceed 
to apply only for those credit products that are suited to their 
particular circumstances. The software is currently deployed to 
a portion of the Group’s credit cards and loans channel 
customers.
Cash balance and dividend
As at 31 December 2012 the Group had a cash balance  
of £18.7m. 
Having reviewed inter alia, the performance of the Group and 
the cash required by the business, the Board is recommending 
a ﬁnal dividend, subject to shareholder approval, in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2012 of 3.94p per ordinary share.
Together with the interim dividend of 1.8p per ordinary share paid 
on 14 September 2012, this gives a total ordinary dividend for 
the year of 5.7 4p per ordinary share (201 1: 4.53p), reﬂecting the 
Board’s conﬁdence in the ability of the business to generate cash 
on an ongoing basis.
The Board is committed to a progressive dividend policy, with 
ongoing monitoring of the appropriate capital structure.
The ex-dividend date for the ﬁnal dividend is 20 March 2013, 
with a record date of 22 March 2013 and a payment date of 
26 April 2013. Shareholders will have the opportunity to elect to 
reinvest their cash dividend and purchase existing shares in the 
Company through a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
Tax 
The Group tax charge of £6.7m in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income represents an effective tax rate of 
21.3% (2011: 31%). This is lower than the prevailing rate of 24.5% 
(2011: 26.5%) due to the impact of the reduction in the rate of 
corporation tax on the deferred tax liability.
In the future, the Group expects the underlying effective rate of 
tax to approximate to the standard UK corporation tax rate.
Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic statutory earnings per ordinary share for the year to 
31 December 2012 was 4.8p (2011: 3.3p). Adjusted basic earnings 
per ordinary share increased from 7 .1p to 9.1p per share. The 
adjusted earnings per ordinary share is based on proﬁt before tax 
after adding back intangible amortisation and goodwill impairment, 
the VAT recoveries relating to current and prior periods, costs 
incurred in relation to the acquisitions of Local Daily Deals Limited 
and MoneySavingExpert.com, credits relating to the reassessment 
of contingent consideration for Financial Services Net Limited and 
Local Daily Deals Limited, and costs related to the contingent 
consideration for MoneySavingExpert.com. A tax rate of 24.5% 
(2011: 26.5%) has been applied to calculate adjusted proﬁt after tax. 
Key contractual arrangements
MoneySupermarket.com Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, 
is party to contracts and other arrangements which the Directors 
judge are essential to the Group’s business.
As with any internet business the Group is dependent upon its 
ability to attract customers to its website either directly or through 
paid search or portal partners, and revenue generated from 
commercial arrangements with its providers.
The Group uses television advertising to attract customers to its 
website directly. The Group incurred costs of £26.0m (2011: £27 .0m) 
relating to television and other ofﬂine advertising in 2012. The Group 
has contracts with a number of media agencies to acquire 
advertising inventory from commercial television companies. The 
Group typically has a commitment of between 6 and 10 week’s 
expenditure at any one time. Television and other ofﬂine advertising 
costs represent 85% (2011: 90%) of distribution costs.
The Group uses search engines to acquire trafﬁc via paid search. 
The Group spent £39.4m (2011: £35.6m) on paid search in 2012. 
Although there are a number of search engines that operate in the 
UK, Google is the dominant search engine and accounts for the 
majority of the Group’s spend in this area. The Group has no 
forward commitment to search engines and manages its spend 
on a real time basis.
The Group has a number of contracts with providers which are 
based either on a cost per click basis or a cost per action basis or 
a hybrid of the two. It also has a number of commercial 
arrangements based on the number of page impressions served 
in the case of banner advertising. The Group does not consider it 
has any material contracts with providers in any one channel. The 
Group does however frequently deal with providers across a 
range of different channels managed under different contracts, 
often to different parts of the same organisation, and occasionally 
through third party media agencies. At this consolidated channel 
level, the largest individual provider represented approximately 4% 
(2011: 6%) of Group internet revenue in 2012. 26 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Business Review
Financial risks
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Signiﬁcant  
worsening  
in ﬁnancial markets
Financial institutions may reduce the quantum of 
lending and/or tighten their acceptance criteria for 
customers seeking to obtain credit. Financial 
institutions may reduce their reliance on the retail 
market to obtain funds or may have lower cost 
funds available from other sources including the 
Bank of England to support their business 
activities. Providers may increase their focus on 
customer retention rather than acquisition. These 
factors may reduce commissions available to price 
comparison websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers 
and to maximise the opportunities for providers to 
acquire customers in a cost effective manner.
Reduction  
of providers
Providers may consolidate, withdraw their 
products from price comparison websites or 
reduce their customer acquisition activity via  
price comparison websites. This may reduce 
competition for business, customer choice,  
Group revenue and the customer proposition  
of price comparison websites.
The Group continues to focus on building strong 
relationships with providers to ensure the Group is 
able to provide solutions to the needs of providers 
and to maximise the opportunities for providers to 
acquire customers in a cost effective manner.
Investment in  
new areas and/or 
signiﬁcant 
acquisitions
Signiﬁcant investments in new products  
and services or new geographies fail  
to make a return. Failure to generate anticipated 
revenue growth, synergies and/or cost savings 
from signiﬁcant acquisitions could lead to 
signiﬁcant goodwill and intangible asset 
impairments.
Investments in new areas typically leverage existing 
expertise and experience built up over many years. 
Capital requirements are relatively low and 
investment is managed in stages such that it is not 
ﬁnally committed until there is good visibility of a 
return. Signiﬁcant acquisitions are approved by the 
Board following pre-acquisition due diligence. 
Post-acquisition performance of signiﬁcant 
acquisitions is closely monitored to ensure 
corrective action can be taken in the event of 
deviations from expected performance.
Financial services  
and other markets 
regulation
The business model in ﬁnancial services  
or other lines of business may be  
compromised by changes to existing  
regulation or the introduction of new regulation.
The Group has a team of regulatory specialists 
who work with the business to ensure that it 
remains compliant with existing regulation and 
informed of impending regulation. The Group has 
embraced regulation to date and shares the vision 
of the regulators generally to make the market 
more transparent to the end customer.
Economic  
environment
Reduction in visitors and revenue from  
a recession as customers seek to reduce  
levels of discretionary expenditure.
The Group continues to focus on building a wide 
range of market leading services to meet 
customers’ needs. Customers seeking to reduce 
levels of discretionary expenditure will also be 
looking to obtain ‘best’ value from compulsory 
products and services. The diversiﬁcation of the 
Group both in the number of verticals that it 
operates in and the range of products and services 
it provides in each vertical should lessen the 
impact of a recession upon the Group although it 
cannot entirely mitigate against it.
The tables below summarise the material financial and operational risks to 
the Group and how the Group seeks to mitigate them in the day-to-day 
running of the business.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 27 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Business Overview Business Review
Operational risks
Risk area Potential impact Mitigation
Competitive 
environment
Loss of market share and erosion of margins  
from increased competition.
The Group continues to focus on building market 
leading products to improve its proposition to 
customers. This includes investment in customer 
retention tools and technology including CRM 
initiatives which deliver additional features and 
functionality to customers.
Brand perception  
and reputation
Reduction in customer loyalty with existing 
customers and an inability to attract new 
customers if the business fails to maintain its 
position as a leading price comparison website  
or if its reputation is negatively impacted by any 
event, such as the loss or misuse of customer 
personal data.
Continued investment in television advertising 
reinforced through press activity will maintain the 
Group in customers’ minds. Rigorous checking of 
the website through audit and review will maintain 
the accuracy of the information displayed. 
Rigorous use of internal controls and testing of the 
Group’s systems together with infrastructure 
investment will ensure the integrity and robustness 
of the Group’s systems.
Business continuity, 
capacity and 
functionality  
of IT and systems
Failure to provide adequate service levels to 
customers or maintain revenue generating 
services.
The Group maintains two separate data centres 
with n + 1 redundancy in relation to its core 
infrastructure to ensure that service is maintained 
in the event of a disaster at the primary data 
centre. Developed software is rigorously tested 
and the Group operates a robust release process 
which mitigates the likelihood of software being 
released into a live environment without being fully 
tested.
Loss of key 
management
Loss of key management resulting in a lack of 
necessary expertise or continuity to execute 
strategy.
Existing key management, new hires or 
management teams that are acquired through 
acquisitions are tied in through attractive equity 
and other incentive packages and rewarding 
career structures. In addition, succession plans 
have been developed or are being developed for 
key members of the management team (including 
through acquisitions) which are regularly reviewed.
Reliance on  
search engine  
natural listings
Reduction in gross margin through reduction  
in revenue derived from search engine  
optimisation activities.
The Group will continue to invest in sustainable 
search engine optimisation activities which adhere 
to search engine guidelines.
Changing customer 
behaviour
Reduction in customer loyalty with existing 
customers and an inability to attract new 
customers if the business fails to adapt to 
changing customer behaviour, such as the 
increasing use of mobile devices to access the 
internet, ‘apps’ and social media.
The Group continues to focus on building market 
leading products to improve its proposition to 
customers. The Group continues to engage with 
customers to understand any changes in the way 
they utilise the Group’s services. 28 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

The Board considers that the management of safety, health, 
environment, social and ethical matters forms a key element 
of effective corporate governance which in turn supports the 
strategy, long term performance and sustainability of the 
business. 
Communities and charities
The Group’s .Community initiative was launched in 2008 
and has continued to develop during 2012. The initiative is 
focused on providing support to charities located within a 
few miles of the Group’s ofﬁces in Ewloe and so support is 
targeted primarily in Flintshire and Cheshire.
A volunteer group of employees meet each month to review 
requests for donations from charities and to allocate funds 
according to agreed donation guidelines. Employees are 
also active in researching and seeking out local good 
causes that the Group can help support. The initiative has 
been effective at harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of 
the Group’s employees to beneﬁt the communities in which 
it operates.
In 2012 the Group made £2,000 per month available for the 
.Community initiative. This funding has been channelled via 
the Charities Aid Foundation, enabling the Group to make 
gross donations to registered charities.
Over the course of the year the Group has supported 44 
charities including:
 Green Pastures Homeless Charity
 Age Concern
 The North Wales Chrysalis Trust
 Alder Hey Children’s Charity
 Miles of Smiles
 Clwyd Special Riding Centre
 Shelter Cymru
In addition to the .Community initiative, the Group and its 
employees continue to select and support a Charity of the 
Year on an annual basis.

The 2012 Charity of the Year was the Alzheimer’s Society. 
The charity provides help and support to people affected 
by dementia. Over the course of the year the Group’s 
employees raised £12,357 for the Alzheimer’s Society with the 
Group also donating £12,357, bringing the total donated to the 
Alzheimer’s Society during the year to £24,714.
Employees have selected Mind as its 2013 Charity of the 
Year. The charity provides help and support to those 
affected by mental health problems.
The Group launched a volunteering scheme in October 2011 
through which the Group supports a total of 60 volunteering 
days per year to help those who are less fortunate, and 
thereby make a valuable contribution to our local community. 
During the year employees volunteered in a diverse range of 
activities including helping at an orphanage in Cambodia. 
Environment
The Group has established a team called the ‘Green Team’ 
which comprises a volunteer group of employees who meet 
regularly and whose aim is to reduce energy and raw 
material usage throughout the Group to support 
environmental and ﬁnancial performance.
The ‘Green Team’ have implemented a number of initiatives in 
2012 to support this aim including the installation of solar panels 
at the Group’s head ofﬁce resulting in energy savings of 
approximately 60,000kwh during 2012, the installation of energy 
efﬁcient lighting at the Group’s ofﬁces, and the continued 
replacement of PCs and printers with more energy efﬁcient 
models. The Group estimates that during 2012 it recycled on 
average over 50% of its commercial waste.
Employees
The Group actively encourages employee involvement and 
consultation and places considerable emphasis on keeping 
its employees informed of the Group’s activities via formal

health and safety policy which is communicated to all 
employees through a health and safety handbook, which is 
regularly reviewed and updated.
Supporting students
In order to build links between the Group and local schools 
and colleges, work experience and placements are offered 
to a number of students. In doing so, the Group strives to 
make work placements positive, challenging and relevant to 
participants’ current studies and their future job prospects.

The Group has formal ethics and anti-bribery policies which 
incorporate the Group’s key principles and standards

agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees providing for compensation for loss of ofﬁce or 
employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

to the delivery of long-term value to shareholders. The Group’s 
research and development expenditure is predominantly 
associated with computer and internet software systems. 
Successfully developed software is used to develop new 
products and to improve and extend the functionality and scope 
of the Group’s internet operations.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company, and the Group as a 
whole, have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Financial

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in 
respect of the Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
Company Financial Statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU  
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
Financial Statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the Group and Company Financial Statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently.
 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent.
 For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU.
 For the Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Company Financial Statements.
 Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report that 
complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
pursuant to Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
4.1.12
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are set out on 
pages 30 and 31 conﬁrms that, to the best of their knowledge:
 The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole.

Corporate Governance
Employees
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and uses a number of ways to engage with 
employees on matters that impact them and the performance of 
the Group. These include formal half yearly business 
performance updates by members of the executive 
management team for all employees, regular update brieﬁngs for 
all employees, regular team meetings, the Group’s intranet site 
which enables easy access to the latest Group information as 
well as Group policies, and the circulation to employees of 
results announcements and other corporate announcements. 
This also helps to achieve a common awareness amongst 
employees of the ﬁnancial and economic factors affecting the 
performance of the Group.
The Group has an established employee forum through which 
nominated representatives ensure that employees’ views are 
taken into account regarding issues that are likely to affect them. 
A robust employee engagement survey process is also in place to 
ensure that employees are given a voice in the organisation and 
that the Group can take action based on employee feedback.
All employees are able to participate in the Company’s Share 
Incentive Plan and Save As You Earn Scheme which gives 
employees the opportunity to purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company. This helps to encourage employee interest in the 
performance of the Group.
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
all employees without discrimination and applies fair and 
equitable employment policies which seek to promote entry into 
and progression within the Group. Appointments are determined 
solely by application of job criteria, personal ability, behaviour 
and competency.
Disabled persons
Disabled persons have equal opportunities when applying for 
vacancies, with due regard to their skills and abilities. Procedures 
ensure that disabled employees are fairly treated in respect of 
training and career development. For those employees becoming 
disabled during the course of their employment, the Group is 
supportive so as to provide an opportunity for them to remain 
with the Group, wherever reasonably practicable.
In the opinion of the Directors, all employee policies are deemed 
to be effective and in accordance with their intended aims.
Borrowings
During 2012 the Group arranged a £20m revolving credit facility 
to provide cash ﬂow for the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com. 
The largest amount drawn down during the period was £13m 
which was repaid in full before the end of 2012.
Financial risk management
It is the Group’s objective to manage its ﬁnancial risk so as to 
minimise the adverse ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnancial markets on the 
Group’s proﬁtability and cash ﬂow. The speciﬁc policies for 
managing each of the Group’s main ﬁnancial risk areas are set 
out in note 17 to the Group Financial Statements on pages 77 
and 78.
Political and charitable donations
During the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2012, the Group 
did not make any political donations (2011: £nil) and made 
charitable donations of £37,032 (2011: £37,454).
Creditor payment policy
It is Group policy to agree terms and conditions for its business 
transactions with suppliers. Payment is made in accordance 
with these terms provided the supplier meets its obligations. 
During the period the Group signed up to the Prompt Payment 
Code, a Government backed scheme which encourages the 
prompt payment of suppliers, the provision of clear guidance on 
payment policy to suppliers, as well as general best practice 
in this area. The average number of trade creditor days 
outstanding for the Group at 31 December 2012 was 41 days 
(2011: 48.8). The Company had no trade creditors at 
31 December 2012 (2011: nil).
Disclosure of information to auditors
The Directors who held ofﬁce at the date of this report conﬁrm 
that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
each such Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information, and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
Auditors
KPMG Audit Plc have indicated their willingness to accept 
re-appointment as auditors of the Company. A resolution 
proposing their re-appointment is contained in the notice of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and will be proposed to 
shareholders at that meeting.
Annual General Meeting

will be held at the Leverhulme Stand, Chester Racecourse, 
The Racecourse, Chester, CH1 2LY on Wednesday 17 April

By order of the Board
Darren Drabble 
Company Secretary  
4 March 2013 36 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors (‘Board’) of MoneySupermarket.com 
Group PLC (‘Company’) is committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and supports the principles laid down in 
The UK Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010 by 
the Financial Reporting Council (‘Code’). This Corporate 
Governance Report describes how the principles of the Code 
are applied by the Company and reports on the Company’s 
compliance with the Code’s provisions.
Compliance
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the 
provisions of the Code throughout the year ended 31 December 
2012 and to the date of this report except as set out below.
Board of Directors
The Board currently has eight members, comprising the 
Non-Executive Chairman, Gerald Corbett, three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, Michael Wemms, Rob Rowley and 
Bruce Carnegie-Brown, and four Executive Directors, Simon 
Nixon, Paul Doughty, Peter Plumb and Graham Donoghue. 
Michael Wemms has been designated as the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director.
The Board normally meets on at least eight occasions in each 
ﬁnancial year including a two day strategy conference. To enable 
the Non-Executive Directors to more freely discuss the 
performance of the Group’s management, the Chairman meets 
with the Non-Executive Directors at least once each year 
without the Executive Directors present.
The Board considers that all the Directors are able to devote 
sufﬁcient time to their duties as Directors. Biographies of the 
Board are set out on pages 30 and 31 including details of the 
signiﬁcant commitments of the Chairman. The Board is satisﬁed 
that these appointments do not conﬂict with the Chairman’s 
ability to carry out his duties and responsibilities effectively for 
the Group.
The Board has reviewed the recommendations of the Davies 
Report as part of a wider diversity discussion and has endorsed 
a Group wide Diversity Policy. The Board supports the aims, 
objectives and recommendations of the Davies Report and in 
line with the Code will continue to make Board appointments on 
merit, against objective criteria and with due regard for the 
beneﬁts of diversity on the Board, including gender.
Independence/Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors bring wide and 
varied commercial experience to Board and Committee 
deliberations. The practice of the Company is to appoint 
Non-Executive Directors for speciﬁed terms of three years, 
subject to a maximum of up to 12 months’ notice within that 
period and also subject to re-election and to Companies Act 
provisions relating to the removal of a Director. Each of the 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, currently 
holds a letter of appointment reﬂecting this.
The Board considers that Gerald Corbett was independent on 
appointment as Chairman and considers Michael Wemms, 
Rob Rowley and Bruce Carnegie-Brown to be independent, 
being independent in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, their judgement.
Con icts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association were amended at the 
2008 Annual General Meeting, in line with the Companies Act 
2006, to allow the Board to authorise potential conﬂicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as 
appropriate, when giving any authorisation. Any decision of the 
Board to authorise a conﬂict of interest is only effective if it is 
agreed without the conﬂicted Directors voting or without their 
votes being counted and in making such a decision, the 
Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will be 
most likely to promote the success of the Company.
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to appointment of any new 
Director or prior to a new conﬂict arising and for the regular 
review of actual or potential conﬂicts of interest. During the year, 
this procedure was adhered to and operated effectively.
Relationship Agreement
The single largest shareholder of the Company is Simon Nixon. 
The Company and Simon Nixon entered into a relationship 
agreement on 11 July 2007 to regulate the ongoing relationship 
between them (‘Relationship Agreement’). The principal purpose 
of the Relationship Agreement is to ensure that the Company is 
capable of carrying on its business independently of Simon 
Nixon, and that transactions and relationships with Simon Nixon 
are at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms.
The Company and Simon Nixon have agreed in the Relationship 
Agreement that Simon Nixon is entitled to appoint (such number 
including himself as a Director) one Non-Executive Director for 
as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 15% of the 
ordinary shares of the Company, two Non-Executive Directors 
for as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 30% of 
the ordinary shares of the Company and three Non-Executive 
Directors for as long as he holds the beneﬁcial interest in at least 
50% of the ordinary shares of the Company. The Relationship 
Agreement will terminate if Simon Nixon holds less than 15% of 
the ordinary shares of the Company.
The Relationship Agreement also includes a protocol to be 
observed in relation to any Non-Executive Director appointed by 
Simon Nixon to deal with potential conﬂicts of interest and the 
provision of conﬁdential information.
As at the date of this report, Simon Nixon had not appointed any 
Non-Executive Directors pursuant to his rights in the 
Relationship Agreement.
Division of responsibilities
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are not 
combined, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the head 
of the Company. The division of roles and responsibilities 
between the Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is clearly 
established, set out in writing and has been approved by the 
Board.

The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board, setting its agenda and monitoring its effectiveness. He ensures effective 
communication with shareholders and that the Board is aware of the views of major shareholders. He facilitates both the contribution 
of the Non-Executive Directors and constructive relations between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for the day to day running of the Group, carrying out agreed strategy and implementing 
speciﬁc Board decisions.
Role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the Group’s performance and meets regularly to review the operation and performance of the 
Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision making and matters delegated to Committees of the 
Board which are available on the investor relations section of the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. These include the 
Group’s strategy; business plan and annual budget; acquisitions and disposals; and other major investments and capital projects.
There is an established procedure for the preparation and approval each year by the Board of business plans and the annual budget. 
The Board receives reports on performance against the business plan and budget and reviews any signiﬁcant variances each time it 
meets. This information enables business performance to be monitored, evaluated, discussed and challenged where necessary and 
enables informed, sound decisions to be made. At least one of the Board’s regular meetings each year is devoted to reviewing and 
agreeing the Group’s strategic direction.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal Committees (Audit, Nomination and Remuneration) to which various matters are delegated. The 
Committees all have formal written terms of reference that have been approved by the Board and are published on the investor 
relations section of the Group’s website at www.moneysupermarket.com. They are also available in hard copy form on application to 
the Company Secretary.
Details of the work of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees are given in the reports of those Committees on  
pages 40 to 52.

Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that new 
Directors appointed by the Board must retire and submit 
themselves for election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment. The Company’s 
Articles of Association further require that all Directors must 
retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every three 
years. In accordance with the Code, all of the Directors will retire 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, 
will offer themselves for re-election.
The Company provides Directors’ and ofﬁcers’ insurance cover 
for the beneﬁt of Directors in respect of claims arising in the 
performance of their duties. The Company has also granted 
indemnities to each of its Directors and the Company Secretary 
to the extent permitted by law and its Articles of Association.
Board evaluation
The formal annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, 
its Committees and individual Directors was undertaken during 
the year. This consisted of an internally run exercise led by the 
Chairman with the assistance of the Company Secretary. The 
appraisal questionnaire used in connection with the process 
was wide-ranging and based on questions outlined in the Code, 
covering both Board and Committee performance. The Board 
considered that an internally run exercise was most appropriate 
in the current year but agreed annually to give consideration to 
whether an externally facilitated evaluation may be appropriate.
The appraisal output is used to identify strengths and 
development areas and conﬁrmed that the Board and its 
Committees were operating effectively. Individual performance 
was also appraised, based on one-to-one interviews with the 
Chairman, or in the case of the Chairman, with the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director following consultation  
with each of the other Directors.
Development
The Chairman and Company Secretary are responsible for 
preparing and co-ordinating an induction programme for newly 
appointed Directors, including business related presentations by 
senior management below Board level, as well as guidance on 
their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of the 
Company. Every Director has access to appropriate training as 
required following their appointment and is encouraged to 
develop their understanding of the Group.
Information
Board members are given appropriate documentation in a timely 
manner in advance of each Board or Committee meeting. This 
normally includes a detailed report on current trading and 
comprehensive papers on matters where the Board or 
Committee will be required to make a decision or give its 
approval. Speciﬁc business related presentations are given by 
senior management below Board level when appropriate.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed and providing 
advice to the Board on corporate governance. Both the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are matters 
for the Board as a whole.
Directors can, where they judge it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors, obtain independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. No such advice was sought 
by any Director during the year. Directors have the right to 
require that any concerns they may have are recorded in the 
appropriate Board or Committee minutes.
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining good 
communications with shareholders. Senior executives, including 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer regularly 
meet with analysts and institutional shareholders to keep them 
informed of signiﬁcant developments and to develop an 
understanding of their views which are discussed with the 
Board. Formal presentations are given to analysts and 
shareholders covering the full year and half year results and the 
Company seeks to maintain a dialogue with the various bodies 
which monitor the Company’s governance policies and 
procedures. The Company Secretary generally deals with 
questions from individual shareholders.
The results and results presentations, together with all 
information reported to the market via the regulatory information 
service, press releases and other shareholder information, are 
published on the investor relations section of the Group’s 
website at www.moneysupermarket.com to be viewed and 
accessed by all shareholders.
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, Michael 
Wemms, is available to shareholders if they have concerns 
which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer or Chief Financial Ofﬁcer has failed to resolve, 
or for which such contact is inappropriate.
All shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Chairmen of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees will be 
available to answer questions at that meeting. Shareholders may 
also contact the Chairman, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer or, if 
more appropriate, the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director to raise any issue with one or all of the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company.
The Company will prepare separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. The result of the vote on each resolution will be 
published on the Group’s website after the Annual General 
Meeting and will be announced via the regulatory information 
service.

Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management are:
 A comprehensive annual business planning and budgeting 
process, requiring Board approval, against which the Group’s 
actual performance and any signiﬁcant variances are 
regularly reviewed by the Board.
 A schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s approval to 
ensure it maintains control over appropriate strategic, 
ﬁnancial, organisational, compliance and capital investment 
issues.
 An organisation structure with clearly deﬁned lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority.
 Regular reviews of the key risks facing the Group to ensure 
key risks are being identiﬁed, evaluated and appropriately 
managed, having regard to the balance of risk, cost and 
opportunity. The management of risk is undertaken by the 
Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer, which reviews the Group risk register at least twice 
each year, and reports its ﬁndings to the Audit Committee.
 An annual two day strategy conference to discuss and 
approve the Group’s strategic direction, plans and objectives 
and the risks to achieving them.
 An internal audit function providing assurance over key risks, 
processes and controls.
In addition, the Audit Committee receives:
 Reports from the external auditors in relation to the Financial 
Statements and the material ﬁnancial reporting judgements 
contained in them.
 Reports from the internal and external auditors in relation to 
the system of internal control and the reviews by the internal 
and external auditors of that system.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management during 
the year. The Board considers that in the context of the control 
environment described above, the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management is effective and satisfactory.
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 32 and 33.
Compliance with the Code
The Directors consider that during the ﬁnancial year ended 
31 December 2012 and to the date of this report, the Company 
complied with the Code except as follows:
B.1.2 – During the year at least half the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, did not comprise Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board has commenced a process to appoint an 
additional Non-Executive Director which it expects to conclude 
during 2013.
E.1.1 – As a result of regular feedback provided to the Board by 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer following 
their dialogue with major shareholders, the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director believes he is aware of the views of 
major shareholders. Unless requested by major shareholders, 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director does not attend 
meetings with them.

Corporate Governance
The Audit Committee presents a separate report in relation to the 
ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2012.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the four Non-Executive 
Directors, Rob Rowley (Chairman), Gerald Corbett, Michael 
Wemms and Bruce Carnegie-Brown. Rob Rowley, Michael 
Wemms and Bruce Carnegie-Brown are considered by the Board 
to be independent. Gerald Corbett was considered by the Board 
to be independent on appointment. Biographies of the members 
of the Audit Committee are set out on pages 30 and 31. Rob 
Rowley is a qualiﬁed accountant and was formerly ﬁnance 
director of Reuters plc and chairman of the audit committee at 
Prudential plc. He is currently chairman of the audit committees at 
Intu Properties plc and Taylor Wimpey plc. The Board is satisﬁed 
that Rob Rowley has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
Operation of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee met on three occasions during the year. 
Details of the attendance at Audit Committee meetings are set out 
in the Corporate Governance Report on page 37 .
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Company 
Secretary, together with the external auditors, will normally attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The external auditors are regularly invited by the Audit Committee 
to advise them of any matters which they consider should be 
brought to the Audit Committee’s attention without the Executive 
Directors present. The external auditors may also request a 
meeting with the Audit Committee if they consider it necessary.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Audit Committee. 
The members of the Audit Committee can, where they judge it 
necessary to discharge their responsibilities, obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense.
The Audit Committee’s duties include:
 Monitoring the ﬁnancial reporting process.
 Monitoring the statutory audit of the Group’s Financial Statements.
 Reviewing the Group’s Financial Statements and the material 
ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained in them.
 Monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems.
 Reviewing and monitoring the independence of the external 
auditors and the provision of additional services to the Group.
 Advising the Board on the appointment and removal of the 
external auditors and the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors.
 Reviewing the Group’s whistle blowing procedures.
The Audit Committee undertakes its activities in line with an annual 
work plan. The Audit Committee agrees the scope of the audit 
work and discusses the results of the full year audit and half year 
review each year.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are published 
on the investor relations section of the Group’s website at 
www.moneysupermarket.com and are available in hard copy 
form on application to the Company Secretary.
During the year, the Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s whistle 
blowing procedures to ensure arrangements are in place to enable 
employees to raise concerns about possible malpractice or 
wrongdoing by the Group or any of its employees on a conﬁdential 
basis. This includes arrangements to proportionately and 
independently investigate such matters and for appropriate 
follow-up action.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Audit 
Committee monitors and reviews each year the effectiveness of, 
and the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management. 
The Audit Committee undertook a review of the effectiveness of, 
and the framework for, the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management, including ﬁnancial, operational and compliance 
controls during the year. In addition to this review, the external 
auditors provided the Audit Committee with comprehensive reports 
of the results of their controls testing as part of the external audit. 
On a half yearly basis, the Audit Committee also reviewed the key 
risks facing the Group and the actions being taken by management 
to mitigate and manage them.
During the year the Audit Committee considered the need to 
establish an internal audit function and concluded that the Group is 
now of a size and complexity that requires an internal audit 
function. Accordingly, an internal audit function was established 
during 2012 and began to report to the Audit Committee during the 
year on the key risks facing the Group and the results of their 
internal control testing.
Review of the work of the external auditors
Subject to the annual appointment of the external auditors by 
shareholders, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
relationship between the Group and the external auditors. This 
review includes an assessment of their performance, cost-
effectiveness, objectivity and independence.
The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate 
relationship is maintained between the Group and the external 
auditors. The Group has implemented a policy of controlling the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors in order to 
ensure that their objectivity and independence is safeguarded. This 
control is exercised by ensuring that all non-audit services are 
subject to the prior approval of the Audit Committee. During the year, 
the Company continued to engage its external auditors to provide 
non-audit services, including the provision of advice in connection 
with tax and acquisition activities, reﬂecting their knowledge and 
understanding of the Group. The Audit Committee also continued 
with the appointment of other accountancy ﬁrms to provide certain 
non-audit services to the Group in connection with tax and actuarial 
advice and anticipates that this will continue in 2013.
The Audit Committee, having considered the external auditors’ 
performance during their period in ofﬁce, recommends their 
re-appointment. A full breakdown of the audit and non-audit related 
fees is set out in note 5 to the Group Financial Statements on page 
67 . The Audit Committee discussed the level of fees and 
considered them appropriate given the current size of the Group 
and the acquisition activities undertaken during the year. The Audit 
Committee is satisﬁed that the level and scope of non-audit 
services undertaken by the external auditors does not impair their 
independence and objectivity.

consideration is given to ensure proposed appointees have 
enough time available to devote to the role and that the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board is maintained. 
When the Nomination Committee has identiﬁed a suitable 
candidate, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee will make 
a recommendation to the Board with the Board making the ﬁnal 
decision.
When dealing with the appointment of a successor to the 
Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director will 
chair the Nomination Committee instead of the Chairman.

the Board together with the size, diversity, structure and 
composition of the Board, and reviewed the succession plans 
for the Board.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholders,
I succeeded Michael Wemms as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in January 2013 and would like to pay tribute to 
Michael’s tenure as Chairman of the Committee for the last ﬁve years. Michael continues as the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and continues as a member of the Remuneration Committee, so I will continue to have the beneﬁt of his counsel in 2013.
The remuneration structures of the Group are designed to support the key goals of the Group which are delivering a ﬁrst class 
customer experience, having the best “shop” in terms of the products we offer our customers and delivering superior returns to our 
shareholders. We aim to balance the desire for continued rapid growth in the business with a commitment to effective risk 
management. Consistent with best practice, the Committee offers a reward package comprising a base salary, pension 
contributions, a bonus and long term share awards linked to the ﬁnancial performance of the Group. The Committee believes that 
the Group’s remuneration structures are appropriate for our business model.
While the structure of the Group’s remuneration plan has remained unchanged in 2012, for 2013 we have awarded some signiﬁcant 
base salary rises to the Executive Directors and have introduced changes to the pension scheme for the Executive Directors which 
are described in detail on page 45. Our decision to do this is based on our desire to recruit and retain the best talent in the media 
and technology sectors and we have had direct experience of the competitive pressures we face in doing this as we have been in the 
market to recruit a new Marketing Director and are currently recruiting a new IT Director for the Group. These changes also reﬂect 
the increasing complexity of the Group and its growth to date.
The Group operates a “pay for performance” culture and the Committee reviews both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance 
targets each year to ensure they are appropriately challenging and relevant for the markets in which we operate. Against this 
background, 2012 has been another year of strong performance for the Group with adjusted revenue increasing by 15% to £204.8m 
and adjusted EBITDA increasing by 26% to £66.5m. Total shareholder return for the year was 62%.
This report provides further details of the Group’s remuneration principles, policies and compensation awards for the Executive 
Directors in 2012. These reﬂect both the successful year we have just completed and the competitive environment in which the 
Group is engaged.
We will continue to monitor developments in executive pay to ensure that our compensation policies are aligned with the market’s 
recommended best practices.
Consistent with the draft proposals on Directors’ pay which were published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in 
June 2012, the report has been split into two sections: a Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the policy on the remuneration 
of the Directors, and an Implementation Report, which discloses how the remuneration policy has been implemented in the year 
ended 31 December 2012. We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the 
forthcoming AGM on 17 April 2013.
Yours sincerely,
Bruce Carnegie-Brown

Remuneration policy and objectives
The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the 
marketplace to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the 
business. Company policy is that performance-related components should form a signiﬁcant portion of the overall remuneration 
package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based 
on measures that represent the best interests of our key stakeholders including shareholders and customers.
The chart below illustrates how the composition of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s remuneration package varies at different levels of 
performance under the 2013 policy, both as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity and as a total value.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy to ensure it remains consistent with best remuneration 
practice and is aligned to shareholders’ interests. The Remuneration Committee believes the policy described above, which applied 
in 2012, remains appropriate and that it will continue in 2013.

Detailed Policy
Base salary
The base salary for each Executive Director is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 January each 
year. It is intended that base salary levels should reﬂect those paid to Executive Directors of comparable companies selected on the 
basis of market sector, market capitalisation and turnover. Individual salary adjustments take into account each Executive Director’s 
performance against agreed challenging objectives, experience in role, changes in responsibility and the Group’s ﬁnancial 
performance, as well as comparing each Executive Director’s base salary to senior management in the Group and relative to the 
external market. The Remuneration Committee used Towers Watson to provide comparative market data.
Further details of the base salary increases for the Executive Directors are set out in the Implementation Report on page 49.
The Group’s employees received salary increases averaging 3% with increases depending on individual performance.
Incentive Plans
The Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that variable pay is determined by relevant and stretching measures of performance 
that are consistent with the strategic objectives of the Group, in order to appropriately align Executive Directors’ interests with those 
of key stakeholders including shareholders and customers.
Performance related bonus
In 2012, performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of the year and were aligned to 
internal targets and strategic business objectives. In setting bonus targets, the Remuneration Committee seeks to link individual 
targets to areas of the business in which the Executive Directors have particular inﬂuence and responsibility, while also seeking to 
maintain a keen team ethos.
The table below shows the target and maximum bonus awards made to the Executive Directors as a percentage of base salary 
in 2012 together with details of the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 2012.
Target Maximum Performance conditions for 2012 bonus
Peter Plumb 135% 185% Target bonus is payable for achievement of:
 Growth in Group adjusted EBITDA and revenue (80% of 
target award) 
 Speciﬁc individual objectives including building brand 
awareness, improving the best shop for customers and 
certain other strategic projects (20% of target award).
The maximum award is payable for the achievement of 
exceptional adjusted EBITDA performance targets as 
well as the achievement of individual objectives.

Further details of the bonus amounts paid to the Executive Directors are set out in the Implementation Report on page 50.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the bonus structure for the Executive Directors for 2013. The Remuneration Committee 
has determined that the target and maximum bonus potential will remain the same as 2012 and the split of targets will be consistent 
with those used in 2012.
Long Term Incentive Plan
Annual grants of conditional nil cost share awards are made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee to senior executives 
and managers. The awards normally vest at the end of the three year performance period, subject to the achievement of the 
performance conditions and continued employment. Awards lapse to the extent that the performance conditions are not achieved.
The maximum award that can be made to an employee in any ﬁnancial year is the equivalent of 200% of an employee’s annual base 
salary, calculated on the basis of the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of grant.
Participants receive a payment (in cash and/or shares at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion) on or shortly following the vesting 
of their awards, of an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on those vested shares between the time when the 
awards were granted and the time when they vest.

2 David Osborne resigned as a Director with effect from 31 December 2012. The 2012 award granted to him has been forfeit in its entirety.
3 Simon Nixon does not participate in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan.
In order for the grants to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisﬁed that such vesting is justiﬁed when taking into account 
the underlying ﬁnancial performance of the Group over the three year performance period.
The Remuneration Committee will meet once the results for the three year plan period are available to determine whether, and the 
extent to which, the performance conditions have been met.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this combination of performance conditions is an appropriate way of rewarding 
Executive Directors because it takes into account both the long term returns to shareholders and the Group’s ﬁnancial growth. The 
performance conditions to be applied to awards granted in 2013 will be reviewed and determined by the Remuneration Committee 
during the ﬁrst quarter of 2013.
Other share plans
Executive Directors have the opportunity to participate in the Company’s HMRC approved all employee Share Incentive Plan which 
provides employees with the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company on a monthly basis using money deducted from their 
pre-tax salary.
Executive Directors also have the opportunity to participate in the Company’s HMRC approved all employee Sharesave Scheme 
which provides employees with the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company at the end of a three year period using money 
deducted monthly from their salary at up to a 20% discount to the price of the Company’s shares at the date employees are invited 
to join the scheme.
Pension
The Company operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme for the beneﬁt of employees including the Executive Directors. In all 
cases, base salary only is pensionable. The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to provide competitive retirement beneﬁts for the 
Executive Directors. With effect from 1 January 2013, the Company increased the pension contributions it makes from 10% to 20% 
of base salary for the beneﬁt of the Executive Directors. 48 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Corporate Governance
Bene ts
The Company provides a car allowance of £14,000 per annum for each of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee’s 
policy is to provide a competitive car allowance for the Executive Directors.
Service agreements
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not ﬁxed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on 12 
months’ notice and make provision, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary in 
lieu of 12 months’ notice. In calculating the amount payable to a Director on termination of employment, the Remuneration 
Committee would take into account the commercial interests of the Company and apply usual common law and contractual 
principles. There are no special provisions for Executive Directors in their service agreements with regard to compensation in the 
event of loss of ofﬁce.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contractual terms for new Executive Directors to ensure these reﬂect best practice. The 
service agreements of the current Executive Directors include the following terms:

Other reserves
The other reserves balance represents the merger and revaluation reserves generated upon the acquisition of MoneySupermarket.com 
Financial Group Limited by the Company, as discussed below, and a capital redemption reserve for £19,000 arising from the 
acquisition of 95,294,118 deferred shares of 0.02p by the Company from Simon Nixon.

of assets acquired, a merger reserve of £16,923,000 for 45% of the book value transferred from a company under common control, 
and a revaluation reserve of £65,345,000 representing 45% of the fair value of the intangible assets transferred from a company 
under common control, were recognised. Amounts are transferred from these reserves to retained earnings as the goodwill and 
other intangibles balances which relate to this acquisition are impaired and amortised.

Financial Statements
1. Corporate information
The Consolidated Financial Statements of MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC (‘Company’), a company incorporated in England, 
and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors 
on 4 March 2013. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 82 to 87.
2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Comparative ﬁgures presented in the Financial Statements 
represent the year ended 31 December 2011. The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors 
deem appropriate, given the Group’s positive cash position, lack of debt, and continued growth and forecast proﬁtability.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies 
that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are 
described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes:
 Note 3 acquisitions
 Note 3 contingent consideration and remuneration
 Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment
 Note 13 revenue recognition
 Note 13 provision for doubtful debts
 Note 14 accruals
 Note 18 share-based payments
 Note 21 commitments and contingencies
Basis of consolidation
These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and equity 
account the Group’s interest in associates.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies. 
Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Consolidated Financial 
Statements include the Group’s share of the proﬁt or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, after 
adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence commences until the 
date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence ceases.
Accounting for business combinations
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations.  
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts 
from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.

2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
 the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are 
generally recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classiﬁed as 
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Where the contingent consideration is dependent on future employment, it 
shall be treated as a cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010
For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the 
acquiree. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with 
business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007. These comprised the incorporation 
of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon 
Nixon’s 45% interest in MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in 
MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited from third parties. The acquisition of Simon Nixon’s shares was between two parties, 
being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction. The acquisition was of an interest 
in a company which gave the investor a signiﬁcant inﬂuence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common 
control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest 
in MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition. The 
acquisition of the remaining shares in MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. This resulted in the fair value 
of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full 
and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. The 
functional currency of the foreign subsidiary icero GmbH is the euro. The income and expenses of the foreign operation are 
translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred. The assets and liabilities of the 
foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date. The exchange difference 
arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at 
the exchange rate at that date. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a proﬁt or loss.
Revenue
The Group generates fees from internet lead generation (click based revenue), commissions from brokerage sales and advertising 
through a variety of contractual arrangements. The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that 
the lead is generated. Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer. 
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax. 60 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of 
property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part 
of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought 
into use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment (including IT equipment) 3 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings 5 years
Ofﬁce equipment 5 years
The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least 
annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All the 
Group’s intangible assets (other than goodwill) have been identiﬁed as having ﬁnite useful lives. As such, they are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life is 
reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated 
useful lives are as follows:
Market-related 10 years
Customer relationships 7 years
Customer lists 3 years
Technology 3 years
Market-related intangible assets are deﬁned as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, 
for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer 
relationships. For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identiﬁed separately. Relationships with 
high-proﬁle customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and trafﬁc on the website, and 
enhance the reputation of the brand. Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and 
unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less 
costs to sell and their value in use. 61 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria 
outlined in IAS 38. Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
 mployee bene ts
De ned contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair values of the 
share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes 
model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made. The amount recognised as an 
expense is adjusted to reﬂect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short term employee bene ts
Short-term employee beneﬁt obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or proﬁt sharing plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs
The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media. Costs associated with the production of adverts are 
recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in 
a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying. The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an 
expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it 
accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period 
in which the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Taxation
Tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt other than in a 
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. 62 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated

2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with ﬁnite lives which are 
acquired through business combinations representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
These liabilities will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 12.
Group management of capital
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
 to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and 
beneﬁts for other stakeholders; and 
 to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in 
the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In assessing the level of capital all 
components of equity are taken into account, i.e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves (where applicable), as well as 
unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by where possible depositing them with 
a number of ﬁnancial institutions to reduce credit risk. The Group had no debt as at 31 December 2012 and is not subject to 
externally imposed capital requirements; management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its 
operations. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds. During the prior year the shareholders authorised the 
Company to purchase up to 50,928,800 of its own shares for cancellation or to be held as treasury shares. The Group believes it is 
meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to 
make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period
The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations which have not had a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s results:
 Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets (amendments to IAS 12)
Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 
2012 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group. These are not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s accounts when adopted, except where stated.
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated ﬁnancial statements (2011)’ – On 12 May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
which is a replacement of IAS 27 Consolidated and separate ﬁnancial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special purpose 
entities. This is part of a new suite of standards on consolidation and related matters, which will replace the existing accounting for 
subsidiaries and joint ventures (now joint arrangements), and will make limited amendments in relation to associates. Concurrent with 
the issuance of IFRS 10, the IASB also issued:
 IFRS 11 ‘Joint ventures (2011)’;
 IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of involvement with other entities (2011)’;
 IAS 27 ‘Separate ﬁnancial statements (revised 2011)’, has been amended for the issuance of IFRS 10 but retains the current 
guidance for separate ﬁnancial statements; and 
 IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised 2011)’, has been amended for conforming changes based on the

2. Summary of signi cant accounting policies continued
Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective continued
Transition guidance: Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12 – Further to the consolidation standards above, the IASB has 
issued transitional guidance, effective from 1 January 2013. The amendments simplify the transition to these new standards and 
provide additional relief from disclosures.*
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (2010) – On 28 October 2010, the IASB published a revised version of IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. 
The revised standard retains the requirements for classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets that were published in 
November 2009 but adds guidance on the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities. As part of its restructuring of IFRS 9, 
the IASB also copied the guidance on derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments and related implementation guidance from IAS 39 
‘Financial instruments: recognition and measurement to IFRS 9’. On 19 November 2011, the IASB issued ‘Mandatory effective date 
and Transition Disclosures which amended the effective date of IFRS 9 to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.*
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ (2011) – On 12 May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’, which establishes a 
single source of guidance for fair value measurement under IFRSs. IFRS 13 deﬁnes fair value, provides guidance on its determination 
and introduces consistent requirements for disclosures on fair value measurements. The Standard does not include requirements on 
when fair value is required; it prescribes how fair value is to be measured if another standard requires it. IFRS 13 is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with early adoption permitted, and applies prospectively from the beginning of 
the annual period in which the Standard is adopted.
IAS 19 ‘Employee beneﬁts (2001) (the ‘amendments’)’ – On 16 June 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee 
beneﬁts’ (2011) (the ‘amendments’) that change the accounting for deﬁned beneﬁt plans and termination beneﬁts. The objective of 
this limited scope project was to improve the ﬁnancial reporting of employee beneﬁts. The amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, with earlier application permitted.
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of items of other comprehensive income (2011)’ – On 16 June 2011, the IASB issued ‘Presentation of items of 
other comprehensive income. The amendments require the grouping of items of other comprehensive income into: items that might 
be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in subsequent periods; and items that will not be classiﬁed to proﬁt and loss in subsequent periods. 
The amendments are applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 with earlier adoption permitted.
IAS 32 ‘Financial instruments: presentation (2011)’ – In December 2011, the IASB amended the accounting requirements and 
disclosures related to offsetting of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities. The amendments to IAS 32 are intended to clarify existing 
application issues relating to the offsetting rules and therefore reduce the level of diversity in current practice. The new disclosures 
are required for annual or interim periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and the clarifying amendments to IAS 32 are effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Both require retrospective application for comparative periods.
On 17 May 2012, the IASB issued ‘Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2009-2011 cycle, incorporating amendments to ﬁve IFRSs. The 
amendments must be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with earlier 
application permitted. Of the ﬁve, three apply to the Group, they are:*
 IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – Spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment should be classiﬁed as 
property, plant and equipment when they meet the deﬁnition of property, plant and equipment in IAS 16;
 IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation – Income tax relating to distributions to holders of an equity instrument and to 
transaction costs of an equity transaction should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’; and
 IAS 34 Interim ﬁnancial reporting – The total assets and total liabilities for a particular reportable segment would be separately 
disclosed in interim ﬁnancial reporting only when the amounts are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and 
there has been a material change from the amounts disclosed in the last annual ﬁnancial statements for that reportable segment.

3. Acquisitions
Financial Services Net Limited
On 14 October 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Financial Services Net Limited (‘FSN’) for £5m, with a further 
£4m of consideration payable dependent upon the achievement of certain cumulative ﬁnancial targets over a 3 year period 
commencing May 2011.
During 2011 the goodwill of £2.2m recognised on the acquisition of FSN was written off in full to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income based on the business’ performance to date against the above targets, and latest forecasts. Management 
assessed the fair value of the contingent consideration based on the performance of FSN, and reduced the amount accrued at 
31 December 2011 by £2.2m to £0.2m. 64 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

3. Acquisitions continued
Financial Services Net Limited continued
In 2012 FSN has continued to trade below its forecast performance. Management performed an impairment review of the remaining 
intangible assets prior to the year end, based on updated forecasts for the business, and as a result of this review the remaining net 
book value of the intangible assets of £4.4m was written off to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition, 
management also reviewed the amount of contingent consideration which they expected to become payable, and as a result 
released a credit of £0.2m to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Local Daily Deals Limited
On 31 August 2011 the Group acquired 51% of Local Daily Deals Limited (‘LDD’) for an initial consideration of £1m, rising to a 
total consideration of up to £11m payable on the third anniversary of the acquisition depending on the achievement of certain 
ﬁnancial targets.
The Group has accounted for the acquisition using the anticipated acquisition method, whereby 100% of LDD’s results since 
acquisition have been consolidated into the results of the Group, as a result of the call and put options in place over the non-
controlling interest.
The deferred consideration payable was dependent upon continued employment, and therefore under IFRS was accounted for as 
contingent remuneration with the forecast amount payable being accrued over the earnout period and charged to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. The estimated fair value of the contingent amount payable was assessed as being £1.0m. As 
at 31 December 2011 £0.1m had been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
During the period, management reviewed the amount of contingent remuneration that they expected to become payable, based on 
the performance of the business to date and its latest forecasts. As a result, a £0.1m credit has been released to the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Since the performance of LDD has been behind management’s expectations the goodwill balance of £0.6m was also reviewed for 
impairment during the period and as a result has been written off in full to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
On 21 September 2012, the Group acquired certain trade and assets from Martin Lewis and his company MoneySavingExpert.com 
for an initial consideration of £65.5m. The initial consideration of £65.5m was settled by a cash payment of £35.0m and £30.5m of 
equity represented by 22.1 million ordinary shares in the Company. In addition, a contingent amount of up to £27.0m, payable in part 
against the achievement of certain non-ﬁnancial metrics and in part at the discretion of the Company Board, is dependent on the 
continued employment of Martin Lewis for three years following the acquisition.

MSE’s net assets at the acquisition date:
Other current assets 16
Intangible assets (see note 12) 12,895
Net identiﬁable assets and liabilities 12,911
Goodwill on acquisition 52,620
Total consideration 65,531
A detailed description of the different intangible assets which were identiﬁed within the acquired business, and the methods used to 
value them, are provided within note 12.
The acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com by the Group is expected to provide a number of beneﬁts to both the Group and the 
acquired business, allowing the enlarged Group to reach a wider audience, and improve the visibility and accessibility of 
MoneySavingExpert.com’s offering. The goodwill identiﬁed upon the acquisition of MoneySavingExpert.com represents the beneﬁts 
referred to above, as well as the skills and knowledge within the acquired business’ workforce. 
The results of MoneySavingExpert.com have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group with effect from 
21 September 2012 and in the three months and 9 days to 31 December 2012, the business contributed revenue (prior to 
consolidation adjustments) of £3.9m and a net proﬁt of £2.8m to the consolidated proﬁt for the year. If the acquisition had occurred 
on 1 January 2012, Group revenue would have been an estimated £209.1m and proﬁt before tax would have been an estimated 
£32.0m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of 
acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on the ﬁrst day of the accounting period.
As noted above, additional amounts of up to £27.0m may become payable on the third anniversary of the completion date in part 
upon the achievement of a number of non-ﬁnancial performance measures speciﬁed in the purchase agreement and in part at the 
discretion of the Company Board, subject to the continued employment of Martin Lewis. These amounts have been accounted for 
separate to the business combination as remuneration as they are linked to the continued employment of Martin Lewis. The fair value 
of the amount that management expects to become payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income over the earnout period as an employment expense. The Group has estimated the amount of this element which will become 
payable by attributing different probabilities to a range of possible outcomes derived from the most recent non-ﬁnancial forecasts of 
the business’ performance. At the balance sheet date the fair value of the contingent amount was £25.0m, and £2.3m has been 
charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the period, included within administrative expenses, and 
£0.2m has been recognised as an expense within net ﬁnance costs, being the unwinding of the discount rate applied.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of £3.4m (2011: £1.1m) during the period relating to legal and advisory fees, which have 
been included in administrative expenses. The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share is a decrease of 0.6p per share.
The Group was previously a signiﬁcant customer of MoneySavingExpert.com. Management considered the settlement of the 
pre-existing relationship on acquisition, and since the pre-acquisition trade was on an arms length, commercial basis, no settlement 
adjustments arose. 66 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

4. Segmental information
Business segments
In applying IFRS 8 – Operating segments, the Group has disclosed ﬁve reportable segments, being Money, Insurance, Travel, 
Home and MoneySavingExpert.com. Money, Insurance and Home operate under the brand name MoneySupermarket.com, and 
Travel under the brand name TravelSupermarket.com, however, all four segments are reported separately. MoneySavingExpert.com 
will be disclosed as a separate operating segment, with revenue generated by FSN and LDD reported within ‘Other’. This disclosure 
correlates with the information which is presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, the Company Board, which 
reviews revenue by segment. The Group’s costs, ﬁnance income, tax charges and net assets are only reviewed by the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker at a consolidated level, with the exception of MoneySavingExpert.com, and therefore have not been 
allocated between all segments in the analysis below. All of the Group revenue of £204.8m (2011: £181.0m) reported in 2012, was 
generated in the UK (2011: £181.0m).

Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the proﬁt or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of 
the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Earnings per share

On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualiﬁed and experienced independent third party to value the 
intangible assets acquired from MoneySupermarket.com Financial Group Limited. This valuation was used as the initial carrying 
value for these assets. Following the impairment in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying 
value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group. At 31 December 2012 the market capitalisation exceeded 
the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% (2011: more 
than 100%).
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units (‘CGU’) that represent the 
lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an 
operating segment as deﬁned by IFRS 8. These CGUs are the ﬁve operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel, Home Services and 
MoneySavingExpert.com. In addition, the recently acquired businesses, Financial Services Net Limited (FSN) and Local Daily Deals 
Limited (LDD), are separate CGUs for the purposes of monitoring goodwill. The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU 
level. For the original four segments, the goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of 
the operating segments at that date with £30.7m allocated to Insurance, £15.5m to Money, £6.6m to Travel and £2.2m to Home 
Services. The balances at 31 December 2012 are in line with those at 1 January 2009. Goodwill impairment for FSN, LDD and 
MSE has been considered separately from the four operating segments outlined above and the Group.
 mpairment re iew by ertical and Group
For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the 
forecast cash ﬂows.
The present value of the future cash ﬂows has been calculated with the following key assumptions:
 Cash ﬂows for year 1 for each CGU represent management’s best estimate of future cash ﬂows as at 31 December 2012, and are 
based upon the Group’s approved budget for 2013 incorporating where possible an allocation of cost of sales, advertising and 
overheads costs. The main assumptions underlying the 2013 budget relate to visitor numbers, source of visitors, revenue per 
transaction/visitor and marketing spend, which incorporate past experience. The forecast assumes continued improvement during 
the course of 2013 driven by new media campaigns, utilisation of the Group’s data asset and investments made during 2012 in the 
core technology for the Group’s key channels. All segments have been assumed to have similar rates of growth. 72 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012
Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
12. Intangible assets continued
 Cash ﬂows for the ﬁrst 3 years assume an average 10% per annum increase in revenue, with all costs expected to grow at 10% 
per annum. Cash ﬂows after 3 years assume no growth.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
 A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% (2011: 13.5%) has been used in the forecast for the Travel, Insurance, Money and Home Services 
segments.
When there are clear indications that the economy has emerged from recession a different set of assumptions may be more 
appropriate.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home 
Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identiﬁed. No reasonably 
possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services 
operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental 
level, and a number of the signiﬁcant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and 
consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment. Therefore the cash ﬂows estimated for these segments include all of 
the Group’s forecast revenues and an allocation of the Group’s forecast costs.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous 
years. In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including 
goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash ﬂows which has been calculated with a 
set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets exceeds their carrying value by £469m 
(2011: £264m), and as such, no impairment was identiﬁed.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, the level of the increase in the discount rate, with all the other assumptions held 
constant, required to give a value in use for the Group’s assets equal to their carrying value, would be in excess of what can reasonably 
be expected to happen (2011: outside of reasonable range). Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash ﬂows of £59.0m (2011: £35.0m) with 
all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use for the Group’s assets equal to their carrying value.
At an asset category level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no 
adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
Acquisition of inancial Ser ices et Limited S
The fair value of the intangible assets recognised upon the acquisition of FSN was calculated as set out below:
 Market related
 Within FSN, the main market related intangible assets are the domain names which FSN owns. These assets were valued using 
an income-based approach, namely, the royalty savings method, which estimates the royalty which the Group would have to pay 
a third party to use the domain names if it did not own them, typically as a percentage of the revenue earned from the domain 
names during their useful economic life of 10 years. The Group estimated revenue based on the most recent 3 year forecasts, and 
for later periods assumed inﬂationary increases of 5%. A royalty rate of 15% was applied based on available industry data. A 
discount rate of 15.8% was used to calculate the present value of the future royalty savings.
 Customer relationships
 This asset represented the value present within the existing relationships which FSN had with product providers and brokers. The 
valuation was based on the cash ﬂows which were expected to result from these relationships during the 7 year useful economic 
life of the asset, adjusted for estimated future attrition of the providers and relationships following the date of acquisition. Again, 
the Group based the estimate on the most recent 3 year forecasts, and for later periods assumed inﬂationary increases of 5%, 
with an assumed attrition rate of the provider relationships of 50% per annum, based on management’s expectations. A discount 
rate of 15.8% was used to calculate the present value of the future beneﬁt resulting from the relationships. 73 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC
Annual Report 2012

12. Intangible assets continued
 Customer lists
 This asset represented the value of the customer data held by FSN at the date of acquisition, and was valued based on the cost 
of recreating such a database in the open market, using in-house estimates of the cost of each data element.
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition of FSN represented the anticipated incremental value which the Group 
expected to generate by applying the existing skills and expertise within the Group’s workforce to the acquired business and assets.
During 2011 the goodwill of £2.2m recognised on the acquisition of FSN was written off in full to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income based on the business’ performance against the targets set, and latest forecasts. Management also 
assessed the fair value of the contingent consideration and reduced the amount accrued at 31 December 2011 by £2.2m to £0.2m.
In 2012 FSN has continued to trade below management expectations. As a result of this management reviewed the remaining 
intangible assets for impairment.
The recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use, and was calculated by reference to FSN’s forecast cash 
ﬂows. For the purposes of IAS 36, FSN is taken to be one CGU.
The present value of the forecast cash ﬂows was calculated with the following key assumptions:
 Cash ﬂows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash ﬂows as at 31 December 2012, and are based upon 
the Group’s approved budget for 2013. The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of 
revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business. The forecast assumes a level of performance 
consistent with that in 2012.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity assume no growth in the number of visitors, and no increase in the revenue generated per visitor, with 
all costs expected to remain ﬂat.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
 A pre-tax discount rate of 16.5% (2011: 16.5%) has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates the value in use of FSN being lower than the carrying value of the business’ identiﬁed intangible 
assets. Therefore, an impairment charge of £4.4m has been recognised in the year within administrative expenses, as well as a credit 
of £0.2m in relation to the release of the accrued contingent consideration. As a result, there is no difference between the carrying 
value and the recoverable amount of the business’ intangible assets as at the balance sheet date.
Acquisition of Local Daily Deals Limited LDD
The Group recognises its intangible assets in the following asset classes. No intangible assets were recognised upon the acquisition 
of LDD for the following reasons:
 Market related
 At acquisition the main market related intangible asset was the domain name which LDD owned. Assets such as this are typically 
valued using an income-based approach, based on estimated revenue in the company’s most recent forecasts, and the savings 
which the Group or an equivalent third party would expect to make by now owning the domain name. Prior to acquisition the 
company’s website attracted low volumes of visitors, and since acquisition the website has been relocated within the Group’s main 
website. In light of this, the Group did not assign any value to the domain name or any other market related intangible assets.
 Customer relationships
 This asset class represents the value within the existing relationships which LDD has with its business partners. Given the nature 
of LDD’s business and the short life-time of the relationships, the Group did not identify any value within this asset.
 Customer lists
 This asset class represents the value of the customer data held by LDD at the date of acquisition. The volume of customer data 
held by the business has been assessed by management as immaterial. As such no value was identiﬁed within this asset.
 Technology
 This asset class relates to technical innovations and advances such as databases, software and trade secrets. Whilst the 
business did own the website on which its business operates, the cost of replicating such a website has been estimated by 
management as immaterial to the Group’s operations. 74 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Notes to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements continued
12. Intangible assets continued
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition of LDD represented the anticipated incremental value which the Group 
expected to generate by applying its existing customer database and expertise to the LDD business. The Group does not expect any 
of the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.
In 2012, LDD has traded below its forecast performance, and as a result management reviewed the goodwill balance for impairment 
during the period.
The recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use, and was calculated by reference to LDD’s forecast cash 
ﬂows. For the purposes of IAS 36, LDD is taken to be one CGU.
The present value of the forecast cash ﬂows was calculated with the following key assumptions:
 Cash ﬂows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash ﬂows as at 31 December 2012, and are based upon 
the Group’s approved budget for 2013. The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of 
revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business. The forecast assumes a performance 
consistent with 2012.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity assume no growth in the revenue generated, with all costs expected to remain ﬂat.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
 A pre-tax discount rate of 16.5% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates the value in use of LDD being lower than the carrying value of goodwill created on the acquisition 
of LDD. Therefore an impairment charge of £0.6m has been recognised in the year in administrative expenses. As a result, there is no 
difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the goodwill as at the balance sheet date.
Acquisition of certain trade and assets of Martin Lewis and MoneySa ingE pert.com
The fair value of the intangible assets recognised upon the acquisition of trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis and 
MoneySavingExpert.com (‘MSE’) were calculated as set out below:
 Market related
 Within MSE, the main market related intangible assets are the MSE tradename, MSE domain name and Martin Lewis’ image and 
reputation. These assets were valued using an income-based approach, namely, the royalty savings method, where it is assumed 
that a company, without similar assets, would license the right to use these assets and pay a royalty related to turnover achieved 
over their useful economic life of 10 years. A royalty rate of 20% has been applied for the ﬁrst three years after acquisition, which 
will include the use of Martin Lewis’ name and image, and a 10% royalty rate has been used for the following seven years when 
Martin Lewis’s name and image will not be included. 
 Customer lists
 This asset represents the value of the customer data held by MSE at the date of acquisition, and its valuation has been performed 
with reference to the cost of buying an equivalent book of customer data on the open market. This was done through analysis of 
recent sales of comparable assets.
 Non-compete agreement
 To value the non-compete agreement management considered what percentage of the business could be lost if Martin Lewis 
was to leave the acquired business and subsequently compete against the Group. The non-compete agreement is valid for a 
period of four years following acquisition. However, as the contingent remuneration which may become payable to Martin Lewis is 
dependent upon his continued employment by the business for three years following the acquisition, the non-compete agreement 
has been valued for the twelve months following the three year earnout period. 75 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

 Tax amortisation bene t 
 Included in the market related intangible and non-compete agreement is an additional increment of value, the tax amortisation 
beneﬁt.
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition represents the anticipated incremental value which the Group expects to 
generate by applying the existing skills and expertise within the Group’s workforce to the acquired business and assets, as well as 
the skills and expertise of the acquired workforce and Martin Lewis.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cashﬂows using the following key assumptions:
 Cash ﬂows for year 1 represent management’s best estimate of future cash ﬂows as at 31 December 2012, and are based upon 
the Group’s approved budget for 2013. The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of 
revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business. The forecast assumes an improvement over 
2013, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation.
 Cash ﬂows for the ﬁrst three years assume an average 10% per annum increase in the revenue generated, whilst payroll costs 
have been forecast to increase by 5% per annum, with all other costs expected to grow at 5% per annum. Cash ﬂows after three 
years assume no growth.
 Cash ﬂows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
 A pre-tax discount rate of 16.2% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets exceed their carrying value by in excess of 21%, and as 
such, no impairment was identiﬁed. The discount rate would need to increase to 19% with all other assumptions held constant, to give a 
value in use of MSE’s assets equal to the carrying value. Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash ﬂows of £2.5m with all other 
assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use equal to the carrying value.

17. Financial instruments
Interest rate risk
The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK banks. Interest earned therefore closely follows movements 
in Bank of England base rates. A movement of 1% in this rate would result in a difference in annual pre-tax proﬁt of £187,000 based 
on Group cash, cash equivalents and ﬁnancial instruments at 31 December 2012. At the balance sheet date, £18,314,000 was 
invested with Lloyds Banking Group, this being the most invested with any one bank.
Effective interest rates
In respect of interest-earning ﬁnancial assets, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the year end date:
31 December 2012 31 December 2011
Effective
interest rate £000
Effective
interest rate £000
Cash and cash equivalents 0.66% 18,680 0.68% 35,005
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a ﬁnancial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties as a means of mitigating risk of ﬁnancial loss 
from default. The Group’s exposure is continuously monitored by the credit control team and ﬁnance management.
By value, over 90% (2011: 90%) of the Group’s revenue comes from blue chip companies. At the balance sheet date, the ﬁve 
largest trade receivables, by provider, accounted for 14% (2011: 22%) of the total trade receivables balance of £20,768,000 
(2011: £15,974,000) and the largest individual balance was £855,442 (2011: £1,080,637). 78 MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC

Fair values
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are principally short-term in nature, and therefore their fair value is not materially different 
from their carrying value. The valuation method for the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities can be deﬁned as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The ﬁnancial liabilities arising on acquisitions held at 31 December 2012 are valued using a level 3 valuation method, being their fair 
value with any change in fair value taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. All other ﬁnancial assets and 
liabilities are valued at amortised cost. There have been no transfers between levels in the year.
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the ﬁnancial 
statements approximate their fair values.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash ﬂows. Details of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risks, are set 
out below:

18. Share-based payments
Share ncenti e Plan scheme S P
Upon listing, the Company granted £3,000 of ordinary shares at the price of £1.70 per ordinary share to each eligible employee free 
of charge. If an employee left within one year of listing, all of these ordinary shares were forfeit; between one and two years of listing, 
50% were forfeit; between two and three years of listing, 20% were forfeit; and after three years of listing, none were forfeit. 948,184 
shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan scheme in 2007. On 31 July 2010 eligible employees became entitled to receive 
their allocation of free shares. 93,886 (2011: 54,365) shares have been withdrawn from the trust by employees during the period and 
a further 388,199 remain held in trust (2011: 482,085).
Long erm ncenti e Plan scheme L P
On 8 April 2009, conditional awards were made over 8,256,530 ordinary shares under the MoneySupermarket.com Group PLC Long 
Term Incentive Plan scheme to senior employees (‘2009 LTIPs’). Under this scheme, up to 70% of the shares were to vest at the end 
of a three year period dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted EBITDA ﬁgure for each of the three ﬁnancial years from 2009 
to 2011, and up to 30% of the shares were to vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon the total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) of the Company relative to a comparator group of deﬁned companies. These awards were therefore subject to market-based 
performance conditions. On 11 June 2012 94.38% of the awards vested following partial achievement of the performance criteria.

to 31 December 2014, and up to 30% of the award vests at the end of a three year period dependent upon the total shareholder 
return (‘TSR’) of the Company relative to a comparator group of deﬁned companies. 
1  The ﬁgures for the awards made in 2010, 2011 and 2012 are the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full, representing 150% of the actual awards made.
Sharesa e scheme
During 2011, the Group established an HMRC-approved savings scheme available to all employees. The scheme allows employees 
to save an amount of their net pay into a savings account each month, and at the end of the three year period, choose to either 
receive back their savings or use them to buy ordinary shares in the Company at a discounted exercise price. The exercise price for 
the 2011 Sharesave scheme was ﬁxed at 89.6p per share.
During 2012, the Group established a further HMRC-approved scheme available to all employees, on the same basis as the scheme 
established in 2011. The exercise price for the 2012 Sharesave scheme was ﬁxed at 107.6p per share.

material adverse effect on the Group. Provision has been made for the expected settlement where the Group believes a payment will 
be made to settle the dispute.
At the end of 2011, the Group was in the process of ﬁnalising a new VAT recovery method with HM Revenue & Customs. During 2012 
formal approval of the new method was received. As a result of this the Group recognised a net credit of £10.6m relating to the 
period from 1 April 2008 to 31 December 2012.

Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards.
No proﬁt and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The proﬁt after 
tax for the Company was £28,725,000 (2011: proﬁt of £48,846,000), which included dividends received of £35.0 million.
The Company has taken the exemption in FRS 1 5(a) and consequently no cash ﬂow statement is presented for the Company.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies 
that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below. The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are 
described in more detail in the accompanying notes:
 Note 4 contingent consideration and remuneration
 n estments
Investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recognised on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given over the fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired. The amounts are capitalised and written off on 
a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is ﬁve years. Provision is made for any impairment. 
Other Intangible Assets
The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value at the date of acquisition. Where this can be 
measured reliably after initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. All of the Company’s intangible assets have been identiﬁed as having ﬁnite useful lives. As such they 
are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer lists 3 years
For accounting purposes, customer lists have been identiﬁed separately. Customer lists allow the Company to undertake targeted 
marketing activities. 
Share based payment transactions
The Group’s share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. The fair value of share 
awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at award 
date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the 
awards made is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards 
were made. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the number of share awards expected to vest. Subsidiaries 
are recharged for the amount recognised as share-based payments relating to awards to their employees. The fair value of the 
recharge is recognised over the vesting period.
Di idends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
 a ation
Tax on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies continued
 a ation continued
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates in force for the year, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
2. Share-based payments
The analysis and disclosures in relation to share-based payments are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements in note 18.

4. Acquisitions
MoneySavingExpert.com (MSE)
On 21 September 2012, the Company purchased trade and certain assets from Martin Lewis for an initial consideration of £64.5m. 
The initial consideration of £64.5m was settled by a cash payment of £34.0m and £30.5m of equity represented by 22.1m ordinary 
shares in the Company. In addition, a contingent amount of up to £27.0m, payable in part against the achievement of certain 
non-ﬁnancial metrics and in part at the discretion of the Company Board, is dependent on the continued employment of Martin 
Lewis for three years following the acquisition. Part of this payment is due to individuals who were employed by MSE at the point of 
acquisition and who remain in employment at the end of the earnout period, with the remainder payable to Martin Lewis.
The amounts due to MSE employees have been accounted for separate to the business combination as remuneration. The fair value 
of this element will be charged to the Company proﬁt and loss account over the earnout period. At the balance sheet date the fair 
value of the contingent amount was £1.7m and £0.2m has been charged to the Company proﬁt and loss account during the period 
as an employment expense.
Under FRS 7 ‘Fair values in acquisition accounting’ the fair value of the remaining contingent amount is included in the cost of 
acquisition. At the balance sheet date management have calculated the fair value of this as £23.3m. This will be reviewed at each 
balance sheet date with any subsequent adjustments needed being made to goodwill.
The Company incurred acquisition-related costs of £3.4m during the period, which under FRS 7 ‘Fair values in acquisition 
accounting’ are included in the cost of acquisition. Total consideration is therefore:
£000

Initial consideration, paid in cash 34,000

A detailed description of the intangible assets identiﬁed within the acquired business, the methods used to value them and the 
background to the acquisition and resulting goodwill are provided in note 12 of the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
The results of the acquired business have been included in the Company proﬁt and loss account with effect from 21 September 2012 
and in the three months and 9 days to 31 December 2012, the business contributed revenue of £2.4m and a net loss of £3.1m to the 
Company proﬁt and loss account for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2012, Company revenue would have 
been an estimated £10.2m and loss before tax would have been an estimated £9.4m. The proﬁt after tax of the acquired business  
in its previous ﬁnancial year to 31 October 2011 was £11.8m.

Enquiring about your shareholding
If you want to ask, or need any information, about your shareholding, 
please contact our registrar (see contact details on the left). 
Alternatively, if you have internet access, you can access the Group’s 
shareholder portal at www.moneysupermarket-shares.com where you 
can, amongst other things, view details of your shareholding, set up or 
amend a dividend mandate and update your address details.
Investor relations website
The investor relations section of our website,  
www.moneysupermarket.com, provides further information for anyone 
interested in the Group. In addition to the Annual Report and share 
price, Company announcements including the half year and full year 
results announcements and associated presentations are also 
published there.
Dividend mandates
If you wish to have dividends paid directly into a bank or building 
society account, you should contact our registrar (see contact details 
on the left) or visit the Group’s shareholder portal at  
www.moneysupermarket-shares.com where you can set up or amend 
a dividend mandate. This method of payment removes the risk of delay 
or loss of dividend cheques in the post and ensures that your account 
is credited on the due date.
Dividend reinvestment plan (‘DRIP’)

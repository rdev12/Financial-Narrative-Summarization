In good shape for 

the new decade 

Lord Sharman of Redlynch OBE 
Chairman 
It is traditional for the Chairman to close his statement by formally thanking 
employees. This year, however, I think it’s more appropriate to begin by saying that 
our strong results for 2009 are due to the extraordinary efforts made by the executive 
team and our people throughout the Aviva group. 
A strong, single brand name is essential for us to compete effectively in the 
global insurance marketplace so the launch of the Aviva name worldwide in 2009 
was fundamental. This was just one of a number of key deliverables during the year 
including: a successful partial sale of our Dutch business, Delta Lloyd, and the 
distribution of monies to our policyholders from the UK inherited estate. 
In a year of ‘business as usual’, these would have been great achievements, so I am 
extremely proud that, through 2009’s adverse conditions, at Aviva we have remained 
strong, resolute and on track. 2010 is unlikely to be any easier but we’re now in an even 
better position to take advantage of new opportunities, and of achieving our vision for 
‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’. 
Dividend 
I am pleased to announce that the final dividend for 2009 will be 15 pence, bringing 
the total dividend to 24 pence. This follows our decision last year to reduce the 
dividend to a sustainable level, from which Aviva can grow over time. Our dividend 
policy remains unchanged and the final dividend cover of 1.8 times remains within 
the 1.5 to 2.0 times target range, which is based on IFRS operating earnings after tax. 
Changes to the Board 
I would like to thank Philip Scott, who retired from his role as chief financial officer 
(CFO) at the end of 2009 with an impressive 36 years’ service with Aviva. With his 
knowledge of the insurance industry, he has successfully navigated us through some 
difficult market conditions. In February 2010, we welcomed Patrick Regan as our new 
CFO. He joined us from Willis Group Holdings in the US where he was group chief 
operating officer and CFO. 
We further strengthened our Board with the appointment of Andrea Moneta, 
chief executive of Aviva Europe, Middle East and Africa, in September 2009. 
Other Board changes include: the retirement after nearly ten years of our senior 
independent non-executive director, Wim Dik; the resignation of Nikesh Arora, 
due to relocation to the United States; the appointment of new independent non-
executive directors, Leslie Van de Walle, former chief executive officer of Rexam plc, 
who joined us in May 2009 and, from January 2010, Michael Hawker, who was 
previously chief executive and managing director of Insurance Australia Group. 
Looking forward 
As a realist, I am sure that 2010 will not be an easy year for the financial markets 
but there may be some cause for optimism as the year progresses. I am particularly 
pleased at how well we have reorganised the business and are ready to take full 
advantage of the upturn when it arrives.

A year of significant 
progress 
I’m pleased with our progress this year. It has been a year of 
strong financial performance and delivery against our strategic 
plans. I’m proud of the way my team has performed and I’m 
confident that by remaining focused on our strategy we will 
make further progress in 2010. 
Aviva has delivered a strong return to profit with IFRS total profit after tax at 
£1,315 million. On an MCEV basis, which takes into account the long-term nature 
of life insurance business, the total profit after tax was £2,935 million compared to 
a loss of £7,707 million in 2008. This rebound in total profits reflects the combined 
effects of a recovery in equity markets, together with our disciplined business 
management and cost control. Operating profit is 12% lower at £2,022 million 
on an IFRS basis and up 3% on an MCEV basis to £3,483 million. 
We have strengthened Aviva’s capital position substantially over the past year 
and IGD solvency surplus, the buffer we hold above our liabilities, has more than 
doubled to £4.5 billion reflecting some bold capital management initiatives and 
a recovery in investment markets. 
We have made excellent progress in the delivery of our strategy, including our 
move to a single brand, the IPO of our Dutch business, the reattribution of the 
inherited estate in the UK and the restructuring of our cost base. 
In driving Aviva forward, we will retain our disciplined approach. We expect the 
external environment to remain unpredictable for some time but are encouraged 
that we saw the first signs of an improved appetite to save among our customers 
in the final quarter of last year. 
We will continue to deliver against the strategy that has helped us to navigate 
the global economic crisis so successfully. We will maximise the value of being a 
single, global group, as we aim to deliver a consistently positive experience for our 
53 million customers around the world. 
Progress 
Creating a global brand has been the most visible sign of ‘One Aviva’ so far. 
We're working hard to ensure it's much more than a name change. 
We're making progress towards delivering ‘twice the value’ – improving the 
way we serve our customers, increasing our efficiency, focusing on profitability, 
removing cost from the business and delivering strong results. 
Regions 
— Successful rebrand to Aviva in the UK 
— Integrating 12 of our businesses in Europe 
— Life assurance portfolio outperforms market in North America 
— Expanded customer reach in Asia Pacific through new bancassurance deals 
— Improved investment and earnings performance for Aviva Investors 
Highlights

— Successful partial sale of Delta Lloyd in the Netherlands for £1 billion 
— Sale of Australian life business 
— £471 million paid to policyholders from reattribution of inherited estate

Aviva plc Group chief executive’s review continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Q 

How has Aviva performed throughout   

a difficult 2009? 
Like all financial services companies, we have 
been affected adversely, both by market 
volatility and understandable customer caution. 
However, the business has stood up well. This 
is due, in part, to our global diversity, having 
both life and general insurance operations and 
also because of the decisive action we have 
taken through the strategy put in place two 
years ago. 
Several months into 2010, we have made 
great progress in transforming our UK business 
under one team. We are also starting to see 
positive results from the creation of our ‘one 
Europe’ operating model. In North America, the 
life market has been really challenged and it’s 
good to see that coming back. In Asia Pacific, 
despite customers being cautious, we have 
continued to grow our business, particularly 
in China and South Korea. Aviva Investors’ 
investment performance has radically improved 
along with solid earnings. 
Q 
How financially strong 
is Aviva? 
We’ve seen a marked improvement in our 
capital position. Focusing on costs in order to 
improve margins has meant that, whilst we have 
seen volumes drop, we still reported a resilient 
operating profit and a strong balance sheet. 
We have worldwide sales of £45 billion and 
£379 billion of funds under management. 
We are managing our financial risks prudently 
and skilfully. 
Q 
Why did you cut your dividend 
mid-year? 
In light of Aviva’s lower IFRS operating 
earnings, the continuing economic uncertainty 
and our desire to retain flexibility, we felt it was 
the right decision to make. So in spite of it 
being a tough decision, we believe it was the 
right one. 
Q 
Do you remain committed to your 
‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ strategy? 
We have made good progress towards our 
target this year. If you compare earnings per 
share of 37.8 pence in 2009 with those of 
2008 (a loss of 36.8 pence), it's a great 
improvement. 
In the past 12 months we’ve increased the 
pace of transformation and restructured our 
portfolio, giving us new opportunities to 
redeploy capital to support profitable growth. 
Our senior management team is committed to 
this target and it remains our focus in 2010.

Q 
How is your business 
changing? 
In 2008 we initiated a programme to create 
a simplified and more modern way of doing 
business to improve efficiency and reflect 
customers’ preference to do business online; 
we’ve invested in new technology and 
streamlined our processes. 
This fundamental change in the way we 
operate means our business is now fit for 
the future, with improved capacity and 
productivity. We have reduced our costs by 
£500 million and Aviva has 19% fewer 
employees than two years ago. 
What's really pleasing is that during this 
period our customer satisfaction has improved, 
with nearly 70% of our businesses at or above 
the local market benchmark and 50% are in 
the upper quartile. 
Q 
What are you most proud of 
in 2009? 
I'm most proud of our people: their dedication 
and resilience over the past year has been 
incredible. They've remained focused on what 
we're here for – delivering prosperity and peace 
of mind to our customers – and have done a 
great job. 
I’ve already talked about our financial 
strength and the strategically significant 
achievements in our business. However, none 
of this could have been done without the hard 
work of all of our people around the world. 
Looking forward – how would you
Q 
sum up your priorities for 2010? 
There’s no question that the economic climate 
remains uncertain: 2010 is still challenging but 
I’m confident we have the right team, strategy 
and commitment to make it another successful 
year. We will continue to deliver our strategy, 
maintain our capital strength and focus on the 
profitable growth of our company. 
53 million customers place their business 
with us. That’s a great responsibility and we 
will be working harder than ever in 2010 to 
continue to earn their trust and attract new 
customers to Aviva.

Aviva plc 
Group strategy 	
Our purpose is to deliver prosperity and 
peace of mind to our customers. We will do 
this by realising our vision: ’One Aviva, Twice 
the Value’. 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
In support of our purpose and our ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ vision, Aviva provides a composite portfolio of life and pensions, 
general insurance, health insurance and asset management products through a multi-channel distribution approach. Working 
together across regions under one Aviva brand provides greater financial stability and flexibility through diversification and a 
reduced reliance on any one channel, product, country or customer group. 
Progress on our current strategic priorities is set out below. 
Our strategic priorities 
Manage composite portfolio 
We are fully committed to maintaining the composite nature 
of the group. We firmly believe in the benefits of life 
insurance, general insurance and asset management as 
complementary parts of an overall business model that 
balances cashflow, returns and long-term value creation, and 
delivers prosperity and peace of mind to customers. 
Build global asset management 
Launched in September 2008, Aviva Investors is a clear example 
of the ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ strategy in action. Integrating 
our global asset management businesses under one umbrella, 
Aviva Investors is now a leading asset manager, with offices in 15 
countries and £250 billion of funds under management. We plan 
to continue to grow Aviva Investors and significantly increase its 
contribution to group profits. 
Progress 2009 
Active management of our composite model provided us with strength in a 
challenging environment, specifically: 
— Focused on profitability above sales volume by exercising price discipline and 
leadership in general insurance and by increasing margins and driving long-term 
value creation in life and pensions 
— Robust performance in Europe benefiting from our strong bancassurance 
relationships despite the challenging environment with excellent sales 
performance in Italy (55%) and France (26%) 
— Strengthened our position in Asia through strong growth in China (15%) and 
Korea (93%). Withdrew capital intensive products in Hong Kong and Taiwan 
— Brought UK life and general insurance businesses together under a single 
management team 
— Grew Aviva Investors worldwide (see below) 
— Achieved robust investment performance across all key markets around the globe 
— Experienced positive net flows of £2.4 billion from third party clients in difficult 
market conditions 
— Enhanced our global distribution and manufacturing capability 
— Made significant progress in building a truly global business development 
capability and achieved a strong sales pipeline across a range of asset classes 
and markets 
— Achieved top quartile ranking in the most recent UK Greenwich Quality Index 
measuring client service and investment performance 
Allocate capital rigorously 
Capital management will continue to be a key focus. Capital 
is treated as a scarce resource, and is allocated to provide the 
highest sustainable returns for shareholders. We continuously 
seek improvements in capital structure and efficiency. 
Strengthened our capital position through a combination of successful strategic 
initiatives and disciplined capital and balance sheet management including: 
— Robust underlying earnings rebuilding our capital base 
— IPO of Delta Lloyd in the Netherlands 
— Sale of Australian business 
— Reattribution of inherited estate in UK 
Multi-channel customer reach 
We sell our products in 28 countries in ways that our 
customers choose to buy them. We will get closer to our 
customers through better understanding of their needs and 
by providing products and services that customers want. 
We will continue looking for the right distribution in the 
right markets. 
Boost productivity 
We constantly look for ways to boost our productivity, to 
support sustainable growth, increase our competitiveness, 
improve our services, and deliver higher value to our 
customers. Working together as ’One Aviva‘, we deliver 
operational excellence through shared services, shared 
knowledge, rationalised systems and effective outsourcing. 
— Implemented initiatives to improve the customer experience and support the 
Aviva brand overall (such as introducing the Aviva Customer Cup to promote 
customer focused projects) 
— Expanded our distribution reach through renewal of DBS bancassurance 
agreement which now extends to markets such as China and India 
— Successfully carried out our major rebrand campaign in the UK creating a 
significant increase in spontaneous awareness among consumers 
— Invested in our e-commerce capability in the UK with the launch of Aviva for 
Advisers website and made our online pension tracker proposition available to 
over 1 million customers 
— Created further value from our leading and unique bancassurance franchise in 
Aviva Europe with sales growth of 14% in 2009 
— 50% of all business units participating in our annual benchmarked relationship 
survey were ranked upper quartile by customers when compared to local 
market averages 
— Achieved £510 million of cost savings against £500 million target including 
reducing total headcount from 54,000 in 2008 to 46,000 in 2009 
— Developed a leaner ‘One Aviva’ operating model through: 
– 	 Increased use of regional shared services in all regions 
– 	 Implementation of centres of excellence in technology 
– 	 Outsourced part of the UK Life book to Swiss Re, outsourced IT data centres 
in UK and Canada and transferred UK Life Lifetime and Collectives 
administration to Scottish Friendly and IFDS, respectively

Our strategy and priorities need to be responsive to any changes in the external environment that may provide opportunities or 
cause strategic risks. These potential changes include capital market developments, an evolving regulatory environment, changes 
in the competitive landscape, development of major trends (such as climate change, changing consumer behaviour and improving 
longevity) or the emergence of potential discontinuities (such as a pandemic). 
We manage these risks and opportunities through disciplined risk management. For further details refer to the risk

Performance review 
Return on equity shareholders’ funds 
The improvement in 2009 to 16.2% (2008: 11.0%) 
reflects the increase in the post-tax MCEV operating 
result and the impact of lower opening equity 
shareholder’s funds following falls in asset values 
in 2008. 
Employee engagement and leadership 
Key performance indicators relating to our 
employees’ views on Aviva are based on questions 
in our annual global ‘Employee Promise’ survey. We 
changed our external provider in 2009 and we now 
report and set targets in line with their stronger 
global financial service (GFS) benchmark norms. To 
ensure consistency, we have therefore removed the 
historical trend data.

benchmark with 12 in the upper quartile. The ratio 
beating benchmark is the same as 2008; however, 
more businesses are in the upper quartile rankings. 
Relevancy 
— Return on equity 
shareholders’ funds is 
calculated as after-tax 
operating return, before 
adjusting items, on opening 
equity shareholders’ funds, 
including life profits on a

— Employee engagement 
represents the degree to 
which people believe in Aviva 
being a great place to work 
and are contributing to help 
meet our collective goals and

— The survey results are used 
each year to determine and

Aviva UK Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
A leader in our home market 
From 1 January 2010 we have brought together 
the Aviva UK life and general insurance 
businesses, creating a new organisation led by 
one chief executive officer. In 2009, in addition 
to completing the rebranding to Aviva, both 
businesses have continued their extensive 
transformation programmes, which will make 
significant improvements to customer service, 
and they have delivered combined cost savings 
of £450 million, a year ahead of plan. 
Strategy 
Our core strategies for the UK business are: 
— to leverage our extensive distribution network and customer 
base to increase profits in a mature but evolving marketplace 
— to maintain market leadership through balanced distribution 
and broad product mix, improved customer retention and 
the simplification of processes, services and costs 
Aviva UK 
Total sales were £14,261 million in 2009, down 24% on 
2008. IFRS operating profit for the year decreased 15% to 
£1,165 million reflecting the impact of lower premiums and 
lower investment returns. These results are discussed in more 
detail on page 44 of this report. 
The rebrand to Aviva in the UK took place on 1 June 2009. 
Our successful advertising campaigns, highlighting Aviva’s 
products and services and encouraging customers to ‘get the 
Aviva deal’, have increased recognition and awareness of the 
Aviva brand significantly. 
UK life business 
Market environment 
During 2009 the overall long-term savings market declined by 
17%
1
. This contraction, for the second consecutive year, was 
primarily driven by falls in the pension and bond markets as 
lower consumer confidence, limited salary increases and higher 
unemployment reduced customers’ propensity to save and 
invest for the future. Specific regulatory events, such as the 
cessation of sales of single premium creditor business, also 
impacted the market. Despite this, we have maintained a 
disciplined focus on profitability, significantly improving our 
new business margin. 
Performance 
In the UK life market, Aviva has built a leading position across 
a broad product range. We have gained competitive advantage 
through our financial strength, product development and taking 
actions to simplify the business making it easier for customers. 
We delivered new propositions recognising consumer 
needs, including offering 12-months, free life cover to new 
parents, the launch of a With-Profit Guaranteed bond and 
recently re-opening our Wrap and Sipp platforms to new 
business. Our innovative Simplified Life protection product 
continues to go from strength to strength with a 147% increase 
in new applications compared to 2008, whilst our market-
leading individual annuity pricing capability attained record new 
business volumes for this product in the fourth quarter of 2009.

 Source: Association of British Insurers (ABI) 
As a result of our major simplification and efficiency initiatives, 
designed to better meet customer needs, we have outsourced 
the administration of almost three million policies to industry 
experts: Swiss Re, Scottish Friendly and International Financial 
Data Services. We have decommissioned over 300 IT systems, 
delivered a more flexible cost base and made £100 million of 
annualised cost savings. 
We have continued to invest in our e-commerce offerings 
with the launch of further new propositions to help our 
customers and distribution partners. ‘Customer Portal’ and 
‘Aviva for Advisers’ provide secure online access to over 
4.5 million policies, enabling customers and advisers to manage 
their Aviva life products quickly and easily at a time convenient 
to them. We were also the first in the industry to offer a virtual 
online guide as part of our innovative ‘Pension Tracker’, making 
it possible for almost 1.5 million customers to manage their 
Aviva pension plans online. This approach contributed to Aviva 
winning the Personal Finance ‘Pension Provider of the Year’ 
award voted for by customers and judged on proposition 
quality, brand, service and sustainability. 
Throughout 2009 our commitment to deliver service 
excellence has driven improved satisfaction and advocacy 
results. By listening to and understanding what matters most 
to our customers and distributors, we can ensure they have 
a better service experience. 
Outlook 
We expect the market to remain challenging in the short term 
as the impact of the recession continues to influence demand 
for investment and savings products. Longer term, major 
regulatory changes including the Retail Distribution Review 
and Solvency II will be implemented. Our strategies will enable 
us to exploit the opportunities emerging in our market as we 
continue to build on our e-commerce and service capability and 
product and distribution breadth. 
Fair reattribution payments 
Following the announcement in May 2009 of a new, more 
flexible offer – and the subsequent FSA and High Court 
approval in September – the reattribution of our inherited 
estate completed on 1 October. Our objective was always to 
create a reattribution that was fair to both shareholders and 
policyholders, making sure that customers had a choice of 
whether they wished to accept the offer, depending on their 
personal circumstances. As a result, over 87% of eligible 
policyholders voted during the election process, with 96% of 
these voting in favour of the offer. By the end of 2009, the 
majority of the £471 million reattribution payment had been 
distributed to those policyholders who accepted the offer.

UK general insurance business 
Market environment 
2009 has been a challenging year, with strong competition and 
the recession impacting all lines of business. More customers 
are searching for cheaper deals, while fewer are making 
discretionary purchases such as breakdown cover. A significant 
fall in creditor volumes, resulting from lower lending, was 
compounded by a sharp rise in creditor claims. Fewer start-ups, 
more business failures and reduced exposures have resulted in 
shrinking commercial markets. However, there have been some 
recent encouraging signs that more realistic pricing is emerging 
in the market, particularly in personal motor. 
Performance 
The UK general insurance operation has significantly improved 
the profitability of business written in 2009. By simplifying the 
business, reducing costs, achieving scale benefits and taking a 
disciplined approach to underwriting and distribution, we have 
created a platform for future growth. 
Progress on our transformation programme remains ahead 
of plan, with all business now being undertaken in our new 
‘centres of excellence’. We are on track to deliver annualised 
savings of more than our £150 million target from this phase by 
2010, in addition to savings of £200 million already delivered. 
We have refocused our brands to offer our customers the 
best price when they buy direct from Aviva supported by our 
‘Get the Aviva Deal’ marketing campaign, complemented by 
the RAC panel which is available on all major online price 
comparison sites and supported by 17 insurers. The impact has 
been extremely positive: we sold more direct personal motor 
policies in the fourth quarter than in the same period in the 
previous three years and the RAC panel had gained a share of 
around 3.5% of new business in the UK personal motor market 
by the end of 2009. 
Overall business volumes have fallen reflecting the action 
we have taken to exit unprofitable business and the challenging 
market conditions. We continue to support independent brokers 
through a range of initiatives including customised networks 
(such as the Broker Independence Group and Club 110) as well 
as providing easy and fast access to our best prices. In addition, 
we were delighted to renew the Barclays homeowner account. 
Outlook 
In the general insurance market, quality of earnings remains our 
priority and we aim to increase profitability through enhanced 
risk selection and tightly controlling our costs. Whilst there are 
some encouraging signs in personal motor, we continue to see 
intense competition in many segments of the market and we 
await the significant shift in attitude that the market requires.

This is particularly true in the case of Commercial lines and there 
is little evidence that the market is hardening significantly. 
RAC insurance 
RAC continues from strength to strength as a leading UK service 
brand, coming fifth in the Institute of Customer Service’s 2009 
survey, comparable with John Lewis, Waitrose and M&S. In its 
core breakdown category it won the JD Power survey for an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive year. The service culture is 
not just delivered by our patrol staff either: RAC’s membership 
call centre entered the Times Top 50 UK call centres at 14th. 
In January 2009 we launched our car insurance panel under 
the iconic RAC brand to complement our existing direct offering 
from Aviva. This ensures that almost every customer that calls us 
can be provided cover at competitive prices. The panel is on all 
the major online price comparison sites and it is writing growing 
volumes of business through this channel of distribution.

Aviva plc 
Europe Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Building a truly pan-European 
business with a broad and 
diverse portfolio 
We have a clear strategy to exploit the 
considerable opportunities in Europe. There 
is significant growth potential in the region, 
in both under-penetrated Western markets and 
developing markets in Eastern Europe. With our 
proven ability to operate across distribution 
channels, we will be able to respond favourably 
to market developments as customer confidence 
begins to return. 
Strategy 
Our strategy is to capitalise on the significant opportunities 
within Europe through: 
— Aviva Europe’s Quantum Leap transformation plan, 
creating one market leading pan-European business 
from 12 federated businesses, 
— the strategic development of our 58% investment in 
Delta Lloyd following the IPO in November 2009. 
Our principal financial objective is long-term, sustainable, 
profitable growth. 
Market environment 
Europe is already the largest insurance market in the world with 
an affluent population of over 800 million people, generating 
31% of global insurance premiums
1
 and accounting for over 
30% of global personal financial assets
2
. Europe offers 
significant growth opportunities in both under-penetrated 
Western markets and developing markets in Eastern Europe. 
As elsewhere, the slowdown in economic growth has 
impacted customer behaviour in the majority of the region 
with customers favouring deposit bank accounts or guaranteed 
insurance products. Customer confidence is beginning to return 
particularly in France, Italy and Poland where customers are 
starting to re-invest in more attractive insurance products such 
as unit-linked bonds. 
Aviva Europe performance 
Aviva Europe operates in 12 businesses across Europe (excluding 

the UK) with substantial operations in France, Italy, Ireland,  

Poland and Spain. We also have a presence in the developing  

markets in Central and Eastern Europe of Czech Republic, 

Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Slovakia.
 
As part of our strategy, we are transforming our 12 federated 

businesses through our Quantum Leap programme into one 

market leading pan-European business.

2. Aviva/Oliver Wyman research (2007) – UK is excluded. 
3. Millward Brown Lansdowne study, Q3 2009. 
4. Retail refers to the sale of insurance products outside of the bancassurance chanel through 
our direct sales force, IFAs, brokers or internet sales. 
Since January 2010, Aviva Europe has assumed responsibility 
for developing Aviva’s business interests in the Middle East, 
based in the United Arab Emirates. We expect this high-
potential market to grow, benefiting from Aviva Europe’s 
experience and resources. 
We achieved total sales of £16,258 million during 2009, 
up 8% on 2008. IFRS operating profit for the year decreased 
4% to £797 million, reflecting exceptional weather losses in 
France and Ireland. These results are discussed in more detail 
on page 45 of this report. 
We have made significant progress in our migration to a 
single Aviva brand. Having operated as Hibernian Aviva in 2009, 
we adopted the Aviva name in Ireland at the start of 2010 and 
we will complete our brand migration programme in June 2010 
when we will operate as Aviva in Poland. Recognition of the 
Aviva brand continues to grow in both markets, with Ireland 
recording prompted awareness rates in excess of 90%
3
. 
Our bancassurance franchise is the largest in Europe with 
50 bank agreements and our retail
4 
channel accesses nine 
million customers through 18,000 financial advisers. With this 
proven ability to operate across distribution channels, we are 
able to meet different customer preferences and respond 
favourably to market developments. 
Our business is performing strongly in both distribution 
channels. In retail, our partnership with AFER, a leading savings 
association in France, continues to be extremely successful 
with customer numbers growing by 5% to 712,000 in 2009. 
In bancassurance, our Italian partnership with Banco Popolare 
that commenced in 2008 performed strongly in highly profitable 
protection products, one of our key strategic objectives. 
In 2009, we developed our suite of guaranteed products which 
have proved attractive particularly in France, Spain and Italy. 
Being there for customers in times of need is crucial: 
following flooding and storms in France during 2009, we paid 
out 90% of claims in the year. And to reinforce this, 94% of 
our customers in France who were hit by Hurricane Klaus were 
happy with the way we handled their claims.

Germany. In 2009, we completed the successful IPO and partial 
sale of Delta Lloyd on Euronext Amsterdam with gross proceeds 
of £1 billion for a 42% stake. This was a significant strategic 
milestone in our management of Delta Lloyd and gives us 
further opportunity to reallocate capital within the group. 
The market environment in the Netherlands remained 
challenging, with weak asset values constraining activity in the 
corporate pensions market, before improving in the latter part 
of the year when Delta Lloyd secured two large group contracts. 
Total sales in 2009 of £5,492 million were down 18% reflecting 
the sale of the health business. IFRS operating profit for the year 
increased 29% to £399 million. These results are discussed in 
more detail on page 46 of this report. 
Delta Lloyd continues to offer innovative, high quality 
products backed by strong fund management performance. 
In June, in collaboration with Rabobank, Delta Lloyd launched 
a €200 million fund, which offers an alternative source of 
capital for promising Dutch ventures. 
In 2009, we successfully integrated the Swiss Life Belgium 
operation with our existing Belgian life operations. Belgium 
extended the ABN AMRO distribution arrangement to include 
Fortis branches when they are rebranded in 2010. 
Outlook 
Market conditions will continue to vary considerably between 
countries: the recession is still challenging in Ireland, Spain and 
Hungary but we are seeing signs of recovery in France, Italy and 
Poland. By continuing to carefully balance profit generation and 
investment opportunities across our broad and diverse portfolio 
and by enhancing innovative customer focused offerings, we 
are confident that we can benefit from the growth potential 
within Europe. 
Aviva Europe: Making a ‘Quantum Leap’ 
in performance 
In 2009, we announced our new strategy to make a ‘Quantum 
Leap’ in performance by integrating the operations of our 
12 separate Aviva Europe businesses. We are creating a single 
pan-European organisation which will create significant value 
for Aviva’s customers and shareholders. 
By moving to a pan-European operating model, we are 
simplifying our product range, shortening the time to launch 
new products for our customers and making significant 
efficiency gains by centralising our operations, enabling us to 
improve cost management, grow net profits and enhance 
dividends remitted to the Group. 
As part of our transformation, we are also establishing a 
single holding company for our European operations in Ireland. 
This new structure will deliver economic, operational and 
regulatory benefits, especially with the anticipated introduction 
of Solvency II in 2012. 
Our two pan-European distribution channels, 
bancassurance and retail, supported by pan-European product 
development, operations and governance will enable us to 
take full advantage of the significant growth potential and 
opportunities in Europe and contribute fully to the 'One Aviva, 
Twice the Value' target.

Aviva plc 
North America Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Poised to benefit from recovery in 
the world’s wealthiest market 
The North American marketplace provides us with 
access to a strategically attractive population with 
a growing demand for products that offer 
prosperity and peace of mind in both the general 
insurance and life and annuities marketplaces. 
Strategy 
We will continue to grow our existing businesses and raise 
our profile in North America on the back of the strength of 
the global brand, communicating with financial analysts, key 
financial and business media, consumers and distributors. 
Our strategic priorities for the region are: 
— to enhance capital efficiency and optimise margins 
— to selectively expand and grow our core life insurance 
and annuity distribution and product capabilities 
— to operate as a great underwriting company 
— to make best use of the synergies created within the regional 
operating model 
— to enhance strong and valuable relationships with our 
customers and distributors. 
Market environment 
The US economy, and its financial sector in particular, suffered 
a severe contraction as a result of the financial crisis. The 
recession also had a major impact on Canada, the US’ largest 
trading partner. There are now increasing signs of economic 
recovery and, despite the recession, North America’s economies 
remain among the world’s largest and its population among 
the world’s wealthiest. 
Performance 
Total sales were £6,345 million in 2009, down 13% on 2008. 
IFRS operating profit for the year improved 43% to £213 million 
reflecting the improved long-term and savings result. Our 
financial results are discussed in more detail on page 47 of 
this report. 
In our US business we have deliberately moderated annuity 
sales in comparison to the prior year and centred on capital 
management. We have grown our life insurance portfolio, 
outperforming in a market that contracted by 19% in the 
first nine months of the year. 
In the Canadian business we have focused on initiatives 
that improve our operational and underwriting effectiveness. 
Examples include the implementation of our three-company 
model, enabling us to price the auto business in the heavily 
regulated Ontario market more accurately, and enhanced 
underwriting through the use of more standardised and 
automated processes. Elsewhere the Canadian business has 
seen an unusually high frequency of large losses through 
a combination of commercial fires and Ontario personal 
auto claims. 
As part of the ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ strategy, we 
are consolidating each of our non-market-facing functions 
into single North American business areas giving us improved 
capability at lower cost. 
Outlook 
A number of economic indicators are starting to point to a 
steady recovery in 2010. We will continue to grow our life 
insurance portfolio in the US and our contribution to total Aviva 
profits, building on 2009 successes. We await the outcome of 
the SEC151A debate concerning the future regulation of 
annuity products and will respond appropriately. In Canada we 
will further enhance our underwriting processes to improve risk 
selection, profitability and capital efficiency. 
Innovative pricing 
In the Canadian business we have successfully implemented 
an innovative approach to the pricing of personal property 
business known as ‘Rate by Peril’. We have used a detailed 
and sophisticated mapping approach combined with proprietary 
and public information to deconstruct the blended approach 
to pricing used for multi-peril household policies. Using this 
approach we are able to determine a unique rate for each 
individual property reflecting its unique exposure to the perils 
covered by the policy including fire, water damage, wind-storm, 
sewer back-up, theft and liability. The increased pricing 
precision that we are able to apply enables us to ‘right-price‘ 
each property.

Aviva plc 
Asia Pacific Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Committed to building a high-
growth and value-creating region 
We operate in eight countries across the Asia 
Pacific region through both joint ventures and 
wholly-owned operations. India and China, 
both with large populations and relatively high 
economic growth, are ‘must-win’ markets 
capable of generating a significant proportion 
of our future expansion within Asia. Throughout 
the rest of the region, our focus is on developing 
the strength of our bancassurance business with 
joint venture partners. 
Strategy 
Our ambition is to build a high growth and value-creating 
region driven by the ‘must-win’ markets of China and India. 
We will achieve this by: 
— securing strong organic growth across all our markets 
— leveraging our multi-distribution platforms and core 
capabilities in bancassurance 
— exploring new growth opportunities in particular health 
and general insurance 
— expanding our regional footprint in fast-growing, high 
potential insurance markets 
— investing in the Aviva brand. 
Market environment 
Trading conditions were difficult in 2009. Long-term savings 
sales were affected by the economic climate as investors turned 
to low volatility investments such as bank deposits. The industry 
also experienced an increase in lapses and clients exercising 
their premium holiday options. 
Performance 
Total sales were £2,712 million in 2009, down 22% on 2008. 
IFRS operating profit for the year improved 114% to £77 million 
reflecting the improved long-term and savings result. Our 
financial results are discussed in more detail on page 48 of 
this report. 
During 2009, customers’ increased caution has led to 
a growing demand for protection and health products and 
those savings products with guarantee features. We have 
strengthened our proposition in these areas which, together 
with our investment product capabilities, will enable us to 
harness the expected economic rebound. 
We made substantial efforts to conserve capital and control 
costs, reducing the sale of capital intensive products in Hong 
Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan and implementing a region-wide 
cost-reduction programme. The sale of our Australian business 
in October also realised a £0.4 billion contribution to capital. 
As part of our commitment to achieving ‘One Aviva, Twice 
the Value’, we launched a number of new initiatives in the 
region. These included our wrap platform in Hong Kong and 
new protection, savings and investment products, both 
conventional and Takaful (Islamic insurance), in Malaysia 
through our shared services platform. 
We expanded our customer reach in local markets during 
the year with a particular focus on bancassurance: we renewed 
our partnership with DBS Bank in Singapore and Hong Kong 
until 2015, extended to additional markets in India, China and 
Taiwan, and also agreed extended terms with key partners in

India. We opened our tenth provincial branch in China, ahead 
of our 2010 target; achieved encouraging sales through Woori 
Bank in South Korea and opened 13 new branches around the 
Seoul area. 
Outlook 
Looking forward, we expect recovery in Asia Pacific to be ahead 
of other regions. Prospects for 2010 are more optimistic with 
the Asia Development Bank predicting GDP growth of 6.6% 
for emerging Asia versus 4.3% in 2009. We are committed 
to building a high-growth and value-creating region and 
establishing Aviva as a leading international player in Asia. 
Joint venture in Malaysia 
We signed a joint venture partner deal with CIMB, the second 
largest bank in Malaysia in 2007 to capitalise on its distribution 
network by providing market leading insurance products and 
excellent servicing capability. To achieve this we drew on our 
regional shared services capability and technical infrastructure 
in Singapore to deliver and administer the product set. We 
successfully launched a portfolio (EasyLife Solutions) of 10 
investment-linked products within a six-month timeframe. 
Sales of EasyLife Solutions have gone from strength to strength, 
contributing to our position as fourth in the industry for single 
premium business in 2009. This has also strengthened our 
partnership with CIMB at all levels.

Aviva plc 
Aviva Investors Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Focused on clients, focused 
on performance 
Aviva Investors combines the group’s asset 
management components into a single, globally 
integrated business. We manage internal funds 
for Aviva, as well as for a growing range of 
institutional and retail third party clients. Our 
focus on client service has brought external 
recognition and contributed to a strong 
performance in 2009. 
Strategy 
Our core strategic objective is to build our presence as a globally 
integrated asset manager and establish Aviva Investors as a 
leading player in the market for retirement solutions. 
We aim to increase revenues and profitability by delivering 
significant growth in higher-margin assets under management 
from external clients. 
The key strategic imperatives central to our success are: 
— our commitment to client focus, delivering investment 
solutions that fully meet their requirements 
— delivering strong investment performance to underpin 
product sales activity 
— finalising the roll-out of a global business development 
function with a footprint in mature and emerging markets 
— a high performance culture that rewards those who make 
the strongest contribution to the achievement of our goals 
— further increases in business effectiveness and efficiency 
through the adoption of global core processes 
Market environment 
Following a turbulent start to 2009, market conditions improved 
with some markets registering their best annual performance 
in over 20 years. The pace of any further rally across markets is 
likely to be more modest with the uncertainty around central 
banks removing stimulus measures. Although some economies 
remain in recession, we remain optimistic that recovery will 
gather pace. 
Performance 
IFRS operating profit was in line with the prior year at 
£115 million while funds under management increased 6% 
to £250 billion as markets recovered. Our financial results 
are discussed in more detail on page 48 of this report. 
A number of positive trends emerged to support our 
strategic objectives in 2009. Our focus on client service gained 
us improved rankings in UK-focused independent client 
service/investment performance surveys for investment quality. 
Investment performance was also an area of strength. Where 
clients have specified performance benchmarks, Aviva Investors 
has met or exceeded 83% of these over one year and 68% 
over three years, with particularly strong performance in France, 
Australia and Poland. We also generated record levels of 
performance fees. 
Our liquidity funds attracted strong inflows in France and 
the UK and from our continental European distribution channel 
through our SICAV range. In the UK, our Sterling Government 
Liquidity and Sterling Liquidity Funds gained Standard & Poor’s 
highest possible ‘AAAm’ stability rating. 
We have made significant progress in developing a global 
marketing, sales and distribution capability, re-engineering our 
global business development function to facilitate sales to 
external clients and underpin our client-centric approach. This 
was enhanced by group-led PR and advertising for the global 
rebrand, which helped to cement trust in, and recognition of, 
the Aviva name in both established and new markets and by 
our own marketing efforts which helped to raise Aviva Investors’ 
profile in a competitive market. 
Aviva Investors also received a number of external accolades 
in Austria, Singapore, Australia and the UK. In November we 
were proud to work alongside the United Nations for the launch 
of their report on ‘sustainable stock exchanges’, a programme 
that is continuing in 2010. 
Outlook 
Since Aviva Investors launched in September 2008 we have 
made strong progress. The loss of confidence in financial 
markets has meant that clients are increasingly looking for 
risk-aware investment options and, as an insurance-owned 
asset manager, we are well placed to capitalise on that trend. 
We look forward to 2010 with confidence and anticipation. 
Listening to our clients 
First Securities Investment Trust (FSITC) is a leading asset 
manager, marketing investment products to customers in 
Taiwan. In 2009, we won a mandate to handle a new global 
high yield product through our high yield investment team in 
North America. We supported the local Aviva Investors team 
in Taiwan and managed FSITC’s successful initial offering. 
As a follow-up, we initiated a customer survey to ensure 
that issues and insights from FSITC were captured and acted 
upon. Despite the significant commercial success of the new 
launch the survey uncovered some concerns and a need for 
improvement on operations and communications. 
We were able to act quickly and decisively to resolve these 
concerns. FSITC’s response was very positive: our actions had 
shown that we had listened to their feedback at a senior level, 
creating a much stronger relationship.

Information on the company Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
History and development of Aviva 
General 
We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws 
of England and Wales. We are one of the world’s leading global 
insurance groups. We are the fifth largest insurance group in 
the world, based on gross written premiums for the 2008 year. 
We are one of the top five providers of long-term insurance and 
savings products in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and 
Spain and one of the top 10 providers of long-term insurance 
and savings products in France, Italy, Hungary and Romania for 
2008. More detail is provided within the operating segment 
review later in this section. Our main activities are the provision 
of products and services in relation to long-term insurance and 
savings, general insurance and fund management. 
Our history 
The Group was formed by the merger of CGU plc and Norwich 
Union plc on 30 May 2000. CGU plc was renamed CGNU plc on 
completion of the merger, and subsequently renamed Aviva plc 
on 1 July 2002. 
CGU plc and Norwich Union plc were both major UK-based 
insurers operating in the long-term insurance business and 
general insurance markets. Both companies had long corporate 
histories. CGU plc was formed in 1998 from the merger of 
Commercial Union plc and General Accident plc. Hand in Hand, 
which was incorporated in 1696, was acquired by Commercial 
Union in 1905, which itself was incorporated in 1861. General 
Accident plc was incorporated in 1865. Norwich Union plc was 
founded as a mutual society in 1797 and operated as such until 
1997, when Norwich Union plc demutualised and became an 
English public limited company. 
Between 2000 and 2002 we actively withdrew from lines 
of business and markets that did not offer the potential for 
market-leading positions or superior returns, or did not otherwise 
meet our strategic objectives, principally through the disposal 
of property and casualty businesses in the UK London Market, 
the US, Australia, New Zealand and certain European countries. 
Since 2002, we have grown in part through carefully 
selected acquisitions, in particular the acquisitions of RAC 
in 2005 and AmerUs in 2006. 
During 2009, we disposed of our long-term and savings 
and wealth management in Australia and through an IPO we 
sold approximately 42% of our Dutch business, Delta Lloyd. 
As at 1 January 2010, we have integrated our life, general 
insurance and health businesses in the UK under one CEO. 
On 5 January 2010, we announced the acquisition of River 
Road Asset Management, a US equity manager, to support 
the expansion of Aviva Investors business. 
Further details of recent acquisitions and disposals can 
be found in the section “Financial statements IFRS – Note 3 – 
Subsidiaries”. 
Business overview 
Our aims and strategy 
In support of our purpose and our ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ 
vision, Aviva provides a composite portfolio of life and pensions, 
general insurance, health insurance and asset management 
products through a multi-channel distribution approach. 
Working together across regions under one Aviva brand 
provides greater financial stability and flexibility through 
diversification and a reduced reliance on any one channel, 
product, country or customer group. In summary our five 
strategic priorities are: 
Shareholder information 
Financial statements IFRS 
Financial statements MCEV 
Other information 
— To manage the composite portfolio of life, general 
insurance and fund management 
We are fully committed to maintaining the composite 
nature of the group. We firmly believe in the benefits of 
life insurance, general insurance and fund management as 
complementary parts of an overall business model that seeks 
to balance cash flow, returns and long-term value creation. 
— To build a global asset management business that will 
foster investment performance and create solutions 
We have significant asset management functions across 
the group. These businesses have historically been managed 
separately and we are now bringing them together in a 
global asset management business, Aviva Investors, in order 
to capitalise on existing strengths around the world and 
leverage those strengths in key product and specialist areas. 
Our goal is that Aviva Investors will foster investment 
performance and create solutions under a single brand 
across the world, with an increased focus on obtaining 
new external clients. 
— To allocate capital rigorously to provide the highest 
sustainable returns for our shareholders 
Capital management will continue to be a key focus for 
us going forward. We treat capital as a scarce resource, 
and strive to allocate capital to provide the highest 
sustainable returns for shareholders. We continuously 
seek improvements in capital structure and efficiency. 
— To increase our customer reach through better 
understanding customer needs 
We sell our products in 28 countries in the way that our 
customers choose to buy them. We will continue looking 
for the right distribution in the right markets. We believe 
we can get closer to our customers through better 
understanding their needs, which would further our goal to 
generate profitable sales, by providing products and services 
that customers want at a fair price. 
— To boost productivity to increase our competitiveness, 
improve our services and deliver higher value to 
our customers 
We constantly look for ways to boost our productivity, 
to support our sustainable growth, increase our 
competitiveness, improve our services and deliver higher 
value to our customers. Working together as ’One Aviva‘, we 
deliver operational excellence through shared services, shared 
knowledge, rationalised systems and effective outsourcing. 
Our business 
Overview 
Our principal activity is the provision of financial products and 
services, focused on the following lines of business: long-term 
insurance and savings business, fund management and general 
insurance and health. 
Our business is managed on a geographic basis through 
a regional management structure based on four regions, UK, 
Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. The four regions 
function as six operating segments as both the UK and Europe 
regions are split into two operating segments. Due to the size 
of the UK region it is split into the UK Life and UK General 
Insurance segments, which undertake long-term insurance and 
savings business and general insurance respectively. In Europe, 
Delta Lloyd is managed separately from the other European 
businesses; therefore the region is split into Aviva Europe and 
Delta Lloyd operating segments. 
Aviva Investors, our fund management business and sixth 
operating segment, operates across all four regions providing

fund management services to third-party investors and to our 
long-term insurance business and general insurance operations. 
Our geographic operating segments offer the following lines 
of business to a greater or lesser extent: 
Long-term insurance and savings business 
Long-term insurance and savings business accounted for over 
80% of our total business based on sales for the year ended 
31 December 2009. We reported total long-term insurance and 
savings new business sales of £32.0 billion and investment sales 
of £3.9 billion for the year ended 31 December 2009. Our focus 
remains on growing our business profitably and improving our 
operational efficiency so that we can fully benefit as our major 
markets return to economic growth. 
Market position 
In the UK we have a market share of 10% based on annual 
premium equivalent (APE) according to the Association of British 
Insurers (ABI) 2009 data. APE is a recognised sales measure in 
the UK and is the total of new annual premiums plus 10% of 
single premiums. Long-term insurance and savings products in 
the UK represented 22% of our worldwide sales for the year 
ended 31 December 2009. 
Long-term insurance products from our European 
businesses (excluding the UK) represented 42% of total group 
worldwide sales for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
In North America the purchase of AmerUs in the United 
States was completed on 15 November 2006 for consideration 
of £1.7 billion. This operation has been rebranded to trade as 
Aviva USA and is ranked first in both fixed indexed life and 
fixed indexed annuity products in 2008, according to LIMRA 
and AnnuitySpecs. 
In the Asia Pacific region we operate in eight countries 
with businesses at different stages of development. 
Brands and products 
In the UK we operated under the Norwich Union brand until 
June 2009, when Norwich Union became Aviva. Following the 
rebrand of Hibernian Aviva in Ireland to Aviva on 11 January 
2010, we operate under the brand name Aviva throughout 
Europe and the rest of the world, except in Poland and the 
Netherlands, where we operate under the names Aviva 
Commercial Union and Delta Lloyd, respectively. The business 
in Poland will fully adopt the Aviva name in June 2010. The 
brand in the Netherlands, Delta Lloyd, will remain unchanged. 
Our long-term insurance and savings businesses offer a 
broad range of life insurance and asset accumulation products. 
Our products are split into the following categories: 
— Pensions – a means of providing income in retirement for an 
individual and possibly his or her dependants. Our pension 
products include personal and group pensions, stakeholder 
pensions and income drawdown. 
— Annuities – a type of policy that pays out regular amounts 
of benefit, either immediately and for the remainder of a 
person’s lifetime, or deferred to commence from a future 
date. Immediate annuities may be purchased for an 
individual and his or her dependents or on a bulk purchase 
basis for groups of people. Deferred annuities are asset 
accumulation contracts, which may be used to provide 
benefits in retirement, and may be guaranteed, unit-linked 
or index-linked. 
— Protection – an insurance contract that protects the 
policyholder or his or her dependants against financial loss 
on death or ill-health. Our product ranges include term 
assurance, mortgage life insurance, flexible whole life and 
critical illness cover. 
— Bonds and savings – accumulation products with single or 
regular premiums and unit-linked or guaranteed investment 
returns. Our product ranges include single premium 
investment bonds, regular premium savings plans, mortgage 
endowment products and funding agreements. 
— Other, which includes equity release and structured settlements. 
— Investment sales comprise of retail sales of mutual fund type 
products such as unit trusts, individual savings accounts 
(ISAs) and Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs). 
Some of our insurance and investment contracts contain a 
discretionary participating feature, which is a contractual right 
to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed 
benefits. These are referred to as participating contacts. 
General insurance and health 
General insurance and health insurance together accounted for 
20% of our total sales for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
In the year ended 31 December 2009, we reported general 
and health insurance net written premiums of £9.2 billion. 
Market position 
We are the leading general insurer in the UK and Ireland based 
on gross written premiums for the year ended 31 December 
2008 and we are one of the top five general insurers in Canada 
and the Netherlands, as based on gross written premiums for 
the year ended 31 December 2008. The group has other 
European general insurance operations in France, Italy, Poland 
and Turkey, and in Asia Pacific we sell general insurance and 
health products in Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. 
In the year ended 31 December 2009, 47% of our total 
general insurance and health business was written in the UK. 
Brands and Products 
Our general insurance business currently operates under 
different brand names, with Aviva and the RAC in the UK, Delta 
Lloyd in the Netherlands and Commercial Union Aviva in Poland. 
Our other general insurance operations in Europe, Canada and 
Asia Pacific operate under the Aviva brand. During 2010, the 
business in Poland will complete its transition across to the Aviva 
brand as part of a global branding exercise. RAC in the UK and 
Delta Lloyd in the Netherlands will remain unchanged. 
Our general insurance business concentrates on personal 
lines and commercial lines insurance through the provision of 
motor, household, travel, creditor, commercial liability and 
commercial property coverage. Our health insurance business 
concentrates on private health insurance, income protection 
and personal accident insurance, as well as a range of corporate 
healthcare products. 
Distribution 
We have various distribution agreements with bancassurance 
partners and joint ventures across many markets in which we 
operate. The agreements contain similar terms and depending 
on our line of business in that market offer long-term insurance 
products, general insurance and health products, asset 
management services or a combination thereof. The agreements 
have a defined contract term, frequently with the option to 
extend. In return for offering our products to their customers, 
the bank or joint venture partners receive a commission as a 
percentage of sales and in some cases achieve extra commission 
if agreed target levels of sales are met. Certain agreements have 
a profit sharing element based on a predetermined percentage. 
The success of the agreement is regularly monitored against 
certain performance indicators which are those typically used 
by the management of the business. In some cases, if the 
agreed targets are not met, the terms of the contract can be 
renegotiated, typically with respect to the level of commission

Fund management 
The fund management businesses manage the funds of Aviva’s 
general insurance and long-term insurance and savings 
operations and provide investment management for institutional 
pension funds, as well as developing and selling retail 
investment products. Our main brand for fund management is 
Aviva Investors. The main fund management operations are in 
the UK, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, the US and Australia. 
All sales of retail fund management products are included in our 
long-term insurance and savings business sales. 
Market position 
Aviva Investors is ranked twenty fourth globally and third based 
in the UK by assets under management, according to Cerulli 
Associates’ December 2008 ranking of asset managers by assets 
under management. Aviva Investors operates under a single 
brand in 15 countries across our regions of the UK, Europe, 
North America and Asia Pacific. The other fund management 
businesses of Aviva comprise our collective investment business 
with the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in the UK, Delta Lloyd in 
the Netherlands and our Navigator wrap administration business 
in Hong Kong and Singapore. Total worldwide funds managed 
by Aviva managers at 31 December 2009 was £250 billion, the 
substantial majority of which currently relates to Aviva’s 
insurance and savings operations. 
Brands and products 
Our business in the UK manages investments including equities, 
fixed income, property, hedge fund and socially responsible 
investments (SRIs) on behalf of institutional, pension fund 
and retail clients. We also sell retail ISAs, unit trusts, OEICs and 
structured products under the Aviva Investors and the Royal 
Bank of Scotland Group (RBSG) brands. 
Operating segments 
Each operating segment has a member of our executive 
management team who is responsible for it and who is 
accountable to the group chief executive for the operating 
performance of their segment. The full membership of our 
executive management team is set out on page 82. This 
structure for our operating segments is intended to ensure 
the Group’s ability to take advantage of market opportunities, 
improve speed of response, eliminate duplication of effort, 
and encourage the sharing of best practice in the interests 
of our customers and shareholders, while providing 
local knowledge. 
United Kingdom Aviva Life 
Business overview and strategy 
Our UK life insurance business is a leading long-term insurance 
and savings provider in the UK with a market share of 10% 
based on 2009 ABI returns. Our main operations are based 
in York though we have a significant presence in Norwich, 
Eastleigh, Bristol and Sheffield. We also have outsourcing 
relationships with a number of partners including Swiss Re, 
Scottish Friendly and International Financial Data Services 
(IFDS) in the UK, and WNS in India. We employ over 9,000 
people and have more than seven million customers as at 
31 December 2009. 
We believe that we provide a broad product offering, with 
a wide distribution reach throughout the UK. We identify brand, 
financial strength, with-profits performance, investment 
performance and rates on protection products as our key strengths.

Other information 
Our core strategy is to leverage our extensive distribution 
network and customer base to increase profits in a mature but 
evolving marketplace. We seek to outperform the UK market 
while delivering enhanced margins. To achieve this, our strategy 
includes the rigorous use of capital, further improving customer 
retention, reducing new business acquisition costs while 
boosting productivity, all of which will drive greater value for 
shareholders. 
We aim to maintain market leadership through balanced 
distribution and broad product mix and the simplification of 
processes, services and costs. 
Market and competition 
The UK long-term insurance market is highly competitive. 
However, there is a potential annual savings gap of some 
£30 billion, the difference between what an individual saves 
today, and what they need to save in order to pay for a 
comfortable standard of living in retirement, as well as a 
potential protection gap of £2.3 trillion, which is the difference 
between the life insurance and financial protection cover an 
individual has and the amount they need to meet their needs, 
according to the ABI and Swiss Re respectively. We believe these 
shortfalls offer significant opportunities for long-term insurance 
companies within this market. 
In 2009 the long-term insurance and savings markets have 
continued to be affected by the turbulent economic conditions, 
the slowdown in the housing market and regulatory impacts, 
such as the ban on the sale of single premium payment 
protection insurance. 
We consider our main competitors to be Prudential, Legal & 
General, AEGON, Standard Life and Lloyds Banking Group. The 
principal competitive factors for our life insurance business in 
the UK are: 
— Financial strength and ratings 
— Brand strength and customer advocacy 
— Focus on customer and quality of service 
— Range of product lines and quality of products on offer 
— Strength of distribution channels 
— Pricing 
— Investment management performance 
Products 
We provide an extensive product range in the UK that covers 
pensions, annuities, protection, bonds and savings and equity 
release products, as well as investment products. We hold 
strong positions in each of our key markets of savings, 
protection, and annuity products based on APE in 2009 
according to ABI returns. 
We write both non-profit and with-profit business. 
Non-profit business means that shareholders retain 100% 
of the distributed profits. With-profit business means that 
policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed 
profits, with shareholders receiving the balance. 
The with-profit products share profits and losses of the 
with-profit fund with its investors. This is achieved through a 
system of bonuses. In deciding the regular bonuses Aviva aims 
to smooth the return of the policyholder’s plan. As bonuses 
are added to the plan, valuable guarantees build up. These 
guarantees are unique to with-profits investments. At the close 
of the plan the investor receives a terminal bonus based on the 
performance of the fund. 
We provide a number of traditional life insurance products 
including level-term, decreasing-term and guaranteed whole 
life insurance, guaranteed lifelong protection plans and critical 
illness cover products.

Our savings and investment products include ISAs, investment 
bonds, funds, base rate trackers, capital protected plan and 
with-profits products. 
The pensions and retirement products we offer include 
stakeholder, personal pensions, equity release, annuities,

Distribution 
We are a leading provider in the UK financial adviser market 
and also have a successful joint venture with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland Group, strong relationships with a number of banks 
and building societies, distribution deals with the Co-operative 
Insurance Society and the Post Office, and growing corporate 
and direct channels. 
The majority of our sales are through independent financial 
advisers (IFAs). This is particularly the case for our savings and 
investment products as customers seek advice due to the 
complex nature of the products, the regulation surrounding 
them and the need for these products to meet the individual 
circumstances of the customer. 
United Kingdom Aviva General Insurance 
Business overview and strategy 
Our UK general insurance business currently operates in the 
UK through two major brands, Aviva (which was changed from 
Norwich Union in June 2009) and the RAC. The combined 
business was the leading general insurer in the UK for 2008, 
with a market share of 13% (2007: 14%) according to 
Datamonitor. We focus on personal and commercial insurance 
and are also a leading provider of roadside assistance through 
the RAC, as voted by the JD Power survey since 2006. We operate 
from a number of locations in the UK, India and Sri Lanka. 
We aim to maintain our market leading position through 
underwriting excellence and product and distribution leadership. 
Our strategy is to focus on insurance fundamentals to maximise 
returns through the insurance cycle. We seek to control the 
impact of claims inflation, provide excellent customer service 
and maintain disciplined underwriting and pricing. To this end, 
we are nearing completion of the process to transform our 
customer service centres and simplify our policy range. 
Market and competition 
The UK is the third largest insurance market in the world 
according to the ABI based on data for 2008. In 2008, the top 
four companies had approximately 38% (2007: 35%) of the 
general insurance market share, based on Datamonitor figures 
for gross written premiums. 
Insurance profits in the UK general insurance market are 
cyclical in nature and after a lengthy period of soft market 
conditions in commercial lines, characterised by high 
competition and falling prices, we have seen some tentative 
signs of hardening since late 2008. There are also signs of 
market rating increases in personal lines, particularly within 
personal motor. 
In 2009, we believe the proportion of customers buying 
insurance online has continued to increase and this is now a 
major distribution channel. In particular we believe that internet 
price comparison sites for personal motor and homeowner 
insurance have again grown their market share as customers 
seek price transparency. 
We consider our main competitors to be RBS, RSA, AXA, 
Zurich, Lloyds Banking Group, Allianz, and Admiral Group. The 
principal competitive factors for our general insurance business 
in the UK are: 
— Range and quality of products 
— Access to distribution 
— Pricing and underwriting discipline 
— Brand association 
— Customer satisfaction, claims handling 
— Cost management 
Products 
We provide a range of general insurance products focused on 
personal and commercial customers. We held top one or two 
positions in all our major classes of business for 2008, according 
to Datamonitor. Our general insurance business mix is 
approximately 60% personal lines and 40% commercial lines. 
Our general insurance products include personal motor, 
home, travel insurance, payment protection, commercial motor, 
commercial property, and commercial liability insurance. 
We also offer a range of breakdown cover through the RAC. 
Our personal motor insurance product range includes cars, 
motorcycles and vans. For businesses we offer cover for fleets 
and commercial vehicles. 
Our home insurance products include building and contents 
insurance and home emergency cover. 
Our commercial products focus on insurance for small to 
medium enterprises and, from 2010, we plan to expand our 
product range in the larger UK corporate risk market. 
Distribution 
We have a multi-distribution strategy. Our personal products 
are sold directly to customers over the phone and through 
our website www.aviva.co.uk, via brokers, through over 100 
corporate partnerships and our RAC Insurance offering is also 
available through price comparison sites. For commercial 
insurance, we focus on broker distribution and believe that 
independent brokers remain the best source of the advice 
required by business customers. 
Europe 
Regional overview and strategy 
Aviva operates in 15 countries across Europe (excluding the 
UK) offering a range of life, pensions and insurance products 
distributed through a wide range of channels. We are one of 
the leading providers of life and pension products in Europe, 
based on 2007 gross written premiums according to the 
Comité Européen des Assurances (CEA), a European insurance 
and reinsurance federation. 
In 2009, we announced a clear two-part strategy to exploit 
the considerable opportunities in Europe. 
Aviva Europe 
In 2009 we announced a new strategy to make a ‘Quantum 
Leap’ in performance by integrating the operations of 12 
previously separate businesses (excluding the operations of 
Delta Lloyd), under a single pan-European executive team. 
The Quantum Leap transformation plan will build a pan-
European approach to operations, governance and product 
development. Distribution has been centralised into two pan-
European channels, bancassurance and retail, allowing us to 
take advantage of the significant growth potential in Europe, 
build competitive advantage and shorten time to market. 
A single holding company has been established in Ireland 
which, subject to regulatory approval, will deliver economic, 
operational and regulatory benefits to Aviva. 
Delta Lloyd 
As a result of the IPO, the strategic management of our 
investment in Delta Lloyd is now managed independently from 
our other operations.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Delta Lloyd is one of the top five financial services providers 
in the Netherlands, with a significant operation in Belgium. In 
November 2009, Aviva successfully completed an IPO of Delta 
Lloyd which is now listed on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. Aviva 
retains 58.3% of the ordinary share capital and 54.0% of the 
voting rights in Delta Lloyd after having raised £1 billion of gross 
disposal proceeds. Its listing enables Delta Lloyd to strengthen 
its profile and brand, as well as more effectively pursue its 
growth strategy in the Netherlands and Belgium, in particular, 
ahead of anticipated sector consolidation in those countries. 
Aviva Europe 
As the leading bancassurer in Europe we have sustained our 
performance by leveraging our unique bancassurance model, 
serving customers through our 50 bancassurance agreements. 
We also have a significant retail franchise, operating through 
more than 8,000 brokers and agents, and a direct sales force 
of over 10,000 consultants. 
Our pan-European distribution model aims to exploit our 
market leading bancassurance model by leveraging existing 
banking relationships, by expanding our product mix into higher 
margin products such as protection and general insurance and 
by reducing the cost per policy through the roll out of a pan-
European shared platform. The shared platform will also give us 
the ability to meet the demands of each prospective partner’s 
requirements, in a rapid and efficient way, creating value for 
both Aviva and our partner. 
We are also building a single retail operating model with 
common tools and methods supported by centralised sales 
support and a pan-European customer retention centre of 
excellence. This strategy will enable us to increase our sales 
force productivity, improve customer retention and create 
economies of scale through pan-European retail cost 
management. 
Our Aviva Europe business has substantial operations in 
France, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain, with significant long-
term insurance businesses. Following early success in Poland, 
we have been building our long-term insurance and savings 
business in developing markets in Central and Eastern Europe, 
and now have businesses in the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Lithuania (which for financial reporting purposes we include in 
Poland), Romania, Russia, Turkey and a distribution capability 
in Slovakia (which for financial reporting purposes we include 
in Hungary). 
In addition, we have large general insurance businesses 
in Ireland and France, as well as developing general insurance 
businesses in Italy, Poland and Turkey. Fund management 
operations exist in France, Ireland, Poland and Romania. The 
fund management operations in France, Ireland and Romania 
are managed by Aviva Investors, and since 1 January 2010 the 
fund management operation in Poland has transferred to Aviva 
Investors. 
Since January 2010, Aviva Europe has also had 
responsibility for developing Aviva’s business interests in the 
Middle East, based in the United Arab Emirates. 
Market and competition 
The region is split between mature Western European markets 
with high wealth and insurance penetration and the developing 
markets of Central and Eastern Europe. We expect to see 
growth of the European long-term insurance and savings 
market above GDP growth over the next decade as a result 
of a growing ageing population and the developing markets 
in the Central and Eastern Europe region. 
Competitive intensity and market consolidation varies 
across the region depending on the size and stage of

development of each market. Our competitors comprise a 
mixture of large pan-European insurers, such as Allianz and 
AXA, and local insurers, such as Powszechy Zaxlad Ubezpieczan 
(PZU) in Poland and CNP Assurances (CNP) in France. Across the 
region consolidation is low; based on total insurance premiums 
from the CEA the top five insurers hold only 35% of the 
market. The CEA data shows that Aviva has a 4.8% share of 
the market (including UK, excluding business written outside 
of Europe, non primary insurance and inaccessible markets 
eg compulsory healthcare) which makes us the fourth largest. 
The largest insurers are Allianz, Generali and AXA. If the UK 
is excluded, Aviva’s market share on the same basis is 4.1%. 
We consider our competitive factors in the European region 
(with such factors to a greater and lesser extent for mature and 
rapidly developing markets) to be: 
— Bancassurance partnerships 
— Existing retail franchise 
— Pan-European distribution model 
— Position in large emerging markets (Russia, Poland, Turkey) 
— Customer-centric range of products and services 
— Global scale 
— Depth of technical expertise across region and ability to 
transfer to developing business units 
— Europe-wide approach to distribution management, 
product development and support functions 
— Pricing 
— Brand strength and customer advocacy 
— Focus on customer and quality of service 
— Financial strength and ratings 
— Investment management performance 
France 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva France is one of the top 10 long-term insurance and 
savings businesses in France based on 2008 new business 
premiums, according to L’Argus de L’Assurance. We offer a 
range of long-term insurance and savings products, primarily 
for individuals, which focus on the unit-linked market. We 
have a partnership with the Association Française d’Epargne 
et de Retraite (AFER), which is the largest retirement savings 
association in France. Aviva France operates through two main 
companies: Aviva Vie and Aviva Direct. 
Our general insurance business in France has a 2.3% share 
of the market as based on 2008 premium income according to 
L’Argus de L’Assurance. We predominantly sell personal and 
small commercial lines insurance products through an agent 
network and our direct insurer, Eurofil. We believe Eurofil is 
the second-largest direct sales insurer in France, based on 
total written premiums, and it sells motor, home and health 
insurance. Direct sales to private customers are conducted 
through the internet and by telephone. 
Our strategy for Aviva France is to continue the 
diversification and growth of our business and to maintain our 
profitability at a high level. We seek to accomplish these goals 
through our distribution expertise, innovation of products and 
services, greater communication and brand visibility. 
Market 
We believe that the long-term insurance and savings market 
in France has long-term growth potential due to the ageing 
population and need for private pensions. We believe that 
the recent volatility in the market has affected sales as some 
consumers are lacking confidence in long-term investments, 
preferring safer forms of investment while they await a recovery 
in financial markets.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Recent changes in the inheritance tax system have eroded the 
long-term insurance tax advantages compared to other asset 
accumulation businesses, which has impacted our individual 
single premium savings product and undertakings for collective 
investment in transferable securities (UCITS). 
We believe that the general insurance market in France is 
mature, showing signs of saturation and increased competition. 
In this market we aim to offer competitive pricing and a wide 
range of products and services. 
Products 
Aviva France long-term insurance and savings business sells 
mainly protection and bonds and savings products. These 
include protection and unit-linked and with profits savings 
products. We are the sole distributor of AFER products, 
which includes unit linked and with-profits products. 
With profits savings products are traditional savings 
products with an agreed duration, a minimum guaranteed 
credit rate and a profit sharing mechanism to pass part of the 
excess return to policyholders. Unit-linked savings products 
return all investment returns earned on policyholder assets 
directly back to the policyholder. 
Aviva France’s general insurance business sells personal 
and small commercial insurance including motor, home, 
commercial, agricultural and construction products, as well 
as health insurance. 
Distribution 
Aviva France sells products through a complete range of 
distribution channels, including approximately 1,800 branch 
staff, 400 insurance advisers, more than 1,000 active partner 
brokers, as well as Aviva Assurances’ 875-member network. 
It has partnerships with AFER, the Union Financière de 
France (UFF) network of financial advisers, Médéric, and a 
bancassurance partnership with Crédit du Nord, a subsidiary 
of Société Générale, which gives Aviva access to 1.4 million 
customers through approximately 780 branches as at 
31 December 2009. We also have direct sales to private 
customers through the internet and by telephone. 
AFER is a market reference savings association, which we 
believe has strong customer loyalty. AFER products are sold 
through Epargne Actuelle, an Aviva Vie network and other 
brokers and makes up approximately 53% of our total French 
life sales in 2009. 
We also have a joint venture with Crédit du Nord called 
Antarius. We have exclusive rights to distribute Antarius­ branded life products, which include protection, and unit-linked 
bonds and savings products, through Crédit du Nord bank 
branches. 
Ireland 
Business overview and strategy 
Our recently rebranded business in Ireland is one of the 
country’s leading multi-line insurers with more than one million 
customers. As the initial part of the move to a global Aviva 
brand, the business was renamed Hibernian Aviva in early 
2009 and from 11 January 2010 has traded as Aviva Ireland. 
It provides long-term insurance and savings products, asset 
management (which is managed by Aviva Investors), general 
insurance and health insurance products. We had a 16.7% 
share of the Irish long-term insurance and savings market in 
2008 based on gross written premiums according to the Irish 
Insurance Federation (IIF), and were the third largest life and 
pension provider in Ireland. Our general insurance business is 
the largest in Ireland, with a market share of 20% in 2008 
according to the IIF. 
Our strategy in our life business in Ireland is to maximise market 
opportunities through re-energising the broker distribution 
channel and pushing forward new initiatives with our 
bancassurance partner Allied Irish Banks plc (AIB). This includes 
developing products with attractive safety features to meet 
customer needs when investment markets are more volatile. 
In our general insurance business we aim to take advantage 
of opportunities to grow our business through building 
innovative products, increasing scale and exploiting 
distribution advantages. 
In May 2008 we acquired 70% of VIVAS Health (now 
renamed Aviva). We believe that this initiative presents 
significant growth opportunities in a new market sector and 
extends our existing partnership with AIB who own the 
remaining 30% of this company. 
Market 
The life insurance market in Ireland is largely consolidated with 
approximately 71% of the market share being held by the top 
three providers, including Aviva, according to a report by IFF 
based on 2008 gross written premiums. Price competition in 
the market continues to increase, with focus increasingly on 
market share. We believe that customers have moved away 
from traditional life products in Ireland because of volatility in 
the stock markets and a slowdown in the housing market in 
the last two years. 
We believe that the general insurance market in Ireland 
continues to be very competitive for both personal and 
commercial lines business and there is continued downward 
pressure on premium rates. 
Products 
Our long-term insurance and savings business offers a 
comprehensive range of protection, bonds and savings and 
pension products. The protection products include single, 
dual and joint life insurance, mortgage protection, specified 
illness and guaranteed whole life cover products. The pension 
range covers retirement and investment products including 
government promoted personal retirement savings account 
(PRSA) schemes. 
Our general insurance and health businesses provide a 
wide range of products including property, motor, travel, farm 
and business insurance. Our motor business is more focused 
on personal lines, while our property business is primarily 
commercial lines. 
Distribution 
Aviva has a wide range of distribution channels in the Irish 
market. Customers can purchase our products through 
intermediary channels such as brokers, corporate partners and 
through retail channels including call centres, a nationwide 
branch network and the internet. 
Our long-term insurance and savings products are 
distributed through a broker network and our bancassurance 
partnership with AIB. This partnership gives us access to more 
than 280 branches. We also provide branded products for a 
number of financial institutions. 
The majority of our general insurance business is sold 
through brokers, with an increasing proportion offered by 
direct and corporate partners.

Italy 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva Italy is the country’s seventh-largest life insurer, with a 
market share of 5% in terms of 2008 gross written premiums 
according to Associazione Nazionale fra le Imprese Assicuratrici 
(ANIA) and has over 1.3 million customers. We also have a stake 
in Banca Network Investimenti, a 900-member financial adviser 
network. Aviva is the 13th largest general insurance company in 
Italy with a market share of 1% according to the Associazione 
Nazionale fra le Imprese Assicuratrici (ANIA). 
Our strategy is to continue to work with our partners on 
new products, suited to the current markets, to develop our 
bancassurance relationships and to expand our customer 
reach, through customer penetration and expanding our 
distribution reach. 
Market 
In the Italian life market, large groups dominate the market, 
with the top four providers writing more than 50% of the 
life premium income in 2007 according to AXCO Insurance 
Information Services. While the market has been reasonably 
stable over the last five years, it shrank in both 2007 and 2008 
(by 11.2% and 11.7% respectively), with total market premiums 
at about €55 billion for the year, according to ANIA. 
In the Italian market, we believe that many consumers 
prefer investment products from well established long-term 
insurance companies as long-term savings vehicles. We also 
think that consumers prefer developing a personal relationship 
with the bank distributing products through one-to-one 
contact. Internet and telephone channels are not widely used 
in Italy. 
In the last few years the Italian government has introduced 
legislation to break the exclusive relationship between general 
insurance companies and their ‘tied’ agents and therefore widening 
the availability of general insurance products from different insurers. 
This has opened up the general insurance marketplace and 
increased competition from different channels. 
Products 
Our long-term insurance and savings business offers a wide 
range of products covering protection, bonds and savings and 
pensions. The largest segment is single and regular premium 
savings and investment products. These include unit-linked 
policies linked to a range of investment funds and profit-sharing 
policies where there is a minimum annual return credited to 
the policy, with the potential for an additional bonus. Also we 
provide index-linked products where there is typically some 
protection of capital at the end of the policy term and a pay-out 
linked to the performance of an index or basket of shares. 
A growing area of the market is credit protection insurance, 
where protection on death and disability is provided for mortgages 
and credit loans. Individual and group pension plans are also 
available and this part of the market is expected to grow in the 
long-term given the ageing population and government reforms 
to reduce the cost of state retirement provision. 
Our general insurance business in Italy mainly provides 
motor and home insurance products to individuals, as well as 
small commercial risk insurance, including marine, to businesses. 
For reporting purposes the Italian general insurance business is 
shown within “Other Europe” in the general insurance segment. 
Distribution 
Our products are distributed principally through bancassurance 
partnerships with UniCredit Group, Banco Popolare Italiana 
Group (BPI), Banca Popolari Unite (BPU) and Unione di Banche 
Italiana (UBI). Our partnership with Banca Delle Marche ended in 
May 2009. These partnerships give us access to more than 
6,200 branches and additionally we also have 650 insurance 
agents and access to approximately 5,800 sales advisers. 
In December 2007, Aviva Italy entered into an exclusive 
long-term partnership with Banco Popolare and acquired a 50% 
interest in Avipop Assicurazioni, a general insurance company, 
for a total consideration of £188 million. This replaced our 
previous agreement with BPI to distribute long-term insurance 
and savings products. 
In 2007, we also purchased, together with other investors, 
a stake in Banca Network Investimenti, a 900-member financial 
adviser network, from BPI. We believe that this network will 
further extend and diversify our distribution reach in the market 
for long-term insurance and savings business. 
In 2008, we acquired 50% plus one share in UBI 
Assicurazioni Vita S.p.A. (UBI Vita). UBI Vita distributes life 
insurance products through Banca Popolare di Ancona and 
other channels and further expands our distribution capability 
and customer base. 
We distribute general insurance products primarily 
through agents and brokers, with a growing proportion 
of bancassurance sales. 
Poland (including Lithuania) 
Business overview and strategy 
Our operations in Poland and Lithuania provide long-term 
insurance and savings products. Our businesses have a 4,200­ member direct sales force, with 66 sales offices across the 
country as at 31 December 2009. Completing the move to 
a global brand, our Polish business, currently known as 
Aviva Commercial Union, will commence trading as Aviva 
in June 2010. 
Our Polish life operation is the second-largest overall life 
insurer, with a market share of 10% based on total premium 
income in 2008 according to the Polish Financial Supervision 
Authority (KNF). It has more than 900,000 individual and group 
customers and manages over £2.5 billion of customers' assets. 
The pension business has been leading the second-pillar pension 
fund market since its launch in 1999, with a market share 
of around 26% and almost 3 million customers and over 
£9.8 billion of assets under management, according to KNF. 
Second pillar pension funds are those privately managed, 
first pillar are the pay-as-you-go state pensions and third 
pillar are voluntary contributions. 
Our long-term insurance strategy is to expand our 
distribution network, particularly in the direct channel, and to 
also develop other alternative points of contact for potential 
clients, for example, bancassurance. We seek to capitalise 
on our new product launches and maximise cross-selling 
opportunities. Our product strategy for pensions is to retain our 
status as the market leader in terms of customers and assets. 
Our general insurance business in Poland commenced in 
1997 and continues to develop. In 2007 we launched a direct 
motor insurance product in order to pursue further potential 
for growth in this dynamic market. For reporting purposes the 
general insurance business is shown within “Other Europe” 
in the general insurance segment.

Market 
The Polish market for protection products has seen significant 
growth since 1999, although penetration rates remain relatively 
low according to our analysis of KNF statistics. Insurance 
companies in Poland are either state-owned or private, with the 
public sector companies continuing to have a strong share of 
the market. The private companies are often under the control 
of international insurers. 
In 1999, Poland launched a comprehensive reform of its 
state pension system and created privately managed funds. This 
enabled private companies to offer pension products and made 
it obligatory for all employees under 30 years of age to join one 
of the competing pension funds. 
In 2009 the Polish government agreed further pension 
legislation changes which restrict the fees that pension fund 
management companies can charge. This is effective from 
1 January 2010. 
The general insurance market is continuing to grow, 
although at a slower rate than the long-term insurance and 
savings market. The general insurance market is mainly driven 
by the motor insurance market. Distribution has been 
dominated by direct sales force and agents, however direct 
sales are now growing. 
Products 
Our life business in Poland provides a broad range of protection, 
annuities and bonds and savings products. For individuals it 
offers unit-linked life policies, annuities, single premium savings 
and, for institutions, group life insurance and employee pension 
programmes, which are both unit-linked products. 
Our pension business offers a standard product for all 
customers as part of the privately managed pensions market. 
We offer general insurance products to both institutions 
and individuals in Poland. For institutions we offer selected 
commercial lines risks such as fire and loss-of-profit insurance, 
technical insurance, insurance against loss of property during 
transportation, civil liability insurance and commercial health 
insurance. For individuals we offer home, accident and travel 
insurance, which are primarily sold by tied agents, whilst motor 
insurance is sold through our direct operation. 
Distribution 
The direct sales force is the main distribution channel for most 
of the Poland group and is made up of 4,200 tied insurance 
agents whose work is co-ordinated by a network of our sales 
offices run by sales managers. 
In 2008 we increased the productivity and size of our direct 
sales force and entered a joint venture with Bank Zachodni WBK 
(a subsidiary of AIB) to sell both life and general insurance 
products through the bank’s network of over 500 branches. 
We also co-operate with independent insurance agencies 
and brokers. We believe that these insurance brokers play a key 
role in selling commercial lines general insurance. Our mutual 
funds are also sold in brokerage houses and our individual 
products are supported by call centre and website sales. 
Spain 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva Spain sells long-term insurance and savings, health and 
accident insurance in Spain through a bancassurance network 
based on joint ventures with six banks (Bancaja, Caja España, 
Caixa Galicia, Unicaja, Caja de Granada and Cajamurcia) and 
through Aviva Vida y Pensiones, the wholly owned Aviva­
branded long-term insurance company. Aviva Spain is the 
country’s fifth-largest long-term insurer by gross written 
premiums with a market share of 6% in 2009 according 
to Investogación Cooperativa entre Entidades Aseguradoras y 
Fondos de Pensiones (ICEA). 
In February 2008, we exercised an option to acquire an 
additional 45% shareholding in our joint venture with the 
Spanish savings bank Caja de Ahorros de Murcia, Cajamurcia 
Vida, which brings our total shareholding to 50% and enables 
the migration of the majority of the Cajamurcia protection 
products to this joint venture company. The new company 
distributes long-term insurance and savings products via 
Cajamurcia’s network of over 400 branches. 
Our strategy in Spain is to further develop our 
bancassurance relationships and attract new partners if the 
opportunities arise. We hope to develop our general insurance 
offerings through our existing partnerships. Overall, we want to 
continue to be customer-focused, react quickly to market trends 
and maximise the sales of our core products, such as pensions 
and savings. 
Market 
Spain’s financial market has a strong banking tradition, and as 
such customers are accustomed to receiving advice through 
traditional banking channels. We believe that customers have a 
high level of financial understanding and require comprehensive 
advice on products and services. The top positions in the long-
term insurance market are dominated by bank-owned or bank-
insurer joint ventures, with the overall bancassurance channel 
accounting for more than 70% of new business premiums in 
2007 in the Spanish life insurance market according to ICEA. 
Products 
We offer a wide range of bonds and savings, and protection 
products. Investment products include both unit linked and 
traditional plans, where profit sharing is regularly used to 
increase the policy return. Our traditional plans include savings 
schemes and income products. Pension savings products have 
valuable tax advantages each year for such contributions within 
permitted limits and we offer a flexible range of individual and 
group plans with alternative investment choices. We also offer 
protection products, covering both mortgages and credit loans 
typically providing cover for the family in the event of death or 
disability. 
The PIAS ‘pension’ product was launched in 2007: this is a 
savings contract with attractive tax benefits if the policy remains 
in force for at least 10 years and if an annuity is purchased at 
the maturity of the product. 
Distribution 
Through bancassurance partnerships we have established 
subsidiaries to distribute our products with each of the banks 
as set out below: 
— Aseval – in conjunction with Bancaja since 2000 
— Unicorp Vida – in conjunction with Unicaja since 2001 
— Bia Galicia – in conjunction with Caixa Galicia since 2001 
— Caja España Vida – in conjunction with Caja España 
since 2001 
— General Vida – in conjunction with Caja de Granada 
since 2002 
— Cajamurcia Vida – in conjunction with Cajamurcia since 2007 
Aviva Vida y Pensiones distributes our products through 
professional intermediaries (financial advisers, agents and 
brokers) and a direct sales force, supported by a branch office 
network and call centres.

Other Europe 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva’s other European businesses are in Turkey, the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Romania, Russia and Slovakia. 
In 2007, our Turkish long-term insurance and savings 
business merged with Ak Emeklilik, the long-term insurance and 
savings company of Sabancı Holdings, to form a joint venture 
company, AvivaSA. The new company merged on 31 October 
2007 to become the largest pensions’ provider in the market, 
with a market share of 22% in 2008 according to the Turkish 
Pensions Monitoring Centre, and the fourth largest life insurer 
with a market share of 6% in 2009 according to the Association 
of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies of Turkey. Under the 
merger, AvivaSA has a bancassurance agreement with Akbank 
T.A.S. (Akbank), Turkey’s second largest privately-owned 
bank based on total assets according to the Banks Association 
of Turkey. 
In the Czech Republic we are the 13th largest life insurer, 
with a 1.6% market share in 2008 according to the Czech 
Insurance Association. We have more than 46,000 customers 
and 117 staff as at 31 December 2009. 
In Hungary, we are the sixth largest life insurance business, 
measured by 2008 gross written premiums, with an 8% market 
share, according to the Association of Hungarian Insurers. We 
have a tied agent sales force consisting of more than 600 
agents and 22 agencies nationwide. 
Aviva Romania is the eighth largest life insurer as measured 
by premium income in 2008 according to the local insurance 
regulator, CSA. We were also the fourth largest voluntary 
pensions' provider in 2008 as measured by fund value according 
to the Private Pension Regulator (CSSPP). Aviva Romania has 
over 550 direct sales force agents and 157 staff. We have 
established a new company to sell newly created mandatory 
pensions. 
In Russia, we started trading in early 2006, with a strategy 
to position the business to take advantage of the growth 
expected to occur as the life insurance industry develops. We 
were the fourth largest life insurer in 2009 compared to 21st in 
the prior year, with a 5% market share based on Aviva Russia’s 
estimates based on statistics from the insurance market 
regulator and Interfax news agency. 
Our strategy in the “Other Europe” region is to grow our 
direct sales force numbers and productivity, whilst continuing 
development of other distribution channels, including 
bancassurance, to enhance our product range and to continue to 
investigate profitable opportunities in new markets. In all of these 
markets, pension reform continues to offer long-term potential. 
Market 
Across these new European markets there are countries at 
different stages of development. Hungary and Czech Republic 
are the most developed markets although they still have a gap 
as compared to Western European markets. 
We believe that Russia and Turkey, with their large 
populations and rapid economic growth, are highly attractive 
markets for the medium term. Countries such as Romania 
represent longer-term potential. With pension reform starting 
later in these countries, markets are at an early stage of 
development. 
Competitiveness varies by country depending on its size 
and stage of development. In more developed markets 
competition is with regional players (eg AXA/Allianz), ex-state­
owned insurers and new entities. The less developed markets do 
not have the same competitive intensity, although competition 
is growing. 
Products 
Aviva Turkey’s products include unit-linked pensions, 
supplemented by protection insurance and other savings 
products, which are aimed at high-net-worth customers and 
leading national and multinational corporations. The general 
insurance segment offers motor, household, fire, marine, 
personal accident, travel and liability insurance. 
Our Czech Republic business offers individual unit-linked 
savings, protection insurance, term insurance, other savings 
products, group life schemes for corporate clients and credit 
insurance for our own bancassurance partners. 
In Hungary, we offer flexible unit-linked and traditional life 
products. Aviva also acts as a distributor for various banking 
products, such as mortgage loans and current accounts, as well 
as selling a combined product. 
In Romania, we provide traditional life insurance products 
and started to offer pension products to customers following 
government reforms introducing compulsory pensions in 2008. 
In Russia, we focus on individual accident insurance, 
group non-state pensions, accident and sickness insurance. 
Distribution 
In Turkey, we have a multi-channel distribution strategy through 
brokers, agencies, a direct sales force, corporate sales and 
bancassurance through an agreement with Akbank, which 
gives us access to their approximate six million retail customers 
through 868 branches. Our general insurance business is 
predominantly sold through agents, with the remainder coming 
through direct sales, a call centre and bank agents. 
In the Czech Republic, our sales force is made up of over 
450 agents operating across 14 branches, with 24 independent 
distributors and two bancassurance partners. 
In Hungary, in addition to the direct sales force we also 
sell through brokerage partners. We commenced cross-border 
sales into Slovakia in August 2008, selling a single product 
through Brokernet Slovakia, which has increased our 
geographical coverage. 
In Romania, we distribute through a direct sales force 
branch network and have bancassurance partners, which 
include local units of Piraeus Bank and ABN AMRO. 
At the end of 2009 Aviva Russia had 43 financial 
consultants, servicing approximately 390,000 clients. 
Agreements with 13 leading retail banks have been signed 
and bancassurance sales are growing rapidly. 
Delta Lloyd 
Business overview and strategy 
Delta Lloyd operates in the long-term insurance and savings, 
general insurance and the fund management markets in the 
Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The group employs about 
6,300 staff as of 31 December 2009. 
In November 2009 Aviva successfully completed an IPO of 
Delta Lloyd which is now listed on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. 
Aviva retains 58% of the ordinary share capital and 54% of 
the voting rights in Delta Lloyd after having raised £1 billion 
of gross disposal proceeds. Its listing enables Delta Lloyd to 
strengthen its profile and brand, as well as more effectively 
pursue its growth strategy in the Netherlands and Belgium, 
in particular ahead of anticipated sector consolidation in 
those countries. Delta Lloyd is considering its strategic options 
in Germany. 
On 24 March 2010 Delta Lloyd Germany has announced 
the intention to discontinue writing new business. This is in line 
with the decision, as indicated in the prospectus for the initial 
public offering, to discontinue Germany as a core market. 
Delta Lloyd was one of the top five providers of life and general

Aviva plc Information on the company continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
insurance in the Netherlands in 2008 based on gross written 
premiums according to an analysis of competitor press releases. 
The sale of our health operations to O.W.M CZ Groep 
Zorgverkeraar U.A (CZ) which was effective on 1 January 2009 
realising a gain on sale of £31 million, has also given us an 
opportunity to sell long-term insurance and savings, and general 
insurance products to CZ’s existing customer base. 
Delta Lloyd Asset Management manages investments both 
for Delta Lloyd’s own insurance operations and for third parties, 
including individual and institutional customers. In addition to 
managing equity and fixed interest funds, our operations 
include management of a property portfolio. 
Delta Lloyd aims to be one of the leading financial service 
providers in the Netherlands and Belgium. To achieve this goal, 
our business is focused on achieving operating efficiencies and 
product and distribution innovation, while building the trust 
of our customers through improving customer service and 
strengthening financial disciplines. 
Market 
We believe that the Dutch insurance market is mature and 
that cost reduction and economies of scale are becoming 
increasingly important. Customers are increasingly demanding 
that suppliers provide value-for-money high-performing 
products with transparent charges. The Dutch savings market is 
extremely competitive with banks now able to offer retirement 
products on the same terms as insurers. 
In the general insurance market there has been stiff 
competition on premium rates, particularly in the key motor 
account, and increasing claims frequencies linked with the 
economic downturn. 
The credit crisis has resulted in a number of Delta Lloyd’s 
competitors seeking state or shareholder support. We expect 
this situation to result in further industry reorganisation and 
consolidation in the coming years. 
Products 
The long-term insurance and savings business of Delta Lloyd 
offers a range of protection, bonds and savings and pensions 
services, including group pension schemes, annuities, unit-linked 
bonds, savings products and protection insurance. 
Our general insurance business sells a range of products 
including personal, motor, travel and home insurance and 
small to medium sized commercial policies. 
Delta Lloyd also sells retail investment fund and mortgage 
products in the Netherlands and retail banking products 
in Belgium. 
Distribution 
Delta Lloyd distributes long-term insurance and savings and 
general insurance products under three brands: Delta Lloyd, 
OHRA and through a joint venture with ABN AMRO. In the 
Netherlands the Delta Lloyd brand works exclusively with 
independent insurance intermediaries, while OHRA focuses 
on direct channels such as telephone, internet and mail. Delta 
Lloyd’s third brand comprises a joint venture with ABN AMRO, 
reaching customers through the extensive distribution networks 
of ABN AMRO bank. In January 2009, Delta Lloyd and ABN 
AMRO bank confirmed that the joint venture remains the 
exclusive insurance partner for the current and future Dutch 
banking operations of ABN AMRO, including Fortis branches 
when they rebrand in 2010. 
Mutual funds are primarily sold through third-party banks 
such as ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank. 
North America 
Regional overview and strategy 
Aviva North America consists of two businesses: the life 
insurance and annuity business in the US and the general 
insurance business in Canada. Our strategic priorities for the 
region are to improve margins and optimise capital usage, to 
selectively expand into market adjacencies and to optimise the 
regional operating model. 
To enhance the growth in our existing businesses, we also 
seek to increase Aviva’s profile in North America by building 
on the strength of the global brand through concerted 
communication efforts with financial analysts, key financial 
and business media, consumers and distributors. We continue 
to expand our distribution network with a focus on larger 
brokerage general agents. 
Market and competition 
The North America region is home to two of the world’s largest 
and richest economies. Aviva has two businesses that currently 
serve their respective home markets and are led by our regional 
headquarters in Chicago. 
We view both the US long-term insurance and annuity 
market and the Canadian property and casualty insurance 
market as highly fragmented markets with a large number 
of insurers, none of whom is in a truly dominant position. 
Competitors for the products in which we specialise, include 
global insurers such as AIG, Allianz, Royal & Sun Alliance, 
Manulife Financial, Old Mutual and AXA. Local market 
competitors also feature in various product segments. 
We consider our competitive factors in the North America 
region to be: 
— Tailored products 
— Product innovation 
— Technical expertise 
— Quality of distribution partnerships 
— Financial strength and performance 
— Strong financial ratings 
— Investment management performance 
— Global brand 
USA 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva USA is the largest provider to both the fixed indexed life 
insurance and fixed indexed annuities according to reports on 
2008 sales which were released by LIMRA and AnnuitySpecs in 
early 2009. Our acquisition of the former AmerUs Group was 
completed in late 2006. Following this we have achieved 
significant growth and market penetration in the US market, 
with more than one million customers. 
Prior to the acquisition of AmerUs Group, the US business 
was headquartered in Boston and had a niche strategy, focused 
on retirement and estate planning with distribution through 
independent agents, banks and structured settlement brokers. 
Our new strategy is to improve margins, optimise capital 
usage and to leverage our core life insurance and annuity 
distribution and product capabilities into adjacent markets. 
A key theme for Aviva is one of recognition; treating both 
employees and customers as unique people with unique 
circumstances.

Performance review 
Market 
The US is the world’s largest national economy, according to 
the World Bank, based on 2008 GDP, as well as the largest 
insurance market according to the Swiss Re Sigma Report, 
No.3/2009. This is especially true for retirement savings products 
as 78 million members of the baby boom generation move into 
retirement in the US. 
At the same time, the US economy, and its financial sector 
in particular, suffered a severe contraction as a result of the 
financial crisis. There are now increasing signs of economic 
recovery and, despite the recession, North America’s economies 
remain among the world’s largest and its population among 
the world’s wealthiest. Retirement savings represent 34% of 
household assets in the US, according to a report by Investment 
Company Institute, and, despite the uncertainty affecting the 
financial markets, we believe that people are still saving and 
buying insurance from brands they trust. In Aviva USA, we 
believe we are well positioned to respond to this customer 
need for safety, having savings and investment products with 
downside guarantees as a major component of our product 
portfolio. The indexed annuity and indexed life markets in which 
Aviva USA operates are dominated by a small number of large 
insurers. According to the fourth quarter 2008 Advantage 
Indexed Sales and Market Report by AnnuitySpecs, the top five 
providers hold 62% of the indexed annuities market, while for 
indexed life, the top five account for 64% of the market. 
Products 
Aviva USA has a strategic focus on protection, annuity and 
savings products. Our life products include our universal life, 
indexed life, no lapse guaranteed and term assurance products. 
Our savings products are primarily funding agreements. Our 
annuity products include indexed annuities, fixed index 
annuities, deferred fixed annuities, immediate annuities, 
guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, and structured 
settlements. During 2008 we announced our withdrawal 
from the structured settlement business. 
In addition, we now offer wellness products and services 
through our relationship with Mayo Clinic Health Solutions. We 
have also launched enhancements to our guaranteed income 
withdrawal benefits and a new bonus index deferred annuity. 
Distribution 
We use Independent Marketing Organisations (“IMOs”) to 
promote and sell our fixed indexed annuities and protection 
products. Our network covers all 50 states and includes 11,500 
annuity producers and 27,000 life insurance producers. The 
large majority of annuity sales are made through fewer than 
3,000 producers, of who approximately one third are SEC 
registered. We believe that SEC registration provides a number 
of significant opportunities for the business, including the ability 
to cross-sell life products through the registered distribution 
force and product penetration of distribution organisations that 
already operate within the registered market. We also distribute 
through career marketing organisations, personal producing 
general agents and brokerage general agents. 
Canada 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva Canada has an 8% share of the Canadian general 
insurance market, with a top five position in all major provinces 
according to a report by MSA Research Inc. 
We believe that we are well placed in Canada for steady 
organic growth and that our success is underpinned by stable 
broker relationships, underwriting excellence and a balanced 
portfolio of commercial and personal lines. Looking ahead, we 
aim to create value by repositioning our personal lines book in 
Ontario through greater pricing sophistication and customer 
segmentation. We will also continue to address increasing 
customer demand for choice and simplicity through our broker-
distribution model and brand investment in key territories. In 
commercial lines, we aim to retain our current market position 
through our expertise in distribution and product innovation. 
Market 
As the seventh largest in the world, according to the Axco 
Insurance Market Report, Canada’s general insurance market is 
established and stable. The four largest provinces generate around 
90% of total premiums with Ontario, the largest, representing 
47% on its own, according to a report by MSA Research Inc in 
2008. The biggest growth market is western Canada, where 
economic development has resulted in significant population 
increases and a changing demographic profile. 
The Canadian general insurance industry is highly 
fragmented with many small players and no dominant 
consumer brand. Steady consolidation has resulted in the top 
five companies sharing 36% of the market with the top two 
companies, Intact Insurance (formerly ING Canada) and Aviva, 
controlling 19%. The rest of the industry consists of smaller, 
provincially based or niche companies. Further consolidation 
is anticipated. 
Distribution is primarily through the traditional broker 
channel, estimated by market commentators, including Axco, 
to account for over 70% of distribution, with the direct and 
affinity channels gradually increasing their share of the market. 
Competition for growth has moved to investment in brokers, 
direct to consumer marketing, and technology. 
Products 
We provide a number of general insurance products through 
our Canadian companies including: 
— Property, home and automobile insurance, including 
recreational vehicles and mobile homes insurance 
— Niche personal insurance products including holiday and 
park model trailers, horses, hobby farms, sailboats, power 
boats and antique classic and custom cars 
— Small and medium-size enterprise commercial insurance, 
including motor, property, liability, boiler and machinery, 
and surety 
Distribution 
We operate in Canada through a distribution network primarily 
focused on approximately 1,700 independent retail brokers, 
who distribute our core personal and commercial lines. In 
addition, we work closely with both independent and wholly 
owned speciality brokers to distribute group insurance and 
speciality personal lines, such as insurance for antique cars.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Asia Pacific 
Regional overview and strategy 
Aviva Asia Pacific operates in eight countries across the region 
through both joint ventures and wholly owned operations. India 
and China, our ‘must-win markets’, have large populations, 
relatively high economic growth and are expected to generate a 
significant portion of the insurance growth in Asia in the future. 
Most of our ‘developing businesses’ in our other countries 
(Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Sri 
Lanka) are bancassurance led with strong joint venture partners. 
We had an established business in Australia, which we sold on 
1 October 2009. We believe that there is potential for growth 
in the Asia Pacific market due to low insurance penetration in 
most countries, an expanding middle class and relatively high 
gross domestic product (GDP) growth. 
Aviva Asia Pacific aims to build a high growth and value-
creating region driven primarily by ‘must win’ markets of 
China and India by increasing new business sales for long-term 
insurance and savings products through development of existing 
businesses, investment in new business development, leveraging 
shared services and harnessing the benefits of multiple 
distribution channels in all of our markets. 
Market and competition 
The Asia Pacific insurance market includes both mature markets 
such as Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South 
Korea and emerging markets such as India and China. The 
mature markets accounted for around 82% of our long-term 
and savings sales in 2009. However we expect that large 
emerging markets, particularly our ‘must win’ markets of India 
and China, will become increasingly more important in the 
future. In long-term insurance and savings, we believe that the 
long-term outlook is positive and will be driven by a generally 
high savings rate, under-penetration of insurance and diversified 
savings, relatively higher GDP growth and the growing need for 
old age provision. 
At a regional level, Aviva Asia Pacific competes mainly with 
other large international insurance and financial services groups. 
The most significant competitors include AIG, ING, Prudential 
plc, HSBC and AXA. These groups are all early entrants into the 
region and most have significant operations and experience in 
all of the Asian markets. Nevertheless, in our chosen markets, 
we believe our strong distribution partnerships, wide footprint 
and regional operational model position us well to compete 
effectively in the region and create a solid platform for 
continued growth. 
We consider our competitive factors in Asia Pacific to be: 
— Balanced portfolio of markets 
— Established presence in “must-win” markets 
— Multi-channel distribution, with particular strength 
in bancassurance 
— Strength in wrap administration platforms 
— Brand recognition 
— Technical expertise 
Asia 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva has operations in eight markets in Asia, with businesses 
at different stages of development. 
In China, through our joint venture with COFCO Limited 
(COFCO), we are ranked fourth in terms of total premium 
among 28 foreign insurers in China according to China 
Insurance Regulatory Commission. We currently have a presence 
in 10 provinces, with a total of 40 city branches. Our “new five 
year strategy” aims to achieve a top 10 position by 2014 in 
terms of life APE. 
In India, we operate in partnership with the Dabur Group 
through an associate, Aviva Life Insurance Company India 
Limited. We currently rank 11th among the private life 
insurance companies in India based on first year premium as 
at 31 December 2009, according to the Insurance Regulatory 
and Development Authority (IRDA) and we aim to be a top 10 
life insurer by leveraging our bancassurance expertise and 
transforming our agency sales force. 
In Singapore, we rank fifth in the life long-term insurance 
market by annualised premium equivalent (APE) as at 
30 September 2009 according to the Life Insurance Association. 
We are one of the leading bancassurance players in the market. 
We have recently extended our partnership with DBS Bank 
(DBS), one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia, until 2015, to 
provide long-term insurance, savings and health and protection 
insurance products. Importantly, the agreement now covers 
additional markets such as India, China, and Taiwan. 
In Hong Kong we are ranked 21st in the long-term 
insurance market by APE as at 30 September 2009 according 
to the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance. Our strategy 
is to leverage our core bancassurance partnership with DBS 
and independent financial adviser (IFA) channels to deliver 
profitable growth. 
In Sri Lanka, we own a 51% stake in Eagle Insurance 
(Eagle). Eagle is ranked the third largest life insurer and fifth 
largest general insurer in the country, as based on gross 
written premiums in 2008 according to the Insurance Board of 
Sri Lanka. In the third quarter 2009, we signed a distribution 
agreement with Lanka ORIX Leasing Company PLC, a large 
leasing company. In Sri Lanka, we aim to attain no.1 position by 
2012 in terms of new business, in life business and to become 
the fourth largest general insurance player in Sri Lanka. 
In July 2007, we entered the Malaysian market through the 
acquisition of a 49% stake in two of CIMB Group’s subsidiaries, 
Commerce Life Assurance Berhad and Commerce Takaful 
Berhad who have entered into bancassurance agreements with 
another CIMB Group subsidiary, CIMB Bank. This has provided 
Aviva access to over four million potential new customers as 
well as introducing takaful insurance to the Aviva group. We 
believe there is significant growth opportunity in takaful in the 
next few years. We aim to become a top five life and takaful 
company in Malaysia by 2014 by APE.

Performance review 
In 2007, Aviva formed a long-term insurance joint venture, 
First-Aviva, with First Financial Holdings Company (FFHC) 
in Taiwan. First-Aviva, in which we have a 49% shareholding, 
started operations in early 2008 and distributes long-term 
insurance and savings products through a bancassurance 
agreement with FFHC’s flagship subsidiary, First Commercial 
Bank, which is Taiwan’s second largest bank network in terms 
of number of branches according to the Financial Supervisory 
Commission. By leveraging over five million bank customers, 
we aim to become the most profitable insurance company in 
the bancassurance channel. 
In April 2008, we entered the South Korean long-term 
insurance market by acquiring a stake in LIG Insurance 
Company Ltd through a partnership formed with Woori Finance 
Holdings Company Ltd Woori Bank is the second largest 
commercial bank in South Korea by market value. We aim to 
be a top 10 life insurer by end 2012 by new business premiums. 
Market 
We believe that the fundamentals of the Asian markets remain 
attractive. The low insurance penetration in most countries and 
relatively higher GDP growth indicate that prospects for 
continued growth in the long-term insurance and savings 
industry are good. The economic forecasts from Asia 
Development Bank predict GDP growth for the region of 4.3% 
in 2009 and 6.6% in 2010 (Asian Development Outlook 2009 
Update, 22 September 2009). 
In our view, the strong outlook for the region is attracting 
a growing number of new insurers and some existing local 
insurers are developing wider regional ambitions, resulting 
in greater competitive pressure throughout the region. 
Products 
Our Asian businesses generally offer a range of protection, 
bonds and savings and pension products including universal 
life, participating life, unit-linked single and regular premium 
life insurance, other savings and pensions products and a range 
of accident and health insurance products. 
In Singapore and Hong Kong, we offer access to a wide 
range of mutual funds through Navigator, a wrap 
administration platform which allows investors to plan, choose, 
manage and track their investments easily and more effectively. 
We are looking at opportunities to roll out our Navigator 
platform to other attractive markets. 
Distribution 
We operate a multi-distribution strategy in Asia, with particular 
strength in bancassurance, and aim to continue to harness the 
benefits of multi-distribution in all of our markets as we expect 
the regionally dominant agency sales force model to decline in 
the region over coming years as markets mature. 
Aviva Singapore has a multi-channel distribution strategy 
building on the core bancassurance relationship with DBS Bank 
and an expanding network of IFAs. We believe that our UK and 
Australia expertise have helped grow this network. 
In Hong Kong, we distribute the majority of our products 
through bancassurance and IFAs. 
In China, India, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea 
bancassurance is the main distribution method. However, direct 
sales force is growing in importance for our business in India. 
Australia 
For details on the sale of our Australian business, which 
completed on 1 October 2009, see “Financial statements 
IFRS – Note 3 – Subsidiaries”. 
Aviva Australia (prior to the sale on 1 October 2009) 
provided investment and compulsory pensions (superannuation) 
products through our Navigator platform and protection 
insurance business. 
In Australia, Aviva provided protection products including 
life insurance, total and permanent disability insurance, and 
critical illness insurance products. 
We distributed protection insurance in Australia through 
all major channels with a focus on the IFA channel. 
Aviva Investors 
Business overview and strategy 
Aviva Investors was set up in 2008 to combine major fund 
management components of the Aviva group into a single 
global fund management business. We have £250 billion in 
assets under management as at 31 December 2009 and offer 
a broad range of expert investment skills and experience 
around the world. We manage internal funds for our long-term 
insurance and savings, and general insurance operations as well 
as a range of external retail and institutional funds. We provide 
these services across most of our geographic operating 
segments, with services in 15 countries around the world, 
including the UK, the US, Canada, France, Poland, China 
and Australia. 
Aviva Investors provides investment management services 
to a broad range of client types. Our largest client group are 
the long-term insurance and savings, and general insurance 
businesses of Aviva plc. For these clients we provide bespoke 
asset management services, across a broad spectrum of asset 
classes. We work extremely closely with these clients to develop 
tailored solutions to their policyholder needs. 
Our distribution model to external clients is a business-to­
business model, and this is consistent across all regions. We 
provide both bespoke segregated solutions for larger clients 
or offer access to a variety of fund ranges. Our target clients 
for the larger segregated solutions tend to be large pension 
schemes and large financial institutions such as insurance 
companies and banks. 
Our strategy is to rapidly grow our external business 
through offering client centric solutions to our customers 
across an expanding global footprint. This will be achieved in 
conjunction with the establishment of a globally integrated 
organisation, supported by a high performance culture and 
global core processes.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Market and competition 
Following the creation of Aviva Investors, we consider our 
competitor peer group to include large-scale global asset 
managers such as those owned by Blackrock, AXA and Allianz. 
In addition, we continue to look at UK-based providers who 
have significant overseas operations, including both insurance-
owned players such as Standard Life Investments and the 
combined asset management businesses of Prudential plc 
(primarily M&G), as well as independent, listed managers like 
Schroders and Aberdeen Asset Management. 
Where appropriate, we also look at other managers with a 
strong presence in the UK institutional and retail markets such 
as F&C Asset Management, Henderson Global Investors, Jupiter 
Asset Management and Threadneedle. These managers also 
have non-UK operations, particularly in Europe. 
Key identified competitive factors for Aviva Investors include: 
— Investment performance 
— Brand 
— Our Aviva group parentage 
— Client service 
— Scale 
— Global product breadth and distribution reach 
— Capabilities to provide solutions 
— Risk management expertise 
Products 
Our product range is broad and covers most asset classes. 
In Europe we have a range of SICAVs (domiciled in France, 
Luxembourg, Romania and Poland). These funds cover all 
key asset classes and normally have different share classes 
depending on the size and type of investor. Our normal 
distribution model for these funds focuses on wholesale 
distributors, asset allocators and smaller institutional investors. 
In the UK, we supply products to the UK retail and 
wholesale markets. These funds are mostly “owned” by Aviva 
UK Life with Aviva Investors as asset manager, although we 
have a small number of funds registered in the Aviva Investors 
name. These funds are promoted to investors via IFAs, fund 
platforms, supermarkets, and discretionary asset managers. 
In addition, we have a range of pooled pension funds which 
are aimed at the smaller pension fund market. These funds 
are normally defined benefit schemes and tend to be advised 
by investment consultants. 
We manufacture hedge funds in the UK, US and Poland. 
These funds are generally registered offshore and are primarily 
sold to the hedge funds industry, although we do also promote 
single strategy funds to institutional clients, family offices and 
wealth managers. The asset classes include fixed interest, multi 
asset, convertibles and equities. 
We also have an expanding range of specialist property 
funds. These funds are targeted at specialist real estate buyers 
and large institutions (mostly pension funds and local 
authorities), and provide real estate solutions to a wide range 
of risk appetites, ranging from secure income generating funds 
to highly leveraged growth funds. These funds address the UK, 
European and Asian markets. 
In Australia, we have a range of unit trusts that are primarily 
marketed to retail clients through the Navigator platform. This 
platform enables investors to select from a range of funds, 
not just those manufactured by Aviva Investors. The funds 
we manufacture are primarily equity related funds with an 
Australian and Asian focus. 
We also have four Dublin domiciled money market funds 
addressing the sterling and Euro money market segments. 
These funds are sold by a specialist sales team based in London 
and target corporate treasury functions. 
Asset classes 
Aviva Investors offers a wide range of investment solutions 
across all asset classes and in all significant financial centres 
worldwide. Where we do not directly manage assets, we believe 
we have the skills and experience to select the right third-party 
asset managers to complement our own products. 
Our investment capabilities, products and services comprise: 
— Alternatives – We offer a range of alternative investment 
products from private equity fund of funds to hedge funds. 
— Equities 
— Fixed Income – Our Fixed Income teams cover the complete 
product set: UK government securities, liquidity products, 
corporate bonds, European and global sovereigns, index-
linked bonds, emerging markets (hard and local currency 
debt) and high-yield instruments. 
— Global Investment Solutions – Our new Global Investment 
Solutions team constructs client solutions across markets. 
— Real Estate – We offer funds specific to property assets in the 
UK, Europe and Asia, in addition to a Global fund, client-
specific segregated funds and a multi-manager service.

Aviva plc 
Financial and operating performance Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Financial and operating performance 
We are the fifth largest insurance group in the world, based on 
gross written premiums for the 2008 fiscal year. We are one of 
the top five providers of life and pensions products in the UK, 
Ireland, Netherlands, through our Delta Lloyd subsidiary, Poland 
and Spain and one of the top 10 providers of life and pensions 
products in France, Italy and Romania, as based on total sales 
for 2008. Our main activities are the provision of products and 
services in relation to long-term insurance and savings, fund 
management and general insurance. 
Recent developments 
On 5 January 2010, we announced the acquisition of River 
Road Asset Management, a US equity manager, to support 
the expansion of Aviva Investors’ third-party institutional asset 
management business. Completion took place on 24 February 
2010 for an estimated consideration of US$122 million 
(£79 million). 
On 17 February 2010, we sold our 35% holding in 
Sogessur SA to that company’s main shareholder, Société 
Générale, for a consideration of £35 million, realising a profit 
on disposal of £24 million. 
Factors affecting results of operations 
Our financial results are affected, to some degree, by a number 
of external factors, including demographic trends, general 
economic and market conditions, government policy and 
legislation and exchange rate fluctuations. See “Performance 
review – Risk management” for more information on risks 
associated with these and other factors. In addition, our 
financial results are affected by corporate action taken by the 
Group, including acquisitions, disposals and other actions aimed 
at achieving our stated strategy. We believe that all of these 
factors will continue to affect our results in the future. 
Demographic trends 
Our results are affected by the demographic make-up of the 
countries in which we operate. The types of products that we 
sell reflect the needs of our customers. For example, in regions 
and countries with a high proportion of older people, a larger 
proportion of our sales will reflect their needs for pre and post­
retirement planning. Our sales levels will also be impacted 
by our ability to help provide useful information to such 
policyholders on retirement planning and to offer products 
that are competitive and respond to such policyholders’ needs. 
In our long-term insurance and savings business we make 
assumptions about key non-economic factors, such as the 
mortality rate that we expect to be experienced by our 
policyholders. In countries where the life expectancy is growing, 
this will need to be reflected in our pricing models as lower 
mortality rates will increase profitability of life insurance 
products but will reduce the returns on annuity products. 
We review our assumptions against our own experience 
and industry expectations. During 2007, 2008 and 2009, 
our results were not impacted by any major changes in 
mortality assumptions. 
Economic conditions 
Our results are affected by the levels of economic activity in our 
geographic markets and, consequently, by economic cycles in 
those markets. High levels of general economic activity typically 
result in high levels of demand for, and therefore sales of, our 
products and services. Economic activity in turn is affected by 
government monetary and fiscal policy as well as by global 
trading conditions and external shocks such as terrorist activity, 
war and oil price movements. During 2009, we saw improved 
economic activity across our regions and although customers 
continued to prefer cash deposits, we saw movement towards 
investment products resulting in increased investment sales, 
primarily across Europe and Asia. 
Capital and credit market conditions 
An important part of our business involves investing client 
money and policyholders’ and shareholders’ funds across a wide 
range of financial investments, including equities, fixed income 
securities and properties. Our results are sensitive to volatility in 
the market value of these investments, either directly, because 
we bear some or all of the investment risk or indirectly, because 
we earn management fees for investments managed on behalf 
of policyholders. Investment market conditions also affect the 
demand for a substantial portion of our life insurance products. 
In general, rising equity price levels have a positive effect on the 
demand for equity-linked products, such as unit trusts and unit-
linked life insurance products and conversely a negative effect 
on the demand for products offering fixed or guaranteed 
minimum rates of return. Declining equity price levels tend to 
have the opposite effects. 
During 2008 and the first half of 2009, the capital and 
credit markets experienced extraordinary and extended volatility 
and disruption. In the first quarter of 2009, the volatility and 
disruption reached levels not seen in many years, although the 
markets stabilised in the last quarter of 2009. The amount of 
investment variance improved to £75 million adverse in 2009 
(2008: £1,631 million adverse) due to the recovery in 
investment markets. Positive variances on fixed interest assets 
in Europe and the United States, driven by the narrowing of 
credit spreads toward the end of the year, were offset by 
losses from equity derivatives in the Netherlands. 
With-profits business 
We write products through our with-profits funds mainly in our 
UK operating segment, with smaller funds in Ireland, Australia 
and Singapore. These funds enable policyholders to participate 
in a large pool of diverse investments, therefore reducing their 
exposure to individual securities or asset classes. The investment 
pool is managed by us with returns to with-profits policyholders 
paid through bonuses which are added to the value of their 
policy. In order to provide an element of stability in the returns 
to policyholders, bonuses are designed to reduce policyholders’ 
exposure to the volatility of investment returns over time and 
to provide an equitable share of surplus earned, depending 
on the investment and operating performance of the fund. 
Shareholders also have a participating interest in the with-profit 
funds and any declared bonuses. Generally, policyholder and 
shareholder participation in with-profit funds in the UK is 
split 90:10. 
The level of bonuses declared to policyholders is influenced 
by the actual returns on investments and our expectation of 
future rates of return. While bonuses can never be negative, 
a predicted sustained fall in equity markets could lead to a 
reduction in annual and terminal bonus rates, and so reduce 
both policyholder returns and shareholders’ profit under IFRS. 
Over the early part of this decade, the combination of a decline 
in equity markets and the general outlook for lower interest 
rates led to reductions in annual bonus rates, and the 
corresponding shareholders’ share of profits. The subsequent 
recovery in equity markets over 2003-2007 led to a partial 
reversal of this trend. During 2008 and 2009 the worsening 
economic conditions have impacted on UK bonus levels but 
the annual effect of this for both policyholders and shareholders 
has been offset by the benefit from the one-off special bonus 
mentioned below. 
Shareholders’ profits arising on with-profits business under 
IFRS depend on the total bonuses declared to policyholders on

an annual basis. A special bonus distribution has been 
announced for policyholders of two of our UK with-profits 
funds, reflecting the financial strength of those funds, which 
has provided an uplift to IFRS profits in both 2008 and 2009 
and will provide an uplift in 2010 of approximately £100 million. 
General insurance and health underwriting cycle 
Our general insurance and health business is comprised of 
our property and casualty insurance and health insurance 
operations. In 2009, general insurance accounted for 29% 
of group net premiums written from continuing operations 
and 35% of our group operating earnings before interest and 
corporate costs respectively. Demand for general insurance is 
usually price-sensitive because of the limited degree of product 
differentiation inherent in the industry. As a result, the price of 
insuring property and casualty risks is subject to a cycle (called 
an underwriting cycle). In periods when the price of risk is high, 
the high profitability of selling insurance attracts new entrants 
and hence new capital into the market. Increased competition 
however drives prices down. Eventually the business becomes 
uneconomic and some industry players, suffering from losses, 
exit the market while others fail, resulting in lower capital 
invested within the market. Decreased competition leads to 
increasing prices, thereby repeating the cycle. Although our 
various general insurance markets are not always at the same 
stage of the underwriting cycle, price competition has been 
increasing within the UK and the rest of the world across most 
of our general insurance business lines in recent years. We are 
now seeing early evidence of increased rating discipline in the 
UK resulting from volatile investment markets. 
We expect the underwriting cycle to continue to operate in 
the future but to be less pronounced than in the past because 
of structural changes to the industry over the past decade. 
Capital markets are imposing financial discipline by being 
increasingly more demanding about performance from 
insurance companies before extending new capital. Such 
discipline, together with the increased concentration of 
competitors within the market, recent natural disasters and 
the adoption of more scientific pricing methods is expected 
to make the underwriting cycle less pronounced in the future. 
Natural and man-made disasters 
Our general insurance and health business results are affected 
by the amount of claims we need to pay out which, in turn, 
can be subject to significant volatility depending on many 
factors, including natural and man-made disasters. Natural 
disasters arise from adverse weather, earthquakes and other 
such natural phenomena. Man-made disasters include accidents 
and intentional events, such as acts of terrorism. These events 
are difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy, although 
they generally occur infrequently at a material level. Our 
exposure to large disasters has been somewhat reduced 
through the recent strategic refocusing of our general insurance 
business towards personal lines business and small- to medium-
sized commercial risks. Our costs in connection with natural 
and man-made disasters are also significantly mitigated by 
reinsurance arrangements with external parties such that our 
maximum exposure is limited to no more than approximately 
£400 million for a one in ten year event or £850 million for 
a one in hundred year event. See “Financial Statements 
IFRS – Note 56 – Risk Management” and “Financial Statements 
IFRS – Note 41 – Reinsurance Assets” for further information 
on our reinsurance programme. 
During 2007, the UK results were adversely impacted 
by £475 million for claims relating to the winter storms and 
summer floods. In 2008, Ireland and Canada incurred some

weather-related losses and in 2009 the UK, Ireland and France 
were all impacted. 
Government policy and legislation 
Changes in government policy and legislation applicable to our 
business in any of the markets in which we operate, particularly 
in the UK, may affect our results of operations. These include 
changes to the tax treatment of financial products and services, 
government pension arrangements and policies, the regulation 
of selling practices and the regulation of solvency standards. 
Such changes may affect our existing and future business by, for 
example, causing customers to cancel existing policies, requiring 
us to change our range of products and services, forcing us to 
redesign our technology, requiring us to retrain our staff or 
increase our tax liability. In the UK, the government has recently 
conducted a number of reviews of the long-term insurance and 
savings industry with the aim of promoting long-term insurance 
and saving by simplifying and reducing the cost of product 
offerings. As a global business, we are exposed to various local 
political, regulatory and economic conditions, business risks and 
challenges which may affect the demand for our products and 
services, the value of our investments portfolio and the credit 
quality of local counterparties. Our regulated business is subject 
to extensive regulatory supervision both in the UK and 
internationally. For details please refer to the section 
“Shareholder Information – Regulation”. 
In 2006, the Financial Services Authority in the UK amended 
the rules regarding the valuation of non-profit life reserves. 
The impact on Aviva was a £167 million benefit to operating 
profit in 2007 and a £149 million benefit in 2006. In 2008, 
the ombudsman in the Netherlands investigated the level 
of charges paid by unit-linked policyholders across the life 
insurance industry. As a result of this investigation, our Delta 
Lloyd life business agreed to recompense their policyholders 
and provided £126 million for this cost. 
Exchange rate fluctuations 
We publish our consolidated financial statements in Pounds 
sterling. Due to our substantial non-UK operations, a significant 
portion of our operating earnings and net assets are denominated 
in currencies other than sterling, most notably the euro and 
the US dollar. As a consequence, our results are exposed to 
translation risk arising from fluctuations in the values of these 
currencies against sterling. Total foreign currency movements 
during 2009 resulted in a loss recognised in the income 
statement of £154 million, an improvement of £173 million 
from a £327 million loss in 2008. 
We generally do not hedge foreign currency revenues, 
as we prefer to retain revenue locally in each business to 
support business growth, to meet local and regulatory market 
requirements, and to maintain sufficient assets in local currency 
to match local currency liabilities. 
Movements in exchange rates may affect the value of 
consolidated shareholders’ equity, which is expressed in sterling. 
Exchange differences taken to other comprehensive income 
arise on the translation of the net investment in foreign 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. This aspect of foreign 
exchange risk is monitored centrally against limits that we have 
set to control the extent to which capital deployment and 
capital requirements are not aligned. We use currency 
borrowings and derivatives when necessary to keep currency 
exposures within these predetermined limits, and to hedge 
specific foreign exchange risks when appropriate; for example, 
in any acquisition or disposal activity. During 2009, sterling had 
strengthened recovering some of its loss in value against the 
euro and dollar in 2008 resulting in a foreign currency loss in 
other comprehensive income of £951 million. During 2008, 
Performance review   
 
 
 
 
 
38 
Aviva plc Financial and operating performance continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
we reported a foreign currency translation gain in other 
comprehensive income of £2,684 million as sterling weakened 
significantly against the euro and the dollar. During 2007, 
the currency translation gain was lower at £723 million. 
The impact of these fluctuations is limited to a significant 
degree, however, by the fact that revenues, expenses, assets 
and liabilities within our non-UK operations are generally 
denominated in the same currencies. 
Acquisitions and disposals 
Over the last three years we have engaged in a significant 
amount of acquisitions and disposals, some of which have had 
a material impact on our results. These transactions reflect our 
strategic objectives of maximising value for our shareholders 
by building top five positions in key markets, withdrawing from 
lines of business or markets that do not offer the potential for 
market-leading positions and taking advantage of particular 
opportunities as they arise. 
Activity in 2009 
On 1 October 2009, we completed the sale of our Australian 
life and pension business and wealth management platform 
to the National Australia Bank for A$902 million (£443 million). 
The sale supports Aviva’s strategy of focusing on the key growth 
markets in Asia where leading positions can be achieved. 
On 3 November 2009, we completed the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) of approximately 42% of Delta Lloyd N.V. raising 
€1.1 billion (£1 billion). The IPO enabled Aviva to monetise 
part of its holding in Delta Lloyd, giving Aviva greater financial 
flexibility, including the option to explore balance sheet 
restructuring and further growth opportunities. It will also 
enhance the value and liquidity of Aviva’s retained stake in 
Delta Lloyd. 
Delta Lloyd, at the start of the year, sold its health business 
for £235 million to OWM CZ Groep Zorgverkeraar UA (CZ). The 
sale to CZ removed the underwriting risk and administration out 
of Delta Lloyd whilst continuing to sell health products and also 
market general insurance and income protection products to 
CZ’s customers. 
Continuing with the group’s strategy to exit non-core 
operations, we disposed of the British School of Motoring 
Limited for a consideration of £4 million. 
Activity in 2008 
During 2008, we acquired subsidiaries in Ireland, Italy and 
Belgium. In Belgium we acquired Swiss Life Belgium, further 
strengthening our position in the Belgium life insurance market. 
The acquisition of UBI Vita in Italy provides us with a new 
bancassurance distribution channel and the acquisition of Vivas 
Group Ltd. in Ireland has enabled us to enter the Irish health 
insurance market. Total consideration for these acquisitions, 
including costs, was £189 million. 
As part of our strategy to exit non-core operations, we 
disposed of HPI Limited and RAC Autowindscreens Limited in 
the UK and our life operations in Luxembourg. In addition, 
we disposed of our offshore administration operations. These 
offshore operations will continue to provide administration 
services to our UK, Irish and Canadian businesses under a 
master services agreement with the new owners. Consideration 
for these disposals was £126 million, realising a net profit 
on disposal of £7 million. 
Activity in 2007 
During 2007, we acquired subsidiaries in Spain, Italy and the UK 
in connection with bancassurance agreements with Cajamurcia, 
Banco Popolare and HSBC, with the objective of further 
increasing our distribution channels and access to customers in 
these markets. In the Netherlands we acquired Erasmus Group 
and an 85% interest in Cyrte Investments NV, further 
strengthening the position of our Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, 
in the Dutch insurance and fund management markets. Total 
consideration for these acquisitions, including costs, was 
£397 million. 
In addition to these acquisitions we entered into joint 
venture agreements with local banks in Turkey, Malaysia and 
Taiwan. Our joint ventures in Malaysia and Taiwan gave us 
access to these emerging markets for the first time, while our 
joint venture in Turkey considerably strengthens our position 
in the Turkish life and pensions market. Total consideration 
for these joint ventures was £208 million. 
We disposed of a number of businesses, the most material 
of which was the contribution of our Turkish business, Aviva HE, 
to our Turkish joint venture, referred to above. This gave rise to 
a profit on disposal of £71 million. Other disposals of smaller 
operations gave rise to a loss on disposal before tax of 
£22 million. 
Reattribution of inherited estate 
The “inherited estate” refers to the assets of the long-term 
with-profit funds less the realistic reserves for non-profit 
policies, less asset shares aggregated across the with-profit 
policies and any additional amounts expected at the valuation 
date to be paid to in-force policyholders in the future in respect 
of smoothing costs and guarantees. 
The reattribution of our inherited estate completed on 
1 October 2009 following the High Court’s approval of the offer 
in September and final approval by the Aviva plc and Aviva UK 
Life boards. Our objective was always to create a reattribution 
that was fair to both shareholders and policyholders, making 
sure that customers had a choice of whether they wished to 
accept the offer, depending on their personal circumstances. 
As a result, over 87% of eligible policyholders voted during 
the election process, with 96% of these voting in favour of 
the offer. By the end of 2009, the majority of the £471 million 
reattribution payment had been distributed to those 
policyholders who accepted the offer. 
As previously stated, from a shareholder perspective the 
reattribution is expected to enhance the cash flow profile of 
Aviva’s UK life business and will bring significant financial 
benefits. In return for the £471 million shareholders are 
expected to gain access to around £650 million of additional 
capital over five years, to fund new, non profit business. 
The reattribution resulted in an IFRS operating loss of 
£5 million (being the net impact of the value of the estate, 
project costs, tax and the ‘Policyholder Incentive Payment’). 
In addition to this, investment earnings on reattributed assets 
and the surplus generated from the ‘New With-Profits Sub-
Fund’ during the period 1 October to 31 December 2009 
generated IFRS operating profits of £79 million. The after 
tax contribution was £51 million in 2009. 
Basis of earnings by line of business 
Our earnings originate from three main lines of business: 
our long-term insurance and savings business, which includes a 
range of life insurance and savings products; fund management, 
which manages funds on behalf of our long-term insurance and 
general insurance businesses, external institutions, pension 
funds and retail clients; and general insurance and health, 
which focuses on personal and commercial lines. These lines 
of business are present in our various operating segments to 
a greater or lesser extent. In the UK, we have major long-term 
insurance and savings businesses and general insurance 
businesses; in Europe we have long-term insurance and savings 
businesses in all countries in which we operate, large general

insurance businesses in Ireland and the Netherlands, through 
our Delta Lloyd subsidiary, and smaller general insurance 
operations in several other countries; in North America we have 
a large long-term insurance and savings business in the US and 
a major general insurance business in Canada; in Asia Pacific we 
predominantly have long-term insurance and savings businesses. 
Our fund management businesses operate across all our 
four regions. 
Long-term insurance and savings business 
For most of our life insurance businesses, such as those in 
the UK, France and the Netherlands, operating earnings are 
generated principally from our in-force books of business. 
Our in-force books consist of business written in prior years 
and on which we continue to generate profits for shareholders. 
Nevertheless new business written in these markets, with the 
exception of our UK with-profits business which is discussed 
below, has a significant direct effect on our operating earnings. 
Under IFRS, certain costs incurred in acquiring new business 
must be expensed thereby typically giving rise to a loss in the 
period of acquisition, though the degree of this effect will 
depend on the pricing structure of product offerings. In markets 
where we are experiencing strong growth, such as we have 
experienced in Spain, Italy, the US and Asia in recent years, 
current year sales have a more significant effect on current 
year operating earnings. 
UK with-profits business 
With-profits products are designed to pay policyholders 
smoother investment returns through a combination of small 
annual bonuses and large terminal bonuses. Shareholders’ profit 
emerges from this business in direct proportion to policyholder 
bonuses, as shareholders receive up to one-ninth of the value 
of each year’s bonus declaration to policyholders. Accordingly, 
the smoothing inherent in the bonus declarations provides for 
relatively stable annual shareholders’ profit from this business. 
The most significant factors that influence the determination 
of bonus rates are the return on the investments of the with-
profits funds and expectations about future investment returns. 
Actual and expected investment returns are affected by, among 
other factors, the mix of investments supporting the with-profits 
fund, which in turn is influenced by the extent of the inherited 
estate within the with-profits fund. 
The annual excess of premiums and investment return 
over operating expenses, benefit provisions and claims 
payments within our with-profits funds that is not distributed 
as bonuses and related shareholders’ profit, is transferred from 
the income statement to the unallocated divisible surplus. 
Conversely, if a shortfall arises one year, for example because of 
insufficient investment return, a transfer out of the unallocated 
divisible surplus finances bonus declarations and related 
shareholders’ profit. 
The unallocated divisible surplus therefore consists of 
future (as yet undetermined) policyholder benefits, associated 
shareholders’ profit and the orphan estate. The orphan estate 
serves as working capital for our with-profits funds. It affords 
the with-profits fund a degree of freedom to invest a substantial 
portion of the funds’ assets in investments yielding higher 
returns than might otherwise be obtainable without being 
constrained by the need to absorb the cash-flow strain of 
writing large volumes of new business and the need to 
demonstrate solvency. 
Other long-term insurance and savings business 
Non-profit business falls mainly into two categories: investment 
type business and risk cover business. Investment type business, 
which accounts for most of our non-profit business, includes 
Governance 
Shareholder information 
Financial statements IFRS 
Financial statements MCEV 
Other information 
predominantly unit-linked life and pensions business, where 
the risk of investing policy assets is borne entirely by the 
policyholder. In addition investment type business also includes 
life and pensions business where the risk of investing policy 
assets is typically shared between policyholders and 
shareholders, subject to a minimum rate of investment return 
guaranteed to policyholders. Operating earnings arise from 
unit-linked business when fees charged to policyholders based 
on the value of the policy assets exceed costs of acquiring new 
business and administration costs. In respect of remaining 
investment type business, investment return generated from 
policy assets has an effect on operating earnings though this is 
often non-proportional. Finally in respect of all investment type 
business, shareholders bear the risk of investing shareholder 
capital in support of these operations. 
Risk cover business includes term assurance, or term life 
insurance business. The risk of investing policy assets in this 
business is borne entirely by the shareholders. Operating 
earnings arise when premiums, and investment return earned 
on assets supporting insurance liabilities and shareholder capital, 
exceed claims costs, costs of acquiring new business and 
administration costs. 
General insurance and health business 
Operating earnings within our general insurance and health 
business arise when premiums, and investment return earned 
on assets supporting insurance liabilities and shareholder capital, 
exceed claims costs, costs of acquiring new business and 
administration costs. 
Fund management 
Fund management operating earnings consist of fees earned for 
managing policyholder funds and external retail and institutional 
funds on behalf of clients, net of operating expenses. 
Approximately 30% of our fund management operating 
earnings are derived from external clients. Arrangements for the 
management of proprietary funds are conducted on an arm’s 
length basis between our fund management and insurance 
businesses. Such arrangements exist mainly in the UK, France, 
the Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, US and Canada. Proprietary 
insurance funds in other countries are externally managed. 
Other business 
Other business includes our operations other than insurance 
and fund management. These incorporate mainly our roadside 
recovery operation in the UK, and our banking and retail 
mortgage operations in the Netherlands and Belgium. 
Financial highlights 
The following analysis is based on our consolidated financial 
statements and should be read in conjunction with those 
statements. In order to fully explain the performance of our 
business, we discuss and analyse the results of our business in 
terms of certain financial measures which are not based on IFRS 
“non-GAAP measures” which we use for internal monitoring 
and for executive remuneration purposes. We review these in 
addition to GAAP measures such as profit before and after tax. 
Non-GAAP measures 
Sales 
The total sales of the group consist of long-term insurance and 
savings new business sales and general insurance and health 
net written premiums. We classify our long-term insurance 
and savings new business sales into the following categories: 
Long-term insurance and savings new business sales

— This includes traditional life insurance, annuity business and 
with profit business 
– There is an element of insurance risk borne by the group 
therefore, under IFRS, these are reported within net written 
premiums. 
— Non-participating investment business 
– This includes unit-linked business and pensions business 
– The amounts received for this business are treated as 
deposits under IFRS and an investment management fee 
is earned on the funds deposited. 
– For new business reporting in the UK, companies continue 
to report non-participating investment business within their 
“covered business” sales, in line with the historic treatment 
under UK GAAP. 
Non-covered business or investment sales: 
— These include retail sales of mutual fund type products 
such as unit trusts and OEICs. 
— There is no insurance risk borne by the group therefore 
under IFRS, these are treated as deposits and investment 
management fee income is earned on the funds deposited. 
This is in line with their previous treatment under UK GAAP. 
— These have never been treated as “covered business” for 
long-term insurance and savings reporting so we show 
these separately as investment sales. 
Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure and key performance 
indicator that we report to our key decision makers in the 
businesses in order to assess the value of new business from 
our customers and compare performance across the markets 
in which we operate. We consider sales to be a critical indicator 
of new business, and is the basis on which we provide analysis 
of our results to our shareholders and analysts. The non-GAAP 
measure of sales is also used internally in the determination 
of bonus awards as an executive performance measure. 
For our general insurance and health business we report 
sales based on IFRS net written premiums. 
For long-term insurance and savings new business, we 
define sales as the sum of the present value of new business 
premiums (PVNBP) of life, pension and savings products and 
investment sales. 
PVNBP is equal to total single premium sales received in the 
year plus the discounted value of annual premiums expected to 
be received over the terms of newly incepted contracts and is 
calculated as at the date of sale. We adjust annual premiums 
to reflect the expected stream of business coming from this 
new business over future years. In the view of management this 
performance measure better recognises the relative economic 
value of regular premium contracts compared to single premium 
contracts. PVNBP is a European insurance industry standard 
measure of new business. 
For our long-term insurance and savings business, we 
believe that sales is an important measure of underlying 
performance and a better measure for new business than 
IFRS net written premiums. We consider the use of sales 
over IFRS net written premiums provides: 
— Consistent treatment of long-term insurance and investment 
contracts: IFRS net written premiums do not include deposits 
received on non-participating investment contracts. Long-
term insurance contracts and participating investment 
contracts also contain a deposit component, which are 
included in IFRS net written premiums, in addition to an 
insurance risk component. Therefore, to appropriately assess 
the revenue generated on a consistent basis between types 
of contracts, we evaluate the present value of new business 
sales of long-term insurance and investment products on 
the basis of total premiums and deposits collected, including 
sales of mutual fund type products such as unit trusts 
and OEICs. 
— Better reflection of the relative economic value of regular 
premium contracts compared to single premium contracts: 
Sales recognise the economic value of all expected 
contractual cash flows for regular premium contracts in 
the year of inception, whereas IFRS net written premiums 
only recognise premiums received in the year. 
— Better reflection of current management actions in the year: 
IFRS net written premiums include premiums on regular 
premium contracts, which incepted in prior years, and 
therefore reflect the actions of management in prior years. 
In comparison to IFRS net written premiums, sales do not 
include premiums received from contracts in-force at the 
beginning of the year, even though these are a source of IFRS 
revenue, as these have already been recognised as sales in the 
year of inception of the contract. In addition, unlike IFRS net 
written premiums, sales do not reflect the effect on premiums 
of any increase or decrease in persistency of regular premium 
contracts compared to what was assumed at the inception of 
the contract. 
PVNBP is not a substitute for net written premiums as 
determined in accordance with IFRS. Our definition of sales 
may differ from similar measures used by other companies, 
and may change over time. 
General insurance and health sales 
General insurance and health sales are defined as IFRS net 
written premiums, being those premiums written during the 
year net of amounts reinsured with third parties, as set out in 
the segmental analysis of results in “Financial Statements IFRS – 
Note 3 – Segmental information”. For sales reporting, we use 
the GAAP measure for general insurance and health business. 
The table below presents our consolidated sales for the 
years ended 31 December 2009, 2008 and 2007, as well as 
the reconciliation of sales to net written premiums in IFRS.

— Effect of capitalisation factor on regular premium 
long-term business: 
PVNBP is derived from the single and regular premiums of 
the products sold during the financial period and is expressed 
at the point of sale. The PVNBP calculation is equal to total 
single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted 
value of regular premiums expected to be received over the 
term of the new contracts. The discounted value of regular 
premiums is calculated using the market consistent 
embedded value methodology proposed by the CFO Forum 
Principles, which we believe will be adopted by all European 
insurance businesses. 
The discounted value reflects the expected income 
streams over the life of the contract, adjusted for expected 
levels of persistency, discounted back to present value. The 
discounted value can also be expressed as annualised regular 
premiums multiplied by a weighted average capitalisation 
factor (WACF). The WACF varies over time depending 
on the mix of new products sold, the average outstanding 
term of the new contracts and the projection assumptions.

and associates: 
Total long-term new business sales include our share of sales 
from joint ventures and associates. Under IFRS reporting, 
premiums from these sales are excluded from our 
consolidated accounts, with only our share of profits or 
losses from such businesses being brought into the income 
statement separately. 
— Annualisation impact of regular premium long-term business: 
As noted above, the calculation of PVNBP includes annualised 
regular premiums. The impact of this annualisation is removed 
in order to reconcile the non-GAAP new business sales to IFRS 
premiums and will vary depending on the volume of regular 
premium sales during the year. 
— Deposits taken on non-participating investment contracts: 
Under IFRS, non-participating investment contracts are 
recognised on the statement of financial position by 
recording the cash received as a deposit and an associated 
liability and are not recorded as premiums received in the 
income statement. Only the margin earned is recognised in 
the income statement. 
— Retail sales of mutual fund type products (investment sales): 
Investment sales included in the total sales number represent 
the cash inflows received from customers to invest in mutual 
fund type products such as unit trusts and OEICs. We earn 
fees on the investment and management of these funds 
which are recorded separately in the IFRS income statement 
as “fees and commissions received” and are not included in 
statutory premiums. 
— IFRS gross written premiums from existing long-term 
business: 
The non-GAAP measure of long-term and savings sales 
focuses on new business written in the year under review 
while the IFRS income statement includes premiums received 
from all business, both new and existing.

Adjusted operating profit 
We report to our chief operating decision makers in the 
businesses the results of our operating segments using a 
financial performance measure we refer to herein as “adjusted 
operating profit”. We define our segment adjusted operating 
profit as profit before income taxes and minority interests in 
earnings, excluding the following items: investment return 
variances and economic assumption changes on long-term 
and non long-term business, impairment of goodwill, 
amortisation and impairment of other intangibles (excluding 
the acquired value of in-force business), profit or loss on 
the disposal of subsidiaries and associates, integration and 
restructuring costs and exceptional items. 
While these excluded items are significant components 
in understanding and assessing our consolidated financial 
performance, we believe that the presentation of adjusted 
operating profit enhances the understanding and comparability 
of the underlying performance of our segments by highlighting 
net income attributable to ongoing segment operations. 
Adjusted operating profit for long-term insurance and 
savings business is based on expected investment returns on 
financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder 
funds over the period, with consistent allowance for the 
corresponding expected movements in liabilities. The expected 
rate of return is determined using consistent assumptions 
between operations, having regard to local economic and 
market forecasts of investment return and asset classification. 
Where assets are classified as fair value through profit and loss, 
expected return is based on the same assumptions used under 
embedded value principles for fixed income securities, equities 
and properties. Where fixed interest securities are classified as 
available for sale, such as in the US, the expected return 
comprises interest or dividend payments and amortisation of 
the premium or discount at purchase. Adjusted operating profit 
includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic 
items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the 
effect of changes in non-economic assumptions. Changes due 
to economic items, such as market value movement and interest 
rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and 
expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in 
economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed as non-
operating items. 
Adjusted operating profit for non long-term insurance 
business is based on expected investment returns on financial 
investments backing shareholder funds over the period. 
Expected investment returns are calculated for equities and 
properties by multiplying the opening market value of the 
investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, 
by the longer-term rate of return. This rate of return is the same 
as that applied for the long-term business expected returns. The 
longer-term return for other investments is the actual income 
receivable for the period. Changes due to market value 
movement and interest rate changes, which give rise to 
variances between actual and expected investment returns, are 
disclosed as non-operating items. The impact of changes in the 
discount rate applied to claims provisions is also treated outside 
adjusted operating profit. 
Adjusted operating profit is not a substitute for profit 
before income taxes and minority interests in earnings or net 
income as determined in accordance with IFRS. Our definition of 
adjusted operating profit may differ from similar measures used 
by other companies, and may change over time.

Sales 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Sales in 2009 were £45,068 million, a decrease of £6,309 
million, or 12%, from £51,377 million in 2008. All regions 
reported a decrease in sales in 2009. Long-term insurance and 
savings and general insurance and health sales decreased by 
24% in the UK with Europe reporting an increase of 6% in 
long-term insurance and savings sales offset by a 26% decrease 
in general insurance and health sales mainly attributable to the 
sale of the Delta Lloyd health business on 1 January 2009. North 
America long-term insurance and savings sales decreased by 
£1,170 million, offset by a 12% increase in general insurance 
sales in Canada. Asia Pacific reported a decrease in sales of 22% 
mainly attributable to the sale of the Australian business on 
1 October 2009. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Sales in 2008 were £51,377 million, an increase of £1,103 
million or 2% from £50,274 million in 2007. This increase was 
mainly attributable to growth in Europe and North America in 
life and pension sales. Life and pension sales in Europe increased 
by 8% from £15,684 million in 2007 to £16,952 million in 
2008, boosted by strength in the euro exchange rate, and in 
North America life and pension sales increased considerably 
to £5,715 million, an increase of £2,069 million or 57% from 
£3,646 million in 2007. General insurance and health sales 
were £11,137 million, an increase of 5% across the whole 
group from £10,569 million in 2007. 
Income 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Net written premiums in 2009 were £32,114 million, a decrease 
of £2,251 million, or 7%, from £34,365 million in 2008. Long-
term insurance and savings and general insurance and health 
both reported decreases in net written premiums primarily in 
the UK with a 36% decrease in long-term insurance and savings 
and 22% decrease in general insurance and health net written 
premiums in the UK. Europe reported a 12% increase in net 
written premiums with both North America and Asia Pacific 
reporting a decrease in net written premiums of 2% and 
11% respectively. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Net written premiums in 2008 were £34,365 million, an 
increase of £5,032 million or 17% from £29,333 million in 
2007. This increase reflects a 24% increase in life and pension 
premiums due to strong new business sales across most of our 
operations and a 5% increase in general insurance and health 
sales predominantly driven by our operations in France, the 
Netherlands and Canada. 
Net investment income 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Net investment income for the year was £24,972 million, 
an increase of £41,015 million (2008: £16,043 million loss). 
During 2009, investment markets across the regions in which 
we operated improved significantly from the falls in property 
and equity markets that were experienced in 2008. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Net investment income decreased by £25,732 million to a loss 
of £16,043 million (2007: £9,689 million profit). This decrease 
reflects the lower market value of properties in the UK, 30% 
to 50% fall in equity values across the world and the impact 
of falling yields and widening credit spreads on fixed income 
securities.

Other income 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Other income (which consists of fee and commission income, 
share of (loss)/profit after tax of joint ventures and associates, 
and profit/(loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and associates) 
increased by £674 million to £1,438 million in 2009 (2008: 
£764 million). Profit/(loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and 
associates includes the sale of our Dutch health business 
and our Australian long-term insurance and savings business 
resulting in a profit of £153 million. The loss after tax of joint 
ventures and associates was £504 million, an increase on 
2008 of £624 million from increasing property values from 
our property partnerships. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Other income decreased by £741 million to £764 million in 
2008 (2007: £1,505 million). The decrease was mainly due to 
the share of losses in joint ventures and associates in the UK, 
where reduced property market values led to lower property 
partnership results. 
Expenses 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Claims and benefits paid in 2009 were £27,549 million, 
a decrease of £1,804 million (2008: £29,353 million). The 
decrease in claims and benefits paid are a result of a fall in 
surrenders during the year and our Dutch healthcare business 
being sold as of 1 January 2009. 
Changes in insurance liabilities in 2009 were a charge 
of £5,682 million, an increase of £9,567 million (2008: 
£3,885 million credit). The unfavourable movement is a result 
of new business provision and the impact of the euro 
against sterling. 
The change in investment contract provisions of 
£11,185 million charge (2008: £10,629 million credit) is a result 
of improved investment markets across our regions resulting 
in increases in our contract liabilities the impact of the euro 
against sterling. 
Unallocated divisible surplus charge of £1,547 million 
(2008: £4,482 million credit) reflects the narrowing of 
investment spread on participating assets and related liabilities. 
In 2008, a negative balance in Spain created a charge of 
£203 million of which £159 million was reversed in 2009 with 
the remaining balance expected to be recovered in 2010. 
Fee and commission expense, other expenses and finance 
costs of £11,098 million decreased by £276 million or 2% from 
£11,374 million in 2008. Lower staff costs and impairment 
charges were offset by higher exceptional costs following the 
reattribution of the inherited estate in the UK – see “Financial 
Statements – Note 6 – Details of expenses”. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Claims and benefits paid in 2008 were £2,232 million higher at 
£29,353 million (2007: £27,121 million). The increase occurred 
across all regions, with the exception of the UK, due to 
unfavourable foreign exchange movement. 
Changes in insurance liabilities in 2008 were £7,393 million 
lower resulting in a £3,885 million credit (2007: charge of 
£3,508 million). The favourable movement was primarily a result 
of investment variances across the world and greater lapses 
than expected in France. 
The change in investment contract provisions in 2008 was 
a credit of £10,629 million (2007: charge of £2,018 million). 
The variance of £12,647 million from the prior year reflects the 
reduction in investment contract provisions as a result of lower 
new business and unrealised losses on investments. 
The change in the unallocated divisible surplus in 2008 was 
£1,560 million more than the prior year with a credit of

£4,482 million (2007: credit of £2,922 million) mainly reflecting 
the impact of falling market values on participating assets and 
related liabilities. These were partly offset by a write-down of 
the negative balance in Spain which created a charge in the 
income statement of £203 million. 
Fees and commission expense, other expenses and finance 
costs in 2008 were £2,440 million higher at £11,374 million 
(2007: £8,934 million). The increase was driven by corporate 
restructuring and brand expense across the group and 
£1,040 million of impairments of financial assets mainly in the 
Netherlands and the US. 
Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to shareholders’ profits 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
Profit attributable to shareholders in 2009 was £1,805 million 
against a loss of £1,300 million in 2008. The increase is primarily 
due to favourable investment performance in 2009 which more 
than offset the decrease in premiums and increase in expenses 
as discussed above. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Loss before tax attributable to shareholders in 2008 was 
£1,300 million, a reduction of £3,132 million against the 
previous year (2007: £1,832 million profit). This decrease 
reflected the 52% reduction in income mainly due to 
investment performance, which was partly offset by lower 
expenses, discussed above, and a policyholder tax credit of 
£1,068 million (2007: tax charge of £15 million). 
Adjusting items 
Year ended 31 December 2009 
The long-term insurance and savings business investment 
variances and economic assumption changes on long-term 
insurance business was a charge of £75 million (2008: 
£1,631 million charge). The favourable change is driven by 
positive market movements across our regions and the inclusion 
in 2008 of a £550 million provision for credit defaults in the UK. 
The short-term fluctuations and economic assumption 
changes on the non-life business were a £152 million credit 
(2008: £913 million charge). Favourable market movements 
across our regions were the primary driver for the change in 
the current year result. 
Impairment of goodwill was £62 million in 2009 (2008: 
£66 million) driven by impairments in our UK life business and 
on an Italian associate. 
Amortisation of intangibles increased by £27 million to 
£144 million in 2009 (2008: £117 million) on higher levels of 
bancassurance and other distribution agreements held within 
the Group. 
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries and associates were 
£153 million. The profit comprises £31 million from the sale 
of our Dutch Health Insurance business and £122 million from 
the sale of our Australian life and pensions business. 
Integration and restructuring costs for 2009 were 
£286 million (2008: £326 million). This includes £210 million for 
the cost savings initiatives in the UK life and general insurance 
businesses and Europe, which have delivered £170 million 
annualised cost savings in the year. 
Exceptional items for 2009 amounted to £45 million 
favourable (2008: £551 million adverse). This includes an 
exceptional gain resulting from the reattribution of the inherited 
estate offset by strengthening of reserves in respect of several 
specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada 
a significant number of years ago and the migration of all 
remaining local brands, except Delta Lloyd and RAC, to the 
single global Aviva brand, which has been implemented over 
the two-year period 2008 to 2009.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
The long-term insurance and savings business investment 
variances and economic assumption changes on long-term 
insurance business were a charge of £1,631 million in 2008 
(2007: £15 million credit). The change is attributable to a 
provision for credit defaults of £550 million in the UK, with the 
balance primarily driven by investment losses across Europe. 
The short-term fluctuations and economic assumption 
changes on the non-life business in 2008 were £913 million 
unfavourable (2007: £182 million unfavourable). These were 
due to lower investment market returns compared to our 
longer-term investment return assumptions and £94 million 
for the impact of changes in discount rates for latent 
claims provisions. 
Impairment of goodwill was £66 million in 2008 (2007: 
£10 million). This was mainly driven by impairments in the 
Netherlands and on an Italian associate company. 
Amortisation of intangibles increased by £14 million 
to £117 million in 2008 (2007: £103 million). This increase 
reflected the higher level of bancassurance and other 
distribution agreements held within the Group following 
new agreements entered into during 2007. 
Profit on disposal of subsidiaries and associates was 
£7 million in 2008. The profit comprises £14 million from the 
sale of the Group’s offshore operations to WNS (Holdings) 
Limited and £31 million from other small operations, offset 
by £38 million loss on the disposal of HPI Limited to Solera 
Holdings Inc., and RAC Autowindscreens Limited to Arques 
Management GmbH. 
Integration and restructuring costs were £326 million in 
2008 (2007: £153 million). This includes £287 million for the 
cost savings initiatives in the UK life and general insurance 
businesses and Europe, which have delivered £340 million 
annualised cost savings in the year. Also included were 
integration costs of £39 million which mainly relate to the 
work to set up our global asset management operation, 
Aviva Investors. 
Exceptional items for 2008 were £551 million. These 
included £142 million for the cost of transferring the lifetime 
wrap platform to a third-party supplier, write-down in 
preparation for sale of the British School of Motoring in the 
UK and closure of the structured settlement business in the US. 
The costs also included £304 million after reinsurance for the 
discounted cost of strengthening our latent claims provisions, 
mainly in the UK, and £126 million for the settlement agreed 
by our Netherlands life business for its unit-linked policyholders, 
following an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees. 
The remaining balance relates to brand migration costs of 
£37 million offset by £58 million benefit from settlement of 
a disputed Australian tax liability and the consequent release 
of a provision for interest charges. 
Adjusted operating profit

Sales in our UK long-term insurance and savings business 
decreased by £3,380 million, or 25%, to £9,963 million (2008: 
£13,343 million). Protection sales have decreased by 14% as 
a result of regulatory changes affecting creditor sales volumes. 
Pension sales decreased by 21% due to the reduced number of 
large schemes written in the year. Annuities decreased by 22% 
due to lower bulk purchase annuity volumes, bonds decreased 
39% and investment sales decreased by 29%. Equity release 
showed an increase of 10%. 
Net written premiums in our UK long-term insurance and 
savings business were £4,389 million, a decrease of £2,718 
million, or 38%, from £7,107 million in 2008. The decrease is 
primarily due to lower bulk purchase annuity and bond sales. 
Adjusted operating profit in our UK long-term insurance 
and savings business decreased by 10% to £658 million (2008: 
£733 million) reflecting lower asset values on bonuses declared 
in our with-profits funds and on the level of the with-profit 
special distribution bonus. The non-profit result increased to 
£495 million (2008: £462 million) including the benefit of 
the reattribution but was partly offset by lower annual 
management charges. 
Profit before tax was £611 million for 2009 (2008: 
£149 million loss). The loss for 2008 included an additional 
£550 million provision for credit defaults over and above the 
long-term provisions, which has been retained in 2009, and 
£97 million for the cost of transferring the investment wrap 
platform to a third-party supplier, which were one off events 
in that year. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Sales in our UK long-term insurance and savings business 
decreased by £1,205 million, or 8%, to £13,343 million (2007: 
£14,548 million). The decrease was driven by sales in bonds 
down 21% and investment sales down 46% compared to 2007 
due to investment market turbulence, with protection down 
9% due to the decline in mortgage approvals. Pensions and

annuities showed an increase of 17% on 2007, with equity 
release up by 3% on 2007. 
Net written premiums in our UK long-term insurance and 
savings business were £7,107 million in 2008, an increase of 
£1,830 million, or 35%, from £5,277 million in 2007. The 
increase was primarily driven by bulk purchase annuity and 
pension sales. 
Adjusted operating profit in our UK long-term insurance 
and savings business increased by £20 million, or 3%, to £733 
million in 2008 (2007: £713 million). This increase was driven 
by the £124 million profit relating to the shareholder proportion 
of the special bonus distribution announced in February 2008. 
The prior year result included a £167 million benefit from the 
reduction of the reserving levels permitted under new rules in 
the UK. Underlying earnings were up £84 million reflecting the 
cumulative benefits of the recent efficiency programmes of 
£65 million and lower new business strain. 
Loss before tax in our UK long-term insurance and savings 
business was £149 million in 2008, a decrease of £713 million 
from £564 million profit in 2007. This decrease mainly reflects 
the £550 million provision for credit defaults and £97 million for 
the cost of transferring the investment wrap platform to a third 
party supplier offset by the increase in adjusted operating profit 
explained above. 
General insurance and health 
The table below presents sales, net written premiums, adjusted 
operating profit and profit/(loss) before tax attributable to 
shareholders’ profits under IFRS from our UK general insurance 
and health business for the years ended 31 December 2009,

Year ended 31 December 2009 
UK general insurance and health net written premiums were 
£4,298 million, a decrease of £1,115 million, or 21%, on 2008 
(2008: 5,413 million). The decrease reflects a combination of 
the actions taken to exit unprofitable business and difficult 
market conditions, most notably in creditor due to lower levels 
of lending, and commercial due to more business failures, 
fewer start-ups and reduced levels of exposure. 
Adjusted operating profit in 2009 was £535 million, a 
decrease of £121 million, or 18% (2008: £656 million). The 
decrease in adjusted operating profit is a result of a decline 
in long-term investment returns, an increase in creditor claims 
resulting from the recession and a reduction in savings on prior 
year claims development to £105 million (2008: £285 million). 
Profit before tax was £434 million, an increase of £825 
million from a loss of £391 million in 2008. The increase 
predominately reflects the impact of investment variances 
of £397 million and an exceptional charge in 2008 of £279 
million relating to the discounted cost of strengthening our 
latent claims. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Net written premiums in our UK general insurance and health 
business decreased by £484 million, or 8%, to £5,413 million 
in 2008 (2007: £5,897 million). This decrease was across all 
personal and commercial lines with personal motor and creditor 
business showing the greatest fall against 2007. This reflected 
the increasingly competitive market and our strategy of writing 
business for profit rather than volume, as well as reflecting

distributor response to the issues with payment protection 
insurance and the decline in lending. 
Adjusted operating profit in 2008 was £656 million, an 
increase of £235 million on 2007 of £421 million. The principal 
factor in the improved profitability for the general insurance 
business was that weather related claims were in line with 
normal expectations compared with a £475 million adverse 
impact in 2007. This favourable impact was partly offset by a 
reduction in the benefit of prior year claims development to 
£285 million (2007: £430 million), the decline in net written 
premiums and a reduction in long-term investment returns to 
£585 million (2007: £656 million). These factors outweighed 
the earned benefits we have derived from our initiatives to 
deliver cost savings and control claims inflation. 
Loss before tax in our UK general insurance and health 
business was £391 million in 2008, a decrease of £533 million 
from a £142 million profit in 2007. This decrease reflected 
the impact of investment variances and £279 million for 
strengthening of latent claims provisions.

Year ended 31 December 2009 
Europe sales in 2009 were in line with the prior year at 
£21,750 million (2008: £21,806 million). A 6% increase in 
long-term insurance and savings sales to £18,704 million (2008: 
£17,716 million) offset a 26% decrease in general insurance 
and health net written premiums to £3,046 million (2008: 
£4,090 million). 
Net written premiums in 2009 increased by £1,730 million 
or 12% to £16,796 million (2008: £15,066 million). 
Adjusted operating profit in 2009 was £1,196 million, 
an increase of 5%, or £55 million, from £1,141 million. 
Europe’s profit before tax attributable to shareholders’ 
profits was £941 million in 2009, an increase of £893 million 
from £48 million in 2008. The increase is mainly attributable 
to favourable investment returns. 
As a result of the IPO, the strategic management of our 
investment in Delta Lloyd is now managed independently from 
our other operations. Accordingly, commentary on Europe’s 
performance is presented as two separate segments for 2009. 
Aviva Europe 
Aviva Europe reported an increase in long-term insurance and 
savings sales of £1,060 million, or 8%, to £14,375 million 
(2008: £13,315 million) largely due to the strengthening of 
the euro against sterling. Life and pension sales contributed 
£668 million to the increase in long-term insurance and savings 
sales with £392 million from investment sales. Both France and 
Italy reported increases in life and pension sales of 26% and 
55%, respectively, with all other markets reporting a decrease 
in sales. Poland sales were 41% down reflecting the impact of 
pension legislation changes and special promotions in 2008. 
General insurance and health sales increased by 4% to 
£1,883 million (2008: £1,812 million) primarily due to increased 
sales in France and other European markets, offset by an 8% 
fall in sales in Ireland. 
Net written premiums in long-term insurance and savings 
businesses were £10,572 million, an increase of £3,201 million, 
or 43% (2008: £7,371 million) driven by France and Italy. Sales 
in France have increased through AFER and Italy reported an 
increase in sales of profit sharing single premium products. 
Aviva Europe’s long-term insurance and savings business 
adjusted operating profit was £761 million, an increase of 
£76 million, or 11%, from £685 million in 2008, reflecting 
increased profits from existing business in France and Italy due 
to favourable experience in claims, lapses and surrenders. 
Aviva Europe’s adjusted operating profit of our general 
insurance and health businesses was £132 million in 2009, a 
decrease of £88 million, or 40%, over £220 million in 2008, 
primarily due to extreme weather in Ireland and France during 
the year. 
Delta Lloyd 
Delta Lloyd reported long-term and savings sales of 
£4,329 million, a decrease of £72 million, or 2%, on 2008 
(2008: £4,401 million). Life and pension sales decreased by 
11% to £3,665 million with investment sales reported at 
£664 million, an increase of 118% on 2008. 
General insurance and health sales were £1,163 million 
(2008: £2,278 million), a decrease of £1,115 million, or 49%, 
as a result of the sale of their health business on 1 January 
2009. Adjusting for the impact of the sale, Delta Lloyd general 
insurance sales were 13% higher on 2008 (2008: £1,028 
million) benefiting from the strengthening of the euro and the 
inclusion of a full year’s contribution from Swiss Life Belgium. 
Delta Lloyd reported net written premiums of £4,341 
million, a decrease of £1,542 million, or 26%, on 2008 (2008: 
£5,883 million) primarily due to lower group pension contracts 
and the sale of the health business. 
Adjusted operating profit was £399 million, an increase 
of £89 million on £310 million in 2008. Improved profits in 
the long-term and savings business resulted from lower new 
business strain, driven by a decrease in corporate pension 
sales, expense savings, and strengthening of the euro. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Total Europe sales in 2008 increased by £1,356 million or 6% to 
£21,806 million (2007: £20,488 million), with increases in both 
long-term insurance and savings business and general insurance 
largely due to the strength of the euro against sterling. 
Long-term insurance and savings business in 2008 
increased by £498 million or 3% to £17,716 million (2007: 
£17,256 million). Within this, life and pensions sales increased 
to £16,952 million from £15,684 million in 2007 as a result of 
significant sales of the individual regular premium product 
launched in late 2007 and short-term endowment policies sold 
through Deutsche Bank in Poland. 
Delta Lloyd’s increased sales were due to a significant 
increase in corporate pension sales with five contracts 
contributing a total of £1,106 million, which was partly offset 
by lower annuity sales as a result of increased competition 
from the banking sector. Sales in Other Europe increased due 
to a one-off payment of £545 million in Romania from the 
introduction of compulsory pensions. These improvements were 
offset by decreased sales in Italy and Ireland predominantly as 
a result of the worsening economic environment. 
Investment sales in Europe in 2008 decreased by 
£808 million or 51% to £764 million (2007: £1,572 million) 
due to reduced sales across all countries as a result of the 
volatile investment markets. 
Europe’s general insurance and health net written 
premiums were £4,090 million in 2008, an increase of 
£858 million, or 27%, from £3,232 million in 2007. The 
increase in the sales result was driven by the strengthening of 
the euro, as well as competitively priced health products sold 
through our Dutch business and strong sales in Italy through our

new bancassurance agreement with Banco Popolare. The Dutch 
health business, which contributed sales of £1,250 million, 
was sold with effect from 1 January 2009. 
Net written premiums in 2008 increased by £1,935 million 
or 15% to £15,066 million (2007: £13,131 million). 
Net written premiums in our long-term insurance and 
savings businesses were £10,976 million in 2008, an increase of 
£1,077 million, or 11%, from £9,899 million in 2007. This 
increase resulted from new product launches in Poland, securing 
five corporate schemes in the Netherlands and the introduction 
of compulsory pensions in Romania. 
General insurance and health net written premiums were 
£4,090 million in 2008, an increase of £858 million, or 27%, 
from £3,232 million in 2007 as explained above. 
Europe adjusted operating profit in 2008 was £1,141 
million, a decrease of 5% or £56 million from £1,197 million. 
Europe’s long-term insurance and savings business adjusted 
operating profit was £881 million, an increase of £104 million, 
or 13%, from £777 million in 2007. This result is partially 
attributable to the strengthening of the euro, which has had 
a positive impact on all our major markets. The main countries 
contributing to the increase were Poland, reflecting higher 
management fees and cost efficiencies and Spain, which earned 
higher profits on protection business following growth in the 
underlying portfolio from the acquisition of Cajamurcia in the 
fourth quarter of 2007. 
In Europe, adjusted operating profit of our general 
insurance and health businesses was £397 million in 2008, a 
decrease of £45 million, or 10%, over £442 million in 2007, 
due to increased price competition across a number of 
countries, particularly in Ireland and the Netherlands. This was 
partly offset by the development of new distribution channels, 
product launches in the year across a number of our businesses 
and the strengthening of the euro. 
Europe’s profit before tax attributable to shareholders’ 
profits was £48 million in 2008, a decrease of £1,274 million, 
or 96%, from £1,322 million in 2007. The decrease was mainly 
due to adverse investment returns and the cost of the unit-
linked compensation in the Netherlands of £126 million.

Aviva North America includes the long-term insurance and 
savings business in the US, which provides life insurance and 
annuity products, and the general insurance business in Canada.

Year ended 31 December 2009 
Sales in Aviva North America were £6,345 million, a decrease 
of £971 million, or 13%, (2008: 7,316 million). The decrease 
is driven by a decrease in annuity sales resulting from 
management action to focus on capital efficiency and the 
decision not to participate in funding agreement business in 
2009. Protection product sales increased by 40% on actions 
to create innovative products and expand product distribution. 
General insurance sales in Canada increased by £199 million, 
or 12%, to £1,800 million (2008: £1,601 million), with growth 
driven by increased sales in homeowner while personal auto 
premiums were maintained at a similar level to 2008. 
Aviva North America’s net written premiums decreased by 
£92 million, or 1%, to £6,176 million (2008: £6,268 million). 
The decrease is a result of lower long-term insurance and 
savings sales in the US offset by improved sales in Canada as 
stated above. 
Adjusted operating profit was £213 million, an increase of 
£64 million, or 43%, on 2008 (2008: £149 million). Long-term 
insurance and savings adjusted operating profit increased to 
£85 million (2008: £16 million) driven by improved investment 
margin earned on existing equity indexed annuity business. 
General insurance adjusted operating profit is in line with 2008 
at £144 million (2008: £145 million) with the benefits of 
increased sales volumes, higher long-term investment return, 
cost savings and foreign exchange movements being offset 
by the adverse movement in the claims experience.
 Aviva North America’s profit before tax attributable to 
shareholders’ profits was £244 million, an increase of £582 
million (2008: £338 million loss). The increase is mainly as a 
result of favourable investment performance during the year. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Sales in Aviva North America in 2008 increased by 
£2,258 million or 45% to £7,316 million (2007: £5,058 million). 
This increase reflected higher US long-term insurance and 
savings business sales, driven by improved annuity sales, 
reflecting our expanded distribution, new product launches and 
successful marketing programmes. General insurance sales in 
Canada increased by 13% to £1,601 million, with growth 
across all lines and sales through the acquisition of National 
Home Warranty in July 2008. 
Aviva North America’s net written premiums were 
£6,268 million in 2008, an increase of £1,842 million, or 42%, 
from £4,426 million in 2007. The increase was mainly due to 
increased annuity sales in the US and improved sales across 
all lines of business in Canada. 
Adjusted operating profit in Aviva North America was 
£149 million in 2008, a decrease of £80 million, or 35%, from 
£229 million in 2007. This is driven by lower annuity margins 
and lower yield on variable rate investments. Annuity margins 
were adversely impacted by increased option costs and lower 
account value, driven by underperformance of the equity 
markets and higher lapse rates. In our Canadian general 
insurance business the result was impacted by favourable prior 
year development, which was offset by difficult market 
conditions in the insurance cycle, weather related costs, higher 
expenses and lower investment income as a result of the sale 
of equities undertaken in the latter half of 2007. 
Aviva North America’s loss before tax attributable to 
shareholders’ profits was £338 million in 2008, an increase 
in loss of £300 million, from £38 million loss in 2007. The 
increased loss was mainly due to significantly lower investment 
income and the recognition of impairment losses, both driven 
by the downturn in the economic environment.

Sales in Asia Pacific decreased by £787 million, or 22%, 
to £2,712 million (2008: £3,499 million). In Australia, sales 
decreased by 34%, impacted by the sale of the Australian 
business on 1 October 2009. Sales in Asia decreased 11% as 
a result of the uncertain economic environment, leading to 
investor caution across Singapore, Hong Kong, India and our 
other Asian markets, together with the impact of the strategic 
decision to scale back the sale of capital intensive products in 
several Asian markets. 
Net written premiums decreased to £455 million, a 
decrease of £56 million, or 11%, on 2008 (2008: £511 million). 
The decrease was mainly due to the impact of the uncertain 
economic environment in the region as highlighted above and 
the disposal of the Australian business. 
Increase in adjusted operating profit of £41 million to 
£77 million (2008: £36 million) was mainly due to the benefit 
from a one-off release of reserves of £68 million following an 
actuarial review of assumptions in Singapore, partly offset by 
the impact of the Australian disposal. 
Profit before tax of £146 million (2008: £68 million loss) 
reflects the favourable movements in the market across the 
Asia Pacific region. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Sales in Aviva Asia Pacific were £3,499 million in 2008, a 
decrease of £784 million, or 18%, from £4,283 million in 2007. 
The decrease was driven by significantly lower investment 
sales through Navigator (our wrap administration platform) of 
£1,746 million, which were £914 million lower than sales of 
£2,660 million in 2007. The lower investment sales were 
partially offset by higher long-term insurance and savings 
business sales of £1,720 million compared to £1,595 million 
in 2007. 
Overall sales in Asia declined in 2008 as a result of volatile 
investment markets, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore. 
This was partly offset by growth in long-term insurance and 
savings business sales in China, due to the expansion of the 
distribution network, and first time contributions from new 
ventures in South Korea and Taiwan. 
Sales in Australia also decreased largely due to the benefit 
in 2007 of a one-off transfer of a group pension scheme and 
the favourable change in superannuation legislation, which 
impacted both long-term insurance and savings sales and 
investment sales. 
Aviva Asia Pacific’s net written premiums were £511 million 
in 2008, a decrease of £91 million, or 15%, from £602 million 
in 2007. The decrease was mainly due to the volatile investment 
markets impacting sales in Hong Kong, where the products are 
mainly investment-related. 
Adjusted operating profit was £36 million in 2008, 
a decrease of £1 million, or 3%, from £37 million in 2007. 
This reflects increased regional costs including one-off costs 
associated with recruitment, offset by an increase in the long-
term insurance and savings business due to lower new business 
strain from sales and business mix. 
Aviva Asia Pacific’s loss before tax attributable to 
shareholders’ profit was £68 million in 2008, compared to a 
profit of £35 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 reflects the 
impact of adverse economic variances mainly in the long-term 
insurance and savings businesses.

Aviva Investors’ adjusted operating profit in 2009 was

the year. 
Profit before tax attributable to shareholders’ profits was 
£91 million, an increase of £19 million, or 25%, on 2008 (2008: 
£72 million). Profit in 2009 benefited from lower integration 
and restructuring costs on the set-up of Aviva Investors. 
Aviva Investor’s funds under management were 
£250 billion, an increase of £14 billion, or 6%, on 2008. The 
increase is a result of investment performance and product 
sales together with capital appreciation in some fixed income 
markets, offset by the impact of sterling’s appreciation against 
the euro and US dollar. 
Year ended 31 December 2008 
Aviva Investors’ adjusted operating profit was £114 million in 
2008, a decrease of £33 million, or 22%, from £147 million in 
2007. The decrease was mainly due to the investment market 
volatility in the year, with all geographical areas experiencing 
downward pressure on fee income. 
Aviva Investor’s profit before tax attributable to 
shareholders’ profits was £72 million in 2008, a decrease of 
£57 million, or 44%, from £129 million in 2007. The decrease

Aviva plc Financial and operating performance continued

was mainly due to the decline in investment markets and the 
integration and restructuring costs of setting up Aviva Investors. 
Aviva Investors’ funds under management were £236 billion in 
2008, an increase of £1 billion, or less than 1%, from 
£235 billion in 2007. The increase was mainly due to exchange 
gains as sterling declined against other major currencies towards 
the end of the year, increasing the value of our non-sterling 
investments, offset by market factors where the fall in equity 
and property capital values and outflows from some open-
ended property funds.

Year ended 31 December 2009 
Corporate centre costs were £108 million, a decrease of 
£33 million, or 23%, on £141 million in 2008. The decrease 
reflects lower central spend. Staff incentive costs were in line 
with 2008 and projects spending decreased by £23 million 
reflecting lower costs following the completion of the brand 
migration, financial controls and MCEV projects initiated 
in 2008. 
The group debt costs and other interest increased to 
£636 million, an increase of £257 million on 2008 of £379 
million. External interest costs increased to £335 million (2008: 
£286 million) reflecting higher interest on subordinated debt, 
due to hybrid debt being issued in 2008 and 2009, which was 
offset by lower commercial paper interest as proceeds from 
the issue were used to repay some commercial paper. Internal 
interest costs increased to £227 million (2008: £197 million) 
driven by changes to our internal loan balances. 
The net pension charge of £74 million (2008: £104 million 
income) represents the difference between the expected return 
on pension scheme assets and the interest charged on pension 
scheme liabilities. The increase is primarily due to lower rates 
of return on asset values offset by higher discount rates 
on liabilities.

Year ended 31 December 2008 
The corporate centre costs for 2008 decreased to £141 million 
(2007: £157 million) due to lower central spend and staff 
incentive costs. Within this total are project spend costs 
totalling £34 million (2007: £26 million). The increase in 
project spend was driven by the corporate centre’s share of 
the ongoing implementation of the global finance strategy. 
The decrease in corporate centre spend is partly explained 
by increased costs being borne by the operating segments, 
as certain corporate centre activities and costs have either 
been transferred or recharged to regional offices. 
In 2008 group debt costs and other interest totalled 
£379 million (2007: £363 million). External interest costs 
increased to £286 million (2007: £259 million) reflecting higher 
interest in subordinated debt, due to our hybrid debt issues in 
May and August 2008, offset by lower commercial paper 
interest as proceeds from the issue were used to repay some 
commercial paper. Internal interest costs increased to 
£197 million (2007: £179 million) driven by changes to our 
internal loan balances. Net pension income increased to 
£104 million (2007: £75 million) reflecting higher expected rates 
of return on assets offset by higher discount rates on liabilities.

Analysis of investments 
We invest our policyholders’ funds and our own funds in order 
to generate a return for both policyholders and shareholders. 
The financial strength of our group and both our current 
and future operating results and financial performance are, 
therefore, in part dependent on the quality and performance 
of our investment portfolios in our UK, continental European, 
North America and Asia Pacific operations. 
For additional information on our financial investments, 
please see “Financial statements IFRS – Note 24 – Financial 
investments”. For a quantitative analysis of funds under 
management by Aviva and third-party fund managers, 
see ‘Financial statements IFRS – Note 58 – Assets under 
management’. 
Investment strategy 
Our investment portfolio supports a range of businesses 
operating in a number of geographical locations. Our aim is 
to match the investments held to support a line of business 
to the nature of the underlying liabilities, while at the same 
time considering local regulatory requirements, the level of 
risk inherent within different investments, and the desire to 
generate superior investment returns, where compatible with 
this stated strategy and risk appetite. 
Long-term insurance and savings business 
As stated above, we aim to optimise investment returns while 
ensuring that sufficient assets are held to meet future liabilities 
and regulatory requirements. As different types of life insurance 
business vary in their cash flows and in the expectations placed 
upon them by policyholders, we need to hold different types of 
investment to meet these different cash flows and expectations. 
The UK with-profits business is comprised largely of long-
term contracts with some guaranteed payments. We are 
therefore able to invest a significant proportion of the funds 
supporting this business in equities and real estate. This is 
because the long-term nature of these contracts allows us to 
take advantage of the long-term growth potential within these 
classes of assets, while the level of guaranteed payments is 
managed to mitigate the level of risk that we bear in relation 
to the volatility of these classes of assets. 
Annuities and non-participating contracts, on the other 
hand, have a high level of guaranteed future payments. We 
endeavour to match the investments held against these types 
of business to future cash flows. We therefore have a policy of 
generally holding fixed income securities and mortgage loans 
with appropriate maturity dates. 
With unit-linked business, the primary objective is to 
maximise investment returns, subject to following an investment 
policy consistent with the representations that we have made 
to our unit-linked product policyholders. 
General insurance and health business 
The general insurance and health business is comprised of 
shorter-term liabilities than the long-term insurance business. 
Furthermore, all the risk attaching to the investments is borne 
by our shareholders. As a result, the investment portfolio held 
to cover general insurance liabilities contains a higher 
proportion of fixed-income securities than the portfolio held 
to cover life insurance liabilities. 
Property partnerships 
As part of their investment strategy, the UK and certain 
European policyholder funds have invested in a number of 
property limited partnerships (PLPs), either directly or via 
property unit trusts (PUTs), through a mix of capital and loans. 
The nature of our involvement in property partnerships is set out 
in the second and third paragraphs of the Investment vehicles 
section of “Financial Statements IFRS – Accounting policies – (C) 
Consolidation principles”. Property partnerships are accounted 
for as subsidiaries, joint ventures or financial investments 
depending on our participation and the terms of each 
partnership agreement. For each property partnership 
accounted for as a subsidiary, joint venture or financial 
investment, we are exposed to falls in the value of the 
underlying properties which are reflected as unrealised 
gains/losses on investment properties, our share of joint venture 
results and unrealised gains/losses on financial investments, 
respectively. However, these are all in policyholder funds (rather 
than shareholder funds) so such losses are offset by changes in 
the amounts due to policyholders or unitholders, or in the 
Unallocated Divisible Surplus (UDS).

Analysis of financial investments 
We distinguish between policyholder, participating fund and shareholder investments, which are terms used to reflect the differing 
exposure to investment gains and losses. Policyholder assets are connected to our unit-linked business, where the policyholder 
bears the investment risk on the assets in the unit-linked funds. Our exposure to loss on policyholder assets is limited to the extent 
that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the funds. Participating fund assets related 
to some of our insurance and investment contracts which contain a discretionary participating feature, which is a contractual right 
to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. Our exposure to investment losses on participating funds is 
generally limited to our participation in the fund. Shareholder assets are other assets held within our long-term businesses that are 
not backing unit-linked liabilities or participating funds. Investments held at 31 December 2009, 31 December 2008 and 
31 December 2007 are analysed below:

As the table indicates, 34% of total investments can be directly attributed to shareholders. The apportionment of our shareholder 
assets is predominantly weighted towards debt securities and loans. In comparison, policyholder and participating funds contain a 
greater proportion of investment property, equities, and other investments (eg, unit trusts), reflecting the underlying investment 
mandates. 
Financial investment balances included in the remainder of this disclosure include financial investments of operations classified 
as held for sale. 
Measurement basis 
We carry investments on our statement of financial position at either fair value or amortised cost. As shown in the table below, 
at 31 December 2009, 93% of the group’s total investments were carried at fair value on the statement of financial position.

well as the cost, unrealised gains and losses, impairments, fair value and other information concerning financial investments, see 
the “Financial Statements IFRS – Note 24 – Financial investments”. 
Debt securities 
We grade debt securities according to current external credit ratings issued. The credit rating used for each individual security is the 
second highest of the available ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. If a credit rating is available from only one of 
these three rating agencies then this rating is used. If an individual security has not been given a credit rating by any of these three 
rating agencies, the security is classified as “non-rated”. 
For the tables below we have used the standard Standard & Poor’s rating classifications. Investment grade debt securities are 
classified within the range of AAA (extremely strong) to BBB (good) ratings, with AAA being the highest possible rating. Debt 
securities which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade. Where we use a rating provided by Moody’s or Fitch, we 
have expressed it as the Standard & Poor’s equivalent rating. For example, we consider Standard & Poor’s rating of AA (very strong) 
to be equivalent to Moody’s rating of AA (excellent) and Fitch’s rating of AA (very strong).

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Despite the increase in market downgrade activity during 2008 and 2009, debt securities with a credit rating of A or above at 
31 December 2009 still represented 81.6% of total holdings (2008: 86.3%). Approximately 43% of total debt security holdings 
were in government bonds and 34% of total debt security holdings were in corporate bonds with a credit rating of A or above, 
as of 31 December 2009. 
“Wrapped credit” is credit exposure that has been insured with monoline insurers to achieve a better credit rating. The 
monoline insurers suffered downgrades during 2008 and 2009 and this is reflected in the analysis that follows. The exposure is 
diversified across several monolines and the underlying bonds are diversified across many different counterparties. In general, we 
are a long-term holder of this debt, although we continue to review our holdings with reference to the underlying quality and 
prospects. 
The majority of the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are US investments and over 65% of the total exposure is 
backed by the US Government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Under the conservatorship arrangements 
with the US Government implemented in September 2008, these securities have an implicit guarantee, although they are not 
expressly backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. The majority of the remaining US RMBS are backed by 
fixed-rate loans that originated in 2005 or before. 
At 31 December 2009, our exposure to sub-prime debt securities was limited to £2 million (2008: £39 million), and our 
exposure to collaterised debt obligations (CDO) and collaterised loan obligations (CLO) was limited to £176 million. Investments 
in structured assets (excluding agency RMBS that are backed by GSEs) were £7,341 million, representing less than 5% of total 
debt securities. 
The vast majority of the corporate bonds that are not rated represent private placements and corporate bond investments 
made via unit trusts, where a “look-through” to the underlying securities has been performed. The private placements are US 
investments which are not rated by the major rating agencies but are rated an average equivalent of A- by the Securities Valuation 
Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a US association of state insurance regulators. 
Excluding the private placements that are rated an average A– by the NAIC, the exposure that is not rated by a major rating 
agency is less than 3% of total debt securities. 
Of the debt securities rated less than BBB, 77% are rated BB, while only 5%, amounting to £181 million, are rated below B.

At 31 December 2009, shareholder investment in equity securities amounted to £5,027 million, of which 77% related to our 
business in the Netherlands, 17% our Italian business and 6% other businesses. The Italian equity holdings are held both directly 
by our Italian subsidiaries and by group holding companies. 
Of our £7,289 million exposure to equity investments in banks, trusts and insurance companies, £1,745 million relates to 
shareholder investments, which includes £766 million equities held by our business in the Netherlands and a strategic holding in 
UniCredit and other Italian banks of £927 million (£757 million net of minority interest share). 
The remaining shareholder exposure to equity securities, other than banks, trusts and insurance companies, arises principally 
in our Netherlands business, amounting to 95% of the total exposure of £3,282 million.

Our global headquarters are located in St. Helen’s, 1 Undershaft, London, England. We also have the following 
regional headquarters: 
— UK – UK Life: York, England 
— UK – UK General Insurance: Norwich, England 
— Europe – London, England 
— North America – Chicago, Illinois, USA 
— Asia Pacific – Singapore

In addition to the above, our regions have major offices in the following locations: 
— North America: Des Moines, Iowa, USA and Scarborough, Ontario, Canada 
— Europe: Paris, France; Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Dublin, Ireland; Madrid, Spain; and Milan, Italy 
We own or lease space in 27 countries around the world. As of 31 December 2009, we owned and occupied land and buildings 
for our own use with a total book value of £416 million (2008: £568 million). We believe that these facilities are adequate for our 
present needs in all material respects. We also hold other properties, both directly and indirectly, for investment purposes, valued 
at £10,756 million at 31 December 2009. 
Risk management 
As a global company we face a diverse range of risks, each of which has the potential to impact financial performance or hinder 
the achievement of business objectives. If we do not manage these risks effectively we could also miss potential opportunities to 
further develop and expand our business. 
At Aviva, sound risk management is a key component of our business and is an integral part of maintaining financial stability 
for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. We group the type of risks we face into three categories: financial, 
strategic, and operational. 
— Financial risks cover market and credit risk, insurance risk, liquidity and capital management.

Performance review
Aviva plc Risk management continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
— Strategic risks include issues such as customer, brand, 
products and markets as well as any risks to our business 
model arising from changes in our market and risks arising 
from mergers and acquisitions. 
— Operational risks arise from inadequate or failed internal 
processes, or from people and systems or from external 
events. This includes business protection, information 
technology, people, legal and regulatory compliance risks. 
We operate within a three lines of defence model. Primary 
responsibility for risk identification and management lies with 
business management (the 1st line of defence). Support for and 
challenge on the completeness and accuracy of risk assessment, 
risk reporting and adequacy of mitigation plans are performed 
by specialist risk functions (the 2nd line of defence). 
Independent and objective assurance on the robustness of the 
risk management framework and the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of internal control is provided by group internal 
audit (the 3rd line of defence). 
We employ effective processes to identify, assess, mitigate, 
manage and monitor the risks to which we are exposed. We 
make appropriate decisions to limit and control the impact the 
risks may have on our strategic objectives. 
We set limits to manage our material risks to ensure we 
stay within our risk appetite (the amount of risk we are willing 
to accept). To work out how “material” a risk is to our business 
we assess its size and scale based on how likely it is to occur and 
what potential impact it would have on our business and our 
stakeholders if it were to occur. Most importantly, when risks 
are outside of appetite, we agree what actions need to be taken 
to manage the risks. 
What risk management activity happens in Aviva? 
To ensure that risks are effectively identified and assessed and 
that appropriate controls and responses are in place, our risk 
management activity needs to operate through clearly defined 
and agreed structures and processes. 
At Aviva, we support and coordinate all group-wide risk 
management activities through a central risk team, led by the 
group chief risk officer. In each of our regions, regional chief 
risk officers ensure that the regional risk profiles remain within 
the limits set centrally. 
The regional chief risk officers work with business 
management to ensure that our risk management framework is 
being used consistently across all our businesses. They also work 
with the group chief risk officer to coordinate and communicate 
decisions that are taken at a group level. 
As well as working with the regions, the central risk team is 
also responsible for managing group risk governance and oversight. 
Risk management framework 
At group centre, the Risk Management Framework enables us 
to understand all the material risks that we currently face and 
to identify early emerging risks. This knowledge helps the risk 
teams to provide effective challenge and support to the regions 
and its businesses. 
The central risk team monitors these risk exposures on a 
regular basis with a specific focus on financial risks via regular 
reporting to the Group Executive Committee and, as part of the 
performance management process, senior management review 
risk management information to ensure the successful delivery 
of our business objectives. 
As well as the ongoing monitoring activities the central risk 
team produces a formal quarterly risk report for the Risk and 
Regulatory Committee of the board and the various risk 
oversight committees.

Corporate governance and oversight 
Our Risk Governance Framework allocates responsibility for the 
oversight of risk management to a number of committees at 
group centre with the Group Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) 
and the Group Operational Risk Committee (ORC) providing 
a key focus on financial and operational risk. The group centre 
committees are in turn supported by similar governance 
structures in the regions. These relationships are summarised 
in the diagram below.

These committees monitor the aggregate risk profile, provide

ensure that our ris0k policies are used to manage risk to 
agreed standards. 
Board oversight is maintained on a regular basis through 
its Risk and Regulatory Committee (RRC). The group chief risk 
officer is a member of the Group Executive Committee and has 
a reporting line to the group chief executive and to the RRC 
with access to the RRC chairman, assuring independence of 
the function. 
Policies and procedures 
We have formal risk policies that ensure a consistent approach 
to the management of all our risks across all the businesses and 
locations in which we operate. These risk policies define our risk 
appetite and set out risk management and control standards for 
the group’s worldwide operations. The risk policies also set out 
the roles and responsibilities of businesses, regions, policy 
owners, and the risk oversight committees. 
As our business needs to change and respond to market 
conditions and customer needs, we regularly monitor the 
appropriateness of our risk policies and risk appetite to ensure 
they remain up-to-date. This helps to provide assurance to the 
various risk oversight committees that there are appropriate 
controls in place for all our core business activities, and that 
the processes for managing risk are understood and followed 
consistently across our global businesses. 
Risk and economic capital 
We already use economic capital models within our decision-
making and were early adopters of stress and scenario analysis 
across the risks we face, making us well placed for the 
forthcoming Solvency 2 regulatory regime. However, the use 
of models is balanced with sound business judgement. 
The Financial Services Authority (FSA) requires Aviva 
to assess its economic capital requirements to ensure that 
it adequately reflects business and control risks. In turn 
this analysis supports our strategic planning and decision-
making processes.

This table sets out the definitions of each key risk type; the 
key risk drivers for each category; sensitivities to economic 
and operating experience on the group’s performance; and a 
summary of the related risk mitigation processes that operate 
within the Risk Management Framework. 
Risk type Key drivers 
Market 
Risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values 
or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations 
in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency 
exchange rates 
— Fluctuation in the value of our investments in loans, debt and equity securities 
as well as our holdings of investment properties 
— Impact of market conditions on sales of investment products and our fund 
management business 
— Products sold by the group that carry investment return and surrender 
value guarantees 
— Premium income, dividends from overseas businesses and transactions from 
currencies other than sterling 
— Assets held in the staff pension scheme 
— Exposures to debt investments, structured asset investments, and 
Credit 
counterparties in our derivatives, mortgage loans and reinsurance placements 
Risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third 
— Default and spread risks are considered, as both impact the value and risks 
parties to meet their payment obligations of assets 
— Concentrations of exposures to individual credits/counterparties or 
sectors/geographies 
— Insufficient capital generated from the receipt of premiums, fees and 
Liquidity 
investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities to pay 
Risk of not maintaining sufficient financial resources to meet 
claims and expenses 
our business obligations as they fall due — Instances where additional cash requirements arise in excess of that available 
within operating businesses 
— Mismatches in the timing of cash flows relating to assets, liabilities and off 
balance sheet instruments 
General insurance 
The inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence, amount and 
timing of insurance liabilities. This includes fluctuations in the 
timing, frequency, and severity of claims and settlements, 
inadequate reinsurance protection and inadequate reserves. 
— Our largest general insurance risk is claims incurred from catastrophic events, 
such as flooding and windstorm 
— Financial impact of worsening claims ratios and inadequate reserves 
— Reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect the 
group against losses 
— Inappropriate risk selection and related pricing 
Life insurance 
The inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence, amount and 
timing of insurance liabilities. This includes exposure to 
mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than 
anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency 
levels and management and administrative expenses 
— Adverse longevity experience (the risk that people will live longer than we 
have assumed) 
— Adverse mortality experience (the death of a policy holder) and morbidity 
(ill health) 
— Expense experience compared with assumptions at the start of the 
insurance policy 
— Poorly designed or inadequately priced products 
— Persistency risk arising from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has 
been assumed 
— Focus on our strategy of delivering ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’
Strategic 
— Our strategic response to changes in external environment including 
Risks to our business model arising from changes in external 
competitive landscape, customer behaviour, distributor regulatory changes, 
events, our markets and customer behaviour as well as risks merger and acquisition opportunities and emerging trends 
arising from mergers and acquisitions 
— We are vulnerable to press speculation, negative publicity, adverse market 
Brand and reputation 
and customer perception
Our dependence on the strength of our brands, the brands 
— Products or services recommended by us do not perform as expected 
of our partners, and our reputation with customers and — We operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence 
distributors in the sale of our products and services are paramount 
— Processing large number of complex transactions across numerous
Operational 
and diverse products
The risks of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequately 
— We are highly dependent on the proper functioning of information 
or failed internal processes, or from people and systems, or technology and communication systems to serve our customers 
from external events — We are partially reliant on the operational processing performance of our 
outsourced partners including certain servicing and IT functions

1. Amounts shown in respect of long-term insurance contracts represent estimated undiscounted cash flows for the Group’s life assurance contracts. In determining the projected payments, 
account has been taken of the contract features, in particular that the amount and timing of the contractual payments reflect either surrender, death or contract maturity. In addition, the 
undiscounted amounts shown include the expected payments based on assumed future investment returns on assets backing insurance and investment contract liabilities. The projected cash 
flows exclude the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds (see below). 
2. All linked contracts and almost all non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand. For such contracts the earliest contractual maturity is therefore at the current 
statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability. Although we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities 
to occur over many years, the total liability for non-linked investment contracts is shown in the Within 1 year column above. 
3. Amounts shown in respect of general insurance contracts are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, including for those classes of business for which discounted provisions 
are held, see “Financial Statements IFRS – Note 38 – Insurance liabilities”. The timing of cash flows reflects a best estimate of when claims will be settled. 
4. The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment. 
5. Includes obligations under stock lending and repurchase agreements. 
6. When subordinated debt is undated or loan notes perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years. Annual interest payments for these borrowings are £75 million. 
Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated using fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable. 
7. The unallocated surplus represents the excess of assets over liabilities, including policyholder ‘‘asset share’’ liabilities, which reflect the amount payable under the realistic Peak 2 reporting regime 
of the FSA. Although accounted for as a liability, as permitted by IFRS 4, there is currently no expected payment date for the unallocated surplus. 
8. Provisions include pension obligations, which have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above, due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future cash flows. The Group 
operates both funded defined benefit and funded defined contribution pension schemes around the world, full details of which are provided in “Financial Statements IFRS – Note 47 – Pension 
obligations”. We have a contractual obligation to fund these schemes. However, the amount and timing of the Group’s cash contributions to these schemes is uncertain and will be affected by 
factors such as future investment returns and demographic changes. Our cash funding of defined contribution schemes is based on percentages of salary. Our cash contribution to defined 
benefit schemes is agreed in advance with scheme trustees for the short term, typically a period of up to five years. However, these contributions are revisited annually in light of changes in 
expectations of investment returns and other assumptions. The scheme liabilities have an average duration of 22 years in the UK schemes and between 12 and 18 years in the non-UK schemes.

Capital management 
Capital management objectives 
Aviva’s capital management philosophy is focused on capital 
efficiency and effective risk management to support the 
dividend policy and earnings per share growth. Overall capital 
risk appetite is set and managed with reference to the 
requirements of a range of different stakeholders including 
shareholders, policyholders, regulators and rating agencies. 
In managing capital we seek to: 
— maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to 
support new business growth and satisfy the requirements 
of our regulators and other stakeholders thus giving both 
our customers and shareholders assurance of our financial 
strength: 
— optimise our overall debt to equity structure to enhance our 
returns to shareholders, subject to our capital risk appetite 
and balancing the requirements of the range of stakeholders; 
— retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, 
including significant unutilised committed credit facilities and 
access to a range of capital markets; 
— allocate capital rigorously across the group, to drive value 
adding growth in accordance with risk appetite; and 
— declare dividends on a basis judged prudent, while retaining 
capital to support future business growth, using dividend 
cover on an IFRS operating earnings after tax basis in the 
1.5 to 2.0 times range as a guide. 
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, 
ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in 
managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the 
requirements of our various stakeholders. 
Strategic capital allocation initiatives 
A number of key strategic initiatives have been delivered in the 
last quarter of 2009 which have significantly enhanced the 
Group’s capital position and financial flexibility. 
On 1 October 2009 Aviva announced the completion of 
the sale of its Australian life business and wealth management 
platform. The total proceeds of the Australian sale were 
£0.4 billion (A$0.9 billion). The sale of the business benefited 
group IGD by £0.4 billion. 
On 3 November 2009 Aviva announced the completion 
of the Delta Lloyd initial public offering (IPO) and the shares 
commenced trading on the Euronext Amsterdam. The IPO 
raised gross proceeds of £1.00 billion (€1.09 billion), including 
the 10% over-allotment option, and generated an IGD benefit 
of £0.5 billion. 
Following High Court and FSA approval in September, the 
deal to complete the reattribution of our inherited estate was 
concluded on 1 October with 87% of policyholders voting and 
96% of these voting in favour of the offer. The total value of 
the inherited estate for the reattribution was £1.25 billion, with 
£0.5 billion paid from shareholder funds to policyholders. The 
impact of the policyholder incentive payment reduced Group 
IGD by £0.5 billion.

1. The “corporate” net liabilities represent the element of the pension scheme deficit 
held centrally. 
2. In addition to our external funding sources, we have certain internal borrowing arrangements 
in place which allow some of the assets that support technical liabilities to be invested in a 
pool of central assets for use across the group. These internal debt balances allow for the 
capital allocated to business operations to exceed the externally sourced capital resources of 
the group. Net internal debt represents the balance of the amounts due from corporate and 
holding entities, less the tangible net assets held by these entities. Although intra-group in 
nature, they are included as part of the capital base for the purpose of capital management. 
These arrangements arise in relation to the following: 
– Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy stand alone capital and liquidity 
requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities. These loans satisfy arm’s length 
criteria and all interest payments are made when due. 
– Aviva International Insurance (AII) Ltd acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary 
holding company for our foreign subsidiaries. Internal capital management mechanisms in 
place allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance 
operations. These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets backing technical liabilities 
to be made available for use across the group. Balances in respect of these arrangements 
are also treated as internal debt for capital management purposes. 
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity 
shareholders’ funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and 
borrowings (including internal borrowings as described in 
footnote 2 above). 
At 31 December 2009 we had £25.2 billion (31 December 
2008: £25.1 billion) of total capital employed in our trading 
operations, measured on an MCEV basis. Over the period the 
benefit of operating profits and investment gains have been 
offset by foreign exchange losses and actuarial losses on staff 
pension schemes. 
In April 2009 we issued a private placement of £245 million 
equivalent of Lower Tier 2 hybrid in a dual tranche transaction 
(£200 million on 1 April 2009 and a further €50 million on 
30 April 2009). These transactions had a positive impact on 
group IGD solvency and economic capital measures. 
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and 
subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves, was 31.8% 
(31 December 2008: 34.0%). Fixed charge cover, which 
measures the extent to which external interest costs, including 
subordinated debt interest and preference dividends, are 
covered by MCEV operating profit was 8.5 times (31 December 
2008: 9.2 times). 
Financial flexibility 
The group’s borrowings are comprised primarily of long dated 
hybrid instruments with maturities spread over many years, 
minimising refinancing risk. In addition to central liquid asset 
holdings of £2.2 billion, the group also has access to unutilised 
committed credit facilities of £2.1 billion provided by a range of 
leading international banks.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Regulatory bases 
Individual regulated subsidiaries measure and report solvency 
based on applicable local regulations, including in the UK the 
regulations established by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). 
These measures are also consolidated under the European 
Insurance Groups Directive (IGD) to calculate regulatory capital 
adequacy at an aggregate group level, where we have a 
regulatory obligation to have a positive position at all times. 
This measure represents the excess of the aggregate value of 
regulatory capital employed in our business over the aggregate 
minimum solvency requirements imposed by local regulators, 
excluding the surplus held in the UK and Ireland with-profit life 
funds. The minimum solvency requirement for our European 
businesses is based on the Solvency 1 Directive. In broad terms, 
for EU operations, this is set at 4% and 1% of non-linked 
and unit-linked life reserves respectively and for our general 
insurance portfolio of business is the higher of 18% of gross 
premiums or 26% of gross claims, in both cases adjusted to 
reflect the level of reinsurance recoveries. For our major non-
European businesses (the US, and Canada) a risk charge on 
assets and liabilities approach is used.

The EU Insurance Groups Directive (IGD) regulatory capital 
solvency surplus has increased by £2.5 billion since 
31 December 2008 to £4.5 billion. This increase reflects a 
combination of operating and market performance as well as 
the benefit of a number of strategic initiatives. Following 
individual guidance from the FSA in 2008 we now recognise 
surpluses in the non-profit funds of our UK life and pensions 
business which is available for transfer to shareholders of 
£0.2 billion (31 December 2008 £0.4 billion). The IGD is a pure 
aggregation test with no credit given for the considerable 
diversification benefits of Aviva. 
As outlined above, a number of strategic initiatives 
impacting the IGD solvency position were completed during the 
year. The Delta Lloyd IPO and Australian Life disposal benefited 
solvency by £0.5 billion and £0.4 billion respectively, while the 
policyholder incentive payment paid as part of the inherited 
estate reattribution reduced solvency by £0.5 billion. Other 
material initiatives included a £0.4 billion benefit from central 
and Delta Lloyd hybrid issues and £0.1 billion from the disposal 
of the Dutch healthcare business. The IGD position also 
benefited from the change in value of non-regulated entities, 
which includes the recognition of intellectual property rights 
and movements in the value of distribution companies. The 
reintroduction of the scrip scheme, allowing investors the option 
of receiving dividends in the form of new Aviva shares, also 
delivered a capital benefit of £0.3 billion over the year. 
Regulatory basis – Long-term businesses 
For our non-participating worldwide life assurance businesses, 
our capital requirements, expressed as a percentage of the EU 
minimum, are set for each business unit as the higher of: 
— The level of capital at which the local regulator is empowered 
to take action. 
— The capital requirement of the business unit under the 
group’s economic capital requirements; and, 
— The target capital level of the business unit. 
The required capital across our life businesses varies between 
100% and 325% of EU minimum or equivalent. The weighted 
average level of required capital for our non-participating life 
business, expressed as a percentage of the EU minimum (or 
equivalent) solvency margin has decreased to 130% 
(31 December 2008: 142%). 
These levels of required capital are used in the calculation 
of the group’s embedded value to evaluate the cost of locked in 
capital. At 31 December 2009 the aggregate regulatory 
requirements based on the EU minimum test amounted to 
£6.1 billion (31 December 2008: £6.0 billion). At this date, the 
actual net worth held in our long-term business was £9.8 billion 
(31 December 2008: £9.5 billion) which represents 159% 
(31 December 2008: 157%) of these minimum requirements. 
Regulatory basis – UK Life with-profit funds 
The available capital of the with-profit funds is represented by 
the realistic inherited estate. The estate represents the assets of 
the long-term with-profit funds less the realistic liabilities for 
non-profit policies within the funds, less asset shares 
aggregated across the with-profit policies and any additional 
amounts expected at the valuation date to be paid to in-force 
policyholders in the future in respect of smoothing costs, 
guarantees and promises. Realistic balance sheet information is 
shown below for the three main UK with-profit funds: Old 
With-Profit Sub-Fund (OWPSF), New With-Profit Sub-Fund 
(NWPSF) and UK Life and Pensions (UKLAP). These realistic 
liabilities have been included within the long-term business 
provision and the liability for insurance and investment contracts 
on the consolidated IFRS balance sheet at 31 December 2009 
and 31 December 2008.

(31 December 2008: £0.8 billion). Realistic liabilities adjusted to eliminate the shareholders’ 
share of future bonuses are £42.1 billion (31 December 2008: £43.2 billion). These realistic 
liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent 
stochastic basis. The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is £0.3 billion, 
£2.2 billion and £3.1 billion for OWPSF, NWPSF and UKLAP respectively (31 December 2008: 
£1.4 billion, £1.5 billion and £4.1 billion).

3. The risk capital margin (RCM) is 3.6 times covered by the inherited estate and support 
arrangement (31 December 2008: 1.8 times). 
4. The UKLAP fund includes the Provident Mutual (PM) fund which has realistic assets and 
liabilities of £1.7 billion, and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate. 
5. This represents the reattributed estate of £1.1 billion at 31 December 2009 held within the 
non-profit fund with UKLAP included within other UK life operations.

Rating agency capital 
Credit ratings are an important indicator of financial strength 
and support access to debt markets as well as providing 
assurance to business partners and policyholders over our ability 
to service contractual obligations. In recognition of this we have 
solicited relationships with a number of rating agencies. The 
agencies generally assign ratings based on an assessment of a 
range of financial factors (eg capital strength, gearing, liquidity 
and fixed charge cover ratios) and non financial factors (eg 
strategy, competitive position, and quality of management). 
Certain rating agencies have proprietary capital models 
which they use to assess available capital resources against 
capital requirements as a component in their overall criteria 
for assigning ratings. Managing our capital and liquidity 
position in accordance with our target rating levels is a core 
consideration in all material capital management and capital 
allocation decisions. 
The group’s overall financial strength is reflected in our 
credit ratings. The group’s rating from Standard and Poor’s 
is AA- (very strong) with a Negative outlook; Aa3 (excellent) 
with a Negative outlook from Moody's; and A (“excellent”) 
with a Stable outlook from A M Best . These ratings continue 
to reflect our strong competitive position, positive strategic 
management, strong and diversified underlying earnings profile 
and robust liquidity position. 
Economic capital 
We use a risk-based capital model to assess economic capital 
requirements and to aid in risk and capital management across 
the group. The model is based on a framework for identifying 
the risks to which business units, and the group as a whole, are 
exposed. A mixture of scenario based approaches and stochastic 
models are used to capture market risk, credit risk, insurance 
risk and operational risk. Scenarios are specified centrally to 
provide consistency across businesses and to achieve a minimum 
standard. Where appropriate, businesses also supplement these 
with additional risk models and stressed scenarios specific to 
their own risk profile. When aggregating capital requirements 
at business unit and group level, we allow for diversification 
benefits between risks and between businesses, with restrictions 
to allow for non-fungibility of capital when appropriate. This 
means that the aggregate capital requirement is less than the 
sum of capital required to cover all of the individual risks. 
This model is used to support our Individual Capital 
Assessments (ICA) which are reported to the FSA for all our UK 
regulated insurance businesses. The FSA uses the results of our 
ICA process when setting target levels of capital for our UK 
regulated insurance businesses. In line with FSA requirements, 
the ICA estimates the capital required to mitigate the risk of 
insolvency to a 99.5% confidence level over a one-year time

against financial and non-financial tests. 
The financial modelling techniques employed in economic 
capital enhance our practice of risk and capital management. 
They enable understanding of the impact of the interaction of 
different risks allowing us to direct risk management activities 
appropriately. These same techniques are employed to enhance 
product pricing and capital allocation processes. Unlike more 
traditional regulatory capital measures, economic capital also 
recognises the value of longer-term profits emerging from in-
force and new business, allowing for consideration of longer-
term value emergence as well as shorter-term net worth 
volatility in our risk and capital management processes. We 
continue to develop our economic capital modelling capability 
for all our businesses as part of our development programme 
to increase the focus on economic capital management. In 
addition we have initiated work on meeting the emerging 
requirements of the Solvency II framework and external 
agencies. 
Solvency II 
2009 has represented a significant step for Solvency II and 
the insurance industry. Since the approval of the Solvency II 
Directive in May 2009, the focus has been on the development 
of the Level 2 implementing measures advice published by the 
CEIOPS which fill in the detail under Level 1 and focused on 
technical issues. Aviva has been actively participating in the 
process by providing responses to the CEIOPS as well as 
participating in the key European industry working groups who 
provide the voice of industry in on-going negotiation in Brussels. 
The formal CEIOPS consultation process has already closed 
and the European Commission are now considering the 
wording on the implementing measures that will be finalised by 
the end of 2010. Full implementation of Solvency II will be 
required in October 2012.

Basis of preparation 
This review complies with the recommendations of the 
European Union (EU) Modernisation Directive, the Companies 
Act 2006 (Contents of Directors’ report: Business review) and is 
in line with current best practice. It is addressed to, and written 
for, the members of Aviva plc with the aim of providing a fair 
review of our business development, performance and position 
at the current time. In producing this review, we aim to present 
a view that is balanced and comprehensive and that is 
consistent with the size and complexity of our business. The 
review is written in the context of the risks and uncertainties 
facing our business. We anticipate that the format and content 
of the review will evolve over time, along with developments in 
our business and the external environment. 
Key performance indicators 
The Companies Act requires that a fair review of the business 
contains financial and, where applicable, non-financial key 
performance indicators (KPIs). We consider that our financial 
KPIs are those that communicate to the members the financial 
performance and strength of the group as a whole. 
These KPIs comprise: 
— Earnings per share (International Financial Reporting 
Standards basis) 
— Proposed ordinary dividend per share and dividend cover 
— Operating profit (Market Consistent Embedded Value basis) 
— Operating profit (IFRS basis) 
— Worldwide sales 
— Return on equity shareholders’ funds 
Management also use a variety of other performance indicators 
(OPIs) in both running and assessing the performance of 
individual business segments and units, rather than the group as 
a whole. OPIs include measures such as new business margins, 
combined operating ratio and underwriting profit. 
In addition to reporting on our financial performance, it is 
important that as a forward thinking company we are aware of 
our wider responsibilities and report on the non-financial 
aspects of our performance. We consider that our employees 
and customers are fundamental to the success of our business; 
as such, they form the basis for our non-financial measures, and 
include: 
— Leadership and employee engagement 
— Customer advocacy 
Accounting basis of preparation 
In addition to presenting our results and financial position on an 
International Financial Reporting Standards basis, we also use 
Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) as an alternative 
performance measure. Details of the accounting basis of 
preparation are set out on the following page. 
Forward-looking statements 
This business review contains “forward-looking statements” 
about: 
— Our future plans 
— Our current goals 
— Our expectations of our future financial condition, 
performance and results 
By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and 
uncertainty because they relate to future events that are beyond 
our control. For example, certain insurance risk disclosures are 
dependent on our choices about assumptions and models, 
which by their nature are estimates. As such, actual future gains 
and losses could differ materially from those that we have 
estimated. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those estimated by the forward-looking 
statements include, but are not limited to: 
— Global economic business conditions 
— Monetary and interest rate policies 
— Foreign currency exchange rates 
— Equity and property prices 
— The impact of competition, inflation and deflation 
— Changes to regulations, taxes and legislation 
— The timing and impact of acquisitions and business 
combinations in relevant industries 
— Natural and other disasters 
— Changes to consumer saving and spending habits 
— Our success in managing the above factors 
Consequently, our actual future financial condition, 
performance and results could differ materially from the plans, 
goals and expectations set out in our forward-looking 
statements. We undertake no obligation to update the forward-
looking statements contained in this review or any other 
forward-looking statements we make.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared under IFRS, 
using standards issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the EU. In addition to 
fulfilling this legal obligation, the group has also complied with 
IFRS as issued by the IASB and applicable at 31 December 2009. 
The financial data contained in the report and accounts has 
been prepared using the group’s accounting policies set out on 
pages 130 to 142. Where applicable, the financial statements 
have also been prepared in accordance with the Statement of 
Recommended Practice (SORP) on accounting for insurance 
business issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), the 
most recent version of which was issued in December 2005 and 
amended in December 2006. 
Following a review of our accounting policy for cash and 
cash equivalents, we have restated the 2007 and 2008 
comparative figures to avoid any ambiguity over the maturity 
dates of these financial instruments. We have also corrected 
some errors made in previous years in reporting pension 
obligations in our Dutch subsidiary. Details are given in 
“Financial statements IFRS – Note 2 – Presentation changes”. 
Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) basis 
of reporting 
We present the results and financial position of our life and 
related businesses on an MCEV basis, in addition to the IFRS 
basis. MCEV methodology represents a more meaningful basis 
of reporting the value of the group’s life and related businesses 
and the drivers of performance than IFRS methodology. This 
basis values cashflow from assets consistently with market prices 
and is consistent with the way pricing is assessed and the 
business is managed. 
The MCEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the 
MCEV Principles published by the CFO Forum in June 2008, 
with the exception of the use of an adjusted risk-free yield due 
to current market conditions for immediate annuities in the UK 
and Netherlands and for all US contracts. Under the MCEV 
methodology, the total profit recognised over the full lifetime of 
an insurance policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of 
reporting. However, the MCEV basis gives a fairer indication of 
the profitability of business on inception. Additionally, 
shareholders’ funds on an MCEV basis incorporate internally 
generated additional value of in-force business (AVIF), which is 
excluded for IFRS reporting. Our incentive schemes and internal 
management reporting are focused broadly evenly between IFRS 
and MCEV performance. These financial statements include 
supplementary information on MCEV reporting in the 
“Alternative method of reporting long-term business” section.

Longer-term investment return 
The long-term nature of most of our operations means that 
short-term realised and unrealised gains and losses are shown as 
an adjustment to operating profit. We focus instead on 
operating profit incorporating a longer-term investment return 
(LTIR). Our rates of return that we use for equity and property in 
our LTIR methodology are aligned with the rates that we use 
under MCEV principles. For fixed interest securities, we include 
the amortisation of premiums or discounts arising on purchase, 
thereby producing an LTIR that is equivalent to the gross 
redemption yield. 
Critical accounting policies and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires the group to 
select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions 
that affect items reported in the consolidated income 
statement, consolidated statement of financial position, other 
primary statements and notes to the financial statements. These 
are set out on pages 130 to 142. 
Critical accounting policies 
The major areas of judgement on policy application are 
considered to be over whether group entities should be 
consolidated (set out in policy D), on product classification (set 
out in policy F) and in the classification of financial investments 
(set out in policy S). 
Use of estimates 
All estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current 
facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge 
and their predictions of future events and actions. Actual results 
can always differ from those estimates, possibly significantly. 
The table below sets out those items that we consider 
particularly susceptible to changes in estimates and 
assumptions, and the relevant accounting policy.

Aviva plc 
Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
At Aviva we believe that corporate responsibility (CR) means 
taking positive action, treating our colleagues, customers and 
suppliers with respect, applying consistently high standards in 
everything we do and having a constructive role in the 
communities in which we operate. As well as running our 
business responsibly we also work to influence sustainable 
behaviour among our customers, suppliers and the companies 
in which we invest. Last but not least, CR is about taking a 
proactive approach towards the shared global challenge of 
climate change. 
The report that follows contains a summary of the progress 
and performance of our CR programme in 2009. A detailed 
review is available online at www.aviva.com/corporate­
responsibility/reports 
Highlights from 2009 include: 
— Executive directors’ remuneration based on financial 
outcomes and targets related to customer advocacy and 
employee leadership and engagement 
— Extended our reporting of key performance indicators 
using Accounting for Sustainability’s connected 
reporting framework 
— Established long-term carbon reduction target 
— Launched ‘Street to School’ global community programme 
— Included in some of the world’s leading indices and 
benchmarks 
Strategy and governance 
’By acting responsibly for the long term in how we do business 
we will meet our ambition to provide prosperity and peace of 
mind to our customers.’ 
This is our core purpose applied irrespective of whether 
economic conditions are favourable or challenging. Our global 
business strategy has stood Aviva in good stead to manage the 
risks and uncertainties experienced through the downturn in the 
world’s economy while preparing for recovery and long-term 
growth. Our people strategy and our CR strategy play an 
important part in this, in maintaining our reputation as a 
preferred employer and responsible corporate citizen, in 
managing our resources and in reducing costs. 
Directing our approach is our Board CR Committee. 
Established in 2006, the Committee is chaired by Carole Piwnica 
and comprises our Chairman, our CEO and three non-executive 
directors. It meets four times a year to review Group CR strategy 
and policy and assess regional performance against consistently 
applied Group key performance indicators (KPIs). It also reviews 
Group functions within Aviva that contribute to our global CR 
programme. In 2009 our global procurement activities were 
presented to the Committee and in 2010 it will receive an 
update on our customer programme. Executive directors 
remuneration is based on a combination of financial outcomes 
along with targets related to customers, employees and 
personal objectives. The Committee’s report can be found on 
page 98. 
Our CR Advisory Group supports and advises on the 
management and implementation of the global CR programme. 
Reporting to the Executive Committee through the Group HR 
Director, it includes Group CR specialists, regional CR directors 
and HR directors who work together to adopt and refine CR 
strategies, assess progress, identify actions that need to be 
taken and embed our programmes in different parts of the 
business. In addition, the Aviva plc Board receives an annual 
update on CR strategy, activities and progress. Our CR 
programme is also featured regularly on the agenda at executive 
management committees and regional performance against 
Group KPIs is reviewed quarterly. 
We also report our performance using the HRH Prince of Wales’ 
Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) connected reporting 
framework (see page 74), a methodology that integrates 
financial and non-financial data to provide a comprehensive 
picture of our performance. 
We were one of the first companies to help develop the 
framework and have incorporated it in our Annual Report and 
Accounts since 2007. By reporting the links between 
sustainability, financial performance and strategic direction 
more explicitly the framework increases our understanding and 
the visibility of sustainability issues. We have found that it has 
helped our finance and sustainability teams to work together 
more effectively, identifying cost savings as well as providing 
clear disclosure to investors. This year we have extended the use 
of the framework further by adding customer and community 
investment indicators. 
Bringing CR into the Boardroom 
Aviva Investors has taken a leading position in encouraging 
global companies to enhance their governance and 
transparency in CR reporting. In 2008, Alain Dromer, Chief 
Executive of Aviva Investors, called on all stock market listing 
authorities to make it a requirement that companies: 
— consider how responsible and sustainable their business 
model is, and 
— put a forward looking sustainability strategy to the vote 
at their AGM 
In November 2009 Aviva announced plans to put our CR Report 
to a separate shareholder vote at the 2010 AGM. We are the 
first company in the UK and the first financial institution in the 
world to take this proactive step. We hope that this will 
encourage other companies to bring CR issues to the heart 
of the boardroom and engage openly and transparently with 
stakeholders on sustainability issues. 
Business ethics 
We aspire to the highest standards of conduct and set out our 
principles in our business ethics code. This stipulates fairness, 
honesty and transparency in all we do. Everyone at Aviva has a 
part to play in upholding our standards and we raise awareness 
of these responsibilities through our induction programmes and 
acceptance and sign-off of the code by all staff. 
Financial crime 
Our financial crime policy reinforces our zero tolerance 
approach and ensures that risks relating to fraud, money 
laundering, market abuse and bribery and corruption are 
adequately controlled. We provide mandatory computer-based 
training as part of our procedures for combating market abuse 
and insider trading, money laundering and fraud. In 2009 we 
enhanced our bribery and corruption controls and rolled out 
a worldwide training programme for employees. 
We encourage our employees to raise any concerns they 
might have through ‘Right Call’ – an Aviva-wide malpractice 
reporting service. This enables all employees to report any 
suspicions or concerns in a confidential manner for independent 
investigation. In 2009, 67 incidents were recorded across the 
group. All cases were referred for independent investigation 
with 51 reaching conclusion and 16 cases currently remaining 
under investigation. 
Our people 
Delivering on our strategic plans and commitments requires 
strong leadership and the energy, dedication and belief of all 
our employees. Over the past three years we have built a strong 
global human resources function to lead our cultural

transformation. We have a clear purpose – to drive a talent 
leadership and culture-led transformation to deliver exceptional 
business performance. We have approached this by 
implementing strategies designed to: 
— Encourage talented people to join Aviva and stay 
— Match the right people to the right roles and take action 
where there are gaps 
— Empower people to be the best they can be 
— Build pride in Aviva 
We will do this by focusing globally on: 
— Developing leaders capable of winning for Aviva in our 
chosen markets 
— Embedding the ‘One Aviva, Twice the Value’ culture 
— Building engagement and commitment by living the 
employee promise 
— Strengthening our CR performance by engaging employees 
and influencing our communities and stakeholders 
— Making it easier to work by simplifying and de-cluttering 
HR tools and processes 
— Building strong global HR and CR functions. 
Locally, the use of global tools and ‘One Aviva’ processes 
supports the delivery of our business strategies. 
Our employee promise 
We want every employee to be able to say ‘At Aviva I am 
recognised for who I am and my contribution matters’. This is 
the cornerstone of our employee promise, developed after 
extensive research and consultation with our people on what 
matters most to them at work. 
By implementing ‘One Aviva’ we are well on the way to 
becoming a global brand recognised wherever we operate. For 
example, in 2009 we reached a key milestone in the UK when 
Norwich Union completed the name change to Aviva. It is vital 
that we take our employees with us by inviting them to 
question, discuss and co-create the future. To support our line 
managers in leading their people on the brand journey, we 
organised a series of ‘This Is Our Story’ cinema events, featuring 
the experiences of employees in different parts of Aviva’s 
business. Managers were equipped with practical tools to help 
them to be effective in bringing to life the behaviours asked of 
all of us. 
We want to create an employment brand that attracts and 
retains the best talent and differentiates Aviva as an employer 
of choice. Over the last 18 months we have introduced new 
management and leadership programmes to nurture talent and 
create proactive dialogue with leaders and their teams. New this 
year is the ‘Learn Your Strengths’ interactive tool, taken up by 
more than 7,000 employees. We also enhanced our induction 
programme and created recognition schemes, including 
Spotlight and Aviva Achievers, which give employees credit for 
exceptional performance. 
We are changing the way in which services are delivered to 
employees and a wide range of supporting tools and materials 
are now available to all on our global intranet, Aviva World, 
which is fast becoming our first port of call for information. 
Aviva World includes news features and forum sites, it gives 
employees worldwide the opportunity to learn more about 
different businesses, discuss issues and get to know each other. 
Listening to our employees 
We rebranded our annual employee survey in 2009 and 
included new questions to reflect the areas our people said 
were important. An extensive communication programme was 
implemented in the lead-up to the launch of the Employee 
Promise survey and our overall participation rate increased to 
Governance 
Shareholder information 
Financial statements IFRS 
Financial statements MCEV 
Other information 
76% (2008: 74%) with eight business units achieving 100% 
participation. Senior management pay continues to be linked 
to the survey results through clear benchmarked targets on 
leadership and engagement. 
Visibility of our survey results has increased with most team 
managers receiving their own localised team results. Senior 
leaders are also engaged, taking the time to speak to employees 
about the survey results, sharing their personal reflections and 
taking direct questions on the survey outcomes. For every survey 
completed we gave a donation to our new ‘Street to School’ 
charity programme raising £37,000 for Save the Children 
in India. 
We invested in an online planning tool to help teams record 
and monitor action plans arising from the survey results. We will 
share progress on these plans at several stages before the next 
survey. In 2010 we will produce a global results booklet 
providing our employees with a clear picture of what we have 
done well, where we can improve and the steps we will be 
taking to address their concerns. 
Strengthening our leadership capability 
During 2009 we continued our twin-track approach to 
developing leadership capability. We ran collective, regionally 
based summits for our top 500 leaders focused on our ‘One 
Aviva, Twice the Value’ vision. A continuation of the culture 
change started in 2008, these events have helped to increase 
the resilience of our senior leaders, improve understanding of 
the internal and external brand and create a global identity. We 
have designed a new approach to individual development that 
seeks to strengthen leadership capability by focusing specifically 
on career transition points. Associations with global partners 
including The Centre for Creative Leadership, INSEAD and 
FranklinCovey are providing innovative methods that enhance 
the quality and variety of development opportunities available. 
For 2010 we have already committed to bring the senior leaders 
together under the banner of Vision into Performance to 
strengthen the day-to-day actions being taken to achieve 
our vision. 
Talent management 
Our Talking Talent programme has been running for two 
years and Aviva now has a consistent method for assessing 
individuals' performance and long-term potential. The process is 
used at all levels and is providing excellent visibility of the talent 
within our business. 
Recruiting and retaining the best people in an increasingly 
competitive market is a strategic priority for Aviva and we have 
launched a new website (www.aviva.com/careers) to showcase 
career options across our worldwide markets. The site describes 
what it is like to work at Aviva, with video profiles of employees, 
information on our culture and values, career management 
insights and an overview of our hands-on approach to CR. 
Diversity, equality and human rights 
Aviva’s diversity programme promotes a fair and respectful 
culture in which differences are valued. Our policy and practices 
are aligned with United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and International Labour Organisation’s core labour 
standards. Gaining a detailed understanding of diversity issues is 
crucial in bringing our employee promise to life. To this end we 
have refreshed our training, beginning with a virtual conference 
in which external speakers and our HR specialists and CR team 
gave their insights. We will continue to focus on key diversity 
challenges in 2010. 
Within our senior management group, representation of 
female colleagues was maintained at 22% in 2009. We were 
recognised in The Times/Aurora Where Women Want to Work

Top 50 list in 2009 and featured in Cranfield University’s study 
of women in the boardroom. Our chief marketing officer, 
Amanda Mackenzie, was named in The Female FTSE Report as 
one of 100 Women to Watch in 2009. Our employee groups, 
including the Aviva Women’s Network and Pride Aviva, are 
firmly established. They have evolved from small beginnings 
to become thriving networks, hosting events and contributing 
support for local community projects. This year, we significantly 
improved our position in Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index, 
achieving 54th position, compared to 78th in 2008. We are 
the only insurer to be included by Stonewall in the top 100 
employers in the UK, and Pride Aviva also received special 
recognition as a ‘star performing employee network group’. 
Community investment 
As a responsible business, we are committed to helping address 
challenges facing people and society. Globally, we invested 
over £8.0 million in 2009 (2008: £9.6 million), in line with our 
strategic focus to support community and charitable initiatives 
in education, life trauma and financial literacy. We encourage 
employee volunteering in support of these areas as part of 
personal development and our people can apply for up to three 
paid volunteering days per year. Nearly 9,000 staff took up the 
opportunity in 2009, resulting in a total of 79,900 volunteering 
hours, an increase of 18% on 2008 (67,700 hours). We report 
the impacts of our activities against the London Benchmarking 
Group model and have developed tools to help our businesses 
around the world capture information on the impact of their 
investments in the communities they serve as well as employee 
time and cash donations. 
We continue to support humanitarian aid through our 
Oxfam 365 partnership, which helps to equip Oxfam with the 
resources and materials to respond to emergencies as soon as 
they happen. Our employee groups also link up with Oxfam 
to raise awareness of key issues and in March our Women’s 
Network match-funded donations made by employees to 
Oxfam’s ‘Yes We Can’ campaign. This was in support of 
Oxfam’s work to change attitudes towards women in Nepal 
and South Asia and create a fairer society. 
In 2009 we launched ‘Street to School’, our five-year global 
charitable initiative, which aims to get children and young 
people off the street and into education. Working with leading 
charities and experts, and supported by our employees and 
customers, together we will champion the needs of street 
children in the communities in which we live and work. ‘Street 
to School’ has already been launched in the UK, Turkey and 
India, and will gradually be adopted in every country in 
which we operate, eventually accounting for 50% of our 
charitable donations. 
Here are just a few of the community activities we 
supported this year: 
‘Street to School’ in India 
Aviva India has partnered with CRY (Child Rights and You) and 
Save the Children in India to help over 50,000 street children 
get access to education and training by 2012. To date, 70% of 
staff have volunteered to donate a day’s salary to CRY, and in 
November, 30 staff members took part in the Airtel Delhi Half 
Marathon to raise funds for the charity. In partnership with the 
Hindustan Times, Aviva India also held a five-day book donation 
drive which resulted in 125,000 books donated by employees, 
schools and members of the public. Save the Children will use 
the books to help give 38,000 under- privileged children access 
to education. 
Economic citizenship education for teenagers 
‘Paying for It’ (www.payingforit.org.uk) launched by Aviva in 
2007, continued to take economic citizenship teaching into 
schools up and down the country with the help of over 100 
specially trained Aviva volunteers. Using specially tailored 
resources available online for all schools to access, classes 
address issues of financial and social importance, such as 
housing, the environment and health. 
The ‘Chance to be Chancellor’ competition was run 
in conjunction with The Times as part of the ‘Paying for It’ 
programme. It offers engaging activities to help young people 
find out more about the current economic challenges facing the 
country and act out the role of the Chancellor in delivering their 
vision for the economy. 
Aviva Canada’s Community Fund 
The Aviva Community Fund gives members of the public the 
opportunity to turn great ideas into action to benefit their 
local communities. Launched in October, a unique website, 
www.avivacommunityfund.org enables Canadians to register 
their ideas with accompanying photos or video. Special outreach 
efforts were made to raise awareness of the new fund to 
charities and not-for-profit organisations and approximately 
8,000 schools, colleges and universities were contacted across 
the country. Through various forms of communication including 
social media sites, the people who submitted the ideas 
encouraged as many people as possible to vote for their idea. 
More than 2,000 ideas were registered and an impartial panel 
of judges awarded a total of $500,000 to eight winning entries, 
announced in January 2010. From coast to coast, ideas ranged 
from building playgrounds for children, driving awareness 
of environmental programmes and providing services for 
at-risk youth. 
Taiwan typhoon 
Typhoon Morakot, which hit Taiwan in August, resulted in over 
400 deaths in the country. Aviva in Taiwan raised funds through 
employee donations to World Vision and employees were given 
up to two days leave to help those affected by the typhoon. 
A dedicated helpline was established to speed up claims and 
affected customers were offered a three-month deferral on 
their premiums. 
Podari Zhizn 
Our people in Russia volunteered their time and money to 
support Podari Zhizn, a charity that helps children suffering from 
terminal illnesses. By funding the charity, instead of subscribing 
to the tradition of buying gifts for clients during holiday periods, 
the funds raised to date have provided a new ventilating system 
of benefit to the children. Aviva Russia has also donated 
computers to the foundation. 
Environment 
Today’s actions will affect future generations, and nowhere is 
this more evident than in our approach to climate change and 
the environment. Our established and proven strategy focuses 
on controlling our own impacts and resources, including gas, 
water, electricity and waste – and by pursuing this long-term 
policy we have reduced our carbon emissions by a further 5.2% 
this year. As an investor, we use our influence to encourage 
others to make responsible choices and we promote good 
environmental practice among our colleagues, customers 
and suppliers. 
On a like-for-like basis, in 2009, our total carbon emissions 
fell by 5.2% across our global business, compared to a 6.6% 
reduction in 2008. Overall, we achieved a group-wide reduction 
in carbon emissions of 15% (2008: 3.3%). This figure includes 
energy consumption data from our business in Australia before

its sale in October 2009. The data excludes Auto Windscreens 
and Aviva Global Services (AGS) which were sold at the end 
of 2008. 
We also set global annual targets in other key areas, 
summarised below: 
Performance 
– accounting 
for 
2009 Targets divestments 
Reduce CO2 emissions by 5%* (5.2)% 
Reduce water use by 4% (8.8)% 
Reduce waste by 4% +9.6 % 
Increase percentage of recycled waste by 2% (until 80% recycled rate 
is achieved). (15.0)% 
* We also offset 105% of our remaining emissions by investing in sustainable projects such 
as renewable energy generation and small-scale run-of-river hydro electricity systems. 
All performance data is calculated on a like-for like basis taking into account new acquisitions 
and divestments in 2009. 
We continue to pursue our goal to incrementally reduce our 
carbon footprint on an annual basis. We have also set out a 
long-term carbon reduction target to help focus our businesses’ 
environmental strategies. By 2020 we aim to reduce our carbon 
emissions by 30% from our 2006 baseline. 
The role of insurers in climate change 
The insurance industry has a fundamental part to play in 
society’s responses to climate change. As a major insurer Aviva 
has first-hand understanding of the impact of extreme weather 
events on our customers. On their behalf, we are committed 
to help mitigate the threat of climate change and support 
everyone in society to adapt to changes caused by man-made 
emissions already in the atmosphere. Our industry can also draw 
on its knowledge of historical weather data to identify patterns 
of change, applying our understanding of risk to map future 
temperature scenarios and determine likely impacts. Finally, 
we can offer the financial tools to help manage the burden 
of climate change, for example the pooling and transfer of risk. 
We believe that climate change must be tackled now. 
As extreme weather events become more frequent and more 
severe, they become more challenging to insure. It is in 
everyone’s interest that insurance remains affordable and 
available so that people affected from severe weather events 
can recover quickly from unavoidable impacts. 
Our actions and commitments 
Proactive participation in leading global forums and associations 
is a key part of our climate change strategy. This year we were 
involved in the lead-up to the Copenhagen Summit in 
December 2009 through our membership of working groups of 
the UNEP Finance Initiative and as signatories to the following: 
— The Geneva Association Kyoto Statement 
— The UNEP FI Investor Statement on a Global Agreement on 
Climate Change 
— The ClimateWise Statement for Copenhagen 
— The Corporate Leaders Group Copenhagen Communiqué 
Our senior executives also take the opportunity to engage 
personally and as widely as possible on climate change and 
other environmental issues. In September, a senior delegation 
including Carole Piwnica, chair of our Board CR Committee, 
Euleen Goh (Aviva Group Board member) and Simon Machell 
(CEO Aviva Asia Pacific) led a roundtable discussion in Hong 
Kong with NGOs, corporates, academics and students from 
Hong Kong University. The event included strong debate on the 
climate change agenda and Aviva’s role in making a difference, 
providing valuable perspectives that are being shared within the 
organisation. The group also visited the Aviva Junk, a ‘green’ 
Chinese sailing vessel, developed in collaboration with Hong

Kong University. Launched in March 2009, the Aviva Junk 
incorporates a number of renewable energy efficient 
technologies and is being used to host educational tours as part 
of our environmental awareness programme in Asia Pacific. 
Raising our employees’ levels of engagement and 
participation in environmental projects is an important part of 
our efforts to encourage good practices, both at work and at 
home. Many of the employee volunteering activities that took 
place around the world in June as part of our celebrations to 
become ‘One Aviva’ focused on the environment, including a 
recyclathon and a series of tree planting events. We publish 
regular articles and updates on environmental matters on our 
global intranet site and, in November, teamed up with our 
environmental partner ClimateWise with an interactive, web-
based project to give employees the chance to have their say 
on risks and opportunities associated with climate change and 
the insurance industry. 
As part of controlling and reducing impacts within Aviva, 
telepresence video conferencing has proved to be a significant 
asset. By implementing this technology and reducing domestic 
and international air travel we have made cost savings, 
promoted work-life balance and reduced our carbon footprint 
from air travel by 5% in 2009. In 2010 we plan to increase the 
number of facilities available to make telepresence a regular 
part of business and extend our capacity by using some of our 
suppliers’ conference facilities. In the UK our proactive work 
on climate change was recognised when we gained 
accreditation to the Carbon Trust Standard. The standard is a 
key milestone for Aviva as it is an early action metric that will 
count towards the UK government’s new Carbon Reduction 
Commitment regulation. 
We are both a signatory and responding company to the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and this year were ranked 
eighth in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for the 
FTSE350, third in the financial services sector and 38th overall 
in the FSTEGlobal 500. Our Chairman, Lord Sharman, spoke at 
the CDP London launch event and called on industry to provide 
more consistency and transparency in reporting and move from 
disclosure to mitigation. 
Our environmental planning is now being extended to our 
partners, and, in a first move for Aviva, we signed a ‘green’ 
service level agreement with Hewlett Packard (HP) for the 
provision and running of two data centres. As a key part of the 
contract, HP is charged with using ‘eco friendly’ or renewable 
power sources to run the centres, develop an environmental 
management system, conduct audits and hold an annual review 
with Aviva to assess progress, set targets and investigate new 
technologies and processes. 
Customers 
With customers’ confidence in financial institutions shaken 
by the global economic downturn, it was as important as ever 
before to remain true to our purpose of providing prosperity 
and peace of mind. We continued to work to understand 
perceptions and needs in our markets and once again 
conducted our wide-ranging annual survey on worldwide 
consumer attitudes to savings, using the results to inform 
ongoing product and service developments across the Group. 
The Net Promoter Score ®

Products and services 
Through our product portfolio customers can make informed 
choices about their insurance and financial needs that can at 
the same time provide wider socioeconomic and environmental 
benefits: 
— Our affordable microfinance and insurance products for low-
income earners have reached around 1.4 million rural lives in 
India to date, in many cases offering financial protection for 
as little as two dollars a year. 
— Car insurance customers in some of our general insurance 
markets can opt for lower premiums if they drive vehicles 
with low CO2 emissions. 
— With research showing that half of new parents do not have 
adequate insurance, we launched Parent Life Cover in the UK 
which includes free protection until the child’s first birthday. 
— Recognising low levels of confidence among consumers, 
Lisseo was launched in France to offer customers the 
opportunity to invest gradually in the equity markets without 
the need to commit a lump sum on one day. 
Extreme weather events are an increasingly common occurrence 
and 2009 was no exception. Aviva in Ireland launched an 
advance payment mechanism in response to the extensive 
flooding in November to help householders and businesses 
who were most seriously affected. In a co-ordinated campaign, 
the team also worked with local and national media and local 
councillors to keep customers informed about the steps to 
take if they were affected. 
In the UK, by activating our major incident plan in a timely 
manner ahead of predicted floods and storms at the year end, 
we were well prepared to respond. In Cockermouth, Cumbria, 
particularly hard hit by severe flooding, Aviva claims staff were 
immediately stationed at the evacuation centre and stayed until 
the last evacuee had left, providing advice and support to 
anyone who needed it, irrespective of who their insurer was. 
Our drive to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty 
gained extra momentum this year with the launch of the first 
Aviva Customer Cup. This is our new global tournament 
designed to help our employees identify and remove barriers to 
customer loyalty, stimulate innovative ideas and enable teams 
around the world to be recognised for delivering the ‘One 
Aviva’ brand promise. Projects from more than 340 teams were 
evaluated by judges in three tournament stages with 10 teams 
making it through to the grand final in October. The winning 
group was the ‘Ears of RAC’ with a web-based project to 
capture comments and opinions from customers, spot trends 
and respond to them quickly. The focus is now on sharing the 
best practices of the top 10 projects in other parts of Aviva’s 
business and embedding these before launching the next 
tournament in 2010. 
Supply chain 
Our challenge is to support our suppliers in meeting the highest 
social, environmental and ethical standards in the delivery of 
goods and services. For 2009 we agreed a global approach and 
targets for our regional procurement teams focusing on our 
approach to: 
— Sourcing ethical suppliers in the context of Aviva’s annual 
third-party spend of around £6 billion 
— Ensuring an ethical relationship between our suppliers and 
Aviva employees 
— Encouraging our suppliers to further develop CR within their 
own businesses and supply chains. 
We made progress in sourcing with the development of a set of 
industry-leading questions in collaboration with the UK-based 
Financial Services CR forum. These take account of CR issues for 
different categories of spend, helping Aviva to make informed 
choices about potential new suppliers. A CR weighting is 
included in our sourcing decisions. 
To support and maintain ethical relationships with suppliers 
we are implementing processes and tools that identify 
hospitality offered by suppliers to ensure that this does not 
conflict with our internal rules and is not offered during 
commercial negotiations. Similarly, we have implemented a 
register of interests to ensure complete transparency of any 
interest that our employees might have in an existing supplier. 
Finally, in relation to encouraging our suppliers to adopt 
sustainable practices, we are reviewing Aviva's suppliers to 
assess them against a ‘CR maturity curve’ and develop relevant 
improvement plans. Aviva's suppliers are asked to sign our code 
of conduct, which provides an obligation to comply with 
relevant standards relating to the environment, ethical business 
conduct and respect for human rights. All regions are making 
good progress in embedding these activities into business 
processes, but we acknowledge that this needs to remain 
a focus area in 2010.

Notes on KPIs 
— Business ethics: This KPI covers 98% of our employees. 
— Customers: Using our NPS methodology, 67% of businesses met or exceed performance last year against a local market average (2008: 67%). However, within that percentage, 24 markets 
are participating in NPS compared to 12 in 2008 and 58% are exceeding the benchmark, compared to 33% in 2008. 
— Last year we reported the percentage of businesses that met/exceeded performance against local market average where no local benchmark was available (2009: 75%). Businesses that were 
covered by this metric are now all rated against a local market average. This metric has therefore been removed. Also in 2009, we replaced an employee survey question relating to the 
percentage of employees who consider that their business is customer focused with a new customer index KPI. This gives an average favourable employee response against five customer 
indicators. 
— Environment: We want to show clearly that we have reduced our emissions as a result of energy management and behavioural change and not merely due to divestments. The KPI for ‘Actual 
emissions’ are absolute emissions for total Aviva operations in each year stated while the KPI with ‘emissions based on 2009 ownership’ show our emissions over the last two years based on 
operations that we have in 2009 allowing for a like-for-like comparison. Water has been restated following an independent review of Aviva Canada's water consumption between 2006 and 
2008. This has increased the overall Group consumption figures. 
— People: Current and historical data for women in senior management excludes Delta Lloyd group. We also report KPIs relating to employee engagement. These can be found in our online 
CR report: www.aviva.com/corporate-responsibility/reports 
— Suppliers: We adjusted our 2009 target and 2008 return for the number of business unit suppliers signing Aviva’s Supplier Code of Conduct due to a statement of compliance from our business 
in North America which could not be validated by Group Procurement. 
— Community: These KPIs cover all Aviva employees and Aviva joint venture employees.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Accounting for Sustainability 
We also report our performance using Accounting for 
Sustainability’s connected reporting framework, which 
integrates financial and non-financial data to provide a 
comprehensive picture of our impacts. We were one of the first 
companies to help develop the framework and have used this 
approach for environmental reporting in our Annual Report 
and Accounts since 2007. This year we have extended the use 
of the framework further by adding customer and community 
investment indicators. 
We have reported the following indicators: 
(i) Greenhouse gas emissions 
(ii) Waste 
(iii)Resource usage 
(iv)Customer advocacy 
(v) Investing in communities

Direct company impacts 
Cashflow performance 
CO2 emissions: Total cost of offsetting 105% of our global CO2 
emissions – 104,351 tonnes in 2009 – was in the region of 
£620,000. These CO2 emissions offset on a retrospective basis 
compensate for the carbon output of our consumption of non­
renewable sourced electricity, fugitive emissions from air-
conditioning system gases, gas and oil from buildings and 
business travel. 
We incur up to a 2% premium when purchasing renewable 
electricity in countries where the benefit of the related zero or 
reduced emissions are granted to the purchasing company. At 
the end of our current main UK electricity contract in July 2010 
we will no longer pay a premium for zero emission electricity in 
the UK. Currently 64% (2008: 65%) of our electricity worldwide 
is purchased from zero emission sources. 
Other significant emissions: Our operations do not generate 
material quantities of any other significant greenhouse gases; 
however we are beginning to measure and report on our 
fugitive emissions in line with the Defra Voluntary Reporting 
Guidelines on GHG for Companies.

Performance, strategy and targets 
In 2009, our total CO2 emissions decreased with 26 of our 
28 businesses reporting consistently on their footprint and 
applying practices to reduce their emissions. These have been 
achieved by using technologies to dematerialise the carbon in 
the way we work, changing behaviours, and by purchasing zero 
emission and renewable electricity. Through our divestment in 
AutoWindscreens, AGS and Aviva Australia, our footprint 
reduced by 12,740 tonnes. 
Our telepresence facilities were used for 1,030 meetings 
in 2009, a total of 4,927 meeting hours. Over the same period 
our air kilometres (km) reduced by 20% from 105 million km 
to 84 million km. Our telepresence sites are reaching optimal 
utilisation so we have begun to investigate other desktop video 
communication technologies to meet the everyday demands 
of the business. For the first time we ran a virtual HR and CR 
conference using webex facilities, replacing the traditional 
‘venue’ format and reducing costs and emissions associated 
with air travel. Held over five weeks, a total of 1,650 attendees 
joined sessions during the 50-hour conference, using 2,475 
webex hours. The conference enabled us to reach the entire 
global HR and CR community at a significant reduction in cost 
on previous events and this format is now being considered 
by other functions in Aviva.
 The energy-related consumption of our UK data centres 
was included in the outsourcing contract. We put what we 
think is the first green service level agreement into place with 
an onus on our outsourcing partners to report performance in 
terms of energy efficiency, target setting, and standards of 
equipment used must sign up to the EU Code of Conduct for 
Data Centres. Our focus on IT, being an enabler to carbon 
reduction, and the more efficient use of energy in the ICT area 
will continue this year as well as use of new technologies with 
a longer return on investment to help us continue to meet our 
annual and long-term carbon reduction targets. 
In August 2009, we became the first insurance company 
to gain accreditation to the Carbon Trust Standard. This 
provides further independent assurance that we have reduced 
our emissions and, along with installation of Automated Meter 
Readers, it means that our operations have met the early action 
metrics in respect of the UK government’s Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. 
The fuel consumption of the RAC fleet has reduced from 
10.3 million litres to 9.1 million litres, a reduction of 11.6%. 
This is due in part to the economic downturn, the use of more 
accurate satellite navigation systems in the vehicles and more 
technical staff in the call centres to talk customers through 
simple repairs. This means they can continue their journey

sooner and breakdown assistance mileage is reduced. We are 
also making use of our local knowledge of reliable garages to 
reduce towing mileage and achieve a comprehensive repair 
quickly. These changes in our processes, together with speed 
limiters and minimising our carrying load, have all reduced the 
carbon intensity of our roadside breakdown service whilst still 
providing the highest level of customer satisfaction. 
Indirect impacts 
We are conscious of the potential impacts that climate change 
has on our business. We constantly update our understanding 
of the effect of these impacts through catastrophe modelling 
tools – using computer-assisted calculations to estimate the 
losses that could be sustained as a result of an extreme weather 
event such as a windstorm or storm surge. In 2009 Aviva was 
represented on the latest ABI Climate Change Research steering 
group which sought to combine catastrophe models with 
climate change models to explore the variation in risk based on 
different temperature scenarios. We consider the financial risk 
climate change poses for Aviva and accordingly build this into 
our levels of capital reserves and risk management processes. 
Further detail on this can be found on page 56. 
We have completed a carbon footprinting exercise for 
the properties we own through our Property Fund managed 
by Aviva Investors for 2008. Under the new UK Government 
Carbon Reduction Commitment scheme, electricity, gas and 
oil used in the properties will be subject to an additional cost 
of £12 per tonne. Aviva Investors’ European Renewable Energy 
and Infrastructure Fund, launched in November 2008, is 
open for investment. The target initial gross assets are set 
at €500 million.

Performance, strategy and targets 
In 2009, the headline figure for the total volume of waste 
generated globally by Aviva shows a reduction of 24%. 
However, this includes a figure of some 6,000 tonnes, the result 
of divestment of businesses such as Aviva in Australia, AGS and 
AutoWindscreens. When we take divestments into account, 
the actual waste shows a net increase of 9.6%, and this has 
also affected our recycling waste figure which at 69% is short 
of our target of 80%. Our global rebranding to Aviva generated 
rebranding waste; however, we monitored it in the run up to 
the day to ensure it was kept as low as possible. The UK 
business recycled 161 tonnes of obsolete media and 26 tonnes 
of other branded products. Aviva in the USA took the 
opportunity to remove office clutter with a two-day recyclathon, 
which generated 18.5 tonnes of recyclable material – the 
equivalent of 101 m
3
 of landfill space. In 2007 the UK business 
set a zero to landfill target for 2012. This has been delayed due 
to the situation in the Chinese recyclate market and the UK’s 
economic position. We now have this target set for 2015. To 
achieve this we have made some significant changes to our 
waste management model. Where local facilities exist, our 
remaining waste, following segregation in the office, is 
processed via material recycling facilities which provides a 
further 85% recycling rate on our waste in these locations. 
This process will continue to be rolled out in 2010 but it has 
already lifted our recycling rate in the UK from 61% to 74%. 
Indirect impacts 
Products/suppliers/investors 
We are rolling out a ‘repair over replacement’ process in our UK 
accident repair centre network to reduce the proportion of new 
parts used in repairs to customers’ vehicles. 
In Canada, Aviva’s Premiere Auto Network became the first 
National Insurance Direct Repair programme to have all of their 
network repairers waterborne compliant. The new waterborne 
products will reduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by 40% 
by 2034. VOCs release fine particulates and ozone into the 
atmosphere. By working with water rather than solvent-based 
products, the reduction will lower the health risk for the paint 
sprayers and other repair shop technicians from contracting 
lung cancer and heart disease. Other procurement initiatives 
include providing alternative recycled-part solutions and paying 
for the disposal of hazardous waste.

Performance, strategy and targets 
Water consumption reduced by 8.8% in 2009, exceeding our 
target of 4%. Whilst the businesses in the UK continued to see 
savings from the water saving devices installed towards the end 
of 2008, Aviva France installed water filters on the bathroom 
taps of Montaigne Head Office in 2009. The filters reduce the 
flow of water by approximately 50% and achieve a reduction 
of around 5% in the total water consumption. This will now 
be rolled out to the regional offices in France. 
Following the very successful use of double sided printing 
in the Group head office, the introduction of duplex printing 
as standard across the UK has resulted in a 20% reduction in 
paper purchased and a 5% volume reduction in the amount 
of office printing. 
Aviva France is currently studying the possibility of using 
paper with a reduced weight at the Montaigne head office in 
order to reduce paper consumption. If this study is successful, 
Aviva will implement this solution throughout its entire network 
in France and will encourage its other subsidiaries to follow. 
When buildings have reached their end of lease or are 
being refurbished, the environmental implications are 
considered. Some businesses like Aviva UK are turning to 
‘space hopping’ (hot desk) solutions. Other Aviva businesses 
are consolidating their property space and as a result are able 
to manage their environmental impact more comprehensively. 
Aviva USA’s purpose-built head office, to be opened in June 
2010, has been rated ‘excellent’ by LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) and combines four existing offices 
into one. 
Indirect impacts 
Products/suppliers/investors 
The economic situation has meant that companies are 
considering the added value of relationships. Recently we 
engaged with some of our IT providers to see how we can make 
further energy savings and, through conversations with our IT 
supplier Cisco, we learned that we are able to power down our 
desktop phones and other networked IT equipment remotely. 
Continuing with our work around the impact of marketing 
materials, and building on our initiatives to make information 
available electronically and using degradable polywrap for 
literature sent through the post, we will be looking at our 
mailings and working with our distribution partners to 
ensure that our environmental impact in this area is kept 
to a minimum. 
Aviva Canada’s ‘Save Waste, Eliminate Paper’ programme is 
supporting our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. It focuses 
on eliminating printed policy documents for brokers, saving 
paper, ink, energy and time costs. So far 246 out of 1,855 
brokers have signed up to this programme. 
In France, Aviva’s agents and advisers are able to use 
laptops when with clients to carry out transactions online. 
This has increased the use of the online intranet portal and 
client email database, lowered levels of correspondence by 
paper mail and fax, and has resulted in a reduction in waste 
and increased efficiency for client-company exchanges. 
In Italy, our distributors can use Web-Bancassurance and 
WebAgenti IT support tools which provide online access to our 
legacy system containing the lifecycle of policies from issuance 
to liquidation. These tools have been extended to all 
intermediaries connected with the main banks and also 
to agents.

At Aviva, the Net Promoter Score

 is our key customer metric. 
This measure is widely regarded as a predictor of future growth, 
with strong correlations to persistency and retention, repeat 
purchase and willingness to recommend. Results to date show 
that advocates are more likely to stay with us and to be more 
profitable over time, suggesting that using this metric to build 
advocacy will have a positive impact on business performance.

Our performance, strategy and targets 
In 2009, we successfully moved to a single global provider of 
our annual relationship and benchmark NPS survey which has 
helped ensure a globally consistent approach to NPS across 
Aviva. Through the Group Remuneration Committee, each 
market is now set improvement targets relative to their local 
benchmark and 10% of our executive directors’ compensation 
is linked to these targets. 
Compared to 2008, we have seen a modest improvement 
in the overall scores, which, given the tough economic climate, 
may be considered a success.

Performance review
Aviva plc Corporate responsibility continued 
Corporate responsibility
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
However, the Net Promoter discipline is about much more than 
simply measuring performance; what counts is how we use the 
data to improve the experience for all our customers and this is 
where we are encouraging businesses to place their attention. 
Through 2010 there will be a number of projects across 
Aviva to further embed the NPS discipline into the way we 
do business. These include using the NPS discipline to capture 
the voice of our distributors as well as Transactional NPS, 
which surveys our customers after they ’touch‘ the business 
to understand and fix immediate operational issues. 
Many of our businesses have already integrated Net 
Promoter into the rhythm of how they do business day-to-day. 
By conducting ’closed loop‘ follow-up calls with ‘detractor’ 
customers, our UK health business was able to better 
understand why their customers were unhappy and take action, 
for example, one follow-up call prevented a formal complaint 
and another, by reducing the customer’s premium, retained 
someone who may otherwise have lapsed. 
In 2009 our Aviva India business began working with their 
‘promoter’ customers to generate sales leads. The sales teams 
followed up with these potential customers to discern their 
needs and offer an appropriate product.

Our measures to understand the key facets of customer

advocacy feed into a broader need in society to establish a more

customer focused approach to insurance. This is a key part of 
the recommendations from the Insurance Industry Working 
Group (IIWG) which was co-chaired by Aviva’s CEO, Andrew 
Moss, and Alistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer. The 
IIWG’s report – ‘Vision for 2020’
3 
– was published in July 2009 
and set out recommendations for its members to increase 
consumer confidence and trust in UK insurance and create 
more awareness of consumers’ personal financial responsibility. 
In turn this would encourage the flow of capital into the UK 
insurance industry and ensure its competitive position in the 
global marketplace. 
Consumer attitudes to saving 
Aviva’s global survey of consumer attitudes to savings has run 
for six years, building up a powerful and valuable body of data 
on a range of topic areas such as attitudes to risk, debt, trust, 
financial services providers and pensions. It has been used in 
product development, PR, strategy and lobbying: 
— Malaysia: won significant media attention with the release 
of selected data revealing that a significant majority of 
Malaysians worry about being under-prepared for their 
financial future. 
— France: taking the insight that French customers are 
increasingly risk averse, we developed a product that would 
allow them to invest gradually in equity markets to smooth 
the risk. 
— Singapore: held successful meetings with the Prime Minister’s 
Office and received acknowledgement for their plans to 
organise a workshop aimed at encouraging and educating 
on wellness and shrinking the gap on long-term care.

Our performance, strategy and targets 
Our global community investment (CI) strategy, focusing 
on financial literacy, education and life trauma, aligns to 
our corporate vision and channels financial support and the 
expertise of our employees into projects where we can see 
positive societal impacts. Our total community investment 
was £1.6 million lower than in 2008. A number of factors 
contributed, including budget constraints across our businesses 
and the sale of Aviva Australia. We also made exceptional cases 
of higher levels of investment in 2008, including our support 
for the victims of the earthquake in Sichaun province in China. 
Despite challenging conditions, employee volunteering is on 
the increase. 16% of employees participated in volunteering 
programmes in 2009, resulting in 79,900 hours of paid 
employee volunteering. Our target for 2010 is to further 
increase the numbers of employees taking up this opportunity. 
Employee attitudes are measured and benchmarked through 
our annual survey, which this year showed that 62% of 
employees believe that we do a good job of supporting 
the communities where we live and work.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Last year we launched ‘Street to School’, our five-year initiative 
to get young people off the streets and into education and 
training. The programme is in operation in the UK, Turkey 
and India and has so far involved various employee fundraising 
activities – including over 70% of employees in both India 
and Turkey participating in a salary donation drive. In India, 
Aviva invited all citizens of Delhi on National Education Day 
in November to join them in building a giant wall made entirely 
of books. The books from the wall will be used to educate 
thousands of underprivileged children supported by Save the 
Children India. Over 125,000 books were donated in five days. 
We aim to roll out ‘Street to School’ in all of our markets from 
2010; a challenge for our businesses is to find viable third sector 
partnerships in both developed and developing markets that we 
operate in. By the end of 2010, our target is to invest 50% of 
our global community investment spend on these projects and 
we are now developing a set of impact targets, addressing the 
numbers of young people that have been positively affected 
by the ‘Street to School’ programme. We will publish these in 
our 2010 report. Also in development are linked cause-related 
marketing (CRM) initiatives which will enable our customers 
to engage in the programme in a number of ways, eg donate 
a percentage of their premiums towards the programme. 
Indirect impacts 
‘Street to School’ is still in its infancy but is already generating 
interest and support from stakeholders including prospective 
charitable partners, media, governments and customers. It has 
also generated unprecedented support from employees who are 
motivating their friends and families to get involved with local 
projects. In 2010, we will continue to raise awareness of the 
issue, and provide more education, funding and practical help 
for children living on the margins of society.

Aviva plc 
Directors’ report Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
The directors submit their annual report and accounts for 
Aviva plc, together with the consolidated financial statements 
of the Aviva Group of companies, for the year ended 
31 December 2009. 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the directors to present a 
“business review” in this Directors’ Report. The information that 
fulfils this requirement can be found in the Performance Review 
on pages 9 to 66, which includes a review of the Group’s 
operations, current position and future prospects, a description 
of the principal activities of the Group, and principal risks and 
uncertainties. This Performance Review, the Corporate 
Governance Report and the Directors’ Remuneration Report are 
incorporated by reference into this Directors’ Report. Details of 
material acquisitions and disposals made by the Group during 
the year are contained in note 3 to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
Results 
The Group results for the year are shown in the consolidated 
income statement on page 143. 
Dividends 
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 15.00 pence 
per ordinary share (2008: 19.91 pence), which, together 
with the interim dividend of 9.00 pence per ordinary share paid 
on 
17 November 2009 (2008: 13.09 pence), produces a total 
dividend for the year of 24.00 pence per ordinary share (2008: 
33.00 pence). The total cost of ordinary dividends paid in 
2009, was £775 million (2008: £902 million). Subject to 
shareholder approval at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the 
final dividend for 2009 will be paid on 17 May 2010 to all 
holders of ordinary shares on the Register of Members at the 
close of business on 26 March 2010 (and approximately five 
business days later for holders of American Depositary Receipts). 
Share capital and control 
The issued ordinary share capital of the Company was increased 
by 108,909,750 ordinary shares during the year. 951,455 shares 
were allotted under the Group’s employee share and incentive 
plans and 107,958,295 shares were allotted under the Aviva 
Scrip Dividend Scheme for the May 2009 and November 2009 
dividends. At 31 December 2009 the issued ordinary share 
capital totalled 2,766,611,374 shares of 25 pence each and the 
issued preference share capital totalled 200 million shares of £1 
each. Accordingly, the issued ordinary share capital constituted 
78% of the Company’s total issued share capital and the issued 
preference share capital constituted 22% of the Company’s 
total issued share capital at 31 December 2009. All the 
Company’s shares are fully paid up and quoted on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange. The Company is listed 
on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of 
American Depositary Shares, referenced to ordinary shares, 
under a depositary agreement with Citibank. Details of the 
Company’s share capital and shares under option at 
31 December 2009 and shares issued during the year are given 
in notes 28 to 31 to the consolidated financial statements. 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares and preference shares as well as the powers of 
the Company’s directors, are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association, copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House and the Company’s website,www.aviva.com, 
or by writing to the Company Secretary.

Other information 
With the exception of restrictions on transfer of ordinary shares 
under the Company’s employee share incentive plans while the 
shares are subject to the rules of the plan, there are no 
restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the Company’s 
ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company. 
Where, under an employee share plan operated by the 
Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares, 
but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally 
exercised at the discretion of the participants. No person holds 
securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to 
control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions in the transfer of securities or voting rights. Unless 
expressly specified to the contrary in the Articles of Association 
of the Company, the Company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by special resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders in general meeting. At the 2010 Annual General 
Meeting shareholders will be asked to adopt new Articles of 
Association and further details can be found in the Notice of 
Meeting accompanying this annual report and accounts. There 
are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, such as commercial 
contracts and joint venture agreements. None is considered to 
be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business 
of the Group as a whole. All of the Company’s employee share 
and incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of 
control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest 
and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro rata 
reduction as may be applicable under the rules of the employee 
share incentive plans. 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, shareholders 
will be asked to renew the directors’ authority to allot shares. 
Details are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on 29 April 
2009, shareholders renewed the Company’s authorities to make 
market purchases of up to 265 million ordinary shares, up to 
100 million 8
3
/4% preference shares and up to 100 million 
8
3
/8% preference shares. These authorities were not used during 
the year. With effect from 1 October 2009, section 725 of the 
Companies Act 2006 was repealed with the effect that the 
Company is no longer subject to a limit of 10% of its total 
issued share capital in respect of the number of its own shares 
that the Company may buy back and hold in treasury. The 
regulation repealing section 725 also extended the validity 
period of the authority given to a company to purchase its own 
shares, from a maximum of 18 months to a maximum of five 
years. The Company will continue to follow guidelines which 
recommend the annual renewal of this authority as a matter 
of best practice for listed companies, unless such guidelines 
change. At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders will be asked to renew this authority for another 
year and the resolution will also retain the 10% maximum 
aggregate number of ordinary shares which the Company 
can purchase. Details are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 
The Company held no treasury shares during the year.

Leslie Van de Walle (appointed 6 May 2009) 
Russell Walls 
Scott Wheway 
The biographical details of the persons currently serving as 
directors appear on pages 80 to 81. 
The Company’s Articles of Association require one-third of 
the directors to retire by rotation each year and also require 
each director to retire at intervals of not more than three years. 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Lord Sharman, the 
Chairman, and Scott Wheway, a non-executive director, will 
retire and, being eligible, will offer themselves for re-election. 
Andrew Moss, the Group Chief Executive will also retire and 
offer himself for re-election. Leslie Van de Walle, Andrea 
Moneta, Michael Hawker and Patrick Regan will offer 
themselves for election by shareholders at this year’s Annual 
General Meeting being the first such meeting after their 
appointment to the Board. Leslie Van de Walle and Michael 
Hawker are non-executive directors and were appointed to the 
Board on 6 May 2009 and 1 January 2010 respectively. Andrea 
Moneta and Patrick Regan are executive directors and have 
service contracts with a Group company, details of which can be 
found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. Wim Dik retired 
from the Board at last year’s Annual General Meeting in line 
with the Board’s plans to renew and refresh its composition, 
while Philip Scott retired from the board on 26 January 2010 
following a 36 year career with the Group, which began with 
Norwich Union. 
Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements 
At no time during the year did any director hold a material 
interest in any contract of significance with the Company or any 
of its subsidiary undertakings other than an indemnity provision 
between each director and the Company and service contracts 
between each executive director and a Group company. The 
Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and 
its directors. The directors also have the benefit of the indemnity 
provision contained in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Company has executed deeds of indemnity for the benefit 
of each director of the Company, and each person who was a 
director of the Company during the year, in respect of liabilities 
that may attach to them in their capacity as directors of the 
Company or of associated companies. These indemnities were 
granted at different times according to the law in place at the 
time and where relevant are qualifying third-party indemnity 
provisions as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 
2006. These indemnities were in force throughout the year and 
are currently in force. Details of directors’ remuneration, service 
contracts and interests in the shares of the Company are set out 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
Financial instruments 
Aviva Group companies use financial instruments to manage 
certain types of risks including those relating to credit, foreign 
currency exchange, cash flow, liquidity, interest rates, and 
equity and property prices. Details of the objectives and 
management of these instruments are contained in the 
Performance Review on pages 9 to 66 and an indication of the 
exposure of the Group companies to such risks is contained in 
note 56 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Health and safety 
The health and safety of the Group’s employees is a priority and 
is reviewed at regular intervals. Each business within the Group 
has an appointed health and safety representative, whose role is 
to bring to the attention of senior management any areas of 
concern that should be addressed within the health and safety 
programme. Information on health and safety matters is 
communicated to staff through the normal communication 
channels. Under the Group’s Health and Safety Policy the Group 
Chief Executive is accountable for health and safety. 
Charitable donations 
The Company has continued to support community initiatives 
and charitable causes worldwide in line with our strategy which 
focuses on education, financial literacy and life trauma. The 
total Group commitment, including cash support and employee 
time during the year was £8.0 million (2008: £9.6 million). 
In 2009, the Group’s community investment in the UK 
totalled £4.4 million (2008: £5.6 million) of which over £1.3 
million (2008: £2.2 million) was given in the form of donations 
and time to charitable organisations. In late 2009 the Company 
launched a new global five-year community initiative – Street to 
School. Aviva’s Street to School programmes will focus on 
partnerships that enable and encourage street children back 
into education and training programmes. The vision for this new 
global commitment is summarised in the Company’s mission 
statement for this project initiative: “We recognise that every 
child living or working on the street has a right to fulfil their 
potential. Together, we will champion the needs of street 
children in the communities in which we live and work.” The 
Company also continues its global partnership with the Oxfam 
365 Alliance which ensures that Oxfam can maintain a state of 
constant preparedness, enabling them to respond immediately 
to emergencies wherever they occur in the world. The Company 
promotes a strong volunteering policy and employees are 
entitled to up to three days annually to support volunteering 
activities. The Company allocates a part of its budget to 
matching contributions to charitable causes raised by staff and 
for providing financial support to charities and communities 
where members of staff give a personal commitment in terms 
of their time.

Political donations 
At the Annual General Meeting held in 2009, shareholders 
passed a resolution, on a precautionary basis, to authorise the 
Company to make political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure (as such terms are defined in sections 362 to 379 of 
the Companies Act 2006) in amounts not exceeding £100,000 
in aggregate. 
The definitions used in the Companies Act 2006 are broad 
in nature and this authority was sought to ensure that any 
activities undertaken throughout the Group’s businesses which 
could otherwise be construed to fall within these provisions 
could be undertaken without inadvertently infringing them. 
During the year, the Company’s American subsidiary, Aviva 
USA, through its employee-funded Political Action Committee, 
made contributions to two different industry bodies, which 
could be construed to fall within the political donations 
provisions. The first contribution was the sum of $2,000 in 
July 2009, to the Federation of Iowa Insurers Political Action 
Committee and the second contribution was the sum of $4,000 
to the American Council of Life Insurers Political Action 
Committee in October 2009. The donations are used to support 
candidates for nomination and/or election to public office. It is 
not the policy of the Company to make donations to EU political 
organisations or to incur other political expenditure. 
As the authority granted at the 2009 Annual General 
Meeting will expire on 28 April 2010, renewal of this authority 
is being sought at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Further 
details are available in the Notice of Meeting. 
Group employees 
The Group’s statement on its employees is set out in the 
Performance Review. 
In summary, the Group’s commitment to communication 
and dialogue with employees continues. The introduction of 
a truly group-wide intranet has enabled, for the first time, 
engagement and communication with employees throughout 
the Group on a single platform. It also helps management to 
share information, ideas and opportunities much faster across 
the entire business. A strong emphasis is placed on the provision 
of news and information through a range of media. Employees 
have opportunities to voice their opinions and ask questions 
through intranet sites, Question and Answer sessions with the 
Group Chief Executive, via telephone conferencing, opinion 
surveys and the Group’s Employee Promise Survey which is open 
to all employees. Face-to-face briefings and team meetings are 
actively encouraged and are held in all business units across the 
Group. The Group’s businesses in the UK have established 
employee consultative forums and a European Consultative 
Forum convenes annually to discuss matters impacting the 
business across Europe. 
The Group ensures that involvement of employees in its 
performance is encouraged by allowing eligible employees to 
participate in the Group’s all employee share ownership plans. 
On 2 June 2009, the Company’s celebrations on becoming 
“One Aviva” saw employees taking part in social and community 
events in every country in which the Group operates. Team 
activities took place in all businesses to welcome the new global 
brand, raise funds for good causes and heighten awareness of 
Aviva’s global commitment to corporate responsibility.

Employee practice 
The Group respects all fundamental human rights and is guided 
in the conduct of its business by the provisions of the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organisation core labour standards. Aviva 
also supports the United Nations Global Compact Principles. 
Aviva Group companies are committed to providing equal 
opportunities to all employees, irrespective of their gender, 
sexual orientation, marital status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, 
disability, age, religion or union membership status. Aviva is an 
inclusive employer and values diversity in its employees. These 
commitments extend to recruitment and selection, training, 
career development, flexible working arrangements, promotion 
and performance appraisal. In the event of employees becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and to provide specialised training 
where this is appropriate. 
Corporate responsibility 
The Group has a well established corporate responsibility 
programme and continues to use its position to influence other 
companies to engage in sustainable business practices and to 
be open and transparent in the information they publicly report. 
In November 2009 the Company announced its intention to 
put its Corporate Responsibility Report to an advisory vote of 
shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting as a means 
of obtaining feedback on the report and the Company’s 
performance in this area. The report is set out on page 68 and 
further details of the resolution are set out in the Notice of 
Meeting. 
Creditor payment policy and practice 
It is the Group’s policy to pay creditors when they fall due for 
payment. Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when 
negotiating each transaction and the policy is to abide by those 
terms, provided that the suppliers also comply with all relevant 
terms and conditions. The Company has no trade creditors. 
In respect of Group activities in the UK, the amounts due to 
trade creditors at 31 December 2009 represented approximately 
23 days of average daily purchases through the year (2008: 
37 days).

The Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
The Company is aware of the changing regulatory environment 
following the recent economic downturn. This has led to the 
review of a number of regulations and corporate governance 
guidelines. The Company will aim to comply fully with any 
resulting regulatory changes and best practice guidelines, where 
it does not already do so. 
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance sets out 
standards of good practice in the form of principles and 
provisions on how companies should be directed and controlled 
to follow good governance practice. The Financial Services 
Authority (FSA) requires companies listed in the UK to disclose, 
in relation to section 1 of the Combined Code, how they have 
applied its principles and whether they have complied with 
its provisions throughout the accounting year. Where the 
provisions have not been complied with companies must 
provide an explanation for this. 
It is the Board’s view that the Company has been fully 
compliant throughout the accounting period with the provisions 
set down in section 1 of the Combined Code, apart from a 
period during the year when the majority of the members of the 
Nomination Committee were not independent non-executive 
directors. This was due to the resignation of Nikesh Arora, a 
non-executive director, who resigned from the Board on 
5 August 2009 following his relocation to the United States 
(US). Mary Francis was appointed to the Committee on 
2 December 2009 and the Company is once again in 
compliance with this aspect of the Combined Code. This report 
sets out details of how the Company has applied the principles 
and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code during 
2009. Further information on the Combined Code can be found 
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website, www.frc.org.uk 
The Board 
The directors are responsible to shareholders for ensuring that 
the Company is appropriately managed and that it achieves its 
objectives. It meets regularly to determine the Company’s 
strategic direction, to review the Company’s operating and 
financial performance and to provide oversight that the 
Company is adequately resourced and effectively controlled. 
The specific duties of the Board are clearly set out in its terms 
of reference that address a wide range of corporate governance 
issues and list those items that are specifically reserved for 
decision by the Board. Matters requiring Board approval include: 
— Group strategy and business plans; 
— Acquisitions, disposals and other transactions outside 
delegated limits; 
— Financial reporting and controls; 
— Capital structure; 
— Dividend policy; 
— Shareholder documentation; 
— The constitution of Board committees; and 
— Key business policies, including the remuneration policy. 
The full terms of reference for the Board are available from the 
Group Company Secretary. Matters that are not specifically 
reserved for the Board and its committees under its terms of 
reference, or for shareholders in general meeting, are delegated 
to the Group Chief Executive. The Board’s terms of reference 
also set out those matters that must be reported to the Board, 
such as significant litigation or material regulatory breaches, and 
cover how matters requiring consideration by the Board that 
arise between scheduled meetings should be dealt with. 
The Board and its committees operate in line with work 
plans agreed prior to the start of each year. At Board and 
committee meetings, directors receive regular reports on the 
Group’s financial position, risk management, regulatory 
compliance, key business operations and other material issues. 
Directors are fully briefed in advance of Board and committee 
meetings on all matters to be discussed. The Group Company 
Secretary is responsible for following Board procedures and 
advising the Board, through the Chairman, on governance 
matters. All directors have access to his advice and services. 
The Board has adopted a procedure whereby directors 
may, in the performance of their duties, seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense if considered 
appropriate. During the year the members of the Remuneration 
Committee sought independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge 
Street Consultants on issues surrounding senior executive 
remuneration. The Audit Committee and the Risk and 
Regulatory Committee also appointed Keith Nicholson, a former 
partner at KPMG LLP, to provide advisory services. 
The Directors 
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, eight independent 
non-executive directors and four executive directors. Each non-
executive director serves for a fixed term not exceeding three 
years that may be renewed by mutual agreement. Subject to 
the Board being satisfied with a director’s performance, 
independence and commitment, there is no specified limit 
regarding the number of terms a director may serve. Each 
director is required to be elected by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting following his/her appointment by the Board 
and to be re-elected at least once every three years. Any non-
executive director who has served on the Board for nine years 
or more is required to submit himself/herself for re-election 
annually. The Board’s policy is to appoint and retain non-
executive directors, who can apply their wider knowledge and 
experiences to their understanding of the Aviva Group, and to 
review and refresh regularly the skills and experience the Board 
requires through a programme of rotational retirement. In 
addition to the strengths of experience, diversity and an 
international perspective, the Board also seeks to comply with 
the requirements of the Combined Code on the independence 
of directors. The process for appointing new directors is 
conducted by the Nomination Committee whose report, 
including a description of its duties, is set out on page 93. 
The Combined Code requires that at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent non-
executive directors as determined by the Board. The Nomination 
Committee performs an annual review of directors’ interests in 
which all potential or perceived conflicts, including time 
commitments, length of service and other issues relevant to 
their independence, are considered. It is the Board’s view that 
an independent non-executive director also needs to be able to 
present an objective, rigorous and constructive challenge to 
management, drawing on his/her wider experiences to question 
assumptions and viewpoints and where necessary defend their 
beliefs. To be effective, an independent director needs to 
acquire a sound understanding of the industry and the 
Company so as to be able to evaluate properly the information 
provided. Having considered the matter carefully the Board is of 
the opinion that all of the current non-executive directors are 
independent and free from any relationship or circumstances 
that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent 
judgement. Accordingly, over half of the Board members, 
excluding the Chairman, are independent non-executive 
directors. Each of the directors being proposed for re-election at 
the 2010 Annual General Meeting has been subject to a formal 
performance evaluation and took part in a peer evaluation

review during 2009. Details of the directors standing for re­
election at this year’s Annual General Meeting are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting. Biographical details of all the directors are 
set out on pages 80 to 81. 
The Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
The respective roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
are set out in the Board’s terms of reference. The Chairman’s 
priority is the leadership of the Board and the Group Chief 
Executive’s priority is the management of the Company. The 
Chairman’s commitment to the Company is two to three days 
per week and his main interests outside the Company are set 
out in his biographical details on page 80. 
Senior Independent Director 
Under the Combined Code the Board appoints one of the non-
executive directors to act as Senior Independent Director. The 
main responsibility of the Senior Independent Director is to be 
available to shareholders should they have concerns that they 
have been unable to resolve through normal channels, or when 
such channels would be inappropriate. The Senior Independent 
Director is also responsible for leading the Board’s discussion on 
the Chairman’s performance and the appointment of a new 
chairman, when appropriate. Richard Goeltz has served as the 
Senior Independent Director since January 2009. 
Board effectiveness 
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the 
Group and the Company undertakes a rigorous evaluation 
each year in order to assess how well the Board, its committees, 
the directors and the Chairman are performing. The aim is to 
improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees and 
the Group’s performance. The process is led by the Chairman 
and supported by the Group Company Secretary. This year the 
evaluation was carried out by Boardroom Review, an 
independent consultancy, and interviews were conducted with 
each Board member. All directors also completed a 
questionnaire evaluating the Board and committees’ processes, 
their effectiveness and where improvements may be considered. 
Boardroom Review prepared a report based on the interviews 
with the directors and the questionnaire circulated and the 
overall results of the evaluation were presented to and reviewed 
by the Board in January 2010. 
The performance of the Chairman is also included in the 
above process and takes into account the views of both the 
executive and non-executive directors. The Chairman’s 
evaluation is managed by the Senior Independent Director who 
provides feedback to the Chairman. As part of the Chairman’s 
evaluation the non-executive directors meet separately under 
the chairmanship of the Senior Independent Director. The Board 
evaluation process assesses the executive directors in their 
capacities as directors of the Company. They are evaluated in 
respect of their executive duties through a separate process 
whereby the Chairman and the non-executive directors assess 
the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Executive 
assesses the executive directors. 
Following this comprehensive review, the directors have 
concluded that the Board and its committees operate effectively 
and have agreed actions in respect of certain processes 
identified for improvement. Additionally, the Chairman has 
concluded that each director contributes effectively and 
demonstrates full commitment to his/her duties. 
Training and development 
The Board believes strongly in the development of all its 
employees and directors and it is a requirement of each 
director’s appointment that they commit to continue their 
development. The form that this development takes is subject 
to individual director’s requirements and the quality and 
relevance of the training available. 
During the year, directors attended a number of internal 
and external courses including an update on the macro­ economic outlook at a Board strategy session, and seminars on 
life accounting and Solvency II for members of the Audit and 
Risk and Regulatory Committees. New members of the 
Corporate Responsibility Committee had an induction on the 
Company’s Corporate Responsibility Programme and two 
members of the Committee participated in a Climate Change 
forum in Hong Kong. Training sessions have also been built into 
the Board’s and committees’ work plans for 2010. The Board 
made visits to the Group’s businesses located in the UK, 
Singapore, Korea and China during the year to gain a closer 
understanding of their operations. 
The Board has a comprehensive induction programme 
consisting of several separate sessions which take place over 
a number of months at times convenient for the director. 
The sessions include presentations from key members of senior 
management, visits to the Group’s main operating businesses, 
and meetings with the external auditor and one of the 
Company’s corporate brokers. Further or follow-up meetings 
are arranged where a director requires a deeper understanding 
on a particular issue. 
Directors’ attendance 
The Company requires directors to attend all meetings of the 
Board and the committees on which they serve and to devote 
sufficient time to the Company in order to perform their duties. 
The attendance of the directors at the Board and committee 
meetings held in 2009 was as follows:

Other information 
During 2009, the Chairman and the non-executive directors met 
in the absence of the executive directors and the non-executive 
directors met in the absence of the Chairman, including one 
meeting chaired by the Senior Independent Director in order 
to appraise the Chairman’s performance. 
Board committees 
The Board has established the following standing committees 
to oversee and debate important issues of policy and oversight 
outside the main Board meetings: 
— Audit Committee; 
— Corporate Responsibility Committee; 
— Nomination Committee; 
— Risk and Regulatory Committee; and 
— Remuneration Committee. 
Throughout the year the chairman of each committee provided 
the Board with a summary of the key issues considered at the 
meetings of the committees and the minutes of the meetings 
were circulated to the Board. The committees operate within 
defined terms of reference which are available on the 
Company’s website, www.aviva.com, or from the Group 
Company Secretary upon request. Board committees are 
authorised to engage the services of external advisers as they 
deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the 
Company’s expense. 
Reports of the committee chairmen are set out on pages 93 
to 116. 
Conflicts of interest 
In line with the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s Articles of 
Association now allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts 
of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or 
conditions as it thinks fit. The decision to authorise a conflict of 
interest can only be made by non-conflicted directors (those 
who have no interest in the matter being considered) and in 
making such decision the directors must act in a way they 
consider in good faith will be most likely to promote the 
Company’s success. The Board has established a procedure 
whereby actual and potential conflicts of interest are regularly 
reviewed and for the appropriate authorisation to be sought 
prior to the appointment of any new director or if a new conflict 
arises. During 2009 this procedure operated effectively. 
Internal Control 
A company’s system of internal control plays a key role in the 
management of risks that may impact the fulfilment of its 
objectives. Internal control facilitates effective and efficient 
operations, the development of robust and reliable internal and 
external reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. 
A system of internal control reduces but cannot eliminate 
the possibility of errors, control circumvention, manual override, 
poor decision making or the impact of unforeseen 
circumstances. As such, a sound system of internal control 
provides reasonable but not absolute assurance over material 
misstatements or losses or that a company will not be hindered 
in achieving its business objectives. 
As part of the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code’, the 
Board should ‘maintain a sound system of internal control to 
safeguard shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets’. 
In addition, as part of their responsibilities 'The Directors should, 
at least annually, conduct a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group's system of internal control and should report to 
shareholders that they have done so. The review should cover all 
material controls, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems'. 
The Board has overall responsibility for maintaining the 
system of internal control for the Group and monitoring its 
effectiveness. During the year, the Audit Committee, with the 
Risk and Regulatory Committee, on behalf of the Board, have 
regularly review the effectiveness of the Group's system of 
internal control. The necessary actions have been and are being 
taken to remedy significant failings and weaknesses identified 
from these reviews. The Audit Committee and the Risk and 
Regulatory Committee monitor resolution of any weaknesses to 
a satisfactory conclusion. In addition, the Company meets the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002) 
requirements for new registrants. 
The principal features of the system of internal control and 
methods by which the Board satisfies itself that this system 
operates effectively are set out below. 
Control environment 
The Group operates a ‘three lines of defence’ model with 
management as the first line, having overall accountabilty for 
the management of all risks relevant to the Group’s business. 
Management is therefore responsible for designing, 
implementing and monitoring the operation of the system of 
internal control and for providing assurance to the Executive 
Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Risk and Regulatory 
Committee, as relevant, that it has done so. 
The Group Risk and Compliance functions operate as the 
second line of defence and are accountable for providing objective 
challenge and oversight of the business’ management of all risk 
through the system of internal control. The functions operate 
globally with teams in all major regions and business units. 
Group Audit operates as the third line of defence and is 
accountable for providing reliable independent assurance to the 
Audit and Risk and Regulatory Committees, local audit 
committees, Board members and the Executive Committee of 
the Group on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of 
internal control. 
Governance and Oversight Committee Structure 
The Board delegates oversight in relation to risk management 
and internal control to the following committees: 
— Audit Committee; and 
— Risk and Regulatory Committee 
The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board 
in discharging its responsibilities for the integrity of the 
Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of 
the system of internal financial control and monitoring the 
effectiveness, performance and objectivity of the internal 
and external auditors. 
The Risk and Regulatory Committee, working closely with 
the Audit Committee, assists the Board in providing direction 
and oversight around the Group’s risk and regulatory policies 
and procedures, including those relating to compliance, risk 
management, financial malpractice and internal controls. 
These Committees have clearly defined terms of reference 
and full reports for these Committees are set out on pages 
94 to 97. 
Oversight of the risk management framework and system 
of internal control is performed on behalf of the Board by the 
Risk and Regulatory Committee working with the Audit 
Committee. These Committees receive reporting over risk 
management and internal control procedures and consider 
where relevant whether appropriate actions have been 
Governance

Aviva plc Corporate governance report continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
undertaken as well as monitoring the completion of any Group 
level actions to a satisfactory conclusion. 
Control activities 
A formal policy framework has been rolled out across the 
Group, which sets out and governs minimum standards around 
the management of financial and non-financial risks and the 
Group’s approach to internal controls. 
Compliance with the policy framework is regularly assessed 
and reported upon on a quarterly basis. Such reporting includes 
any moves outside the Group’s risk appetite and tolerance and 
any emerging issues. Appropriate action plans are developed 
and undertaken where such moves are identified. 
In addition to the regular reporting, a six monthly Group 
policy framework compliance management certification process 
is in place. Any risks, control weaknesses, or non-compliance 
with the Group policy framework or local delegation of 
authority must be highlighted as part of this process. 
Internal Controls over financial reporting 
A Group Reporting Manual including International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Market Consistent Embedded 
Value (MCEV) requirements has been defined and rolled out 
across the Group. A Financial Reporting Control Framework 
(FRCF) is in place across the Group. FRCF relates to the 
preparation of reliable financial reporting and preparation of 
local and consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
IFRS and MCEV. FRCF also allows compliance with the 
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. 
The FRCF process follows a risk based approach, with 
management identification, assessment (documentation and 
testing), remediation as required, reporting and certification 
over key financial reporting related controls. Management 
quality assurance procedures over the application of the FRCF 
process and FRCF controls are undertaken regularly. The results 
of the FRCF process are signed off by business unit and regional 
Chief Executives and Chief Financial Officers and at a Group 
level by the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer. 
The Disclosure Committee, which has the role of overseeing 
the design and effectiveness of the Group’s disclosure controls, 
for both financial and non-financial information, evaluates the 
Group’s disclosure controls and reviews and endorses the 
Group’s key periodic external reports including the consolidated 
financial statements. This Committee is chaired by the Chief 
Financial Officer and reports to the Audit Committee and 
Executive Committee. A Group Technical Committee, reporting 
to the Disclosure Committee is in place, which presides over 
significant technical matters, reviewing technical decisions 
including key judgements, issues and application of 
assumptions. 
Risk Management 
An Enterprise wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), 
designed to identify, evaluate, manage and monitor significant 
risks to the achievement of business objectives is in place and 
embedded throughout the Group. The Group Risk function 
facilitates the implementation of the risk management 
framework, with management owning the management and 
monitoring of risks. The Group Risk function assesses and 
reports significant risks identified across the Group and 
corresponding action plans to the Executive Committee, 
the Risk and Regulatory Committee and Audit Committee. 
A company's objectives, its internal organisation and the 
environment in which it operates are continually evolving and, 
as a result, the risks it faces are continually changing. 
Management in conjunction with the Group Risk function 
monitors the risk profile of business units, regions and the 
Group on a regular basis. On a quarterly basis, risk reports, 
setting the risk profiles, risk exposures outside Group risk 
appetite and action plans within financial, operational, 
compliance and strategic risk categories, are reported by the 
Group risk function. A consolidated Group wide risk profile 
including residual risk levels and action plans are considered 
by the Executive Committee and the Risk and Regulatory 
Committee. Regional executive committees and management 
receive and similarly consider local risk reporting. 
Where significant risks outside Group risk appetite are identified 
an immediate escalation process is in place. Such significant 
risks are reported by the Chief Risk Officer to the Executive 
Committee, the Risk and Regulatory Committee and Audit 
Committee, along with any proposed mitigating actions. 
The risk management process has been in place for the year 
under review and up to the date of approval of the annual 
report and accounts. 
Internal audit 
The Group’s internal audit function provides independent 
assurance to management on the effectiveness of the internal 
control systems and, the adequacy of these systems to manage 
business risk and to safeguard the Group’s assets and resources. 
The internal audit function also provides objective independent 
assurance on risk and control to both the Audit Committee and 
the Risk and Regulatory Committee. 
Throughout 2009, the internal audit function through the 
Chief Audit Officer provided quarterly reporting on issues arising 
and the status of action items to the Audit Committee and Risk 
and Regulatory Committee. Similar reporting is undertaken on a 
regional and business unit basis to local executive management 
and local audit committees. The effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function is reviewed annually by the Audit 
Committee. 
Share capital and control 
The information required to be provided by the directors 
pursuant to section 992 of the Companies Act 2006 can be 
found on page 83 of the Directors’ report. 
Communication with shareholders 
The Company places considerable importance on 
communication with shareholders and engages with them on 
a wide range of issues. 
The Group has an ongoing programme of dialogue and 
meetings between the executive directors and institutional 
investors, fund managers and analysts. At these meetings a 
wide range of relevant issues including strategy, performance, 
management and governance are discussed within the 
constraints of information already made public. 
The Company’s investor relations department is dedicated 
to facilitating communication with institutional investors. 
The directors consider it important to understand the views of 
shareholders and, in particular, any issues which concern them. 
The Board receives reports on matters that have been raised 
with management at the regular meetings held with the 
Company’s major investors. During the year the Chairman and 
the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with the major 
institutional investors and attended investor meetings with 
management. In addition, the Senior Independent Director is 
available to meet with major investors to discuss any areas of 
concern that cannot be resolved through normal channels of 
investor communication, and arrangements can be made to

meet with the Senior Independent Director through the Group 
Company Secretary. Similarly, arrangements can be made for 
major investors to meet with newly appointed directors. In 
addition, the Board consults with shareholders in connection 
with specific issues where it considers appropriate. 
The Board is equally interested in the concerns of private 
shareholders and, on its behalf, the Group Company Secretary 
oversees communication with this group of investors. The 
Company has provided a dedicated email address to which 
questions can be sent, in addition to the facility on the 
Company’s website and a freepost address, which are all 
highlighted in the shareholder information section of the Notice 
of Meeting. These can be used by shareholders to put relevant 
questions to the directors. These are considered to be 
particularly helpful for those shareholders who are unable to 
attend the meeting. Written responses are provided through a 
brochure containing answers to the most frequently asked 
questions, which is also placed on the Company’s website, 
www.aviva.com/agm. All material information reported to the 
regulatory news service is simultaneously published on the 
Company’s website, affording all shareholders full access to 
Company announcements. 
The Company has taken full advantage of the provisions 
within the Companies Act 2006 allowing communications to 
be made electronically to shareholders where they have not 
requested hard copy documentation. As a result, the Company’s 
website has become the primary method of communication for 
the majority of its shareholders. Details of the information 
available for shareholders on the website can be found in 
shareholder information on pages 323 to 324 and the 
Shareholder Services section of the website at 
www.aviva.com/investor-relations. 
The Company’s Annual General Meeting provides a 
valuable opportunity for the Board to communicate with private 
shareholders. At the meeting, the Company complies with the 
Combined Code as it relates to voting, the separation of 
resolutions and the attendance of Board committee chairmen. 
Whenever possible, all directors attend the Annual General 
Meeting and shareholders are invited to ask questions during 
the meeting and have an opportunity to meet with the directors 
following the conclusion of the formal part of the meeting. 
The Company will also ensure that it continues to provide 
shareholders with the right to ask questions at meetings, which 
will ensure compliance with the recently enacted Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009. In line with the 
Combined Code, details of proxy voting by shareholders, 
including votes withheld, are made available on request and are 
placed on the Company’s website following the meeting. 
The Company’s annual report and accounts and annual 
review, together with the Company’s half-year report, interim 
management statements, 20F document (for filings with the 
United States Securities and Exchange Commission) (SEC) and 
other public announcements, are designed to present a 
balanced and understandable view of the Group’s activities 
and prospects and are available on the Company’s website, 
www.aviva.com. The Chairman’s statement, Group Chief 
Executive’s review, and Performance Review provide an 
assessment of the Group’s affairs and they will be supported 
by a presentation to be made at the Annual General Meeting. 
Shareholder Tracing Programmes 
During the year, the Company undertook three shareholder 
tracing programmes in order to identify and locate shareholders 
with unclaimed payments. The exercises were conducted by 
professional tracing agencies on behalf of the Company and 
two subsidiaries, General Accident plc and RAC plc. The 
exercises, which were largely successful, related to shareholders 
who have had dividend payments returned and unclaimed, and 
dissentient shareholders who did not accept takeover offers 
when the Company acquired the subsidiaries. 
As at 31 December 2009 the response rate across all three 
programmes ranged between 19% and 58%. 
Aviva Investors 
Aviva Investors, the Group’s core asset management company, 
believes that good governance plays an important role in 
protecting and enhancing shareholder value. In keeping with 
the Group’s values, Aviva Investors looks to act as a responsible 
investor, monitors the governance of the companies in which 
it invests and seeks to maintain an effective dialogue and 
engagement with companies on matters which may affect the 
future performance of those companies. 
Aviva Investors maintains a detailed Corporate Governance 
and Voting Policy as part of its investment strategy, which 
underpins its approach to engaging and voting at company 
general meetings. The policy encompasses social, environmental 
and ethical issues and is applied pragmatically after careful 
consideration of all relevant information. In addition, Aviva 
Investors makes detailed voting reports available to clients, as 
well as providing some summary reporting on its website, 
www.avivainvestors.com. 
US Listing requirements 
The Company was admitted to the NYSE on 20 October 2009 
and its ordinary shares are traded as American Depositary 
Shares. As a foreign company listed on the NYSE, the Company 
is required to comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules 
to the extent that these rules apply to foreign private issuers 
such as the Company. As a foreign private issuer, the Company 
is therefore required to comply with NYSE Rule 303A.11 by 
making a disclosure of the differences between the Company’s 
corporate governance practices and the NYSE corporate 
governance rules applicable to US companies listed on the 
NYSE. These differences are summarised below: 
Independence criteria for directors 
Under NYSE listing rules applicable to US companies, 
independent directors must form the majority of the board of 
directors. The Combined Code requires that at least half the 
Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent 
non-executive directors, as determined by the Board. The NYSE 
listing rules for US companies also state that a director cannot 
qualify as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines 
that the director has no material relationship with the company, 
and the NYSE rules prescribe a list of specific factors and tests 
that US companies must use for determining independence. 
The Combined Code sets out its own criteria that may be 
relevant to the independence determination, but permits the 
Board to conclude affirmative independence notwithstanding 
the existence of relationships or circumstances which may 
appear relevant to its determination, so long as it shall state 
its reasons. 
Non-Executive Director Meetings 
Pursuant to NYSE listing standards, the non-management 
directors of each listed company must meet at regularly 
scheduled executive sessions without management and, if that 
group includes directors who are not independent, listed 
companies should at least once a year schedule an executive 
session including only independent directors. Under the 
Governance   
 
 
92 
Aviva plc Corporate governance report continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Combined Code, the Chairman and non-executive directors 
must meet separately to assess the executive directors. 
Committees 
Under NYSE standards, US companies are required to have a 
nominating/corporate governance committee. In addition to 
identifying individuals qualified to become Board members, this 
committee must develop and recommend to the Board a set of 
corporate governance principles. The Company’s Nomination 
Committee’s terms of reference do not require the Committee 
to develop and recommend corporate governance principles for 
the Company. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
NYSE listing standards require US companies to adopt and 
disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, 
officers and employees, and promptly disclose any waivers of 
the code for directors or executive officers. While the Company 
does not strictly follow this NYSE standard applicable to US 
companies, it is committed to ensuring that its business is 
conducted in all respects according to rigorous ethical, 
professional and legal standards. The Company has adopted 
a Business Ethics Code to which all employees are bound and 
a Code of Ethics for Senior Management to comply with the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. 
Shareholder Approval of Equity-Compensation Plans 
Under the NYSE listing standards, shareholders must be given 
the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and 
“material revisions” to those plans. Under the Combined Code, 
shareholder approval is also necessary for certain equity-
compensation plans and “significant changes” thereto, subject 
to certain exceptions. The Combined Code does not provide a 
detailed definition or explanation of what are considered to be 
“significant changes”, in contrast to the detailed definition of 
“material revisions” provided by the NYSE. 
Directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are required to prepare accounts for each 
accounting period that comply with the relevant provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and 
which present fairly the financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows of the Company and the Group at the end of 
the accounting period. A fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS requires the directors to: 
— select suitable accounting policies and verify that they are 
applied consistently in preparing the accounts, on a going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Company and the Group will continue in business; 
— present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that is relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable; 
— provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Company and the Group’s 
financial position and financial performance; and 
— state that the Company and the Group have complied with 
applicable IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements. 
The directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting 
records, which are intended to disclose with reasonable 
accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Company 
and the Group. They are also ultimately responsible for the 
systems of internal control maintained by the Group for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Further details of the systems of internal controls maintained by 
the Group are more fully described on pages 89 and 90. 
Directors’ responsibility statement pursuant to the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4 
The directors confirm that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge: 
(a) the Group and Company financial statements in this report, 
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the EU, International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee’s interpretation and those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and results of the Company and of the 
Group taken as a whole; and 
(b) the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
By order of the Board

Group Chief Executive Chief Financial Officer

Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Overview on pages 2 to 8 and the Performance 
Review on pages 9 to 66. The Performance Review includes 
sections on Group Performance (pages 10 to 56), Capital 
Management (pages 61 to 63) and Risk Management (pages 56 
to 59. In addition, the financial pages include notes on the 
Group’s borrowings (note 48); its contingent liabilities and other 
risk factors (note 51); its capital structure and position (notes 54 
and 55); management of its risks including market, credit and 
liquidity risk (note 56); and derivative financial instruments 
(note 57). 
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with a diversified business model, with a spread of business and 
geographical reach. As a consequence, the directors believe that 
the Group is well placed to manage its business risks 
successfully. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Other information 
This report provides details of the role of the Nomination 
Committee and the work it has undertaken during the year. 
The main purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board 
by keeping the composition of the Board under review and 
conducting a rigorous and transparent process when making 
or renewing appointments of directors to the Board. It also 
advises the Board on issues of directors’ conflicts of interest and 
independence. The full terms of reference for the Committee 
can be found on the Company’s website, www.aviva.com, and 
are also available from the Group Company Secretary. 
The following directors served on the Committee during 
the year:

* 	 The Nomination Committee notes that the Combined Code does not preclude the Group 
Chief Executive from membership of the Committee and the Committee believes that his 
input is essential and invaluable in its discussions and therefore important that this is obtained 
through his membership of the Committee. Any concern about this will be allayed by the 
predominant membership of independent non-executive directors on the Committee. 
The Committee met on six occasions in 2009 and the members’ 
attendance record is set out in the Corporate Governance report 
on page 88. Nikesh Arora ceased to be a member of the 
Committee on 5 August 2009 following his resignation from 
the Board due to his relocation to the US. The Group Company 
Secretary acts as the secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee keeps under review the balance of skills 
on the Board and the knowledge, experience, length of service 
and performance of the directors. It also reviews their external 
interests with a view to identifying any actual, perceived or 
potential conflicts of interests, including the time available to 
commit to their duties to the Company. The Committee 
monitors the independence of each non-executive director and 
makes recommendations concerning such to the Board. The 
results of these reviews are important when the Board considers 
succession planning and the re-election of directors. Members 
of the Committee take no part in any discussions concerning 
their own circumstances. During 2009 the Committee reviewed 
the senior management pool to identify potential Executive 
Committee members. 
During the year, the Board accepted the Committee’s 
recommendations that Andrea Moneta, Patrick Regan, Michael 
Hawker and Leslie Van de Walle join the Board. Andrea Moneta 
and Patrick Regan were appointed as executive directors of the 
Board, with Patrick Regan replacing Philip Scott as Chief 
Financial Officer and Andrea Moneta’s appointment increasing 
the number of executive directors to four. Leslie Van de Walle 
was appointed as a new non-executive director from 6 May 
2009 and Michael Hawker’s appointment as a non-executive 
director took effect from 1 January 2010. In respect of Mr Van 
de Walle’s and Mr Hawker’s appointments, the Committee 
engaged a search agency to help it identify suitable candidates 
with the skills and capabilities required and to assist with the 
preparation of an interview list. 
In line with the Combined Code requirement, the Board 
undertook a review of the effectiveness of all its committees 
during the year, including the Nomination Committee. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 
3 March 2010.

Audit committee report Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
This report provides details of the role of the Audit Committee 
and the work it has undertaken during the year. The purpose 
of the Committee is to assist the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities for the integrity of the Group and Company’s 
financial statements, the assessment of the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal financial controls and monitoring the 
effectiveness and objectivity of the internal and external 
auditors. The full terms of reference for the Committee can be 
found on the Company’s website, www.aviva.com, and are also 
available from the Group Company Secretary. 
The following independent non-executive directors, served 
on the Committee during the year: 
Period 
Member From To 
Russell Walls (Chairman) 1 July 2004 To date 
Mary Francis 1 January 2007 To date 
Richard Goeltz 1 July 2004 To date 
Euleen Goh 1 January 2009 To date 
The Committee met on nine occasions in 2009 and the 
members’ attendance record is set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 88. In addition, the Committee held 
separate meetings with members of senior management for the 
purpose of induction and training. The Group Company 
Secretary acts as the secretary to the Committee. 
Russell Walls, a Fellow Chartered Certified Accountant, is 
a former group finance director of BAA plc, Wellcome plc and 
Coats Viyella plc. Richard Goeltz is a former chief financial 
officer of American Express Company and NatWest Group plc 
and a former member of the Accounting Standards Board. 
Euleen Goh, a Chartered Accountant and member of the 
Chartered Institute of Taxation, is a former financial controller of 
Pontiac Land and chief executive of Standard Chartered Bank, 
Singapore. The Board is satisfied that these directors have recent 
and relevant financial experience. The Group Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Accounting 
Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the external auditor normally 
attend, by invitation, all meetings of the Committee. Other 
members of senior management are also invited to attend as 
appropriate to present reports. In performing its duties, the 
Committee has access to the services of the Chief Audit Officer, 
the Group Company Secretary and external professional 
advisers. During 2009 the Committee appointed Keith 
Nicholson, a former partner at KPMG LLP, as an external adviser 
to the Committee. 
The Committee follows an agreed annual work plan. It 
reviews, with members of management and the internal and 
external auditors, the Company’s financial announcements 
including the annual report and accounts to shareholders and 
associated documentation. It places particular emphasis on their 
fair presentation and the reasonableness of the judgemental 
factors and appropriateness of significant accounting policies 
used in their preparation. At each meeting, the Committee 
receives a report from the Chief Audit Officer concerning the 
Company’s systems of internal financial control, including any 
significant new issues and actions taken on previously reported 
issues. The Committee also reviews, approves and monitors 
the annual work plan for the Group’s internal audit function. 
Twice each year, the Committee receives reports on the 
adequacy of the Group’s life assurance and general insurance 
reserves. The Committee reports to the Board regarding the 
effectiveness of the Group’s overall systems of internal 
financial control including the risk management systems in 
relation to the financial reporting process. The Committee 
works closely with the Risk and Regulatory Committee, which 
reviews the Company’s overall internal controls and risk 
management systems. 
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor 
and, at all scheduled meetings, holds discussions with both the 
Chief Audit Officer and external auditors in the absence of 
management. The chairman of the Committee reports to the 
subsequent meeting of the Board on the Committee’s work and 
the Board receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting of 
the Committee. 
During the year, the Committee was integrally involved in 
the SEC registration and NYSE listing of the Company and 
received regular updates on progress of the project. The 
Committee reviewed and approved the registration document 
and the Company’s financial reporting control framework 
was developed to ensure compliance with the United States 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. This included ensuring all the risks 
associated with the project were understood and within 
risk appetite. 
The Committee held two joint meetings with the Risk and 
Regulatory Committee and one with the members of the 
business unit audit committees in the Asia Pacific region. 
This meeting allowed the Committee to gain a deeper 
understanding of the relevant local issues and assess the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal financial controls and 
the effectiveness and objectivity of the internal and external 
auditors in those businesses. 
Each of the Group’s major business units has an audit 
committee that provides an oversight role for its business. 
The Chief Audit Officer reviews the papers and minutes from 
these committees and brings all significant matters to the 
Committee’s attention. The Chief Audit Officer also attends 
local audit committee meetings on a regular basis and reports 
back on the effectiveness of these local committees to the 
Committee. In addition, during 2009 the members of the 
Committee attended several local audit committee meetings, 
including those in Aviva USA, Aviva UK Life, Aviva UKGI, Aviva 
Investors and the Europe Region Oversight Committee. This 
programme of attendance at local audit committee meetings 
will continue during 2010. 
Internal audit 
The Group’s internal audit function reports to management on 
the effectiveness of the Company’s systems of internal controls, 
the adequacy of these systems to manage business risk and to 
safeguard the Group’s assets and resources. The internal audit 
function is fully centralised and each country/region head has a 
full reporting line to the Chief Audit Officer (with the exception 
of Delta Lloyd). The Chief Audit Officer reports to the Group 
Chief Executive and to the chairman of the Group Audit 
Committee. Through the Chief Audit Officer, the internal audit 
function provides objective assurance on risks and controls to 
the Committee. The plans, the level of resources, the budget of 
the internal audit function and the remuneration of the Chief 
Audit Officer are reviewed and approved at least annually by 
the Committee, which also undertakes an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function against 
guidance criteria provided by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in England and Wales and by the Institute of 
Internal Auditors (IIA). Every five years the review is performed 
by an independent party as required by the IIA standards. 
The last independent review was performed in 2008. 
The continuing deteriorating economic and market 
environment required even greater attention to internal controls 
in 2009. During 2009 the Group internal audit function carried 
out assurance reviews of the Group’s capital and liquidity

business as usual activities. 
External auditor 
Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young) was appointed auditor of 
the Company in 2001 having previously been the auditor of 
Norwich Union plc. Following the annual external audit 
effectiveness review, the Committee concluded that the audit 
service was fit for purpose and recommended that a re-tender 
process should not be undertaken in 2009 but that the 
relationship and the effectiveness of the auditor be kept 
under review. Ernst & Young audits all significant subsidiaries 
of the Group. 
The Company introduced a revised external auditor policy 
on 1 January 2008 aimed at safeguarding and supporting the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors. The policy 
was updated to reflect current global best practice on auditor 
independence, and is in full compliance with all UK, US and 
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) rules. The revised 
external auditor policy aims to be simpler to interpret, providing 
greater clarity on what services may and may not be provided by 
the Group’s external auditors. 
The external auditor policy regulates the appointment of 
former audit employees to senior finance positions in the Group 
and sets out the approach to be taken by the Group when using 
the services of the external auditor, including requiring that all 
services provided by the external auditor are pre-approved by 
the Committee. It distinguishes between those services where 
an independent view is required and that should be performed 
by the external auditor (such as statutory and non-statutory 
audit and assurance work), prohibited services where the 
independence of the external auditor could be threatened and 
they must not be used, and other non-audit services where the 
external auditor may be used. Non-audit services where the 
external auditor may be used include: non-recurring internal 
controls and risk management reviews (ie excluding outsourcing 
of internal audit work), advice on financial reporting and 
regulatory matters, due diligence on acquisitions and disposals, 
project assurance and advice, tax compliance services, and 
employee tax services. The Committee receives a quarterly report 
of compliance against the external auditor policy and the policy 
has worked effectively during 2009. 
Annually, the Committee reviews a formal letter provided 
by the external auditor confirming its independence and 
objectivity within the context of applicable regulatory 
requirements and professional standards. 
The Group paid £15.0 million to Ernst & Young for audit 
services in 2009, relating to the statutory audit of the 
Group and Company financial statements and the audit 
of Group subsidiaries and associates pursuant to legislation 
(2008: £12.1 million). The fees for other services, which 
included advice on accounting and regulatory matters, reporting 
on internal controls, corporate governance matters, and due 
diligence work, were £19.0 million, giving a total fee to Ernst & 
Young of £34.0 million (2008: £25.0 million). Further details are 
provided in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 
In addition, the Group engaged the organisation Corporate 
Citizenship in relation to certain assurance work, including 
verification of its Corporate Responsibility Report. 
During the year, the Committee performed its annual review of 
the independence, effectiveness and objectivity of the external 
auditor, assessing the audit firm, the audit partner and audit 
teams. The process was conducted by means of a questionnaire, 
completed Group-wide by members of senior management 
and members of the Group’s finance community and the 
Committee. The questionnaire sought opinions on the 
importance of certain criteria and the performance of the 
external auditor against those criteria. Based on this review, 
the Committee concluded that the audit service of Ernst & 
Young was fit for purpose and provided a robust overall 
examination of the Group’s business and the risks involved. 
In line with the Combined Code requirement, the Board 
undertook a review of the effectiveness of all its committees 
during the year, including the Audit Committee. In addition, the 
Committee also carried out a self-evaluation of its effectiveness. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 
3 March 2010.

Michael Hawker was appointed to the Committee on 1 January 
2010. The Committee met on six occasions in 2009 and the 
members’ attendance record is set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 88. In addition the Committee held 
separate meetings with members of senior management and 
Ernst & Young for the purposes of induction and training. The 
Group Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the 
Committee. 
The Group Chief Executive, Chief Risk Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, Chief Audit Officer, Group Regulatory Director 
and the external auditor normally attend, by invitation, all 
meetings of the Committee. Other members of senior 
management are also invited to attend as appropriate to 
present reports. It is the Committee’s practice at each meeting 
to meet separately with the Chief Audit Officer and the external 
auditor without any members of management being present. In 
performing its duties, the Committee has access to the services 
of the Chief Audit Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Group 
Regulatory Director, and the Group Company Secretary and 
external professional advisers. During 2009 the Committee 
appointed Keith Nicholson, a former partner at KPMG LLP, as an 
external adviser to the Committee. 
External background 
In the challenging economic and market environment the Board 
and the Committee continued to focus on financial risk and 
capital management. The Committee also spent an increasing 
amount of time on the emerging requirements of the European 
Union’s Solvency II Directive, and the recommendations of the 
Walker Report in the UK. Although the recommendations of the 
Walker Report are not yet binding on the Group, the Group is 
already compliant with the majority of the recommendations 
relating to risk. In particular, the Board has had a separate risk 
and regulatory committee since 2006. The Committee chairman 
regularly reports to the Board on the Committee’s activities, and 
sits on the Audit and Remuneration Committees to ensure that 
risk considerations are fully reflected in their decisions. 
Committee activities during 2009 
The Committee’s main functions are to assist the Board in 
making decisions on the Group’s risk appetite; to oversee the 
monitoring and control of risks so that they remain aligned with 
appetite; to ensure that management is reviewing emerging 
risks and testing the Group’s resilience through scenario 
planning and stress testing; to give broad direction to the way 
the Group assesses its capital requirements and how it is 
optimising the balance between risk and reward when 
allocating capital for new business; and to ensure that 
management and the Board have high quality information on 
risk when reviewing Group strategy and future plans. 
During the year the Committee focused on the 
following areas: 
— Strengthening the risk function: a number of changes 
have been made to the risk function since the Group’s move 
to a regional structure. Following a review of progress, 
further changes have been implemented including; the 
appointment of a new Chief Risk Officer who reports to the 
Group Chief Executive; emphasis on first line responsibilities 
for managing risk, with support and challenge from the risk 
function and initiation of a comprehensive review of the 
Group’s risk appetite. 
— Capital management: this was a strong focus of the 
Committee throughout the year. Group capital requirements 
were monitored against existing risk appetite and capital 
availability in a rapidly changing market. The Committee 
reviewed scenario and stress testing and also considered 
reinsurance and hedging strategies to understand their 
contribution to capital management. 
— Solvency II: with increasing emphasis on economic capital, 
the Committee monitored the likely impact of Solvency II on 
the Group’s economic capital requirements and businesses. 
The Committee is responsible for the oversight of the 
Group’s Solvency II programme. 
— Risk monitoring: the Committee received regular reports on 
key risks and the actions and controls introduced to mitigate 
any risks that were out of appetite. Necessary focus was 
placed on financial and insurance risks including those 
relating to capital, credit, and equity risk. The Committee 
continued its practice of inviting business unit and regional 
teams, led by their Chief Executive, to present on how risk is 
managed in their businesses. During the year, presentations 
were received from North America region, Europe region, 
Asia Pacific region and UK General Insurance. 
— Group risk policies: The Committee approved significant 
changes to certain Group risk policies and received regular 
reports on compliance with Group policies. 
— Operational risks: during the year the Committee paid 
particular attention to business protection and IT risks, and 
how business units were embedding behaviour that met the 
FSA’s principles of Treating Customers Fairly. 
— Regulatory risks and relationships: The Committee 
received regular reports on compliance issues and regulatory 
and other public policy initiatives. In particular, it monitored 
the actions being taken by management in response to the 
FSA’s Risk Mitigation Programme; monitored worldwide 
regulatory reform developments arising from the financial 
crisis and government and regulatory responses to it; 
monitored management responses to proposed changes in 
the prudential requirements for financial services companies; 
and oversaw measures to strengthen oversight of the 
Group’s compliance functions, particularly outside the UK.  97

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
— Fraud and financial crime: the Committee maintained 
regular oversight of compliance with controls against 
financial malpractice including fraud, and of the 
arrangements for employees to report in confidence any 
concerns about lack of probity (whistleblowing). 
— Internal controls: the Group’s internal audit function 
provided the Committee with independent and objective 
assurance over the appropriateness, effectiveness and 
sustainability of the Company’s system of internal controls. 
Key control issues reported by Group internal audit to 
management and to the Committee members were 
monitored on a quarterly basis until the risk exposure had 
been properly mitigated. 
During the year the Committee held two joint meetings with 
the Audit Committee and one with the members of the 
business unit audit committees in the Asia Pacific region. 
The chairman of the Committee reports at the subsequent 
meeting of the Board on the Committee’s work and the Board 
receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting of the 
Committee. 
In line with the Combined Code requirement, the Board 
undertook a review of the effectiveness of all its committees 
during the year, including the Risk and Regulatory Committee. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 
3 March 2010.

The Committee met on four occasions in 2009 and the 
members’ attendance record is set out in the Corporate 
Governance report on page 88. The Group Company Secretary 
acts as the secretary to the Committee. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved 
the content and scope of the Company’s 2009 CR Report, 
monitored the management of the CR risks affecting the Group 
and helped establish a process by which regions could report 
performance and progress to the Committee. In November 
2009 the Company announced its intention to put its CR Report 
to an advisory vote of shareholders at the 2010 AGM as a 
means of obtaining feedback on the report and the Company’s 
performance in this area. The report is set out on pages 67 to 
78 and further details of the resolution are set out in the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting. 
The Committee reviewed each region’s performance and 
progress during the year against the Group key performance 
indicators and, for the first time, began to review performance 
of Group functions which contribute to our CR programme 
activities, beginning with Group procurement. In addition, it 
reviewed Aviva Investor’s approach and progress in Sustainable 
and Responsible Investment. The Committee also received 
updates on the Group’s key CR programme activities, including 
climate change, community investment, diversity and external 
benchmarking. The Committee reviewed the Group’s carbon 
offset projects as part of management’s commitment to be 
carbon neutral on a global basis.

Highlights 
— The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) approved the Executive Directors’ (EDs) request to freeze their basic salaries for 
2009 and to take a 10% reduction on the personal element of their annual bonus. In 2010, the EDs requested that their basic 
salaries should not be subject to annual review and the Committee has endorsed this proposal. 
— The demanding financial and non-financial targets set for the 2009 annual bonus were met in part during the year. The 
combination of financial outcomes, along with those targets relating to employees, customers, and personal objectives mean 
that the Group Chief Executive received a 2009 bonus of 74% of his maximum opportunity (2008: 54%). 
— The Committee entered the 2010 reward period conscious of the challenging economic background and widespread comment 
on over generous executive remuneration. The Committee believes Aviva’s 2009 business results are strong and that Aviva’s 
remuneration practices already closely link pay to performance and also align with current governance guidelines. The 
Committee has, however, continued to ensure prudent and proportionate reward outcomes. 
— Andrea Moneta, Chief Executive Officer, Aviva Europe, Middle East and Africa was appointed as ED of Aviva plc on 
29 September 2009. Information on his remuneration therefore appears in this report for the first time. 
— On 1 January 2010, Mark Hodges was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the whole of Aviva’s UK Insurance operations, 
which brought together the Life and General Insurance businesses. As a result of this significant expansion of his managerial 
responsibilities, his basic salary was increased. 
— On 26 January 2010, Philip Scott retired from the Board. He continues to be employed by the Group and will retire on 31 July 
2010. Details of his leaving arrangements are disclosed in this report. 
— Patrick Regan joined Aviva as the new Chief Financial Officer on 22 February 2010. Details of his joining arrangements and 
ongoing annual remuneration are disclosed in this report.

Committee Decisions 
The Company’s EDs elected to take a basic salary freeze in 2009 and to take a 10% reduction on the personal element of their 
annual bonus. A further 45 members of senior management similarly accepted a 2009 basic pay freeze. The 2008 Annual Report 
and Accounts stated the Committee had decided to review mid year the financial targets used for bonus purposes for EDs and 
other senior managers. This was in addition to the mechanical rebasing for exchange rate and capital assumptions that is carried 
out annually. Only in exceptional circumstances would the Committee consider amending financial targets, either up or down, and 
any significant change would be the subject of appropriate consultation. Having reviewed the targets, it was agreed that they 
remained valid and therefore the bonuses paid for the 2009 performance year, which are disclosed in this report, are based on 
unaltered financial and non-financial targets. 
The Committee remains conscious of the shareholders’ loss of value in light of the recession. This has also impacted the EDs 
through the significantly lower value of the deferred ABP shares and LTIP grants in 2007, both of which will vest in 2010.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Future actions and changes 
The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the structure of EDs’ compensation packages in 2010, compared with 
those outlined in this report. There are, however, three main areas of activity in 2010 which are worth noting: 
i) Increased regulation in executive remuneration and changes in corporate governance 
2009 has seen a series of regulatory and governance guidelines issued by a wide ranging group of organisations, from the Financial 
Services Authority, the Company’s primary regulator, to the Financial Stability Board of the G20. Whilst many of the issued 
guidelines do not yet formally apply to Aviva, the Company has already reviewed its existing remuneration arrangements against 
these and Aviva’s current remuneration structures are broadly in line with the requirements laid down by the majority of the codes 
of practice and corporate governance expectations. A good example of this is the high level of deferral on the annual bonus (two­
thirds) which would be considered best practice in the new environment. In addition, the Company has introduced clawback 
provisions into the Company’s share incentive plans. The Group Risk and Regulatory Committee is also mindful of the 
recommendations and that its involvement will be required including its input into the setting of financial objectives. 
ii) Changes to UK taxation 
The changes in the personal tax regime effective in April 2010 will create a significantly different tax position for a number of 
senior employees. The Company has therefore made available the choice to receive deferred annual bonus awards as restricted 
stock, thus allowing the payment of income tax on grant prior to the changes coming into effect in April 2010. Any potential cost 
to the Company is judged to be minimal. In addition, the 2010 LTIP grant will be underpinned by an approved share option grant. 
This will have no additional cost to the Company. These changes were discussed with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 
before being implemented. 
iii) Strategic Reward Review 
The Company is required every five years to seek shareholder approval for the operation of its share-based incentive plans. The 
Committee has, in the past, carried out a comprehensive review of senior executive remuneration to coincide with this. This has 
allowed the Company to put to shareholders’ proposals that reflect a thorough review of the Company’s remuneration package 
taking into account changing market and regulatory practice and the requirement to ensure that the package remains competitive. 
It was agreed in 2008 that the review would be delayed by 12 months from 2009 to 2010. This will enable Aviva to reflect on the 
new regulatory and governance requirements that emerge from the global financial crisis. Following an in-depth review during 
2010, new proposals will be put to shareholders in 2011. 
Remuneration policy 
Alignment with Group Strategy 
The Committee considers alignment between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior executives, including EDs, to be 
critical. It believes that senior executives should be highly rewarded (on a market competitive basis) for the delivery of stretching 
goals but should receive reduced rewards when the business performs poorly. The pay and employment conditions of employees 
of the Company and Group were also taken into account when determining directors’ remuneration for the financial year. To 
achieve this alignment Aviva’s remuneration package is leveraged, with a high percentage of pay “at risk” against the achievement 
of stretching goals which is aligned with the Company’s risk profile and employee behaviour. Furthermore two-thirds of any bonus 
and any LTIP grant are delivered in the form of Aviva shares. The element of deferred bonus that is matched under the OATTV Plan 
only vests if very demanding Earnings Per Share (EPS) targets are met. The requirements to defer bonus, participation in the LTIP 
and the OATTV Plan closely tie the long-term value of executive remuneration to the Company’s share price performance. 
Senior executives thus have high exposure to the same benefits and drawbacks of share price movement as all shareholders. The 
belief that senior executives should be shareholders is reinforced through formal guidelines requiring EDs to build up and maintain 
a significant holding of shares in the Company. 
The Group’s strategic priorities and targets are set out elsewhere in this report. Those priorities are reflected closely in the 
remuneration package: 
— Basic Salary: Internal and external equity in basic salary positioning is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration 
package. A range of market data is used to inform decision making taking into account the Company’s policy with regard to 
the FTSE 30 and FTSE 50. 
— ABP: Bonus structures are effective only if they drive, through the targets, the maintenance of the Company on a sound 
financial footing and sustained profitable growth. In addition, the targets must not provide an incentive to promote behaviours 
which could be detrimental to the Company’s long-term interests. Management must justify the targets it recommends. The 
Committee assures itself that the targets provide appropriate incentives, are sufficiently challenging, are aligned to shareholders’ 
interests and are within the Group’s risk appetite. 
The Committee also considers how, given changing economic circumstances, the Group’s priorities, and consequently the targets 
underpinning its bonus structures, need to change. Given the challenging current environment the Committee has agreed that 
financial targets for 2010 should focus more on profitable growth and long-term value creation. Financial targets sit alongside 
targets on customer advocacy and employee engagement introduced in 2005 that the Committee believes are critical to long-term 
organisational health. The personal objectives of Executive Committee members are reviewed by the Committee to ensure they 
adequately reflect the strategic aims of the Group, good governance and best practice.

Other information 
— OATTV Plan: This plan was introduced to emphasise the Group Chief Executive’s clear strategic aim for the Group to deliver 
growth in EPS, with a target of doubling EPS in five years from a baseline at the end of December 2007. No other element of 
executive remuneration was focused on EPS growth, and this bonus scheme directly aligns a portion of executive remuneration 
to this key strategic goal. 
— LTIP: The LTIP encourages a longer-term management focus on Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and relative TSR. These 
metrics measure how the Company is performing in both absolute and relative terms. 
The Committee considers all these elements, plus pension and other benefits, as a whole. It looks to ensure that an appropriate 
balance is maintained between them so that the need for both short-term success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised. 
The Committee also ensures that the non-financial business measures and individual objectives reflect adequately the Company’s 
environmental, social and governance responsibilities. 
Constituent elements of reward as a percentage of total remuneration 
Tables 3a and 3b below show how the Group’s remuneration policy translates in practice into the Group Chief Executive’s 
remuneration package. The tables outline the contribution each element makes to overall compensation at both “Target” and 
“Stretch” levels of performance. More than 50% of EDs’ total remuneration is performance related. For the remainder of EDs, 
43% of total remuneration is paid in cash for on “Target” performance and 27% for “Stretch” performance (excluding ACAP 
which EDs participate in to varied degrees, see Table 5).

Table 3a shows the breakdown of the Group Chief Executive’s remuneration package into its main constituent elements. Table 3b 
gives the proportions of fixed cash, variable cash and shares. For the purposes of Table 3b, fixed cash includes basic salary and the 
discretionary ACAP payment. Variable cash is the one-third of bonus paid in cash annually. The share element includes the two-
thirds of the annual bonus deferred into shares, the OATTV Plan match and the LTIP. 
— “Target” performance means a target ABP outcome (75% of basic salary), a 50% vesting of the LTIP (87.5% of basic salary)

grant, 50% in following year and 25% in year after that). Additional shares are awarded at 

vesting in lieu of the dividends paid on the deferred shares during the deferral period.  

OATTV Plan 
The OATTV Plan aligns senior executives with the Group Chief Executive clear strategic aim  

of doubling EPS by the end of 2012. 

The plan matches 100% of the deferred ABP shares for the Group Chief Executive (75% for  

other EDs) 

For the 2009 awards, the vesting of these matched shares is dependent on the achievement  

of 49.2 pence per share and then compounded annual growth targets as follows: 

— Less than 12.5% growth pa Nil 
— 12.5% growth pa 0.1 for 1 
— 41.5% growth pa 2 for 1 
Matching is on a straight-line basis for performance from 12.5% to 41.5%. No additional 
shares are awarded for the dividends paid during the three-year performance period on those 
shares that vest. 
— Annually, a proportion of the deferred element 
of the ABP is matched in shares. 
— Shares vest based only upon the achievement 
of demanding EPS growth targets. 
LTIP 
The LTIP is intended to motivate the achievement of the Company’s longer-term objectives,  

to aid the retention of key personnel and to align executive interests to those of shareholders. 

The Group Chief Executive is eligible to receive an annual award of shares equal to 175% of  

basic salary. Other EDs are eligible to receive an annual award of shares equal to 150% of  

basic salary. 

The Company operates a phantom scheme in the United States (US) for its US-based  

employees. Levels of awards reflect US market practice. 

No additional shares are awarded for the dividends paid during the three-year performance  

period on those shares that vest. 

— Annual awards in shares that vest, subject to 
ROCE and relative TSR performance conditions 
being met at the end of a three-year 
performance period. 
— Awards that do not vest lapse. 
Long-term savings 
The Aviva Capital Accumulation Plan (ACAP) is a long-term savings vehicle which aids — Discretionary payments into a trust where they

Company contributions are discretionary and vary year on year, but would not normally 
exceed 50% of basic salary. Contributions for the EDs are shown in the table on page 113. 
No ED who participates in the ACAP is currently accruing benefits in the ASPS. A resignation 
or departure for breach of contract generally results in forfeiture of contribution for the 
relevant year. 
ASPS 
The UK ASPS provides a competitive post retirement package. No ED is currently accruing — Deferred cash payable on retirement in the 
service-based benefits in the ASPS. form of a lump sum /monthly payment. 
The scheme provides accrual at 1/30th, 1/45th or 1/60th of annual basic salary depending on 
seniority and the date of joining the scheme. 
Lump sum death in service benefit of four times basic salary is provided, as is a spouse’s or 
partner’s pension equal to two-thirds of actual or, on death in service and in certain other 
circumstances, prospective pension. Post retirement increases are equivalent to the Retail Price 
Index up to a maximum of 10%. Retirement benefits can be accessed from age 60.

ABP – target setting 
The financial targets which underpinned the ABP (accounting for 50% of annual bonus) in 2009 were derived from Aviva’s return, 
growth and capital efficiency/capital generation goals. Three of the financial targets (operating profit, volume and new business 
contribution) were “stretched” (as set out in Table 6) due to their importance in achieving these aspirations. 
Employee and customer targets (each accounting for up to 10% of annual bonus) are set taking into account performance to 
date and aspirations for the future. The employee targets on leadership and engagement are derived from the Group’s employee 
promise survey in which all business units participate and which over 37,500 staff completed in 2009. This survey is delivered 
through an independent third party who is able to provide extensive external benchmark data. The Company’s aspiration is to 
reach the upper quartile positions compared to the relevant global and national norms on leadership and engagement over time. 
In 2009, the number of businesses measuring customer advocacy using a consistent robust methodology doubled, and this was 
measured by an independent global research agency. All business units now have customer advocacy targets in place for 2010. 
The Company’s aspiration is to reach the upper quartile in the relevant local market benchmark. Internal assurance that the 
outcomes on employee and customer targets were accurately calculated and reported was provided to the Committee by 
Group Audit. 
Personal objectives based on delivery of key strategic priorities, personal leadership and operating performance of the 
relevant portion of the business account for up to 30% of annual bonus. Carbon emissions targets are also included as part of 
the EDs’ personal objectives. 
The Group’s performance against its financial, employee and customer KPIs in 2009, as they affected the bonus of the Group 
Chief Executive, is shown in Table 6.

The Committee is sensitive to the current environment in relation to executive pay, and particularly relating to the payment of 
bonuses in circumstances where financial targets have not been met and share prices have fallen. However, the combination of 
financial and non-financial measures is central to the structure of the ABP. The Committee wants to ensure a balanced focus on 
both short-term financial performance and on the objective non-financial measures that are leading indicators of future financial 
success. This balance is, in the Committee’s view, reflective of good practice in incentive design and is consistent with the FSA’s 
guidance on creating incentive schemes that have a focus on long-term sustainable performance. 
As described above, the Committee took the view that it was important to maintain the integrity of the financial targets for 
the EDs, and so these were not adjusted during the year. In the same way, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to pay 
bonuses based on pre-agreed rigorous targets when these have been met. 
To align with the business priorities for 2010, the financial measures at Group level for 2010 are operating profit, volume, 
new business margin, the Combined Operating Ratio (COR) of our general insurance businesses and cost savings.

OATTV Plan 
The OATTV Plan aligns senior executives with the Group Chief Executive’s clear strategic aim of doubling EPS by the end of 2012. 
The plan matches 100% of the deferred ABP shares for the Group Chief Executive (75% for other EDs). For the grant made in 
2009 the vesting of these matched shares is dependent on the average annual growth in EPS during the three year performance 
period, thus: 
— Less than 12.5% growth pa Nil 
— 12.5% growth pa 0.1 for 1 
— 41.5% growth pa 2 for 1 
Matching is on a straight-line basis for performance between 12.5% and 41.5%. The maximum match of two shares for each 
deferred share is paid for delivering a doubling of EPS by the end of 2010. The threshold matching of 0.1 of a share for each share 
deferred is equivalent to doubling EPS by 2014. The Committee reviews the performance conditions of this plan annually. 
LTIP – Target Setting 
The LTIP vests subject to the degree of achievement of two equally weighted performance measures, chosen to reflect 
shareholders’ long-term interest, in absolute ROCE and relative TSR performance. 
ROCE targets 
ROCE targets are set annually within the context of the Company’s three-year business plan and are set on a Market Consistent 
Embedded Value basis. Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return. The Company’s 
external auditor provides a formal opinion on the ROCE vesting calculation. The 2009 LTIP award ROCE targets are set out in 
Table 7 below: 
Table 7: 2009 LTIP ROCE Targets 
ROCE over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROCE targets

31.5% 15% 

Between 31.5% and 37.5% Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight line basis  

37.5% and above 50% 

TSR Targets 
Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any LTIP award. The comparator group for the assessment of relative TSR 
performance at the time of the 2009 grant comprised Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Fortis, Friends Provident, Generali, ING, Legal and 
General, Lloyds Banking Group, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal and Sun Alliance, Standard Life and Zurich. HBOS had 
been delisted by the time the 2009 grant was made and so was not included in the comparator group. Friends Provident was 
delisted in November 2009. 
TSR vesting operates as set out in Table 8 below:

The same targets will apply for the 2010 LTIP awards. The comparator group will remain unchanged other than the removal of 
Friends Provident which will be replaced by Resolution Limited. The Committee has agreed a shortlist of companies that would be 
considered for inclusion in the comparator group, subject to final review, should any further member of the group be delisted. 
Details of subsisting LTIP awards are provided on page 110 and Table 9 below shows the vesting projections (non-audited) of 
those awards as at 31 December 2009. 
Table 9: Projections of vesting of subsisting LTIP awards

Aviva LTIP 2009 50% 
Aviva LTIP 2008 50% 
Aviva LTIP 2007 50% 
Details of the assumptions used in valuing the LTIP for accounting purposes can be found on page 202 of this report. The vesting 
assumption made in respect of the 2010 award for accounting purposes is 50%. 
Since the LTIP has performance conditions attached to it, then one potential outcome is that neither performance condition is 
met and the whole of the LTIP lapses. Table 10 below has been drawn up to assist in understanding the potential value of the LTIP 
awards made to EDs in 2010 should the performance conditions be met in part or in whole.

Assumptions are as follows: 
— Threshold vesting assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at the minimum level, producing a 30% vesting of the total award. 
No share price growth is assumed; 
— Expected value, based on the vesting assumption made for accounting purposes, assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at a 
combined rate of 50% of the total award. Share price growth of 5% per annum is assumed over the three-year performance 
period; 
— Maximum vesting assumes both TSR and ROCE elements vest in full, producing a 100% vesting. Share price growth of 10% per 
annum is assumed over the three-year performance period. 
Andrea Moneta joined Aviva in July 2008 and does not have an LTIP award vesting in 2010. 
At the end of the performance period for the 2006 LTIP grant, which vested in 2009, the Company was ranked eighth out 
of the 15 companies in the TSR comparator group (15% vesting) and ROCE was 36.0% (41.3% vesting). The total vesting was 
therefore 56.3%. The 43.7% of the award which did not vest lapsed. 
The LTIP vesting history is set out in Table 11 below. Prior to the 2005 award, vesting history is based on an earlier LTIP plan, 
and the last award made under this plan was in 2004.

Notes 
1. The actual price used to calculate the ABP and LTIP awards is based on a three day average price. These were in 2006: 820p; 2007: 769p; 2008: 608p; 2009: 256p. The three day average price 
used to grant the 2008 OATTV Plan awards was 617p and in 2009 was 256p 
2. The performance period for all awards begins at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is granted. 
3. The performance conditions for awards granted and vested during 2009 are explained elsewhere in this report. 
4. The monetary value of awards will be calculated by multiplying the relevant number of shares by the market price at the date of vesting. 
5. The award date for the awards which vested in 2009 was 30 March 2006. 
6. The awards granted to Andrea Moneta were awarded before he was appointed to the board, and were held at the date of his appointment. 
7. The awards that vested in 2009 were released with the net amount being settled in shares and the balance settled in cash and used to pay the resulting tax liability. 
8. These figures relate to shares issued in lieu of dividends accrued during the deferral period. 
9. The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the directors in the period was £5.256 million (2008: £4.319 million). The net value has been calculated by reference to the market price at 
the date of grant.

Performance graph 
Table 13 below compares the TSR performance of the Company over the past five years with the TSR of the FTSE 100 Return 
Index. This index has been chosen because it is a recognised equity market index, of which Aviva is a member. 
The companies which comprise the current LTIP comparator group for TSR purposes were chosen on the basis of product 
and geographic match to Aviva and are listed above. The TSR graph for the comparator group has been plotted using the 20 
companies (including Aviva) in the comparator group for pre-2005 grants, the 15 companies (including Aviva) in the comparator 
group for 2005-07 grants, the 16 companies (including Aviva) in the comparator group for the 2008 grant, and the 15 companies 
(including Aviva) in the comparator group for the 2009 grant.

EDs’ service contracts 
Service contracts agreed with each ED incorporate their terms and conditions of employment. Contracts were last reviewed during 
2006 bringing them in line with good market practice. The aim is to strike a fair balance between the Company’s and the 
employee’s interests taking into account good market practice. The key terms are set out in Table 14 below. 
Table 14: EDs’ key terms and conditions of employment 
Provision  	 Policy 
Notice period 
By the director 6 months 
By the Company 12 months, rolling. No notice or payment in lieu to be paid where the Company terminates for cause. 
Termination payment 	 Pay in lieu of notice up to a maximum of 12 months’ basic salary. This may be increased by a discretionary 
redundancy payment (where appropriate) but any such further termination payment is capped at 12 months’ 
basic salary. 
Any amount is subject to phased payment and mitigation requirements. 
Remuneration and benefits As described in this Report the operation of the ABP, the OATTV Plan and LTIP is at the Company’s discretion and, 
in the case of the long-term savings plans, at the trustees’ discretion. 
Expenses 	 Reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in accordance with their duties. 
Holiday entitlement 30 working days plus public holidays. 
Sickness 	 In line with senior management terms, ie 100% basic salary for 52 weeks, and 75% thereafter. 
Non-compete During employment and for six months after leaving. 
Contract dates 	 Director Date current contract commenced

Share ownership requirements 
An internal shareholding requirement was introduced in 2005 that the Group Chief Executive and any EDs should build, over a 
five-year period, a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 175% of basic salary and 150% of basic salary respectively and no 
specific value per share was designated for the calculation. Shares held in compulsory bonus deferrals and performance shares held 
in unvested LTIPs are not taken into account in applying this test. 
As at 31 December 2009, based on that day’s closing share price of 397.9p, Mr Moss’ shareholding of 239,848 shares 
represented 103% of his basic salary of £925,000 (his holding of 176,067 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 76% of his basic 
salary of £925,000 using the 31 December 2009 share price). As it currently stands, largely due to the volatile market conditions in 
the current economic climate, Mr Moss will not meet the internal shareholding requirement target of 1.5 x his salary by April 2010, 
although he is on target to meet the 1.75 x his salary by July 2012. Mr Scott’s shareholding of 512,652 shares represented 340% 
of his basic salary of £600,000 (his holding of 400,973 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 266%). Mr Hodges’ shareholding of 
139,028 shares represented 106% of his basic salary of £520,000 (his holding of 100,086 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 
77%). Mr Moneta’s shareholding of 394 shares represented 0% of his basic salary of €780,000 (£694,587 based on average 
exchange rate for 2009 of €1.12297: £1.00).

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
External Board appointments 
Aviva recognises its senior executives can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a NED of non Aviva Group companies. It is, 
at the same time, conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment 
required by a NED position and ensure any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties. The 
Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing senior executives to serve as a NED of one external company, subject to 
approval by the Board, and to retain any board fees. 
The only ED who held an external NED appointment during 2009 was Philip Scott who was appointed to the Board of Diageo 
plc on 17 October 2007 and, following the announcement of his intended retirement from the Company, to the Board of Royal 
Bank of Scotland Group plc on 1 November 2009. As a NED of Diageo plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling £101,250 in 2009. 
As a NED of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling £25,000 in 2009. 
All employee share plans 
EDs are eligible to participate in a number of HMRC approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible 
employees. 
These plans include a free share element of the Aviva All Employee Share Ownership Plan (AESOP). Under this plan, eligible 
employees can receive up to a maximum of £3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Company’s UK businesses. 
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period. In addition, the partnership element of the AESOP, which the Company 
also operates, allows participants to invest up to £125 per month out of their gross salary in the Company’s shares. There is no 
matching to this investment by the Company. 
The Aviva SAYE allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Company’s shares at a discount of up to 20% of their 
market value at the date of grant. In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three, five or seven-
year HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of £250 per month. 
Details of holdings under these plans can be found on page 115. 
Dilution 
Awards granted under the Aviva employee shares plans are met by the funding of an employee trust administered by an external 
trustee that acquires shares in the market. The current practice is that new issue shares will generally only be issued where it is not 
practicable to use the trust and the funding policy is kept under review by the Committee and the Board. Details of the shares 
currently held in the employee trust are set out in note 30 to the accounts. 
During 2009 loans totalling of £53.6 million were made to RBC Trustees (CI) Limited to ensure sufficient shares were available 
to meet its ongoing liabilities. 
NEDs 
The NEDs, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. The key terms of the 
appointments are set out in Table 15 below. 
Table 15: NED key terms of appointment 
Provision Policy 
Period Three-year term which can be extended by mutual consent.

It is the Company’s policy to set the fees paid to its Chairman and NEDs taking account of the median market payments in 
international companies of similar size and complexity. NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties. A further 
fee is paid to NEDs (other than the Chairman) in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board 
committees. 
Fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience. In 
determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs the Board receives recommendations from the EDs, who consider the NED’s duties 
and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid 
by competitors and similar-sized companies.

The Chairman and NEDs do not participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the Chairman and NEDs will be 
determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders. The current aggregate limit of £1.5 million was approved by 
shareholders at the Company’s 2005 Annual General Meeting. The amount paid in 2009 was £1.165 million. EDs are remunerated 
under their service contracts and receive no additional fee for serving as directors.

Notes 
1. Bonuses show the value at the date of award inclusive of the two-thirds of bonus which Aviva requires its EDs to defer into Aviva shares for three years. 
2. “Benefits”. All the EDs received life assurance benefits during the year that relate to the cost incurred by the Company of insuring the directors’ life and relevant spouses’ benefits which, had the 
director died during the year, could not have been wholly paid by the pension scheme and would therefore have been met by the Company had the insurance not been in place. The disclosure 
also includes the cost of private medical insurance and, where appropriate, accompanied travel, accommodation and car benefits. All the numbers disclosed include the tax charged on the 
benefits. No directors received an expense allowance during the year. 
3. Figures shown for Mr Moneta have been converted from Euro to Pound Sterling at the average exchange rate for 2009 of €1.12297 : £1.00. Further details of Mr Moneta’s benefits are 
contained in table 5. The grossed element for schooling and housing as outlined in table 5 will be delivered in 2010. 
4. For the purposes of the disclosure required by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the directors in respect of 2009 was £6.7 million (2008: £5.2 million). 
5. No compensation payment for loss of office was made to any director, or former director, during the year. 
6. Annual bonuses are one-third paid in cash and two-thirds deferred into shares for three years.

— Mary Francis joined the Nomination Committee on 2 December 2009. 
Senior executives’ remuneration 
The total compensation paid during the year to key management personnel, being those having authority and responsibility for 
planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Company, including the Company’s EDs and NEDs (as required to be

Notes 
1. Accrued pensions shown are the amounts that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year. 
2. Benefits deriving from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) paid by directors are excluded from the amounts above. 
3. The change in transfer value allows for fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as changes in stock market conditions. The 
transfer values have been calculated in line with the relevant legislation and using actuarial assumptions agreed by the Trustee. These assumptions were revised during the year resulting in higher 
transfer values. 
4. Mr Scott opted out of the ASPS on 30 June 2009. For the first three months of 2009 Mr Scott made regular member contributions of 5% of salary. Mr Scott then switched to making salary 
sacrifice contributions at the same rate for the final three months of his Scheme membership. Salary sacrifice contributions are excluded for the figures above. 
5. Mr Moneta opted out of the Scheme on 30 June 2009. Contributions shown are for the period to this date. 
6. No former Directors received any increase in retirement benefits in excess of the amount to which they were entitled, on the later of the date when the benefits first became payable, or 
31 March 1997. 
7. The transfer value of net increase (decrease) in accrued pension shows the value of the increase (decrease) in accrued pension net of inflation, over the year net of contributions.

Other information 
Income from associates predominantly relates to our 
investments in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) life and 
collective investment companies listed in the ‘Financial 
Statements IFRS – Note 19 – Interest in, and loans to, 
associates.’ Under management service agreements with 
these associates, our UK life insurance companies provide 
administration services, the cost of which is recharged to the 
RBS companies. In addition, our fund management companies 
provide fund management services to these associates, for 
which they charge fees based on the level of funds under 
management. 
Transactions with joint ventures relate to the property 
management undertakings. At 31 December 2009, there were 
18 such joint ventures, the most material of which are listed in 
the ‘Financial Statement IFRS – Note 13 – Interest in, and loans 
to, joint ventures.’ Our interest in these joint ventures comprises 
a mix of equity and loans, together with the provision of 
administration services and financial management to many 
of them. Our UK life insurance companies earn interest on 
loans advanced to these entities and our fund management 
companies charge fees for administration services and for 
arranging external finance. 
Our UK fund management companies manage most of the 
assets held by the Group’s main UK staff pension scheme, for 
which they charge fees based on the level of funds under 
management. The main UK scheme and the Dutch scheme hold 
investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies 
with other Group companies, as explained in ‘Financial 
Statement IFRS – Note 41(e)(iv) – Pension obligations’. 
The other related parties’ receivables are not secured and 
no guarantees were received in respect thereof. The receivables 
will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms. Details of 
guarantees, indemnities and warranties provided on behalf of 
related parties are given in ‘Financial Statements IFRS – Note 
45(h) – Contingent liabilities and other risk factors – Other’. 
Loans to joint ventures 
We make loans to our property management joint ventures to 
fund property developments which we undertake with our joint 
venture partners. Movements in these loans may be found in 
‘Financial Statements IFRS – Note 18 – Interests in, and loans to, 
joint ventures’. Total loans at 31 December 2009 and at the 
end of each of the last three financial years are shown in the 
table below: 
2009 2008 2007 
£m £m £m 
Loans to joint ventures 327 297 167 
These constitute loans to joint ventures to fund shopping, 
business or distribution centres or properties in Europe, as well 
as a film studio development in the UK. The largest of these is 
part of a facility granted in November 2005 and had a balance 
of £255 million as of 31 December 2009 and bears an interest 
rate of 8%. 
Dividend Data 
Our dividend policy is to sustain a target dividend cover of 
between one and a half and two times our IFRS adjusted 
operating profit after tax before amortisation of goodwill and 
adjusting items. Under UK company law, we may only pay 
dividends if the company has “distributable profits” available. 
“Distributable profits” are accumulated, realised profits not 
previously distributed or capitalised, less accumulated, 
unrealised losses not previously written off based on IFRS. 
Even if distributable profits are available, we pay dividends only 
if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of 
our called-up share capital and undistributable reserves and the 
payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of our 
net assets to less than that aggregate. 
As a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends 
and interest from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends. Many 
of our subsidiaries are subject to insurance regulations that 
restrict the amount of dividends that they can pay to us. 
Historically, we have declared an interim and a final dividend 
for each year (with the final dividend being paid in the year 
following the year to which it relates). Subject to the restrictions 
set out above, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary 
shares is made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, while 
payment of any final dividend requires the approval of our 
shareholders at a general meeting. Ordinary preference shares 
are irredeemable and dividends on ordinary preference shares 
are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
We pay our cash dividends in pounds sterling, although our 
Articles of Association permit payment of dividends on ordinary 
shares in other currencies and in forms other than cash, such 
as ordinary shares. If dividends on ordinary shares held by the 
American Depositary Shares (ADS) depositary are paid in pounds 
sterling, the ADS depositary will convert the pounds that it 
receives on behalf of the ADS holders into US dollars according 
to the prevailing market rate on the date that the ADS 
depositary actually receives the dividends. 
For the 2007 final dividend and previous final and interim 
dividends, shareholders on record were provided with the 
opportunity to elect to receive dividends in the form of newly 
issued ordinary shares through our scrip dividend scheme. 
For the 2008 interim dividend the scrip dividend scheme was 
replaced by a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP). For those 
shareholders participating in the DRIP, we paid a cash dividend, 
which was then used to buy existing shares on the open market. 
For the 2008 final dividend we withdrew the DRIP and 
reintroduced the scrip dividend scheme. 
An interim dividend is generally paid in November of each 
year. A final dividend is proposed by our Board of Directors 
after the end of the relevant year and generally paid in May. 
The following table shows certain information regarding the 
dividends that we paid on ordinary shares for the periods 
indicated in pounds sterling and converted into US dollars at 
the noon buying rate in effect on each payment date.

Controls and procedures 
Disclosure controls and procedures 
Management has evaluated, with the participation of Aviva’s 
Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer, the 
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as at 
31 December 2009. There are inherent limitations to the 
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and 
Shareholder information

Aviva plc Additional information for Shareholders continued

procedures, including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. 
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures 
can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control 
objectives. Based upon Aviva’s evaluation, the Group Chief 
Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of 
31 December 2009 Aviva’s disclosure controls and procedures 
were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information 
required to be disclosed by Aviva in the reports Aviva files and 
submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, 
processed, summarised and reported, within the time periods 
specified in the applicable rules and forms and that it is 
accumulated and communicated to Aviva’s management, 
including the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial 
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure. 
Management’s annual report on internal control over 
financial reporting 
This Annual Report does not include a report of management’s 
assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting 
or an attestation report of the company’s registered public 
accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission for newly public 
companies. 
Audit committee financial expert 
The Board has determined that Russell Walls, Richard Goeltz 
and Euleen Goh all qualify as audit committee financial experts 
within the meaning of Item 16A of Form 20-F, and that Russell 
Walls, Richard Goeltz and Euleen Goh are all independent as 
defined by the New York Stock Exchange Corporate 
Governance Standards. 
Code of ethics 
The company has adopted a code of ethics for its group chief 
executive, chief financial officer, general auditor and group chief 
accounting officer as required by the provisions of Section 406 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the 
SEC. There have been no amendments to, or waivers from, 
the code of ethics relating to any of those officers. The code 
of ethics was filed on 7 October 2009 as an exhibit to our Form 
20-F registration document. 
Regulation 
Compliance 
In our insurance business, matters may arise as a result of 
industry-wide issues, inspection visits or other regulatory activity 
requiring discussion and resolution with insurance industry 
regulators. As a result of these matters, we ensure that 
procedures are in place to address regulatory concerns and that 
such procedures are properly planned, managed and resourced. 
We pursue corrective action when necessary and report 
progress to the regulatory bodies in a timely manner. 
Overview of regulation as it affects our business 
Our principal insurance and investment operations are in the 
United Kingdom, Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific 
region. We are therefore subject to financial services regulation 
in these regions, which is discussed below. 
United Kingdom 
The Financial Services Authority 
In the UK, the Financial Services Authority (the FSA) is the single 
regulator for all authorised persons with respect to regulated 
activities in the financial services sector. In this regard, the FSA 
is authorised to make rules and issue guidance in relation to a 
wide sphere of activity encompassing the governance of the 
conduct of business by, and the prudential supervision of 
persons which the FSA has authorised to conduct such business 
(“Authorised Persons” or “Authorised Firms”). 
Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 
(“FSMA”), no person may carry on or purport to carry on a 
regulated activity by way of business in the UK unless he is an 
Authorised Person or an exempt person. A firm which is granted 
permission by the FSA to carry on regulated activities becomes 
an Authorised Person for the purposes of FSMA. “Regulated 
activities” are prescribed in the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 and include 
banking, insurance and investment business, stakeholder 
pension schemes, insurance mediation and certain mortgage 
mediation and lending activities. 
Authorised Firms must at all times meet certain threshold 
conditions, which include having adequate resources for the 
carrying on of its business and being a fit and proper person, 
having regard to all the circumstances. Authorised Firms must 
also comply with the FSA’s Principles for Business, which are 11 
high level principles for conducting financial services business in 
the UK. These include the maintenance of adequate systems 
and controls, treating customers fairly and communicating with 
customers in a manner that is clear, fair and not misleading. 
The FSA’s regulation of the group 
A number of the Group’s UK subsidiaries are directly authorised 
and regulated by the FSA. The regulated subsidiaries include our 
insurance companies (eg the UK Life and UK General Insurance 
companies), asset managers (Aviva Investors) and intermediaries 
(UK Healthcare and RAC Motoring Services). Aviva plc, although 
not directly authorised by the FSA, does itself come within the 
scope of regulation by virtue of being the ultimate insurance 
holding company in the Group. In line with requirements under 
the Insurance Groups Directive, Group solvency returns are 
required to be prepared at Aviva plc level. 
The FSA regime is built on the basic principle that a firm 
should have systems and controls, including risk management, 
which are appropriate to the size, complexity and diversity of 
its business. 
Approved persons and controllers 
The FSA regime is also predicated on the principle of senior 
management responsibility. The directors and senior managers 
holding positions of significant influence of each of the Group’s 
regulated entities are individually registered with the FSA under 
the “Approved Person” regime, and can be held directly 
accountable to the FSA for control failings in those firms. 
A number of senior managers at Group level have also been 
registered as Approved Persons for the regulated subsidiaries, 
even though they are neither directors nor senior managers of 
these firms. This recognises that these managers exert 
significant influence over the regulated subsidiaries, because 
they are responsible for key parts of the Group’s control 
framework on which the regulated subsidiaries place reliance. 
The FSA regulates from a legal entity perspective, even 
though we tend to operate within Regions by Business Unit.

Aviva plc Additional information for Shareholders continued 
Corporate responsibility
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Governance 
However, the FSA also recognises, and indeed expects, that 
Aviva’s regulated subsidiaries operate within an overall 
framework of Group governance and controls. Its rules expressly 
provide that any systems and controls which operate on a 
Group basis will be taken into account in determining the 
adequacy of a regulated subsidiary’s systems and controls. The 
robustness of these Group controls, from the operation of the 
Aviva plc board and its committees down, is thus very much 
within its regulatory remit. 
The FSA regulates the acquisition and increase of control 
over Authorised Firms. Under FSMA, any person proposing to 
acquire control of or increase control over certain thresholds 
over an Authorised Firm must first obtain the consent of the 
FSA. The Authorised Firm must also inform the FSA of any such 
proposed acquisition or increase. In considering whether to 
grant or withhold its approval to the acquisition or increase of 
control, the FSA must be satisfied both that the acquirer is a fit 
and proper person and that the interests of consumers would 
not be threatened by this acquisition or increase of control. 
Control over a UK Authorised Firm (“A”) is acquired if the 
acquirer holds 10% (or 20% if the Authorised Firm is an 
insurance intermediary) or more of the shares in A or a parent 
undertaking of A (“P”); is able to exercise significant influence 
over the management of A or P by virtue of his shareholding in 
that company; is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise, of 
10% (20% in the case of an insurance intermediary) or more 
of the voting power of A or P, or is able to exercise significant 
influence over the management of A or P by virtue of his voting 
power in that company. Increases in “control”, once they reach 
thresholds of 20%, 33% and 50% of the shares or voting 
power of an Authorised Firm or one of its parent undertakings, 
also requires the consent of the FSA. 
In order to determine whether a person or a group of 
persons is a “controller” for the purposes of FSMA, the holdings 
(shares or voting rights of the person and his ‘associate’), if any, 
are aggregated. 
FSA conduct of business rules 
The FSA’s Conduct of Business (COB) Rules apply to every 
Authorised Firm carrying on regulated activities and regulate 
the day-to-day conduct of business standards to be observed 
by Authorised Persons in carrying on regulated activities. 
The COB Rules are principle based and the scope and 
range of obligations imposed on an Authorised Firm will vary 
according to the scope of its business and range of the 
Authorised Firm’s clients. Generally speaking, however, the 
obligations imposed on an Authorised Firm by the COB Rules 
will include the need to classify its clients according to their level 
of sophistication, provide them with information about the 
Authorised Firm, meet certain standards of product disclosures 
(including fee and remuneration arrangements), ensure that 
promotional material which it produces is clear, fair and not 
misleading, assess suitability when advising on certain products, 
controls on the range and scope of advice given, manage 
conflicts of interest, report appropriately to its clients and 
provide certain protections in relation to client assets. 
Day-to-day supervision 
The FSA’s day-to-day supervision of Aviva is conducted by a 
dedicated team within its Major Retail Groups Division. The 
FSA takes a risk-based approach to its regulatory activity, 
concentrating its resources on those firms and activities which 
it assesses pose the greatest potential threats to its four 
statutory objectives of: 
Shareholder information 
Financial statements IFRS 
Financial statements MCEV 
Other information 
— maintaining confidence in the financial system 
— promoting public understanding of the financial system 
— securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers 
— reducing the extent to which it is possible for a business to 
be used for a purpose connected with financial crime 
Given our size, and the extent of our share of the UK retail 
market, a major issue within our business which causes concern 
for the FSA could have a very significant impact on these 
objectives. The FSA therefore aspires to have a ‘close and 
continuous’ relationship with us. In practice, this means that 
a wide range of Group, Regional and UK Business Unit senior 
managers have regular scheduled ‘close and continuous’ 
meetings with the FSA, and other meetings and discussions on 
specific issues take place as the need occurs. This adds up to 
weekly or even daily FSA interaction at both UK Business Unit 
and Group level, although contact at a Regional level would be 
less frequent. 
The FSA also periodically conducts a formal ARROW review 
of Aviva (which stands for Advanced Risk-Responsive Operating 
framework), to assess the level of risk that the Group poses to 
each of the FSA objectives. The last full risk assessment was 
conducted in 2009 and the next full risk assessment is due to 
start in the first half of 2011. The resulting risk mitigation 
programme (RMP) itemises those areas of potential risk or 
weakness where the FSA particularly wishes us to focus 
attention. The risk assessment and RMP are updated on an 
on-going basis between each ARROW review. 
Along with other firms in the insurance industry, our 
relationship with the FSA has recently gone through another 
significant stage in its development with the roll out of the 
individual capital assessment (ICA) regime. This is shifting 
emphasis from managing issues after the event to better 
assessing the adequacy of up-front governance, risk 
management and prevention. It has also increased focus 
on risk, controls and governance at individual entity level. 
The FSA has highlighted in its 2009 Business Plan that it 
expects to focus on: 
— Ensuring firms are soundly run and in particular that they 
adjust their business models to ensure they can remain well 
capitalised and securely funded. 
— Maintaining pressure on firms to treat customers fairly. 
— Playing a full role in modernising the global regulatory 
framework. 
— Completing the planned programme of improvements to its 
supervisory processes. 
Outside of the UK, each Aviva business is regulated by its own 
national regulator(s). However, overseas operations are also 
within the remit of the FSA for two main reasons: 
The structure of the Group means that the great majority 
of the overseas operations are owned, ultimately, by Aviva 
International Insurance (AII), a UK regulated insurance company. 
In its regulation of AII, the FSA has a legitimate interest in the 
systems and controls by which the Group manages its overseas 
businesses, to ensure that financial shocks do not flow through 
to the UK. 
Our activities within the EU are subject to the Insurance 
Groups Directive (as discussed in more detail below). This gives 
the FSA the additional formal responsibility of acting as lead 
regulator (ie the cross sector supervisory co-ordinator) for the 
Group within the EU. 
Shareholder information

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
The FSA therefore seeks to monitor the strategy and 
performance of the Group’s international businesses through 
regular ‘Close and Continuous’ meetings with the CEOs and 
Finance Directors of the overseas Regions. 
The FSA aims to play a leading role in the development of 
both EU and international regulation. It is, in particular, at the 
vanguard of the movement towards risk-based insurance 
regulation. The FSA has increased its desire for a principles 
based approach to regulation. In line with this FSA continues 
to place increasing weight on the ‘Treating Customers Fairly’ 
principle. More recently FSA has rewritten the conduct of 
business rules to remove many of the more granular 
requirements. 
Intervention and enforcement 
The FSA has extensive powers to investigate and intervene in 
the affairs of Authorised Firms and is obliged under FSMA to 
monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by, and to 
enforce the provisions of, FSMA, related secondary legislation 
and the rules made thereunder. 
The FSA’s enforcement powers, which may be exercised 
against both Authorised Firms and Approved Persons, include 
public censure, imposition of unlimited fines and, in serious 
cases, the variation or revocation of permission to carry on 
regulated activities or of an Approved Person’s status. The FSA 
may also vary or revoke an Authorised Firm’s permission to 
protect the interests of consumers or potential consumers, or 
if the Authorised Firm has not engaged in regulated activity for 
12 months, or if it is failing to meet the threshold conditions for 
authorisation. The FSA has further powers to obtain injunctions 
against Authorised Persons and to impose or seek restitution 
orders where persons have suffered loss. 
In addition to its ability to apply sanctions for market abuse, 
the FSA has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising 
under FSMA and insider dealing under Part V of the Criminal 
Justice Act 1993 and breaches of money laundering regulations. 
The FSA’s stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all 
appropriate cases. 
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) 
The FSCS is intended to compensate individuals and small 
businesses for claims against an Authorised Firm where the 
Authorised Firm is unable or unlikely to be able to meet those 
claims (generally, when it is insolvent or has gone out of 
business). Under a new funding system that started on 1 April 
2008, for the purposes of funding FSCS compensation costs, 
the FSCS levy is split into five broad classes: 
— Deposits 
— Long-term insurance and savings 
— General insurance 
— Investments 
— Home finance 
With the exception of the deposits class, each broad class is 
divided into two sub-classes based on provider/intermediation 
activities. Each of the ‘sub-classes’ is made up of firms which 
are providers or intermediaries and engage in similar styles of 
business with similar types of customer. 
The sub-classes are based on the activities a firm undertakes 
(and are aligned to their FSA permissions). A firm could be 
allocated to one or more sub-classes according to the activities 
that it undertakes. In the event of a failure of a market 
participant, the Authorised Firms in the Group could be required 
to make contributions to compensate investors. 
Restrictions on business 
Under the FSA’s Handbook, an insurance company is restricted 
from carrying on any commercial business other than insurance 
business and activities directly arising from that business. 
Therefore, the FSA authorised insurance companies in the 
Group are bound by this restriction. 
Capital and solvency rules for insurers 
Under the FSA Handbook, a UK insurer (including those within 
the Group) must hold capital resources equal to at least the 
Minimum Capital Requirement (the ‘MCR’). Insurers with 
with-profits liabilities of more than £500 million must hold 
capital equal to the higher of MCR and the Enhanced Capital 
Requirement (the ECR). The ECR is intended to provide a more 
risk responsive and “realistic” measure of a with-profits insurer’s 
capital requirements, whereas the MCR is broadly speaking 
equivalent to the previous required minimum margin and 
satisfies the minimum EU standards. 
Determination of the ECR involves the comparison of two 
separate measurements of the Authorised Firm’s financial 
resources requirements, which the FSA refers to as the ‘twin 
peaks’ approach. The two separate peaks are: 
— The requirement comprised by the mathematical reserves 
plus the ‘long-term insurance capital requirement’ (the 
LTICR), together known as the ‘regulatory peak’; and 
— A calculation of the “realistic” present value of the insurer’s 
expected future contractual liabilities together with projected 
‘fair’ discretionary bonuses to policyholders, plus a risk capital 
margin, together known as the ‘realistic peak’. 
The regulatory peak implements the Solvency I Directives, the 
latter forming part of the European Commission’s efforts to 
achieve a single European market for financial services. The 
LTICR is made up of several components, but in general is equal 
to approximately 4% of the mathematical reserves, although 
the formula varies according to the type of business written. 
All insurers must also assess for themselves the amount 
of capital needed to back their business (Individual Capital 
Assessments). If the FSA views the result of this assessment 
as insufficient, the FSA may draw up its own Individual Capital 
Guidance for the firm, which can be imposed as a requirement 
on the scope of the Authorised Firm’s permission. 
Long-term assets and liabilities 
Where a UK insurer carries on life insurance business, then long-
term business assets and liabilities – namely those assets and 
liabilities relating to life and health insurance policies – must be 
segregated from the assets and liabilities attributable to non-life 
insurance business or to shareholders. Separate accounting and 
other records must be maintained and a separate fund must be 
established to hold all receipts of long-term business. 
The extent to which long-term fund assets may be used for 
purposes other than long-term business is restricted by the rules 
in the FSA Handbook. Only the “established surplus” – the 
excess of assets over liabilities in the long-term fund, as 
determined by actuarial investigation – may be transferred so as 
to be available for other purposes. Restrictions also apply to the 
payment of dividends by the insurance company, as described 
below. The rules in the FSA Handbook for insurers require the 
maintenance of sufficient assets in the separate long-term 
insurance fund to cover the actuarially determined value of the 
insurance liabilities.

Governance 
Distribution of profits and with-profits business 
For UK authorised life insurer carrying on with-profits business, 
the FSA’s rules require that once an allocation of surplus in a 
with-profits fund has been made to policyholders, no transfer 
of assets representing any part of a subsequent surplus can be 
made, to shareholders or otherwise, unless either the “relevant 
minimum” (as defined in the FSA Handbook) of the surplus has 
been allocated to policyholders or a statutory notification 
procedure has been followed. Calculation of the relevant 
minimum is based on the percentage of the relevant surplus 
previously allocated to eligible policyholders. 
Reporting requirements 
Under the FSA Handbook, insurance companies must file with 
the FSA their audited annual accounts and statements of 
financial position and life insurers’ annual reports from the 
actuary performing the actuarial function. There is also a 
requirement to report the annual solvency position of the 
insurance company’s ultimate parent. 
The FSA uses the annual return to monitor the solvency 
(ability to meet current and future obligations such as claims 
payments to policyholders) of an insurance company. For 
general insurance business, the return is also used to assess 
retrospectively the adequacy of the company’s claims provisions. 
The directors of an insurance company are required to sign a 
certificate, which includes a statement as to whether the 
company has maintained the required minimum margin of 
solvency throughout the year. The directors must also certify 
that the company has completed its return to the FSA properly 
in accordance with the FSA’s instructions and that the directors 
are satisfied that the company has complied in all material 
respects with the requirements set out in the FSA Handbook. 
UK winding up rules 
The general insolvency laws and regulations applicable to UK 
companies are modified in certain respects in relation to UK 
insurance companies, where direct insurance claims will have 
priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors (with the 
exception of preferred creditors), including reinsurance 
creditors, on a winding-up by the court or a creditors’ voluntary 
winding up of the insurance company. Furthermore, instead of 
making a winding-up order when an insurance company has 
been proved unable to pay its debts, a UK court may, under 
section 311 of FSMA, reduce the amount of one or more of 
the insurance company’s contracts on terms and subject to 
conditions (if any) which the court considers fit. Where an 
insurance company is in financial difficulties but not in 
liquidation, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme may 
take measures for securing the transfer of all or part of the 
business to another insurance company. 
FSMA provides further protection to policyholders of 
insurance companies effecting or carrying out contracts of long-
term insurance. Unless the court orders otherwise, a liquidator 
must carry on the insurer’s business so far as it consists of 
carrying out the insurer’s contracts of long-term insurance with 
a view to it being transferred as a going concern to a person 
who may lawfully carry out those contracts. In carrying on the 
business, the liquidator may agree to the variation of any 
contracts of insurance in existence when the winding-up order 
is made, but must not effect any new contracts of insurance. 
The European Union (EU) 
In addition to its UK businesses Aviva is also currently active 
in 14 of the 27 EU member states through wholly owned 
Shareholder information

subsidiary and joint venture companies. These companies are 
subject to the laws and regulation of the EU member state in 
which they are based. However, as progress continues towards 
the creation of a single market in financial services, EU 
legislation will continue to have a significant influence on the 
legislative environment both in the UK and other EU markets. 
The EU operates by promulgating Directives that must be 
implemented into local national legislation within each EU 
member country. Directives set the minimum standards for the 
appropriate national legislatures to meet, but leave it up to the 
legislatures to decide just how they should be implemented. 
National governments are generally free to include restrictions in 
their laws beyond those required by a directive but may not pass 
laws that do not meet the minimum standard. Directives are 
written at a fairly high level of detail and consequently 
implemented in more detail at national level according to the 
local legal system. Still higher levels of detail may be imposed 
through the rules and regulations of national regulators. In the 
case of financial services businesses these rules can be extensive. 
EU financial services regulation is based on the principle of 
‘home country control’ under which the home country regulator 
is responsible for monitoring compliance with all applicable 
regulation. For life and non-life insurance business the home 
country control principle was implemented through the Third 
Life and Non-Life Directives during the mid 1990’s. This regime 
places the responsibility for such issues as solvency, actuarial 
reserves and investment of assets as well as certain governance 
issues on the home country regulator. Consequently most 
companies that have been licensed to conduct insurance 
business in one member state may conduct business or apply 
to ‘passport’ into all other member states without having to 
be separately licensed in each. The general exception is selling 
activity which continues to be regulated by the state in which 
the sale takes place. 
Insurance group directive (IGD) 
The EU has promulgated the Insurance Groups Directive 
(“IGD”), which requires member states to introduce the 
following measures to strengthen supervision of insurance 
companies which are part of a group: 
— An adjustment to the solo supervision solvency calculation 
in relation to participating interest in other insurance 
undertakings in order to eliminate ‘double-gearing’ (the 
use of the same regulatory capital in more than one entity 
of a group). 
— An additional parent undertaking solvency margin 
calculation analogous to the adjusted solo solvency margin 
test referred to above, to be applied at the level of the 
parent undertaking. 
— The introduction of new solo-supervision requirements, 
including rules as to internal control within the insurance 
undertaking regarding the production of information 
relevant to supplementary supervision, the exchange of 
information within the group and the supervision of intra­
group transactions. 
— Further provisions aimed at ensuring co-operation between 
competent regulatory authorities of member states. 
Since 31 December 2006 the group capital resources 
requirement (the parent undertaking solvency calculation 
mentioned above) has been a ‘hard’ test (ie it constitutes a 
requirement to maintain the group capital resources, rather 
than simply to make the calculation) under the FSA Handbook.

Reinsurance directive 
On 16 November 2005, the Council and the European 
Parliament adopted Directive 2005/68/EC on reinsurance (the 
“Reinsurance Directive”) which member states were obliged 
to transpose into national law by 10 December 2007. The 
Reinsurance Directive requires that all reinsurance undertakings 
be authorised in their home member state. To obtain that 
authorisation, they will need to meet strict requirements. Once 
they have done so, they will be free to carry out their activity 
anywhere in the EU through the single market passport. The 
FSA has implemented the requirements of the Directive by 
changing its Handbook with effect from 31 December 2006. 
Distance marketing directive 
Under the Distance Marketing Directive, EU member states are 
required to implement a framework of rules and guidance in 
order to protect consumers by: 
— Setting minimum standards for information that must be 
provided to consumers before entering into a financial 
services contract by ‘distance means’. 
— For certain products and services, giving a cooling-off period, 
which for general insurance is 14 days, in which a consumer 
may, without penalty, cancel such a contract. 
Insurance mediation directive 
Under the Insurance Mediation Directive, EU member states 
are required to establish a framework to: 
— Ensure that insurance and reinsurance intermediaries have 
been registered on the basis of a minimum set of 
professional and financial requirements. 
— Ensure that registered intermediaries will be able to operate 
in other member states by availing themselves of the 
freedom to provide services or by establishing a branch. 
— Impose minimum requirements, with certain limitations, as 
regards the content of the information which the insurance 
intermediaries must make available to their potential 
customers, and the arrangements for its provision. 
Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) 
Further measures towards the creation of a single market in 
financial services were incorporated into the Financial Services 
Action Plan (FSAP) adopted in 2000. The FSAP included specific 
legislative action aimed at extending (i) the single wholesale 
market (ii) creating an open and secure retail market and (iii) 
introducing state of the art prudential rules and supervision. 
The FSAP also included measures towards harmonising 
conduct of business rules, notably The Insurance Mediation 
Directive and the Distance Marketing Directive described above. 
Investment business 
With the introduction of the Investment Services Directive (ISD) 
the same home country control and passporting regime applied 
to fund management activities. In November 2007 the ISD was 
superseded by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
(MiFID). MiFID builds on the home country control principle but 
extends the range of ‘core’ investments services and activities 
that may be passported from one member state to another 
and increased clarity of responsibilities between home and 
host country jurisdictions. MiFID also introduces greater 
harmonisation governing the organisation and conduct of 
business of investment firms. 
The Capital Requirement Directive which came into force 
on 1 January 2007 sets out for the first time directive-based 
capital requirements for all investment firms brought into 
regulation by MiFID. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
The standards drafted by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) have been mandatory for about 7,000 
EU listed companies since 1 January 2005. For standards on 
insurance contracts a two phased approach has been adopted 
by the IASB. Under the interim solution adopted as IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts, insurers apply a variety of existing local 
accounting practices subject to a number of adjustments. 
Proposals for a final standard for accounting for insurance 
contracts are currently under review but might not be agreed 
before 2011 or later. 
Solvency II 
On 5 May 2009, the European Parliament formally adopted 
the Solvency II Level 1 Directive. Solvency II represents a 
fundamental change in European regulation and will result in 
a more sophisticated risk based capital approach. It establishes 
a solvency system that is better matched to the true risks of 
insurers enabling supervisors to protect policyholder interests 
as effectively as possible in accordance with common principles 
across the EU. 
Since the approval, the focus has been on the development 
of the Level 2 implementing measures advice published by the 
CEIOPS which fill in the detail under Level 1 and focused on 
technical issues. Aviva has been actively participating in the 
process by providing responses to the CEIOPS as well as 
participating in the key European industry working groups who 
provide the voice of industry in on-going negotiation in Brussels. 
The formal CEIOPS consultation process has already closed 
and the European Commission are now considering the 
wording on the implementing measures that will be finalised 
by the end of 2010. Full implementation of Solvency II will be 
required in October 2012. 
Future EU developments 
The integration of retail financial services and the increased 
awareness of consumers to financial issues remain high on 
the EU agenda. This is tending to drive a number of initiatives 
including the Single Market review which will encompass 
reviews of the working of the retail financial services markets, 
adequacy of consumer protection and contractual rights 
provisions as well as more specific proposals on investment 
products and mortgages. 
In addition to the EU wide initiatives there have also been 
developments within our major EU markets, including: 
In France all applicable EU Directives have now been 
brought together in a single insurance code supervised by 
the Authorité de Contrôle des Assurances et des Mutuelles 
(ACAM). In the Netherlands, where Aviva operates under the 
Delta Lloyd brand, a new Financial Services Act replacing eight 
former supervision Acts came into force on 1 January 2007. 
Under the new Act the role of the two market regulators – 
The Nederlandische Bank (DNB) for prudential issues and the 
Authority for Financial Markets (AFM) for conduct of business 
are clearly defined. 
Primary EU insurance regulation in Ireland has been 
implemented through two Acts and supervised by the Financial 
Regulator. In July 2007 the Consumer Protection Code was 
introduced, a major legislative development bringing together 
comprehensive rules to apply across the financial services sector. 
In both Spain and Italy where we operate through joint 
ventures with local banks and savings institutions there has 
been significant progress in revising local regulation and

On Poland’s accession to the EU in 2003 the introduction of 
a number of Acts continued the liberalisation of insurance law 
started by the Insurance Act of 1990. The 2003 Acts introduced 
EU law on insurance activities covering areas including licensing, 
supervision, reserving and technical provisions, financial 
reporting, selling activities, pension fund supervision and the 
role of an insurance ombudsman. The 2006 Act on Financial 
Market Supervision created a single regulator the Polish 
Financial Supervision Authority (KNF). The process was 
completed on 1 January 2008 when the KNF assumed 
responsibility for bank regulation from the National Bank 
of Poland. 
The European Commission has adopted draft legislation 
that will create a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and set 
up a European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS). The ESFS 
will be composed of national supervisors and three new 
European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) for banking, insurance 
and securities. The ESAs will have powers to develop technical 
standards and guidelines and direct national supervisors to take 
action or refrain from action in cases where national supervisors 
cannot reach agreement between them and where the 
Commission has decided that an emergency situation exists. 
The Commission is now looking to the Council and Parliament 
for rapid adoption so that the new structures can begin 
functioning in 2010. 
United States 
We write life and annuity business in the United States through 
Aviva USA, a wholly owned subsidiary formed by the merger of 
Aviva Life Insurance Company of America with AmerUS which 
it acquired in July 2006. Aviva USA is domiciled in Iowa and 
licensed to conduct business in all 50 states. In New York it 
operates a wholly owned subsidiary Aviva Life Insurance 
Company of New York. 
There is no federal system of regulation for the insurance 
businesses. Rather, individual states have authority to pass 
statutes, adopt regulation or issue directives to regulate 
insurance activities within their jurisdiction. 
Consequently, life insurance companies are subject to 
regulation both in the state in which they are domiciled as well 
as in each of the individual states in which they operate. State 
regulation can vary in detail from state to state. All have laws 
and regulations covering the financial aspects of the insurance 
business including standards of solvency, reserves reinsurance 
and capital adequacy. In addition, most states have specific 
regulation governing licensing and conduct of selling agents as 
well as the approval of products and associated product forms 
and literature. 
Federal initiatives 
While the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
(NAIC) has no statutory powers, its members are the insurance 
commissioners in each state and it acts as a forum to develop 
and propose model laws and regulations. Each state then 
decides whether to adopt the NAIC model laws or regulations 
and each state may make changes to the adoption process. 
However, the models are generally widely adopted. An 
example is the ‘Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Act’ 
which has been widely adopted by states for a broad range 
of transactions. 
NAIC has a commitment to modernising the state based system 
of insurance regulation and is pushing forward an action plan 
aimed at achieving consistency of approach between states on 
a number of issues including consumer protection, licensing, 
solvency and changes in insurance company control. The 
American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) is proposing an optional 
federal charter (OFC) under which life insurers could choose 
to be federally regulated instead of state regulated. It is 
envisaged that the OFC would operate within the NAIC 
modernisation plan. 
In addition to the OFC there have been legislative proposals 
for federal reform in the US. The legislation that is currently 
pending would impose stricter prudential standards on 
systemically significant financial companies, higher risk financial 
activities and introduce new mechanisms for resolving failures of 
significant financial companies. The legislative proposals require 
additional stress testing and reporting on a regular basis. In 
addition, a federal insurance office (FIO) will be established with 
a remit to monitor the insurance industry, co-ordinate federal 
efforts and develop federal policy on international insurance 
matters. While the FIO will have no regulatory authority over the 
business of insurance it will be required to conduct a study of 
how to improve and modernise insurance regulation and report 
to Congress no later than one year after the proposed 
legislations comes into force. 
Additionally, there is active discussion within the NAIC of 
moving to a principles-based valuation system for the setting 
of reserves and capital for life insurance companies. This could 
change our statutory reserve and capital requirements 
significantly and it is not possible to estimate the impact on our 
financial condition and results of operation at this time. 
On 17 December 2008 the SEC voted in favour of adopting 
a new rule 151A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
The effect of the rule change is to bring indexed annuity 
products within SEC regulation on a similar basis as the so called 
‘variable’ products which are regulated as securities. The rule 
was set to become effective on 12 January 2011 and apply to 
equity indexed annuities issued on or after that date. However, 
after a legal challenge by several life insurers in the US Court 
of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the court remanded rule 151A 
back to the SEC on 21 July 2009, requesting further technical 
analysis. One of the life insurers involved requested the Court 
to delay the effective date of the rule change to two years after 
SEC completes their analysis. The SEC has now consented to 
the delay but the court is now considering whether it should 
set aside the rule entirely. Aviva believes indexed annuities 
represent an important product within the US savings and 
retirement market and that we will be able to meet the 
requirements of the new rule 151A under the Securities Act 
of 1933.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Risk-based capital 
The NAIC has developed risk-based capital standards for life 
insurance companies as well as a model act for state legislatures 
to enact. The model act requires that life insurance companies 
report on a formula-based, risk-based capital standard that they 
calculate by applying factors to various asset, premium and 
reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk 
characteristics of a company, including asset risk, insurance risk, 
interest rate risk and business risk. The NAIC designed the 
formula as an early warning tool to identify potentially 
inadequately capitalised companies for purposes of initiating 
regulatory action. The model act imposes broad confidentiality 
requirements on those engaged in the insurance business 
(including insurers, agents, brokers and others) and on state 
insurance departments as to the use and publication of risk-
based capital data. 
Any state adopting the model act gives the state insurance 
commissioner explicit regulatory authority to require various 
actions by, or take various actions against, insurance companies 
whose adjusted capital does not meet minimum risk-based 
capital standards. The Iowa Insurance Commissioner takes into 
account the NAIC’s risk-based capital standards to determine 
adequate compliance with Iowa insurance law. 
Effective 31 December 2005, the NAIC implemented new 
requirements, referred to as C-3 Phase II, for calculating risk 
based capital in connection with variable annuity products with 
death and living benefit guarantees. These changes did not have 
a material effect on our US operations, and at 31 December 
2008, the Company’s total adjusted capital under the NAIC’s 
definition substantially exceeded Iowa standards. 
Canada 
We write property and casualty business in Canada via a 
number of wholly owned companies. 
Insurance business in Canada is regulated federally by the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) with 
the focus very much on prudential supervision, ie capital 
adequacy, solvency etc. OSFI derives its powers from the federal 
Insurance Companies Act (Canada) which governs the structure 
and operation of federally incorporated insurance companies. 
The capital adequacy of insurance companies is monitored 
under the Minimum Capital Test (MCT) – a risk based 
framework allowing for capital to be assessed on the basis of 
an individual company’s risk profile taking account of the 
investments held and insurance business being written. 
Companies have their own internal MCT target as well as being 
expected to maintain capital in excess of 150% of the OSFI 
minimum requirement. 
There are also 10 individual provincial regulators each 
regulating predominantly conduct of business issues such as 
policy terms and conditions, pricing and underwriting of 
companies they have licensed to write business in the province. 
Asia Pacific 
We operate within the Asia Pacific region through a network 
of subsidiary companies either wholly owned or established as 
a joint venture with a local partner. Our business in the region 
is predominately long-term and savings business, with small 
general insurance and health operations. 
There are wholly owned businesses in Singapore and Hong 
Kong. Aviva operates in China, India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, 
Taiwan and Korea which, depending on the nature and extent 
of the control we are able to exert, are either accounted for as 
subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. 
The Asia Pacific region is made up of a number of widely 
differing and independent markets. The markets tend to be 
at different stages in their development but each has its own 
regulatory structures and Aviva fully complies with the local 
regulation in each of the countries in which it operates. 
Industry regulation across the region typically focuses on 
financial stability, ie minimum capital and the basis for 
calculating solvency, reserves and policyholder liability. In many 
of the markets across the region Regulators have the power to 
revoke operating licences, regulate shareholder structures and 
the participation in and the payment of dividends. Markets 
within the region are moving quickly to modernise insurance 
regulation with an increasing focus on governance and conduct 
of business. 
Intellectual property 
Our primary brands in the UK (Aviva, Norwich Union, RAC) are 
registered trade marks in the UK and elsewhere. 
We own approximately 300 registered or pending marks in 
the UK, including Community trade marks having effect in the 
entire EU. 
We have an active programme of review of marks and 
watching for infringements. There are no material infringements 
in the UK known to us as at the date of this report, either by the 
Group or third parties.

Aviva plc 
Independent auditor’s report to the Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
shareholders of Aviva plc 

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of Aviva plc for the year ended 
31 December 2009 which comprise the Accounting Policies, the Consolidated and Parent Company Income Statements, the Pro 
Forma Reconciliation of Group Operating Profit to Profit before Tax, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of 
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company Statements of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, and the related notes 
1 to 59 and A to I. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 to the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 92, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
— the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2009 and of the Group’s and the Parent company’s profit for the year then ended 
— the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
— the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Separate Opinion in relation to IFRSs 
As explained in the Accounting Policies to the Group financial statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its legal 
obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB). 
In our opinion, the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; 
— the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and 
— the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement, set out on page 90 with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the 
financial statements.

Aviva plc 
Accounting policies Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Aviva plc (the “Company”), a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK), together with its 
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group” or “Aviva”) transacts life assurance and long-term savings business, fund management, 
and most classes of general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries, associates and branches in the UK, Ireland, 
continental Europe, United States (US), Canada, Asia, Australia and other countries throughout the world. 
The Group is managed on a regional basis, reflecting the management structure whereby a member of the Executive 
Management team is accountable to the Group Chief Executive for the operating segment for which he is responsible. Further 
details of the reportable segments are given in note 4. 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. 
(A) Basis of presentation 
Since 2005, all European Union listed companies have been required to prepare consolidated financial statements using 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by 
the European Union (EU). The date of transition to IFRS was 1 January 2004. In addition to fulfilling their legal obligation to comply 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the Group and Company have also complied with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and applicable at 31 December 2009. 
In 2008, the IASB issued a revised version of IFRS 3, Business Combinations, which introduces a number of changes in 
accounting for such transactions that will impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period an 
acquisition occurs, and future reported results. A consequential amendment to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements, requires a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) to be accounted for as an equity 
transaction, rather than giving rise to goodwill or a gain or loss. Other consequential amendments were made to IAS 7, Statement 
of Cash Flows, IAS 12, Income Taxes, IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, IAS 28, Investments in Associates, 
and IAS 31, Interests in Joint Ventures. These are applicable prospectively for accounting periods commencing 1 July 2009 or later, 
and are therefore not applicable for the current accounting period. On adoption, they will impact the areas noted above in the 
Group’s financial reporting. 
In 2009, the IASB issued IFRS 9, Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement, the first part of a replacement 
standard for IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. This is applicable prospectively for accounting periods 
commencing 1 January 2013 or later, and is therefore not applicable for the current accounting period. It has not yet been 
endorsed by the EU but, on adoption, will require us to review the classification of certain investments while allowing us to retain 
the fair value measurement option as we deem necessary. 
During 2008 and 2009, the IASB also issued amendments to IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of IFRS, IAS 32, Financial Instruments: 
Presentation, IAS 39 and the results of its annual improvements project. Further amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 2, Share-Based 
Payment, IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures, and the results of its second annual improvements project have been issued but have 
not yet been endorsed by the EU. These are applicable prospectively for accounting periods commencing 1 July 2009 or later, and 
are therefore not applicable for the current accounting period. On adoption, they will not have any material impact on the Group’s 
financial reporting. 
IFRIC interpretation 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, and interpretation 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities 
with Equity Instruments, as well as an amendment to interpretation 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum 
Funding Requirements and their Interaction, were issued during 2008 and 2009 but the latter two have not yet been endorsed 
by the EU. These are applicable prospectively for accounting periods commencing 1 July 2009 or later, and are therefore not 
applicable for the current accounting period. On adoption, they will not have any impact on our financial reporting. 
In accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, the Group has applied existing accounting practices for insurance and 
participating investment contracts, modified as appropriate to comply with the IFRS framework and applicable standards. 
Further details are given in policy F below. 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured in the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated 
in sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. Unless otherwise noted, the amounts shown in these 
financial statements are in millions of pounds sterling (£m). As supplementary information, consolidated financial information is 
also presented in euros. 
The separate financial statements of the Company are on pages 275 to 282. 
(B) Operating profit 
The long-term nature of much of the Group’s operations means that, for management’s decision-making and internal performance 
management, short-term realised and unrealised investment gains and losses are treated as non-operating items. The Group 
focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term 
and non long-term businesses. Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial 
investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected 
movements in liabilities. Variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic 
assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit. For non-long-term business, the total investment 
income, including realised and unrealised gains, is analysed between that calculated using a longer term return and short-term 
fluctuations from that level. Further details of this analysis and the assumptions used are given in notes 8 and 9. 
(C) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that 
affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, statement of financial position, other primary statements and notes to 
the financial statements.

Critical accounting policies 
The major areas of judgement on policy application are considered to be over whether Group entities should be consolidated (set 
out in policy D), on product classification (set out in policy F) and in the classification of financial investments (set out in policy S). 
Use of estimates 
All estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge 
and their predictions of future events and actions. Actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly. 
The table below sets out those items we consider particularly susceptible to changes in estimates and assumptions, and the 
relevant accounting policy.

Fair values of financial investments S 
Impairment of financial investments S 
Fair value of derivative financial instruments T 
Deferred acquisition costs and other assets W 
Provisions and contingent liabilities Z 
Pension obligations AA 
Deferred income taxes AB 
(D) Consolidation principles 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities) in which the Group, directly or indirectly, has power to exercise 
control over financial and operating policies in order to gain economic benefits. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on 
which effective control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from consolidation from the date the Group no longer has 
effective control. All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group 
companies have been eliminated. 
From 1 January 2004, the date of first time adoption of IFRS, the Group is required to use the purchase method of accounting 
to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Under this method, the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets 
given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. The 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill (see policy 
N below). Any surplus of the acquirer’s interest in the subsidiary’s net assets over the cost of acquisition is credited to the income 
statement. 
Merger accounting and the merger reserve 
Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the “pooling of interests method” 
(or merger accounting), which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative 
accounting periods. Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated 
statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company 
for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary’s own share capital and share premium account. These 
transactions have not been restated, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transitional arrangements. 
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration 
includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 
1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006. 
Investment vehicles 
In several countries, the Group has invested in a number of specialised investment vehicles such as Open-ended Investment 
Companies (OEICs) and unit trusts. These invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties, and distribute 
most of their income. The Group’s percentage ownership in these vehicles can fluctuate from day-to-day according to the Group’s 
and third-party participation in them. Where Group companies are deemed to control such vehicles, with control determined based 
on an analysis of the guidance in IAS 27 and SIC 12, they are consolidated, with the interests of parties other than Aviva being 
classified as liabilities. These appear as “Net asset value attributable to unitholders” in the consolidated statement of financial 
position. Where the Group does not control such vehicles, and these investments are held by its insurance or investment funds, 
they do not meet the definition of associates (see below) and are, instead, carried at fair value through profit and loss within 
financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position, in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. 
As part of their investment strategy, the UK and certain European long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a 
number of property limited partnerships (PLPs), either directly or via property unit trusts (PUTs), through a mix of capital and loans. 
The PLPs are managed by general partners (GPs), in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and 
which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs. The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary. 
Accounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiaries, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings 
in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement. Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a 
subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated. Where the partnership is managed by a contractual 
agreement such that no party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Group’s partnership share in the PLP (including its indirect 
stake via the relevant PUT and GP) may be greater than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been classified as joint ventures. Where the 
Financial statements IFRS   
 
 
 
 
132 
Aviva plc Accounting policies continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate influence, the relevant investments are carried at fair value through 
profit and loss within financial investments. 
Associates and joint ventures 
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but which it does not control. Generally, it is presumed that 
the Group has significant influence if it has between 20% and 50% of voting rights. Joint ventures are entities whereby the Group 
and other parties undertake an economic activity which is subject to joint control arising from a contractual agreement. In a 
number of these, the Group’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities may be greater than 50% but the terms of the relevant 
agreements make it clear that control is not exercised. Such jointly-controlled entities are referred to as joint ventures in these 
financial statements. 
Gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the associates and joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment 
of the asset transferred between entities. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, 
the cost of the investment in a given associate or joint venture, together with the Group’s share of that entity’s post-acquisition 
changes to shareholders’ funds, is included as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position. As explained in policy N, 
the cost includes goodwill identified on acquisition. The Group’s share of their post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the 
income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Equity accounting is 
discontinued when the Group no longer has significant influence over the investment. 
If the Group’s share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the undertaking, the Group does 
not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity. 
The Company’s investments 
In the Company statement of financial position, subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at their fair values, estimated using 
applicable valuation models underpinned by the Company’s market capitalisation. These investments are classified as available for 
sale (AFS) financial assets, with changes in their fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a 
separate investment valuation reserve within equity. 
(E) Foreign currency translation 
Income statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at average exchange 
rates for the year while their statements of financial position are translated at the year end exchange rates. Exchange differences 
arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and of borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to 
the currency translation reserve within equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, such exchange differences are transferred out of this 
reserve and are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. The cumulative translation differences were 
deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS. 
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement. 
Translation differences on debt securities and other monetary financial assets measured at fair value and designated as held at 
fair value through profit or loss (FV) (see policy S) are included in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement. For 
monetary financial assets designated as AFS, translation differences are calculated as if they were carried at amortised cost and so 
are recognised in the income statement, whilst foreign exchange differences arising from fair value gains and losses are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and included in the investment valuation reserve within equity. Translation differences on non-
monetary items, such as equities which are designated as FV, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss, whereas such 
differences on AFS equities are included in the investment valuation reserve. 
(F) Product classification 
Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer 
to make significant additional payments in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance, at the inception of 
the contract. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be 
reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be 
insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts. 
Some insurance and investment contracts contain a discretionary participating feature, which is a contractual right to receive 
additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. These are referred to as participating contracts. 
As noted in policy A above, insurance contracts and participating investment contracts in general continue to be measured and 
accounted for under existing accounting practices at the later of the date of transition to IFRS or the date of the acquisition of the 
entity, in accordance with IFRS 4. Accounting for insurance contracts in UK companies is determined in accordance with the 
Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers, the most recent version of which was issued in 
December 2005 and amended in December 2006. In certain businesses, the accounting policies or accounting estimates have been 
changed, as permitted by IFRS 4 and IAS 8 respectively, to remeasure designated insurance liabilities to reflect current market 
interest rates and changes to regulatory capital requirements. When accounting policies or accounting estimates have been 
changed, and adjustments to the measurement basis have occurred, the financial statements of that year will have disclosed the 
impacts accordingly. 
One such example is our adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 27, Life Assurance, (FRS 27) which was issued by the UK’s 
Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in December 2004. Aviva, along with other major insurance companies and the ABI, signed a

Shareholder information 
Financial statements IFRS 
Financial statements MCEV 
Other information 
Memorandum of Understanding with the ASB, under which we voluntarily agreed to adopt in full the standard from 2005 in the 
Group’s IFRS financial statements. FRS 27 adds to the requirements of IFRS but does not vary them in any way. The additional 
requirements of FRS 27 are detailed in policy K below and in note 55. 
(G) Premiums earned 
Premiums on long-term insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are recognised as income when receivable, 
except for investment-linked premiums which are accounted for when the corresponding liabilities are recognised. For single 
premium business, this is the date from which the policy is effective. For regular premium contracts, receivables are taken at the 
date when payments are due. Premiums are shown before deduction of commission and before any sales-based taxes or duties. 
Where policies lapse due to non-receipt of premiums, then all the related premium income accrued but not received from the date 
they are deemed to have lapsed is offset against premiums. 
General insurance and health premiums written reflect business incepted during the year, and exclude any sales-based taxes 
or duties. Unearned premiums are those proportions of the premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the 
statement of financial position date. Unearned premiums are calculated on either a daily or monthly pro rata basis. Premiums 
collected by intermediaries, but not yet received, are assessed based on estimates from underwriting or past experience, and are 
included in premiums written. 
Deposits collected under investment contracts without a discretionary participating feature (non-participating contracts) are 
not accounted for through the income statement, except for the fee income (covered in policy H) and the investment income 
attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the 
investment contract liability. 
(H) Other investment contract fee revenue 
Investment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration, investment management, surrenders or other contract 
services. The fees may be for fixed amounts or vary with the amounts being managed, and will generally be charged as an 
adjustment to the policyholder’s balance. The fees are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are collected unless they 
relate to services to be provided in future periods, in which case they are deferred and recognised as the service is provided. 
Initiation and other “front-end” fees (fees that are assessed against the policyholder balance as consideration for origination 
of the contract) are charged on some non-participating investment and investment fund management contracts. Where the 
investment contract is recorded at amortised cost, these fees are deferred and recognised over the expected term of the policy by 
an adjustment to the effective yield. Where the investment contract is measured at fair value, the front-end fees that relate to the 
provision of investment management services are deferred and recognised as the services are provided. 
(I) Other fee and commission income 
Other fee and commission income consists primarily of fund management fees, income from the RAC’s non-insurance activities, 
distribution fees from mutual funds, commissions on reinsurance ceded, commission revenue from the sale of mutual fund shares, 
and transfer agent fees for shareholder record keeping. Reinsurance commissions receivable are deferred in the same way as 
acquisition costs, as described in policy W. All other fee and commission income is recognised as the services are provided. 
(J) Net investment income 
Investment income consists of dividends, interest and rents receivable for the year, movements in amortised cost on debt securities, 
realised gains and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on FV investments (as defined in policy S). Dividends on equity securities 
are recorded as revenue on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield 
on the investment. It includes the interest rate differential on forward foreign exchange contracts. Rental income is recognised on 
an accruals basis. 
A gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds 
received, net of transaction costs, and its original cost or amortised cost as appropriate. 
Unrealised gains and losses, arising on investments which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, 
represent the difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase 
value during the year, less the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the 
year. Realised gains or losses on investment property represent the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the property. 
(K) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities 
Claims 
Long-term business claims reflect the cost of all claims arising during the year, including claims handling costs, as well as 
policyholder bonuses accrued in anticipation of bonus declarations. 
General insurance and health claims incurred include all losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, related 
handling costs, a reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from 
previous years. 
Claims handling costs include internal and external costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims. 
Internal costs include all direct expenses of the claims department and any part of the general administrative costs directly 
attributable to the claims function.

Long-term business provisions 
Under current IFRS requirements, insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured using accounting policies 
consistent with those adopted previously under existing accounting practices, with the exception of liabilities remeasured to reflect 
current market interest rates and those relating to UK with-profit and non-profit contracts, to be consistent with the value of the 
backing assets. For liabilities relating to UK with-profit contracts, the Group has adopted FRS 27, Life Assurance, as described in 
policy F above, in addition to the requirements of IFRS. 
In the United States, shadow adjustments are made to the liabilities or related deferred acquisition costs and are recognised 
directly in other comprehensive income. This means that the measurement of these items is adjusted for unrealised gains or losses 
on the backing assets such as AFS financial investments (see policy S), that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, 
in the same way as if those gains or losses had been realised. 
The long-term business provisions are calculated separately for each life operation, based either on local regulatory 
requirements or existing local GAAP at the later of the date of transition to IFRS or the date of the acquisition of the entity, and 
actuarial principles consistent with those applied in the UK. Each calculation represents a determination within a range of possible 
outcomes, where the assumptions used in the calculations depend on the circumstances prevailing in each life operation. The 
principal assumptions are disclosed in note 38(b). For liabilities of the UK with-profit funds, FRS 27 requires liabilities to be 
calculated as the realistic basis liabilities as set out by the UK’s Financial Services Authority, adjusted to remove the shareholders’ 
share of future bonuses. For UK non-profit insurance contracts, the Group applies the realistic regulatory basis as set out in the 
FSA Policy Statement 06/14, Prudential Changes for Insurers, where applicable. 
Present value of future profits (PVFP) on non-participating business written in a with-profit fund 
For UK with-profit life funds falling within the scope of the FSA realistic capital regime, and hence FRS 27, an amount may be 
recognised for the present value of future profits on non-participating business written in a with-profit fund where the 
determination of the realistic value of liabilities in that with-profit fund takes account, directly or indirectly, of this value. This 
amount is recognised as a reduction in the liability rather than as an asset in the statement of financial position, and is then 
apportioned between the amounts that have been taken into account in the measurement of liabilities and other amounts which 
are shown as an adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus. 
Unallocated divisible surplus 
In certain participating long-term insurance and investment business, the nature of the policy benefits is such that the division 
between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain. Amounts whose allocation to either policyholders or 
shareholders has not been determined by the end of the financial year are held within liabilities as an unallocated divisible surplus. 
If the aggregate carrying value of liabilities for a particular participating business fund is in excess of the aggregate carrying 
value of its assets, then the difference is held as a negative unallocated divisible surplus balance, subject to recoverability from 
margins in that fund’s participating business. Any excess of this difference over the recoverable amount is charged to net income 
in the reporting period. 
Embedded derivatives 
Embedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts 
for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are not separately measured. All other embedded derivatives 
are separated and measured at fair value, if they are not considered as closely related to the host insurance contract or do not 
meet the definition of an insurance contract. Fair value reflects own credit risk to the extent the embedded derivative is not fully 
collateralised. 
Liability adequacy 
At each reporting date, an assessment is made of whether the recognised long-term business provisions are adequate, using 
current estimates of future cash flows. If that assessment shows that the carrying amount of the liabilities (less related assets) is 
insufficient in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up an 
additional provision in the statement of financial position. 
General insurance and health provisions 
(i) Outstanding claims provisions 
General insurance and health outstanding claims provisions are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not 
settled at the statement of financial position date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs. Significant 
delays are experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of 
liability business, including environmental and pollution exposures, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at 
the statement of financial position date. Any estimate represents a determination within a range of possible outcomes. Further 
details of estimation techniques are given in note 38(c). 
Provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency 
at the reporting date, having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims. The discount rate is set at the start of the 
accounting period with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating 
profit as an economic assumption change. The range of discount rates used is described in note 38(c). Outstanding claims 
provisions are valued net of an allowance for expected future recoveries. Recoveries include non-insurance assets that have been 
acquired by exercising rights to salvage and subrogation under the terms of insurance contracts.

(ii) Provision for unearned premiums 
The proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred 
as a provision for unearned premiums. The change in this provision is taken to the income statement as recognition of revenue 
over the period of risk. 
(iii) Liability adequacy 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews its unexpired risks and carries out a liability adequacy test for any overall excess of 
expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums, using the current estimates of future cash flows under 
its contracts after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the relevant general business 
provisions. If these estimates show that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities (less related deferred acquisition costs) is 
insufficient in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up a 
provision in the statement of financial position. 
Other assessments and levies 
The Group is subject to various periodic insurance-related assessments or guarantee fund levies. Related provisions are established 
where there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event. Such amounts are not included in insurance 
liabilities but are included under “Provisions” in the statement of financial position. 
(L) Non-participating investment contract liabilities 
Claims 
For non-participating investment contracts with an account balance, claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account 
balance released. 
Contract liabilities 
Deposits collected under non-participating investment contracts are not accounted for through the income statement, except for 
the investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position 
as an adjustment to the investment contract liability. 
The majority of the Group’s contracts classified as non-participating investment contracts are unit-linked contracts and are 
measured at fair value. Certain liabilities for non-linked non-participating contracts are measured at amortised cost. 
The fair value liability is determined in accordance with IAS 39, using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of 
the amount for which the liability could be settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. For unit-
linked contracts, the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, plus additional non-unit reserves if required based on 
a discounted cash flow analysis. For non-linked contracts, the fair value liability is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with 
allowance for risk calibrated to match the market price for risk. 
Amortised cost is calculated as the fair value of consideration received at the date of initial recognition, less the net effect of 
payments such as transaction costs and front-end fees, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation (using the effective interest rate 
method) of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity value, and less any write-down for surrender payments. 
The effective interest rate is the one that equates the discounted cash payments to the initial amount. At each reporting date, the 
amortised cost liability is determined as the value of future best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. 
(M) Reinsurance 
The Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of business. 
Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were 
considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business. The cost of reinsurance related 
to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies, using assumptions consistent with 
those used to account for these policies. 
Where general insurance liabilities are discounted, any corresponding reinsurance assets are also discounted using consistent 
assumptions. 
Gains or losses on buying retroactive reinsurance are recognised in the income statement immediately at the date of purchase 
and are not amortised. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated income 
statement and statement of financial position as appropriate. 
Reinsurance assets primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance 
liabilities. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provisions or 
settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract. 
Reinsurance contracts that principally transfer financial risk are accounted for directly through the statement of financial 
position and are not included in reinsurance assets or liabilities. A deposit asset or liability is recognised, based on the consideration 
paid or received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained by the reinsured. 
If a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount accordingly and recognises that impairment loss in 
the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after 
initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, 
and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.

(N) Goodwill, AVIF and intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 (the date 
of transition to IFRS) is carried at its book value (original cost less cumulative amortisation) on that date, less any impairment 
subsequently incurred. Goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against reserves and has not been reinstated. 
Goodwill arising on the Group’s investments in subsidiaries since that date is shown as a separate asset, whilst that on associates 
and joint ventures is included within the carrying value of those investments. 
Acquired value of in-force business (AVIF) 
The present value of future profits on a portfolio of long-term insurance and investment contracts, acquired either directly or 
through the purchase of a subsidiary, is recognised as an asset. If the AVIF results from the acquisition of an investment in a joint 
venture or an associate, it is held within the carrying amount of that investment. In all cases, the AVIF is amortised over the useful 
lifetime of the related contracts in the portfolio on a systematic basis. The rate of amortisation is chosen by considering the profile 
of the additional value of in-force business acquired and the expected depletion in its value. The value of the acquired in-force 
long-term business is reviewed annually for any impairment in value and any reductions are charged as expenses in the 
income statement. 
Intangible assets 
Intangibles consist primarily of brands, certain of which have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives, and contractual 
relationships such as access to distribution networks and customer lists. The economic lives of the latter are determined by 
considering relevant factors such as usage of the asset, typical product life cycles, potential obsolescence, maintenance costs, the 
stability of the industry, competitive position, and the period of control over the assets. These intangibles are amortised over their 
useful lives, which range from five to 30 years, using the straight-line method. 
The amortisation charge for the year is included in the income statement under “Other operating expenses”. For intangibles 
with finite lives, a provision for impairment will be charged where evidence of such impairment is observed. Intangibles with 
indefinite lives are subject to regular impairment testing, as described below. 
Impairment testing 
For impairment testing, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been allocated to cash-generating units. The 
carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances or 
events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are written down for impairment 
where the recoverable amount is insufficient to support its carrying value. Further details on goodwill allocation and impairment 
testing are given in note 16(b). 
(O) Property and equipment 
Owner-occupied properties are carried at their revalued amounts, which are supported by market evidence, and movements are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to a separate reserve within equity. When such properties are sold, the 
accumulated revaluation surpluses are transferred from this reserve to retained earnings. These properties are depreciated down to 
their estimated residual values over their useful lives. All other items classed as property and equipment within the statement of 
financial position are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Investment properties under construction are included within property and equipment until completion, and are stated at cost 
less any provision for impairment in their values. 
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method to write-down the cost of other assets to their residual values over their 
estimated useful lives as follows: 
— Land No depreciation 
— Properties under construction No depreciation 
— Owner-occupied properties, and related mechanical and electrical equipment 25 years 
— Motor vehicles Three-years, or lease term if longer 
— Computer equipment Three to five years 
— Other assets Three to five years 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed regularly, and at least at each financial year end, 
and adjusted if appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written 
down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference 
to their carrying amount. 
Until 1 January 2009, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of property and equipment were 
expensed as incurred. With effect from 1 January 2009, such costs are capitalised. All repairs and maintenance costs are charged to 
the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the 
carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of 
performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group and the renovation replaces an identifiable part of the asset. Major 
renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.

(P) Investment property 
Investment property is held for long-term rental yields and is not occupied by the Group. Completed investment property is stated 
at its fair value, which is supported by market evidence, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by local qualified staff of the 
Group in overseas operations. Changes in fair values are recorded in the income statement in net investment income. 
(Q) Impairment of non-financial assets 
Property and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset’s net selling price and value 
in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows. 
(R) Derecognition and offset of financial assets and financial liabilities 
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where: 
— The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired. 
— The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without 
material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement;. 
— The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and has either transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset. 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously. 
(S) Financial investments 
The Group classifies its investments as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FV) or financial assets available 
for sale (AFS). The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired, and is determined by local 
management at initial recognition. The FV category has two subcategories – those that meet the definition as being held for 
trading and those the Group chooses to designate as FV (referred to in this accounting policy as “other than trading”). 
In general, the FV category is used as, in most cases, the Group’s investment or risk management strategy is to manage its 
financial investments on a fair value basis. Debt securities and equity securities, which the Group buys with the intention to resell in 
the short term, are classified as trading, as are non-hedge derivatives (see policy T below). All other securities in the FV category are 
classified as other than trading. The AFS category is used where the relevant long-term business liability (including shareholders’ 
funds) is passively managed, as well as in certain fund management and non-insurance operations. 
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the assets, at their fair values. Debt securities are initially recorded at their fair value, which is taken to be amortised cost, 
with amortisation credited or charged to the income statement. Investments classified as trading, other than trading and AFS are 
subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of trading and other than trading investments are included in the 
income statement in the period in which they arise. Changes in the fair value of securities classified as AFS are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and recorded in a separate investment valuation reserve within equity. 
Investments carried at fair value are measured using a fair value hierarchy, described in note 24(b), with values based on 
quoted bid prices or amounts derived from cash flow models. Fair values for unlisted equity securities are estimated using 
applicable price/earnings or price/cash flow ratios refined to reflect the specific circumstances of the issuer. 
When securities classified as AFS are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are transferred out of the 
investment valuation reserve to the income statement with a corresponding movement through other comprehensive income. 
Financial guarantees are recognised initially at their fair value and are subsequently amortised over the duration of the 
contract. A liability is recognised for amounts payable under the guarantee if it is more likely than not that the guarantee will be 
called upon. 
Impairment 
The Group reviews the carrying value of its investments on a regular basis. If the carrying value of an investment is greater than 
the recoverable amount, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the income statement in the period of impairment. 
The following policies are used to determine the level of any impairment, some of which involve considerable judgement: 
AFS debt securities: An AFS debt security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred which has 
impaired the expected cash flows, ie where all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security are not considered 
collectible. An impairment charge, measured as the difference between the security’s fair value and amortised cost, is recognised 
when the issuer is known to be either in default or in financial difficulty. Determining when an issuer is in financial difficulty 
requires the use of judgement, and we consider a number of factors including industry risk factors, financial condition, liquidity 
position and near-term prospects of the issuer, credit rating declines and a breach of contract. A decline in fair value below 
amortised cost due to changes in risk-free interest rates does not necessarily represent objective evidence of a loss event. 
Financial statements IFRS   
 
 
 
 
138 
Aviva plc Accounting policies continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
AFS equity securities: An AFS equity security is considered impaired if there is objective evidence that the cost may not be 
recovered. In addition to qualitative impairment criteria, such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value 
below cost. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, an equity security is considered impaired if the decline in fair value relative 
to cost has been either at least 20% for a continuous six month period or more than 40% at the end of the reporting period. 
Evidence to the contrary may include a significant rise in value of the equity security, for example as a result of a merger 
announced after the period end. We also review our largest equity holdings for evidence of impairment, as well as individual 
equity holdings in industry sectors known to be in difficulty. Where there is objective evidence that impairment exists, the 
security is written down regardless of the size of the unrealised loss. 
For both debt and equity AFS securities identified as being impaired, the cumulative unrealised net loss previously recognised 
within the investment valuation reserve is transferred to realised losses for the year with a corresponding movement through other 
comprehensive income. Any subsequent increase in fair value of these impaired securities is recognised in other comprehensive 
income and recorded in the investment valuation reserve, unless this increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after 
the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement. In such an event, the reversal of the impairment loss is recognised 
as a gain in the income statement. 
Mortgages and securitised loans: Impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted 
at the effective rate of interest of the loan, subject to the fair value of the underlying collateral. When a loan is considered to be 
impaired, the income statement is charged with the difference between the carrying value and the estimated recoverable amount. 
Interest income on impaired loans is recognised based on the estimated recoverable amount. 
Reversals of impairments are only recognised where the decrease in the impairment can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the write-down (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), and are not recognised in respect of equity 
instruments. 
(T) Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
Derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate futures, currency and interest rate swaps, currency 
and interest rate options (both written and purchased) and other financial instruments that derive their value mainly from 
underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity values or equity instruments. All derivatives are initially recognised in 
the statement of financial position at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are subsequently remeasured at their 
fair value, with the method of recognising movements in this value depending on whether they are designated as hedging 
instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not 
available, by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models. All derivatives are carried 
as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. Premiums paid for derivatives are 
recorded as an asset on the statement of financial position at the date of purchase, representing their fair value at that date. 
Derivative contracts may be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives are standardised 
and include certain futures and option contracts. OTC derivative contracts are individually negotiated between contracting parties 
and include forwards, swaps, caps and floors. Derivatives are subject to various risks including market, liquidity and credit risk, 
similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments. 
The notional or contractual amounts associated with derivative financial instruments are not recorded as assets or liabilities 
on the statement of financial position as they do not represent the fair value of these transactions. These amounts are disclosed 
in note 57. 
Interest rate and currency swaps 
Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange periodic payments in the same currency, each 
of which is computed on a different interest rate basis, on a specified notional amount. Most interest rate swaps involve the net 
exchange of payments calculated as the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest payments. Currency swaps, in their 
simplest form, are contractual agreements that involve the exchange of both periodic and final amounts in two different 
currencies. Both types of swap contracts may include the net exchange of principal. Exposure to gain or loss on these contracts will 
increase or decrease over their respective lives as a function of maturity dates, interest and foreign exchange rates, and the timing 
of payments. 
Interest rate futures, forwards and options contracts 
Interest rate futures are exchange-traded instruments and represent commitments to purchase or sell a designated security or 
money market instrument at a specified future date and price. Interest rate forward agreements are OTC contracts in which two 
parties agree on an interest rate and other terms that will become a reference point in determining, in concert with an agreed 
notional principal amount, a net payment to be made by one party to the other, depending what rate in fact prevails at a future 
point in time. Interest rate options, which consist primarily of caps and floors, are interest rate protection instruments that involve 
the potential obligation of the seller to pay the buyer an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer. This 
differential represents the difference between current rate and an agreed rate applied to a notional amount. Exposure to gain or 
loss on all interest rate contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest rates fluctuate. 
Foreign exchange contracts 
Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot, forward and futures contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency 
of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date. Foreign exchange option contracts 
are similar to interest rate option contracts, except that they are based on currencies, rather than interest rates. 
Exposure to gain or loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and 
interest rates fluctuate.

Derivative instruments for hedging 
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group designates certain derivatives as either: 
(i) a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge) 
(ii) a hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction or a firm 
commitment (cash flow hedge); or 
(iii)a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge) 
Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way, provided certain criteria are met. At the inception of the 
transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk 
management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents its assessment of 
whether the hedge is expected to be, and has been, highly effective in offsetting the risk in the hedged item, both at inception and 
on an ongoing basis. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment or cash flow hedges, and that prove 
to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk, are recognised in other comprehensive income and a separate reserve within 
equity. Gains and losses accumulated in this reserve are included in the income statement on disposal of the relevant investment or 
occurrence of the cash flow as appropriate. 
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no 
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation. 
For a variety of reasons, certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group’s risk 
management positions, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific IFRS rules and are therefore treated as derivatives 
held for trading. Their fair value gains and losses are recognised immediately in other trading income. 
(U) Loans 
Loans with fixed maturities, including policyholder loans, mortgage loans on investment property, securitised mortgages and 
collateral loans, are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers. The majority of these loans are carried at their unpaid 
principal balances and adjusted for amortisation of premium or discount, non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs. 
These amounts are deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as an adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest 
rate method. Loans with indefinite future lives are carried at unpaid principal balances or cost. 
For certain mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of the revised fair value option under IAS 39 to present the 
mortgages, associated borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair 
value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch that would otherwise 
arise from using different measurement bases for these three items. The fair values of mortgages classified as FV are estimated 
using discounted cash flow forecasts, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate which reflects the risks associated with these products, 
calibrated using the margins available on new lending or with reference to the rates offered by competitors. They are revalued at 
each period end, with movements in their fair values being taken to the income statement. 
At each reporting date, we review loans carried at amortised cost for objective evidence that they are impaired and 
uncollectable, either at the level of an individual security or collectively within a group of loans with similar credit risk 
characteristics. To the extent that a loan is uncollectable, it is written down as impaired to its recoverable amount, measured as the 
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan, including any collateral 
receivable. Subsequent recoveries in excess of the loan’s written down carrying value are credited to the income statement. 
(V) Collateral 
The Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of stock lending transactions, as well as 
certain derivative contracts and loans, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. Collateral is also pledged as security 
for bank letters of credit. The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the 
counterparty. 
Collateral received in the form of cash, which is not legally segregated from the Group, is recognised as an asset in the 
statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in financial liabilities (note 49). Non-cash collateral 
received is not recognised in the statement of financial position unless the Group either sells or repledges these assets in the 
absence of default, at which point the obligation to return this collateral is recognised as a liability. 
Collateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from the Group, is derecognised from the statement of 
financial position with a corresponding receivable for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the 
statement of financial position unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement, and therefore continues 
to be recognised in the statement of financial position within the appropriate asset classification. 
(W) Deferred acquisition costs and other assets 
The costs directly attributable to the acquisition of new business for insurance and participating investment contracts (excluding 
those written in the UK) are deferred to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable out of future margins in revenues on 
these contracts. For participating contracts written in the UK, acquisition costs are generally not deferred as the liability for these 
contracts is calculated in accordance with the FSA’s realistic capital regime and FRS 27. For non-participating investment and 
investment fund management contracts, incremental acquisition costs and sales enhancements that are directly attributable to 
securing an investment management service are also deferred. 
Where such business is reinsured, an appropriate proportion of the deferred acquisition costs is attributed to the reinsurer, 
and is treated as a separate liability. 
Financial statements IFRS   
 
140 
Aviva plc Accounting policies continued
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Long-term business deferred acquisition costs are amortised systematically over a period no longer than that in which they are 
expected to be recoverable out of these future margins. Deferrable acquisition costs for non-participating investment and 
investment fund management contracts are amortised over the period in which the service is provided. General insurance and 
health deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned. The reinsurers’ share of 
deferred acquisition costs is amortised in the same manner as the underlying asset. 
Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business at the end of each reporting period and are written-off where 
they are no longer considered to be recoverable. 
Other assets include vehicles which are subject to repurchase agreements and inventories of vehicle parts. The former are 
carried at the lower of their agreed repurchase price or net realisable value, whilst the latter are carried at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value, where cost is arrived at on the weighted average cost formula or “first in first out” (FIFO) basis. Provision is made 
against inventories which are obsolete or surplus to requirements. 
(X) Statement of cash flows 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term 
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
change in value. Such investments are those with less than three months’ maturity from the date of acquisition, or which are 
redeemable on demand with only an insignificant change in their fair values. 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts, which are included 
in payables and other financial liabilities on the statement of financial position. 
Operating cash flows 
Purchases and sales of investment property, loans and financial investments are included within operating cash flows as the 
purchases are funded from cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of 
related benefits and claims. 
(Y) Leases 
Leases, where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership is retained by the lessor, are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held for use in such leases are included in property and equipment, and are depreciated to their residual values over their 
estimated useful lives. Rentals from such leases are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the 
relevant leases. Payments made as lessee under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the relevant leases. 
(Z) Provisions and contingent liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more 
probable than not that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for 
example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. 
The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. Contingent liabilities are disclosed if there is a possible future 
obligation as a result of a past event, or if there is a present obligation as a result of a past event but either a payment is not 
probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. 
(AA) Employee benefits 
Annual leave and long service leave 
Employee entitlements to annual leave and long service leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made 
for the estimated liability for annual leave and long service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the statement 
of financial position date. 
Pension obligations 
The Group operates a large number of pension schemes around the world, whose members receive benefits on either a defined 
benefit basis (generally related to a member’s final salary and length of service) or a defined contribution basis (generally related to 
the amount invested, investment return and annuity rates), the assets of which are generally held in separate trustee-administered 
funds. The pension plans are generally funded by payments from employees and the relevant Group companies. 
For defined benefit plans, the pension costs are assessed using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the cost 
of providing pensions is charged to the income statement so as to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees. The 
pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, using a discount rate based on market 
yields for high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms 
to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The resulting pension scheme surplus or deficit appears as 
an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
Costs charged to the income statement comprise the current service cost (the increase in pension obligation resulting from 
employees’ service in the current period, together with the schemes’ administration expenses), past service cost (resulting from 
changes to benefits with respect to previous years’ service), and gains or losses on curtailment (when the employer materially 
reduces the number of employees covered by the scheme) or on settlements (when a scheme’s obligations are transferred outside

the Group). In addition, the difference between the expected return on scheme assets, less investment expenses, and the interest 
cost of unwinding the discount on the scheme liabilities (to reflect the benefits being one period closer to being paid out) is 
credited to investment income. All actuarial gains and losses, being the difference between the actual and expected returns on 
scheme assets, changes in assumptions underlying the liability calculations and experience gains or losses on the assumptions made 
at the beginning of the period, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans. Once the 
contributions have been paid, the Group, as employer, has no further payment obligations. The Group’s contributions are charged 
to the income statement in the year to which they relate and are included in staff costs. 
Other post-employment obligations 
Some Group companies provide post-employment healthcare or other benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits 
is usually based on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. 
Unlike the pension schemes, no assets are set aside in separate funds to provide for the future liability but none of these schemes 
is material to the Group. The costs of the Canadian scheme are included within those for the defined benefit pension schemes 
in that country. For such schemes in other countries, provisions are calculated in line with local regulations, with movements being 
charged to the income statement within staff costs. 
Equity compensation plans 
The Group offers share award and option plans over the Company’s ordinary shares for certain employees, including a Save As You 
Earn plan (SAYE plan), details of which are given in the Directors’ remuneration report and in note 29. 
The Group accounts for options and awards under equity compensation plans, which were granted after 7 November 2002, 
until such time as they are fully vested, using the fair value based method of accounting (the ‘fair value method’). Under this 
method, the cost of providing equity compensation plans is based on the fair value of the share awards or option plans at date of 
grant, which is recognised in the income statement over the expected vesting period of the related employees and credited to the 
equity compensation reserve, part of shareholders’ funds. 
Shares purchased by employee share trusts to fund these awards are shown as a deduction from shareholders’ funds at their 
original cost. 
When the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited 
to share capital (par value) and the balance to share premium. Where the shares are already held by employee trusts, the net 
proceeds are credited against the cost of these shares, with the difference between cost and proceeds being taken to retained 
earnings. In both cases, the relevant amount in the equity compensation reserve is then credited to retained earnings. 
(AB) Income taxes 
The current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years. Tax, 
including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to reserves 
as appropriate. 
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all 
material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation of property and equipment, revaluation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities including derivative contracts, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits and tax losses carried 
forward; and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base. 
The rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date are used to determine the deferred tax. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised 
in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred taxes are not provided in respect of temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from 
goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes, or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss at the time of 
the transaction. 
Current and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity are similarly 
recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity respectively. Deferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of 
available for sale investments, owner-occupied properties and other amounts charged or credited directly to other comprehensive 
income is recognised in the statement of financial position as a deferred tax asset or liability. Current tax on interest paid on Direct 
Capital instruments is credited directly in equity. 
In addition to paying tax on shareholders’ profits, the Group’s life businesses in the UK, Ireland, Singapore and Australia (prior 
to its disposal) pay tax on policyholders’ investment returns (‘policyholder tax’) on certain products at policyholder tax rates. 
Policyholder tax is accounted for as an income tax and is included in the total tax expense. The Group has decided to show 
separately the amounts of policyholder tax to provide a more meaningful measure of the tax the Group pays on its profits. In the 
pro forma reconciliations, operating profit has been calculated after charging policyholder tax.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
(AC) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, most borrowings are stated 
at amortised cost, and any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over 
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred except 
where they are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of property and equipment as described in policy O above. 
Where loan notes have been issued in connection with certain securitised mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of 
the revised fair value option under IAS 39 to present the mortgages, associated liabilities and derivative financial instruments at fair 
value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and 
eliminates any accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise from using different measurement bases for these three items. 
(AD) Share capital and treasury shares 
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. 
Accordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if: 
(i) 	 there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on terms 
that may be unfavourable; and 
(ii) the instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of shares or is a derivative 
that will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. 
Share issue costs 
Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the 
proceeds of the issue and disclosed where material. 
Dividends 
Interim dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on these shares 
are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders. Dividends on preference shares are recognised in the period in 
which they are declared and appropriately approved. 
Treasury shares 
Where the Company or its subsidiaries purchase the Company’s share capital or obtain rights to purchase its share capital, the 
consideration paid (including any attributable transaction costs net of income taxes) is shown as a deduction from total 
shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses on sales of own shares are charged or credited to the treasury share account in equity. 
(AE) Fiduciary activities 
Assets and income arising from fiduciary activities, together with related undertakings to return such assets to customers, are 
excluded from these financial statements where the Group has no contractual rights in the assets and acts in a fiduciary capacity 
such as nominee, trustee or agent. 
(AF) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number 
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group 
and held as Treasury shares. 
Earnings per share has also been calculated on the operating profit before impairment of goodwill and other adjusting items, 
after tax, attributable to ordinary shareholders, as the directors believe this figure provides a better indication of operating 
performance. Details are given in note 14. 
For the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and share options granted to employees. 
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings 
per share. 
(AG) Operations held for sale 
Assets and liabilities held for disposal as part of operations which are held for sale are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of financial position. The relevant assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value, less the 
estimated selling costs.

Other information 
1 – Exchange rates 
The Group’s principal overseas operations during the year were located within the Eurozone and the United States. The results and 
cash flows of these operations have been translated into sterling at an average rate for the year of €1 = £0.88 (2008: €1 = £0.80) 
and £1 = US$1.57 (2008: £1= US$1.85). Assets and liabilities have been translated at the year end rate of €1 = £0.88 (2008: €1 = 
£0.97, 2007: €1 = £0.73) and £1 = US$1.61 (2008: £1= US$1.44, 2007: £1 = US$1.99). 
Total foreign currency movements during 2009 resulted in a gain recognised in the income statement of £154 million (2008: 
£327 million loss). 
2 – Presentation changes 
(a) Changes to presentation 
(i) 	 The Group has adopted IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of Financial Statements, as of 1 January 2009. The principal impact of this 
has been in the following areas: 
(a) The titles of some of the prime statements have changed, so that the consolidated statement of recognised gains and losses 
is now called the consolidated statement of comprehensive income; the reconciliation of movements in consolidated 
shareholders’ equity is now called the consolidated statement of changes in equity; the consolidated balance sheet is renamed 
the consolidated statement of financial position; and the consolidated cash flow statement is renamed the consolidated 
statement of cash flows. 
(b) The standard requires the income tax effect of each component of comprehensive income to be disclosed. This information 
is given in note 13. 
(c) Changes in the year in each element of equity must now be shown on the face of the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity, rather than in the notes. 
(d) The standard requires entities to present a comparative consolidated statement of financial position as at the beginning 
of the earliest comparative period when the entity has applied an accounting policy retrospectively, makes a retrospective 
restatement or reclassifies items in the financial statements. As we have restated certain prior year figures, explained in 
section (b) below, we have presented three consolidated statements of financial position and supporting notes in these 
financial statements. 
(ii) The Group has also adopted Amendments to IFRS 7, Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, as of 1 January 2009. 
The principal impact of these amendments is to require the following additional disclosures: 
(a) An analysis of financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance  

of inputs used in making the fair value measurements. 

(b) An analysis of transfers of financial assets and liabilities between different levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
(c) A reconciliation from beginning to end of period of financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is based on 

unobservable inputs. 

(d) An enhanced discussion and analysis of liquidity risk, including a maturity analysis of financial assets held for managing 

liquidity risk, if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent 

of liquidity risk. 

Comparative information for the disclosures required by the IFRS 7 amendments is not needed in the first year of application.  

However, the Group has provided comparatives for the analysis of financial assets according to a fair value hierarchy, which we
 
had previously reported. 

(iii)As explained in note 3(c), the Group completed the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of its subsidiary, Delta Lloyd NV (Delta Lloyd), in 
November 2009. Although the Group has remained the majority shareholder after the IPO, Delta Lloyd is now managed 
separately from our other European operations, reflecting the change in shareholder base. For this reason, the segmental 
information given in note 4(a) has been modified to show Delta Lloyd and the Aviva Europe operations separately, with 
comparatives analysed in the same way for consistency. 
(b) Restatement of prior year figures 
(i) 	 During 2009, the Group undertook a review of our accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents. Previously, we defined 
these as normally having a maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition. To avoid ambiguity, our accounting policy 
has been refined to impose a cut-off date of exactly three months, allowing us to delete ‘normally’ from the policy wording. 
This refinement of policy has resulted in a reclassification of certain short-dated instruments between cash and cash equivalents 
and financial investments. 
The impact of this refinement has been to increase financial investments and reduce cash and cash equivalents in 2008 
by £538 million (2007: £430 million) compared to the amounts previously stated. As a consequence of this, cash flows from 
operating activities in 2008 have decreased by £58 million, with the effect of exchange rate movements accounting for the 
remaining £50 million. 
(ii) During 2009, the Group’s Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, carried out a review of the way it had been applying IAS 19, Employee 
Benefits, in its own financial statements where the corridor method of smoothing actuarial gains and losses in its pension 
schemes is followed; in accounting for its self-insured pension obligations and intercompany eliminations; and in its reporting to 
Group where the corridor accounting is reversed. The review concluded that errors had been made locally in applying IAS 19 on 
the transition to IFRS and in subsequent years, such that gains on certain assets had been reported in provisions, to be released 
over time, rather than through other comprehensive income. The impact of correcting these errors is to reduce other liabilities 
by £129 million as at 1 January 2008, increase deferred tax liabilities by £33 million and increase retained earnings at that date 
by £96 million.

3 – Subsidiaries 
This note provides details of the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries that the Group has made during the year, together with 
details of businesses held for sale at the year end. The principal Group subsidiaries are listed on pages 33 to 34. 
(a) Acquisitions 
(i) Material acquisitions 
There were no material acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2009. 
(ii) Other goodwill arising 
As disclosed in the 2008 financial statements, on 30 June 2008 the Group acquired Swiss Life Belgium (SLB). At 30 June 2009, 
the fair values of the assets and liabilities were updated from their provisional values to reflect decreases in the value of acquired 
in-force business and deferred acquisition costs, and increases in insurance and investment contract liabilities. This has given rise 
to an increase in goodwill of €72 million (£64 million) to €132 million (£117 million). 
Other goodwill of £5 million has arisen on smaller acquisitions and increases in shareholdings in existing subsidiaries, together 
with a £16 million reduction for changes in contingent consideration payable on previous acquisitions. None of these is considered 
material for separate disclosure. 
(iii) Non-adjusting subsequent event 
Acquisition of River Road Asset Management 
On 5 January 2010, the Group announced that it had agreed to acquire 100% of River Road Asset Management, a US equity 
manager, to support the expansion of Aviva Investors’ third party institutional asset management business. Completion took place 
on 24 February 2010 for an estimated total consideration of £79 million (US$122 million), of which £37 million (US$57 million) 
was paid in cash on completion. The balance comprises contingent consideration. 
The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Group to pay amounts over the next five years, based on a multiple of 
the earnings during that period, up to a maximum total purchase price of £70 million (US$108 million). The potential undiscounted 
amount of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is 
between £26 million (US$41 million) and £53 million (US$82 million). 
In view of the recent timing of this transaction, accounting for this acquisition is not yet complete and it is currently impractical 
to comply with the requirements of IFRS 3, Business Combinations and to state with any certainty the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities acquired, and therefore to estimate the goodwill arising on the transaction.

(i) Dutch health insurance business 
On 1 January 2009, the Group’s Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, sold its health insurance business to OWM CZ Groep Zorgverkeraar 
UA (CZ), a mutual health insurer, for £246 million, realising a profit of £31 million, calculated as shown below. Under the 
terms of the agreement, CZ purchased the Delta Lloyd health insurance business and took on its underwriting risk and policy 
administration. Delta Lloyd continues to market and distribute health insurance products from CZ to its existing customers and 
continues to provide asset management for the transferred business. Delta Lloyd also has exclusive rights to market life, general 
insurance and income protection products to CZ’s customers.

businesses at 31 December 2008, adjusted to reflect the results in the period from 1 January 2009 to completion. The profit on 
disposal of these wholly-owned subsidiaries was £122 million, calculated as follows:

**Other costs of disposal have arisen from the agreement of a call option to purchase the shares of an associate of the Australian businesses in 2010.  

(iii) UK non-core operations 
On 11 February 2009, the Group sold The British School of Motoring Limited and its subsidiaries to Arques Consulting GmbH for 
a consideration of £4 million. The resultant loss on disposal of £9 million was provided for in the 2008 financial statements. 
(iv) Non-adjusting subsequent event 
On 17 February 2010, the Group sold its 35% holding in Sogessur SA to that company’s main shareholder, Société Générale, for 
a consideration of £35 million, realising a profit on disposal of £24 million.

(c) Listing of minority shareholding in Delta Lloyd 
On 3 November 2009, Aviva plc and Delta Lloyd completed the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) of Delta Lloyd, which commenced 
trading on Euronext Amsterdam on that date. The IPO consisted of a public offering to institutional and retail investors of Delta 
Lloyd’s ordinary shares, including the over-allotment option (also referred to as a “greenshoe”) taken up on 24 November 2009. 
The Group has remained the majority shareholder after the IPO, retaining 58% of the ordinary share capital in Delta Lloyd. The 
transaction has been treated as an equity transaction with minorities, resulting in the following transfers between reserves:

4 – Segmental information 
The Group’s results can be segmented, either by activity or by geography. Our primary reporting format is on regional reporting 
lines, with supplementary information being given by business activity. This note provides segmental information on the 
consolidated income statement and statement of financial position. 
(a) Operating segments 
The Group has determined its operating segments along regional lines. These reflect the management structure whereby a 
member of the Executive Management team is accountable to the Group Chief Executive for the operating segment for which he 
is responsible. The activities of each operating segment are described below: 
United Kingdom 
The United Kingdom comprises two operating segments – UK Life and UK General Insurance (UK GI). The principal activities of UK 
Life are life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business, whilst UK GI provides 
insurance cover to individuals and to small and medium-sized businesses, for risks associated mainly with motor vehicles, property 
and liability, such as employers’ liability and professional indemnity liability, and medical expenses. UK GI also includes the RAC 
motor recovery business, the group reinsurance result and the results of run off agency business. 
Aviva Europe 
Activities reported in the Aviva Europe operating segment exclude operations in the UK and include those in Russia and 
Turkey. Principal activities are long-term business in France, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain, and general insurance in France,

6 – Details of expenses continued 
Integration and restructuring costs 
Integration and restructuring costs incurred in the year amounted to £286 million (2008: £326 million). This includes £210 million 
for the cost savings initiatives in the UK life and general insurance businesses and Europe, which have delivered £170 million 
annualised cost savings in the year. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items totalled £45 million net profit (2008: £551 million net expense) in the year. 
For the year ended 31 December 2009, this comprised: 
— A net exceptional profit before tax of £207 million as a result of the reattribution of the inherited estate (see note 44), of which 
£674 million is included in “other expenses” and £881 million credit is included in changes in “unallocated divisible surplus”; 
— A £60 million expense for the strengthening of reserves in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks 
written in Canada a significant number of years ago, which is included in “change in insurance liabilities”; and 
— A £102 million expense for the migration of all remaining local brands, except Delta Lloyd and RAC, to the single global Aviva 
brand, which has been implemented over the two year period 2008 to 2009. The cost is included in “other expenses”. 
For the year ended 31 December 2008, this comprised: 
— A £142 million expense for closing or exiting non-core business operations such as the lifetime wrap platform and The British 
School of Motoring in the UK and the structured settlement business in the United States; 
— A £304 million expense after reinsurance for the discounted cost of strengthening latent claims provisions, mainly in the UK 
(see note 38); 
— A £126 million expense for the settlement agreed by our Netherlands life business for its unit-linked policyholders, following 
an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees; 
— Brand migration costs of £37 million (referred to above); and 
— A £58 million credit from settlement of a disputed Australian tax liability and the consequent release of a provision for 
interest charges.

Impairment of financial investments 
Group policy is to recognise an impairment on available for sale (AFS) equity securities when there has been a prolonged or 
significant decline in their fair value below their cost, irrespective of general market movements. Although management believes 
that these equity securities will ultimately recover their value, there can be no certainty that this will happen as, unlike fixed 
maturity securities, the value of an equity security cannot be recovered in full by holding it to maturity.

8 – Long-term business economic volatility 
The long-term nature of much of the Group’s operations means that, for management’s decision-making and internal performance 
management, the effects of short-term economic volatility are treated as non-operating items. The Group focuses instead on an 
operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business. This note explains 
the methodology behind this. 
(a) Definitions 
Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and 
policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. 
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, 
and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions. Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and 
interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in 
economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit. 
(b) Economic volatility 
The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: 
Long-term business 
2009 2008 
£m £m 
Investment variances and economic assumption changes (75) (1,631) 
The limited economic variance in 2009 reflects the recovery in investment markets, with positive variances on fixed interest assets 
in Europe and the United States driven by the narrowing of credit spreads towards the end of the year, offset by losses from equity 
derivatives in the Netherlands. Investment variances include the reversal of £160 million of losses incurred in 2008 relating to assets 
backing participating business in Spain. Additional credit default provisions for corporate bonds and commercial mortgages were 
maintained at £550 million in the UK and increased by £97 million in Europe. This compares to a significantly negative impact in 
2008 driven by the global financial crisis. 
(c) Methodology 
The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately 
for each principal long-term business unit. 
The expected return on investments for both policyholder and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions 
applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period. Expected investment return assumptions are derived 
actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year. The same margins are applied on 
a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties. 
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases 
during the period arising from expected operating experience. 
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and 
changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates. To the extent that these differences arise from the operating 
experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit. 
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit 
but included in profit before tax. 
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on 
investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items. 
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic 
assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit. For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked 
and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on 
profit. For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and 
liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees. 
(d) Assumptions 
The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local 
economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS. 
Within the 2008 results, the expected rate of investment return was calculated by reference to the one year swap rate in the 
relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium for equities and properties. For 2009, the Group considers that the return over 
the typical duration of the assets held is more appropriate and is more consistent with our expectation of long-term rates of return. 
The expected return on equities and properties has therefore been calculated by reference to the 10 year swap rate in the relevant 
currency plus an appropriate risk premium. 
If the IFRS operating profit had been calculated by reference to the one year swap rate, this profit would have been 
£200 million lower. There is no impact on IFRS profit before tax.

United Kingdom 7.0 9.2 5.5 7.7 

Eurozone 7.3 8.3 5.8 6.8 

For fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average 
prospective yields for the actual assets held. Where such securities are classified as available for sale, such as in the United States, 
the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount 
at purchase. 
The Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles to 
calculate the longer-term investment return for its long-term business in 2008 and 2009. 
9 – Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business 
For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated 
longer-term return and short-term fluctuations from this. This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the 
relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business. 
(a) The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business 
result and reported outside operating profit were as follows:

Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit 95 (819) 
1,180 449 
(c) The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit. In respect of equities 
and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and 
purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return. 
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard 
to local economic and market forecasts of investment return. The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual 
income receivable for the year. 
(d) The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer-term return, were 
£22,844 million (2008 restated: £23,398 million). For other operations, the longer-term return reflects interest income earned 
in the Netherlands bank and retail mortgage divisions.

The Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under MCEV principles to calculate 
the longer-term investment return for its non-long-term business in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, rates were based on EEV.

(g) The economic assumption changes arise from movements in the rate used to discount latent claims. 
As explained in accounting policy K, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, 
in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims. The discount 
rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being 
reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change. The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 38(c).

Information concerning individual directors’ emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 99 to 116 in the “Corporate Governance” section of this report. For the purposes of the disclosure required 
by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the directors in respect of 2009 was £6.7 million 
(2008: £5.2 million). Employer contributions to pensions for Executive Directors’ for qualifying periods was £123,000 (2008: 
£234,000). This is only for one ED as the others in the qualifying periods were not receiving any pension contributions by Aviva. 
The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the directors in the period was £5.256 million (2008: £4.348 million). The net 
value has been calculated by reference to the market price at the date of grant. During the year, no share options were exercised 
by directors (2008: nil options exercised).

Subsequent to 31 December 2009, the directors proposed a final dividend for 2009 of 15.0 pence per ordinary share (2008: 19.91 
pence), amounting to £415 million (2008: £527 million) in total. Subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM, the dividend will 
be paid on 17 May 2010 and will be accounted for as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2010. 
Interest on the direct capital instrument issued in November 2004 is treated as an appropriation of retained profits and, 
accordingly, it is accounted for when paid. Tax relief is obtained at a rate of 28.0% (2008: 28.5%).

goodwill has been expensed in the year. Together with impairment charges of £32 million recognised in respect of goodwill within 
interests in associates (note 19), the total goodwill write down for the year is £62 million. 
Movements in contingent consideration relate to contingent consideration paid/received in respect of past acquisitions of 
subsidiaries. Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed before 1 January 1998 was charged directly to reserves. Goodwill arising 
on the Group’s acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within the carrying value of those investments (see notes 
18 and 19).

As explained in accounting policy N, the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is reviewed 
at least annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value. The tests led to impairment of 
goodwill of £nil in 2009 (2008: £68 million). 
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: 
United Kingdom 
(i) Long-term business 
The United Kingdom long-term business goodwill balance is split across four cash generating units, with no individual balance 
exceeding £22 million. 
The Group acquired Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited from HFC Bank Limited (HFC) in 2007, and identified 
£20 million of the purchase price as goodwill in respect of unrecognised deferred tax assets which could not be utilised or 
recognised at the time. The Group is now able to recognise value for these assets and further consideration of £9 million, included 
in the "Movements in contingent consideration", is payable to HFC in this respect. As required by paragraph 65 of IFRS 3, Business 
Combinations, the total £29 million has been charged to expenses, together with £1 million of transaction costs representing the 
balance of acquired goodwill. Deferred tax assets have increased to recognise this new asset (see note 45(b)(iii)). 
(ii) General insurance, RAC and health 
The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance, RAC and health unit has been determined based on a value in use 
calculation. The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year 
period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 9.5%. Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 
2.5% growth rate. This growth rate is set with regards to past experience and historical statistics of UK premium growth published 
by the Association of British Insurers. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management, and as such 
reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant 
UK industry sectors 
— Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, customer numbers, premium rate 
and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates; and 
— Growth rates represent the rates used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and have been based 
upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates, including external sources of data such as ABI Annual 
Market Statistics.

16 – Goodwill continued 
Europe 
Long-term business 
The recoverable amount of long-term business cash generating units in the Europe region, has been determined based on a value 
in use calculation. The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of each cash generating unit, including goodwill, to 
the Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) of that cash generating unit. If the MCEV is less than the carrying value of a cash 
generating unit the present value of profits from expected new business for that cash generating unit is considered. If the value 
of profits from expected new business for a cash generating unit is expected to grow beyond the period of the initial plan, this 
growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future growth in each country. 
For European long-term business cash generating units a key assumption used for the calculation was the embedded value 
which represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded 
Value (MCEV) principles. The embedded value is the total of the net worth and the value of the in-force life business. 
General insurance, health and other 
The recoverable amount of general insurance, health and other non-life cash generating units in the Europe region has been 
determined based on a value in use calculation. Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit using a discounted cash 
flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management for each cash generating unit and 
discounted at a risk discount rate appropriate for each cash generating unit. If the cash flows are expected to grow beyond the 
period of the initial plan, this growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future 
growth in each country. 
(iii) France (long-term business) 
The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed as part of the recoverable amount 
of the French long-term business cash generating unit. The MCEV of the French long-term business was significantly greater than 
its carrying value, including indefinite life intangible assets. 
(iv) Ireland (long-term business) 
The MCEV of the Irish long-term business is greater than its carrying value so the recoverable value will be significantly in excess 
of its carrying value, including goodwill. 
(v) Ireland (general insurance and health) 
The recoverable amount of the Irish general insurance and health business exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit 
including goodwill. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period which represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved 
by management and reflecting the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth 
rates for the Irish economy. The assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate 
changes, claims inflation and commission rates; 
— Future cash flows are extrapolated beyond the three year business plan period assuming nil growth for general insurance 
business and a 7% growth rate for the health business; and 
— A risk adjusted discount rate of 10.8%. 
(vi) Italy (long-term business) 
This calculation is an actuarially-determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the 
present value of expected profits from future new business. 
Key assumptions (in addition to MCEV principles) used for the calculation were: 
— New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written 
in a period. This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management; 
— Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based 
on management’s estimate of future growth of 2.0%; and 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business. The 
discount rate includes a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years 
for new business may differ from that assumed. 
(vii) Italy (non-life) 
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Budgeted operating profit for an initial three year period represents the operating profit in the most recent business plans, 
approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and 
expected growth rates for the Italian economy; 
— Growth rate of 3.0% represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period; and 
— A risk adjusted discount rate of 10.2%.

16 – Goodwill continued 
(viii) Delta Lloyd (long-term, general insurance, health and fund management) 
The recoverable amount of the Delta Lloyd life and general insurance and health cash generating units has been determined on the 
basis of a value in use calculation. This calculation is an appraisal value and is based on the discounted expected future cash flows 
from the operations over their expected useful life. Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan 
figures for a three to five year period, depending on the management plan period of the unit. Expected cash flows for later periods 
have been extrapolated, taking into account the growth rate. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three to five year period; 
— For the year following the end of the management plan period cash flows are extrapolated at a growth rate of nil to 2.6% 
depending on the particular circumstances of each unit; and 
— Risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.1% to 10.6% depending on management’s assessment of the specific risks of each unit, 
represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business. 
(ix) Spain (long-term business) 
This calculation is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future 
new business. The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill. 
Key assumptions (in addition to MCEV principles) used for the calculation were: 
— New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written 
in a period. This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management; 
— Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based 
on management’s conservative estimate of future growth of 3.0%. This growth rate is in line with industry expectations; and 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 6.5% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business. The 
discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in 
future years for new business may differ from that assumed. The test performed in the current year estimates the value of future 
new business on an MCEV basis. This methodology incorporates more of the risk of future new business into the underlying 
cash flows, and so consequently a lower risk discount rate is applied relative to the prior period. 
(x) United States (long-term business) 
The recoverable amount of the United States long-term cash generating unit has been determined based on a value in use 
calculation. 
This calculation is an actuarially-determined appraisal value and is based on an embedded value of the business (the total of 
the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business) together with the present value of expected profits from 
future new business. The value in use exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is based on projected cash flows of the business 
including expected investment returns. 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 8.0% is used to calculate the embedded value; 
— New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written 
in a period. This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management; 
— Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based 
on management’s estimate of future growth of 5.0% for life and annuity business, which is set with regard to past experience 
in these markets; and 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.0% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business. The 
discount rate includes an additional margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new 
business may differ from that assumed. 
The recoverable amount for the cash generating unit exceeds its carrying value by £332 million. An increase in the risk adjusted 
discount rates applied to calculate the embedded value and the present value of future profits from future new business of 60 
basis points would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value. 
Cash flow projections 
To comply with paragraph 33(c) of IAS 36, cash flow projections for the period beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated 
from the position in the final year of the three year plan period. In all cases we have assumed a steady growth rate for subsequent 
years, not an increasing growth rate. The steady growth rate in each case is a positive or nil growth rate. The steady growth rate 
selected for each cash generating unit reflects long-term expectations for the markets in which each cash generating unit 
participates.

* On insurance and participating investment contracts. 
**On non-participating investment contracts. 
(a) Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise the RAC brand, and the value of the Union Financière de France Banque 
distribution channel, where the existing lives of the assets and their competitive position in, and the stability of, their respective 
markets support this classification. 
Impairment testing of these intangibles is covered in note 16(b). 
(b) The negative figure of £20 million for AVIF on insurance contracts arises from the updating of fair values for Swiss Life Belgium, 
described in note 3(a)(ii). 
(c) During the year, the Group reviewed the terms of its bancassurance agreement with Banco Popolare, signed in December 2008, 
which was initially for 10 years with five-year automatic renewal periods. This agreement is expected to be renewed indefinitely. 
Although this agreement had originally been classified as an intangible asset with indefinite useful life, it is now considered 
more appropriate to reclassify it as having a finite useful life where the residual value is high, as a consequence of the terms of 
the put option, and amortisation immaterial and this is consistent with other similar contracts. This has resulted 
in a reallocation in the year of £431 million from intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to those with finite useful lives. 
(d) Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.

(d) Impairment testing 
CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad 
The Group’s investments in CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad have been tested for impairment by 
comparing their carrying values (which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition) with their recoverable amounts. The 
recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations. This calculation is an 
actuarially-determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of 
expected profits from future new business. The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Cash flow projections based on 
(i) the policy portfolio existing at the valuation date, and 
(ii) the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three year period. The cash flows 
from existing policy portfolio is calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience 
investigation where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available; 
— The calculations use a risk adjusted discount rate of 13.2%; and 
— New sales beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 11.0%.

AvivaSA Emeklilik ve Hayat A.S. 
The Group’s investment in AvivaSA Emeklilik ve Hayat A.S. has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value (which 
includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition) with its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation. 
This calculation is an actuarially-determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with 
the present value of expected profits from future new business. The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash 
generating unit including goodwill. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the Market 
Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) principles. The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and 
the value of the in-force business. The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a firm of 
actuarial consultants. 
— New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written 
in a period. This is initially based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management. 
— Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based 
on management’s estimate of future growth of 5.0%. 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 15.0% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business. The 
discount rate reflects a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may 
differ from that assumed.

19 – Interests in, and loans to, associates continued 
Although the Group’s holding in two of the three Cyrte funds is less than 20%, it has significant influence through ownership of 
the fund manager, Cyrte Investments BV, a subsidiary of which acts as general partner to the funds, and through membership of 
its investment committee. 
The Group’s Dutch subsidiary owns 30.8% of the shares, and depositary receipts for shares, in Van Lanschot NV, a financial 
services company in the Netherlands. The Group is not able to appoint management representation on the board of this company 
and is therefore unable to exert significant influence over its affairs. Accordingly, this investment is treated as a financial investment 
rather than as an associate.

Summarised aggregate financial information on the Group’s interests in its associates is as follows:

The associates have no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group is exposed, nor has the Group any significant 
contingent liabilities in relation to its interest in them. 
(d) Impairment testing 
RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited 
The Group’s investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment 
by comparing their carrying values (which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition) with their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amounts for both investments have been determined based on value in use calculations, using an appraisal 
value methodology. The appraisal value comprises MCEV and a value of future new business. Future new business is valued using a 
similar approach as used for the in-force business. The value of 2010 planned new business is based on planned volumes, planned 
margins for manufactured business and current margins for collectives and adopted business all approved by management. This 
value is then multiplied by an annuity factor to give the value of 25 years of future new business and then discounted back to the 
valuation date. The annuity factor for Life business allows for new business growth of 2.8% in 2011 and 5.4% thereafter and a 
pattern of market-consistent time dependent risk discount rates equivalent to a single risk discount rate of 4.4%. For Collective 
Investments the new business growth assumptions are 7.7% in 2011 and 6.1% thereafter. This value is adjusted to allow for 
future expense over-runs and under-runs, based on the projected expenses and sales volumes. 
The test performed in the current year estimates the value of future new business on an MCEV basis. This methodology 
incorporates more of the risk of future new business into the underlying cash flows and so consequently a lower risk discount rate 
is applied relative to the prior period. 
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments. 
Banca Network Investimenti SpA 
The Group’s investment in Banca Network Investimenti SpA has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value (which 
includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition) with its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation prepared by an external valuation expert. 
Value in use was calculated using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by 
management and discounted at an appropriate risk discount rate. 
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: 
— A cash flow project based on a five year plan period; and 
— Risk adjusted discount rate of 10.3% based on the weighted average cost of capital of similar Italian listed companies. 
As a result of the testing, an impairment of £26 million has been recognised. This reflects adverse developments in the business 
environment in which this associate operates. 
(e) Non-adjusting subsequent event 
On 17 February 2010, the Group sold its 35% holding in Sogessur SA to that company’s main shareholder, Société Générale, for 
a consideration of £35 million, realising a profit on disposal of £24 million.

Fair value losses of £26 million have been charged (2008: £37 million) to other comprehensive income (note 34), with the 
remainder being charged to the income statement. 
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by local qualified 
staff of the Group in overseas operations, all with recent relevant experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the 
relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other 
countries. This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated 
amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s­ length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, 
assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding 
potential alternative uses. The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the 
International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment. 
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be £328 million 
(2008: £414 million). 
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

Investment properties are stated at their market values as assessed by qualified external valuers or by local qualified staff of the 
Group in overseas operations, all with recent relevant experience. Values are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and 
are based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, assuming no future growth in rental income. 
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties. 
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2009 was 
£11,750 million (2008: £13,764 million, 2007: £14,616 million). Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable

Loans to banks include cash collateral received under stock lending arrangements (see note 24(e)). The obligation to repay this 
collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities (note 49). 
Of the above loans, £33,241 million (2008: £30,673 million, 2007: £25,666 million) is expected to be recovered more than 
one year after the statement of financial position date. 
Loans at fair value 
Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio 
of mortgages. Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 24(b). 
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was a gain of £338 million 
(2008: £644 million loss). The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2009 was a loss of 
£315 million (2008: £854 million loss). 
Loans at amortised cost 
The fair value of these loans at 31 December 2009 was £19,786 million (2008: £20,218 million, 2007: £17,588 million).

(b) Collateral 
The Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate, in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery.
 
This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy,  

for the majority of the loan balances above. In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed  

securities, and is held in segregated accounts. Transfer of title for the collateral received always occurs in such cases, although  

no market risk or benefit is taken. In the event of a default, the Group is able to sell or repledge the collateral.  

The amount of collateral received with respect to loans which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of 
default was £3,685 million (2008: £3,880 million, 2007: £6,282 million). No collateral was actually sold or repledged in the 
absence of default during the year (2008: £nil).

23 – Securitised mortgages and related assets 
The Group has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings, in our 
UK Life and Dutch businesses. This note gives details of the relevant transactions. 
(a) Description of arrangements 
(i) United Kingdom 
In a long-term business subsidiary Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime 
mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies), in return for initial 
consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration. The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF 
companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments. 
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies. 
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust. Although AER does 
not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the 
majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and they have 
therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements. AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any 
of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted 
in order to effect a further advance. 
AER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies. These have been eliminated 
on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
(ii) Delta Lloyd 
In three subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV (DLL), Amstelhuys NV (AMS), and Delta Lloyd Bank (Belgium) NV/SA (DLB), 
the principal benefits of certain portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to a number of special purpose securitisation 
companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed and floating rate notes. 
All the shares in the securitisation companies are held by independent trustee companies. Although DLL, AMS and DLB do not 
own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the securitisation companies or their parent companies, they retain control 
of the majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and these 
companies have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements. DLL, AMS and DLB have no right, 
nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans before the optional call date, other than in 
certain circumstances where they are in breach of warranty. 
Delta Lloyd companies have purchased notes in the securitisation companies, which have been eliminated on consolidation 
through offset against the borrowings of the securitisation companies in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
(iii) General 
In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the 
note holders and do not intend to provide such support. Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only 
entitled to obtain payment, of both principle and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special 
purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that 
note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

(b) Fair value methodology 
(i) For financial assets carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a “fair value hierarchy” as follows: 
Quoted market prices in active markets – (‘Level 1’) 
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is one in which 
transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Examples 
are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets. 
Modelled with significant observable market inputs – (‘Level 2’) 
Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either 
directly or indirectly. If the asset has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term 
of the asset. Level 2 inputs include the following: 
— Quoted prices for similar (ie not identical) assets in active markets. 
— Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary 
substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly. 
— Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at 
commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates). 
— Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (market­ corroborated inputs). 
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, and listed 
debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive. Valuations, whether sourced from internal models or third parties incorporate 
credit risk by adjusting the spread above the yield curve for government treasury securities for the appropriate amount of credit risk 
for each issuer, based on observed market transactions. To the extent observed market spreads are either not used in valuing a 
security, or do not fully reflect liquidity risk, our valuation methodology, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, 
reflects a liquidity premium. 
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, we generally 
validate the price quoted by the broker by using internal models with observable inputs. When the price obtained from the broker 
and internal model are similar, we look to the inputs used in our internal model to understand the observability of the inputs used 
by the broker. In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, and the observability of inputs used 
by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3. Broker quotes are usually non-binding. 
Modelled with significant unobservable market inputs – (‘Level 3’) 
Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value 
to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity 
for the asset at the measurement date (or market information for the inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable 
inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Examples are 
certain private equity investments and private placements. 
The majority of the Group’s financial assets are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data. A 
small percentage (4%) of total financial assets recorded at fair value, are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments. 
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, 
calibrated to market observable data where possible. Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing 
one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly. 
The principal investments classified as Level 3 are: 
— Structured bond type products held by our businesses in France and Italy amounting to £7.0 billion, for which there is no active 
market. These bonds are valued either using third party counterparty or broker quotes. These bonds are validated against 
internal or third party models. Most of these bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either, (i) the third party models 
included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or (ii) differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty 
and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification. At 31 December 
2009, the counterparty and broker quotes used to value these products were less than the modelled valuations. 
— Notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to £1.0 billion, for which there is no active market. 
These are valued using counterparty quotes, corroborated against the prices of selected similar securities. In 2009 there was 
insufficient market observable transactions in the selected securities to provide a reliable proxy price to corroborate the 
counterparty price. 
— Private equity investment funds held by our UK Life business amounting to £0.8 billion. In valuing our interest in these funds, we 
rely on investment valuation reports received from the fund manager, making adjustments for items such as subsequent draw 
downs and distributions between the date of the report and valuation date and the fund manager’s carried interest. 
— Certain direct private equity investments and private placements held by our business in the Netherlands and strategic interests 
in banking partners held by our Italian business amounting to £0.8 billion. Valuations are based on third-party independent 
appraisals, or where internally modelled, transactions in similar entities, discounted cash flow techniques and valuation 
multiples, using public and internal management information. 
— Other Level 3 investments amount to £1.6 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number 
of businesses throughout the Group.

The Group assesses the fair value hierarchy of its financial investments biannually at 30 June and 31 December. Transfers between 
fair value hierarchy levels are deemed to have occurred at the assessment date. 
Transfers into and out of Level 3 arose for the following reasons: 
— Changes in the market observability of valuation inputs. 
— Changes in the market observability of inputs used to validate valuations. 
— Significant differences between third party prices used for valuations and validation prices either sourced from third parties or 
internal models. 
The transfers into Level 3 principally relate to certain debt securities held by our businesses in the UK, Italy and France and 
private equity investment funds in the UK. These investments were previously classified as Level 2. The single largest transfer was 
of £6.8 billion structured bond type products, whose valuation methodology is described earlier in this section. 
Of the £52 million net losses recognised in the income statement during the year, £2 million gain relates to net investment 
income and £54 million loss relating to impairments is included in other expenses.

All unrealised gains and losses and impairments on financial investments classified as fair value through profit or loss have been 
recognised in the income statement. 
Unrealised gains and losses on financial investments classified as at fair value through profit or loss recognised in the income 
statement in the year were a net loss of £18,919 million (2008: £25,105 million net loss). Of this, £1,877 million net loss (2008: 
£108 million net gain) related to financial investments designated as trading and £17,042 million net loss (2008: £25,213 million 
net loss) related to investments designated as other than trading. 
The movement in the unrealised gain/loss position reported in the statement of financial position during the year, shown in the 
table above, includes foreign exchange movements on the translation of unrealised gains and losses on financial investments held 
by foreign subsidiaries, which are recognised in other comprehensive income, as well as transfers due to the realisation of gains 
and losses on disposal and the recognition of impairment losses. 
Total impairments of financial investments recognised in the income statement in the year, disclosed in note 6, were £538 
million (2008: £973 million). This comprised impairments of financial investments classified as available-for-sale of £482 million 
(2008: £830 million) disclosed in the table below, and impairments of financial investments classified as fair value through profit 
or loss of £56 million (2008: £143 million).

(e) Financial investment arrangements 
(i) Stock lending arrangements 
The Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas during the year in accordance with established 
market conventions. The majority of the Group’s stock lending transactions occurs in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-
regulated, locally-domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law. 
The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements. Collateral must be in a readily realisable 
form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts. Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no 
market risk or economic benefit is taken. The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where 
this is considered necessary to manage the Group’s risk exposure. 
In certain markets, the Group or the Group’s appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral 
received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default. The carrying amounts of financial 
assets received and pledged in this manner at 31 December 2009 were £16,909 million and £703 million respectively (2008: 
£18,486 million and £322 million respectively, 2007: £23,779 million and £4 million respectively). The value of collateral that was 
actually sold or re-pledged in the absence of default was £nil (2008: £nil). 
In addition to the above, the Group has received and pledged cash collateral under stock lending arrangement that has been 
recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation or receivable for its return. These latter balances 
are shown separately in notes 49 and 25 respectively. 
(ii) Stock repurchase arrangements 
Included within financial investments are £664 million (2008: £383 million, 2007: £358 million) of debt securities and other fixed 
income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements. The obligations arising under these arrangements 
are shown in note 49. 
(iii) Other arrangements 
In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Group’s UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on 
behalf of the policyholders. Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its 
payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits. At 31 December 2009, £703 million (2008: £474 million, 2007: £nil) of 
financial investments were restricted in this way. 
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the 
holders of policies issued in those countries. Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and spread of the Group’s trading base. 
No further credit risk provision is therefore required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.

The level of capitalised acquisition costs for new long-term business reduced by £390 million in 2009, reflecting lower new 
business in the US. The amortisation reduced by £214 million in 2009, mainly in the UK where improved asset values impacted 
on projected profits, particularly management charges on unit-linked funds, leading to lower amortisation. 
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a 
movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit. It is estimated that the movement in DAC balance would 
reduce profit by £5 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to reduce by 1% and reduce profit by £20 million 
if equity and property market values were to fall by 10% from year end 2009 levels. 
The shadow adjustments relate to deferred acquisition costs on business in the United States backed by investments classified 
as available for sale. As explained in accounting policy K, unrealised gains and losses on the AFS investments and the shadow 
adjustments above are both recognised directly in other comprehensive income. 
(c) Other assets 
Other assets include £1 million (2008: £1 million, 2007: £66 million) that is expected to be recovered more than one year after 
the statement of financial position date. 
(d) Prepayments and accrued income 
Prepayments and accrued income of £3,604 million (2008: £3,762 million, 2007: £2,986 million), include £148 million 
(2008: £259 million, 2007: £111 million) that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of 
financial position date.

29 – Equity compensation plans 
This note describes the various equity compensation plans we use, and shows how we value the options and awards of shares in 
the Company. 
(a) Description of the plans 
The Group maintains a number of active stock option and award schemes. These are as follows: 
(i) Savings-related options 
These are options granted under the Inland Revenue-approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) share option schemes in the UK and in 
Ireland. Options are normally exercisable during the six month period following either the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the 
start of the relevant savings contract. 
(ii) Executive share options 
These are options granted on various dates from 1999 to 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Scheme or predecessor 
schemes. Options granted between 1999 and 2000 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to either the Company’s 
return on equity shareholders’ funds (ROE) or its relative total shareholder return (TSR) against a chosen comparator group. In 
respect of options granted from 2000 the performance condition has been a mixture of both ROE and TSR measures. In all cases, 
performance is measured over a three-year performance period and the options are normally exercisable between the third and 
tenth anniversary of their grant. 
(iii) Deferred bonus plan options 
These are options granted in 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan. Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus in 
exchange for an award of shares of equal value also received a matching award over an equal number of share options. The 
exercise of these options is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions. These options are exercisable up to the tenth 
anniversary of their grant. 
(iv) Long-term incentive plan awards 
These awards have been made under the Aviva Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 and are described in Section (b) below and in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. 
(v) Annual bonus plan awards 
These awards have been made under the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2005, and are described in Section (b) below and in the 
Directors’ remuneration report. 
(vi) One Aviva, twice the value bonus plan awards 
These are conditional awards first granted under the Aviva Annual Bonus Plan 2005 in 2008, and are described in section (b) below 
and in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
(b) Outstanding options and awards

The vesting of awards under the Aviva Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 is subject to the attainment of performance conditions 
as described in the Directors’ remuneration report. Shares which do not vest, lapse. 
(iii) Shares to satisfy awards and options 
Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares 
purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the 
various executive incentive plans and funded by the Company. 
From March 2003 to July 2008, it was generally the Company’s practice to satisfy the awards granted after March 2003 by the 
issue of new shares at the time of vesting. However, since July 2008, it has been the Company’s practice to satisfy all awards and 
options using shares purchased in the market and held by employee trusts except where local regulations make it necessary to 
issue new shares. Further details are given in note 30.

(e) Fair value of options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 
The weighted average fair values of options and awards granted during the year, estimated by using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model, were £1.78 and £1.94 (2008: £1.99 and £4.44) respectively. 
(i) Share options 
The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: 
Weighted average assumption 2009 2008 
Share price 480p 518p 
Exercise price 316p 410p 
Expected volatility 55% 32.6% 
Expected life 5.00 years 5.00 years 
Expected dividend yield 5.06% 5.5% 
Risk-free interest rate 2.47% 4.4% 
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life 
of the options prior to its date of grant. 
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant. The bonds 
chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options. 
12,559 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year (2008: 1,112,282). 
(ii) Share awards 
The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: 
Weighted average assumption 2009 2008 
Share price 216.25p 608p 
Expected volatility* 60% 25% 
Expected volatility of comparator companies’ share price* 61% 26% 
Correlation between Aviva and competitors’ share price* 55% 65% 
Expected life 2.75 years 2.78 years 
Expected dividend yield 8.23% 4.5% 
Risk-free interest rate* 1.76% 3.9% 
* For awards with market-based performance conditions. 
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of 
the options prior to its date of grant. 
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant. The bonds chosen 
were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.

30 – Shares held by employee trusts 
We satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans primarily through shares purchased in the market and 
held by employees share trusts. This note gives details of the shares held in these trusts. 
Movements in the carrying value of shares held by employee trusts comprise: 
2009 2008 
Number £m Number £m 
Cost debited to shareholders’ funds 
At 1 January 8,635,582 33 1,521,064 10 
Acquired in the year 14,000,000 54 8,500,000 29 
Distributed in the year (4,656,350) (19) (1,385,482) (6) 
Balance at 31 December 17,979,232 68 8,635,582 33 
The shares are owned by an employee share trust with an undertaking to satisfy awards of shares in the Company under the 
Group’s equity compensation plans. Details of the features of the plans can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
These shares were purchased in the market and are carried at cost less amounts charged to the income statement in prior 
years. At 31 December 2009, they had an aggregate nominal value of £4,494,808 (2008: £2,158,896, 2007: £380,266) and a 
market value of £71,539,364 (2008: £33,678,770, 2007: £10,236,761). The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the 
shares held in the trusts. 
31 – Preference share capital 
This note gives details of Aviva plc’s preference share capital. 
The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2009 was: 
2009 2008 
£m £m

200,000,000 cumulative irredeemable preference shares of £1 each 200 200

/4% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of £1 each 100 100 
200 200 
The Sterling preference shares, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the 
Company’s ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue. The issued 
preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered. 
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares. The Company does not have 
a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may 
make dividend payments at their discretion.

990 990 990 
The euro and sterling direct capital instruments (the DCIs) were issued on 25 November 2004. They have no fixed redemption date 
but the Company may, at its sole option, redeem all (but not part) of the euro and sterling DCIs at their principal amounts on 
28 November 2014 and 27 July 2020 respectively, at which dates the interest rates change to variable rates, or on any respective 
coupon payment date thereafter. 
In addition, under certain circumstances defined in the terms and conditions of the issue, the Company may at its sole option: 
— substitute at any time not less than all of the DCIs for, or vary the terms of the DCIs so that they become, Qualifying Tier 1 
Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities; 
— substitute not less than all of the DCIs for fully paid non-cumulative preference shares in the Company. These preference shares 
could only be redeemed on 28 November 2014 in the case of the euro DCIs and on 27 July 2020 in the case of the sterling 
DCIs, or in each case on any dividend payment date thereafter. The Company has the right to choose whether or not to pay any 
dividend on the new shares, and any such dividend payment will be non-cumulative. 
The Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the DCIs on any relevant payment date. Deferred coupons shall be 
satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company: 
— Redemption; or 
— Substitution by, or variation so they become, alternative Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities; or 
— Substitution by preference shares. 
No interest will accrue on any deferred coupon. Deferred coupons will be satisfied by the issue and sale of ordinary shares in the 
Company at their prevailing market value, to a sum as near as practicable to (and at least equal to) the relevant deferred coupons. 
In the event of any coupon deferral, the Company will not declare or pay any dividend on its ordinary or preference share capital.

Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the “pooling of interests method” 
(or merger accounting), which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative 
accounting periods. Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated 
statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company 
for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary’s own share capital and share premium account. 
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration 
includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 
1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006. 
The balance on the reserve has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union 
companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc in 2005.

The shares issued in lieu of dividends are in respect of the transfer to retained earnings from the ordinary dividend account, arising 
from the treatment of these shares explained in note 28(b). 
The Group’s regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on 
applicable local regulations. Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the 
extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.

The minority shareholders in two subsidiaries in France and Italy hold options requiring the Group to purchase their shares. Both 
sets of minority shareholders have recently indicated that they intend to exercise these options in 2010. We have therefore 
classified their interest as at 31 December 2009 to financial liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.

(b) Long-term business liabilities 
(i) Business description 
The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: 
— In the UK mainly in: 
–	 New With-Profits sub-fund (NWPSF) of Aviva Life & Pensions UK (UKLAP), where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to 
at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance. Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that 
is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support 
Account (RIEESA) (see below). 
–	 Old With-Profits sub-fund (OWPSF), With-Profits sub-fund (WPSF) and Provident Mutual sub-fund (PMSF) of UKLAP, where 
the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance. 
–	 “Non-profit” funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits. 
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are 
derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds. 
–	 The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but 
these cannot be distributed until the “lock-in” criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met. RIEESA will be used to 
write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF. 
— In France, where the majority of policyholders’ benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain 
guarantees, and shareholders’ profits are derived largely from management fees. In addition, a substantial number of policies 
participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders. 
— In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the 
benefit of the shareholders. The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods 
and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands. In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are 
determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders’ profits are derived largely from 
management fees. 
— In the United States, there are two main types of business – protection products and accumulation products. Protection 
products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies. The accumulation 
product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business 
customers. In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary

(ii) Group practice 
The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Group’s life operations. The provisions for overseas 
subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, 
modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act. 
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions 
where discretion is permitted. In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations. 
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality/morbidity rates. 
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are 
included in the movements in the long-term business provision. 
(iii) Methodology and assumptions 
There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts – the net premium 
method and the gross premium method – both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims. 
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based 
on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability. The difference between this premium and the 
actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses. This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract 
by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency. Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses (including those 
vesting following the most recent fund valuation), but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses. However, 
this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount 
rate used. 
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest 
and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses. These assumptions can vary by contract type and 
reflect current and expected future experience. Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for 
future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses. 
(a) UK 
With-profit business 
The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the 
shareholders’ share of future bonuses. The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit 
reserve (WPBR) and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR (referred to as the cost of future 
policy-related liabilities). The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related 
liabilities. The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of 
the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the 
contract. 
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular 
and final bonuses. 
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: 
— Maturity Guarantees 
— Guaranteed Annuity Options 
— GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers 
— Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise 
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profits sub-funds in UKLAP, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made 
in respect of guarantees. 
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based 
on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period. Non-market-related assumptions (for 
example, persistency, mortality and expenses) are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends. 
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: 
Future investment return 
A “risk-free” rate equal to the spot yield on UK Government securities, plus a margin of 0.1% is used. The rates vary, according 
to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2009 being 4.35% (2008: 3.58%) for a policy with 
10 years outstanding. 
Volatility of investment return 
Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available or on a best 
estimate basis where not. These are term-dependent, with specimen values for 10 year terms as follows: 
Financial statements IFRS 
 Volatility 
2009 2008 
Equity returns 26.6% 34.6% 
Property returns 15.0% 15.0% 
Fixed interest yields 14.4% 15.9% 
The table above shows the volatility of fixed interest yields, set with reference to 20 year at-the-money swaption volatilities.

38 – Insurance liabilities continued 
Future regular bonuses 
Annual bonus assumptions for 2010 have been set consistently with the year end 2009 declaration. Future annual bonus rates 
reflect the principles and practices of the fund. In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and 
the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice. 
Mortality 
Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends. 
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below:

PCMA00/PCFA00 adjusted plus

Non-profit business 
Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which 
discount projected future cash flows. The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together 
with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses. 
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience. 
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to 
the bid value of units. The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption 
that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue. Where appropriate, allowance for persistency 
is based on actual experience. 
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term 
interest rates as measured by gilt yields. An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties 
with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, 
mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class. A further margin for risk is then deducted for all 
asset classes. 
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under 
the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of 
the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.

The majority of reserves arise from a single premium savings product and is based on the accumulated fund value, adjusted 
to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities. The net premium method is used for 
prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of 
the contract. The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based 
on industry tables.

On transition to IFRS, the valuation of most long-term insurance and participating investment contracts was changed from existing 
methods that used historic assumptions to an active basis using current market interest rates. A liability adequacy test is performed 
in line with IFRS requirements. Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, 
the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash 
flows. The yield curve is constructed from yields on collateralised AAA bonds.

(d) United States 
For the major part of our US business, insurance liabilities are measured in accordance with US GAAP as at the date of acquisition. 
The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on 
guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values. Reserve interest assumptions ranged from 
2.00% to 7.50% in 2009 (2008: 2.00% to 7.50%). The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2009 
was 4.47% (2008: 4.47%).

Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
38 – Insurance liabilities continued 
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a 
retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. For the indexed products, 
the liability held is calculated based on the option budget method and is equal to the host contract and the calculated value of the 
derivative. The value of the derivative is based on the present value of the difference between the projected fund value and the 
underlying fund guarantee. The weighted average interest crediting rates for universal life products were 4.27% in 2009 (2008: 
4.77%). The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 2.00% to 
6.00% in 2009 (2008: 2.50% to 6.00%). An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other 
insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally-weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, 
policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality. The additional liability represents the present 
value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions. 
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain 
indices. A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum 
guaranteed value. A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the 
customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices. Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are 
valued at their fair value. 
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is 
expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years. The excess charges are 
deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs. Shadow adjustments 
may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities. 
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income so that unrealised gains or losses on investments 
that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same 
way as realised gains or losses. 
(e) Other countries 
In all other countries, local generally-accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different 
categories of business as appropriate. The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific 
groupings of people. 
(iv) Movements 
The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 
2009 2008 
£m £m 
Carrying amount at 1 January 156,188 135,312 
Provisions in respect of new business 11,105 13,414 
Expected change in existing business provisions (7,625) (6,423) 
Variance between actual and expected experience 2,154 (9,401) 
Effect of adjusting to PS06/14 realistic basis — (40) 
Impact of other operating assumption changes (121) (812) 
Impact of economic assumption changes (404) (604) 
Other movements 1,112 (527) 
Change in liability recognised as an expense 6,221 (4,393) 
Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals (67) 1,872 
Foreign exchange rate movements (8,284) 23,397 
154,058 156,188 Carrying amount at 31 December 
The variance between actual and expected experience of £2.2 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment 
markets in 2009, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values. Equity markets recovered and the values of corporate 
bonds and commercial mortgages were increased by the narrowing of credit spreads. For many types of long-term business, 
including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting 
the net impact on profit. Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality 
and other demographic factors. 
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance 
liabilities. The £2.2 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions. For participating 
business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does 
not impact on profit. Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions 
and estimates during the year shown in note 42, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets. 
(c) General insurance and health liabilities 
(i) Provisions for outstanding claims 
Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in 
assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position 
date. The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available. However, it is inherent 
in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.

Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment 
expenses (LAE) in respect of all claims that have already occurred. The provisions established cover reported claims and associated 
LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE. 
We only establish loss reserves for losses that have already occurred. We therefore do not establish catastrophe equalisation 
reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to 
future periods in which catastrophes may occur. When calculating reserves, we take into account estimated future recoveries from 
salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their 
collectability.

of reinsurance, by major line of business.

Financial statements IFRS 
The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was £13,576 million (2008: £15,061 million). The period of time which 
will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims. 
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency 
having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims. The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the 
claims and is given in the table above. The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 
8 and 15 years depending on the geographical region. Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the 
accounting period is reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change. 
During 2009, we have experienced an increase in the number of bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders (PPOs) 
or structured settlements, especially in the UK, which are reserved for on a discounted basis. 
(iii) Assumptions 
Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation. Case estimates are generally set by 
skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims. Taking into account 
all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and 
inspections. Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting 
estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim. Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for 
authorisation.   
 
 
 
214 
Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
38 – Insurance liabilities continued 
No adjustments are made to the claims technicians’ case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions 
when the estimated ultimate cost of a large or unusual claim may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, 
to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then 
estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson 
methods. The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a company’s past claims development experience can be used 
to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid 
and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected 
loss ratios. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also 
used where this is considered appropriate. 
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business. Certain lines of 
business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage. In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, 
either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future 
development. 
The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio 
assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative 
judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off 
occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims 
inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling 
procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range 
of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved. The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result 
in the quantification of a reserve range. 
However, the following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: 
UK mesothelioma claims 
The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail 
nature of the liabilities. UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Group’s latent claims. The key assumptions 
underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average 
cost of claims, legal fees and the life expectancy of potential sufferers. 
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies. Many different scenarios can be 
derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions. An upper and lower 
scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate £195 million greater 
than the best estimate, or £155 million lower than the best estimate. These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or 
lower bound on these liabilities. 
Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities 
The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at 
the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims. The range of discount rates used is 
shown in section (ii) above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date. At 31 December 2009, it is estimated 
that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately £60 million, excluding the offsetting 
effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business. The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all 
assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56(i). 
Allowance for risk and uncertainty 
The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit 
reserve uncertainty distributions. The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims adopted by the Group at 31 December 2009 
requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, 
plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty. The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in 
accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to 
each line of business and type of claim in that territory. The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure 
that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods. 
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques. However, 
allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the 
explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.

The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in note 42 and the economic assumption changes are explained in note 9. 
Exceptional strengthening of claim provisions 
In 2009 an exceptional charge of £60 million was incurred for the strengthening of reserves in respect of several specific 
discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago, which is included in change in 
insurance liabilities. 
In 2008 the Institute of Actuaries’ Asbestos Working Party report contributed to our view that experience variances, which 
we had previously perceived as normal short-term volatility, reflected a real worsening of expected ultimate claims experience. 
The market trend in mesothelioma claims was fully reflected as a significant one-off strengthening of gross latent claims reserves 
in 2008 of £356 million, with a corresponding increase of £52 million in reinsurance recoverable. The net increase of £304 million 
comprised £668 million on an undiscounted basis and discounting of £364 million. 
(d) Loss development tables 
(i) Description of tables 
The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 
2001 to 2009. The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident 
year. For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2009 £5,767 million had actually been paid in settlement 
of claims. In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of £6,250 million 
was re-estimated to be £6,044 million at 31 December 2009. 
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and 
overall claim frequency and severity. 
In 2005, the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years were required to be disclosed. This is being increased in each succeeding 
additional year, until 10 years of information is included. 
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against 
adverse future claims experience and development. As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the 
absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss 
development tables and movements table (c)(iv) above. However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group 
establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year (2009) where the development of claims is less mature and there 
is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims. Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an 
improvement in the estimated cost of claims. 
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2008 were: 
— £285 million from the UK, mainly due to an improved trend in bodily injury experience on both personal and commercial motor, 
favourable experience on commercial liability and a reduction in public liability average claim costs. 
— £312 million from Europe, mainly due to lower than expected IBNR and costs of settling motor and commercial liability claims.
 
— £111 million from Canada, mainly due to favourable motor bodily injury experience. 

— £89 million from prior year health insurance provisions.  

Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2009 were:  

— £230 million from the UK, including group reinsurance business, mainly due to an improved view of group reinsurance liabilities, 
and favourable development on personal and commercial motor claims, and commercial property and commercial liability 
large claims. 
— £237 million from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal motor and commercial property, especially 
in respect of large claims. 
— £79 million from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor and personal property.

In the loss development tables shown above, the cumulative claim payments and estimates of cumulative claims for each accident 
year are translated into sterling at the exchange rates that applied at the end of that accident year. The impact of using varying 
exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table. Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the 
disposed entity as “paid” at the date of disposal. 
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from 
business written before 2001. The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 
31 December 2009 were £968 million (2008: £1,019 million, 2007 £323 million). The movement in the year reflects exceptional 
strengthening of provisions by £60 million in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a 
significant number of years ago (2008: £668 million due to the increased market trend in mesothelioma claim notifications), other 
releases of £62 million (2008: £16 million strengthening), foreign exchange rate movements and timing differences between claim 
payments and reinsurance recoveries.

39 – Liability for investment contracts 
This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how we calculate these liabilities and what 
assumptions we have used. 
(a) Carrying amount 
The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 
2009 2008 2007 
£m £m £m 
Long-term business 
Participating contracts 66,559 65,278 53,609 
Non-participating contracts at fair value 41,289 39,509 43,608 
Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 2,167 2,772 1,027 
43,456 42,281 44,635 
Total 110,015 107,559 98,244 
(b) Long-term business investment liabilities 
Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are 
therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS. 
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right 
to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. These are referred to as participating contracts and are 
measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 38. They are 
not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under 
IFRS. In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall. 
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project. 
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified 
as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus. Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 40. 
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and 
the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost. 
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, £39,686 million are unit-linked in structure and the 
fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis. These contracts 
are classified as ‘Level 1’ in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied 
by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant. Of the remaining non-participating contracts measured at 
fair value at 31 December 2009, £238 million are classified as ‘Level 1’, £1,203 million are classified as ‘Level 2’ and £162 million 
are classified as ‘Level 3’ in the fair value hierarchy. ‘Level 3’ investment contracts had a fair value of £178 million at 31 December 
2008, with the movement in the year represented by foreign exchange movements of £19 million offset by new policy issuances 
of £3 million. We believe that changing one or more of the assumptions that support the ‘Level 3’ valuation to reasonably possible 
alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly. In respect of investment contracts carried at fair value there 
were no transfers between different levels of the fair value hierarchy during 2009. 
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of 
transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are 
amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term. The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 
26 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 50. 
In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts. These contracts may not be cancelled 
by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may, subject to a call premium, be terminated by Aviva at any 
time. Aviva issued no new funding agreements in 2009. The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate 
funding agreements as at 31 December 2009 were 4.79% and 0.37% respectively. Funding agreements issued before 2008 are 
measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows, and for business issued since 2008 are measured at 
amortised cost. Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk. 
Funding agreements carried at fair value total £1,093 million and are classified as ‘Level 2’ in the fair value hierarchy. 
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.

(c) Movements in the year 
The following movements have occurred in the year: 
(i) Participating investment contracts

£m £m 
Carrying amount at 1 January 65,278 53,609 
Provisions in respect of new business 5,973 3,391

Foreign exchange rate movements (4,256) 12,576 
Other movements 19 — 
Carrying amount at 31 December 66,559 65,278 
The variance between actual and expected experience of £2.5 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment 
markets in 2009, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values. Equity markets recovered and the values of corporate 
bonds and commercial mortgages were increased by the narrowing of credit spreads. For many types of long-term business, 
including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting 
the net impact on profit. Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality 
and other demographic factors. 
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating 
investment contract liabilities. The £2.5 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change in assumptions. 
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible 
surplus and does not impact on profit. Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of 
changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 42, together with the impact of movements in related 
non-financial assets.

The variance between actual and expected experience of £2.5 billion was primarily driven by favourable movements in investment 
markets in 2009, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values. Equity markets recovered and the value of corporate 
bonds and commercial mortgages were increased by the narrowing of credit spreads. For unit-linked investment contracts, 
movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. Minor variances 
arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors. 
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non­ participating investment contract liabilities. The £2.5 billion variance between actual and expected experience is not a change 
in assumptions. The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates 
during the year shown in note 42, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the 
impact of movements in related non-financial assets.

Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
40 – Financial guarantees and options 
This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products. 
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including 
investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products. Further information 
on assumptions is given in notes 38 and 39. 
(a) UK Life with-profit business 
In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSA’s realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation 
of FSA liabilities. Under the FSA’s rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair 
value, using market-consistent stochastic models. A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and 
options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions. 
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: 
(i) Maturity value guarantees 
Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum 
maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus. In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value 
guarantees on certain unit-linked products. For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy 
anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI/CPI. 
(ii) No market valuation reduction (MVR) guarantees 
For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a “no MVR” guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy 
anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value 
of units and the market value of the underlying assets. 
(iii) Guaranteed annuity options 
The Group’s UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate 
options (GAOs), where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on 
guaranteed conversion rates. The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities. 
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were £760 million at 31 December 2009 (2008: £1,093 million, 
2007: £1,161 million). With the exception of the New With-Profits Sub Fund (NWPSF), movements in the realistic liabilities in the 
with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit. 
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were £109 million at 31 December 2009 (2008 and 2007: not applicable). 
(iv) Guaranteed minimum pension 
The Group’s UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the 
condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy. 
In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit 
mortgage endowments. Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to 
a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall. For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to 
certain conditions. 
(b) UK Life non-profit business 
The Group’s UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 
under FSA Policy Statement 06/14 Prudential Changes for Insurers. 
(i) Guaranteed annuity options 
Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products. Provision for these 
guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to £28 million 
at 31 December 2009 (2008: £27 million, 2007: £36 million). 
(ii) Guaranteed unit price on certain products 
Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at 
retirement or death. No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds 
is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and 
interest rates. 
(c) Overseas life businesses 
In addition to guarantees written in the Group’s UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing 
guarantees and options. Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below. 
(i) France 
Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses 
Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees. The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value 
of the contract including accrued bonuses. Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the 
duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains 
on equity-type investments. Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values. Local statutory accounting envisages the 
establishment of a reserve, “Provision pour Aléas Financiers” (PAF), when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed 
minimum credited returns. No PAF was established at the end of 2008.

40 – Financial guarantees and options continued 
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of £33 billion at 31 December 2009 (2008: 
£33 billion, 2007: £24 billion). The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 75% of the average of the last two years’ declared 
bonus rates and was 3.67% for 2009 (2008: 3.66%, 2007: 3.64%) compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.62% 
(2008: 4.85%,2007: 4.92%). 
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of £12 billion at 31 December 2009 (2008: £12 billion, 
2007: £8 billion) and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between nil and 4.5%. 
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits 
In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and/or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal 
to the premiums paid. The reserve held in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2009 for this 
guarantee is £97 million (2008: £113 million, 2007: £30 million). The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of 
the economic liability. At the end of 2009, total sums at risk for these contracts were £372 million (2008: £1,279 million, 2007: 
£63 million) out of total unit-linked funds of £14 billion (2008: £14 billion, 2007: £15 billion). The average age of policyholders 
was approximately 54. It is estimated that this liability would increase by £71 million (2008: £59 million, 2007: £17 million) if yields 
were to decrease by 1% per annum and by £25 million (2008: £22 million, 2007: £7 million) if equity markets were to decline by 
10% from year end 2009 levels. These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option. 
(ii) Delta Lloyd 
Guaranteed minimum return at maturity 
In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts. 
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% 
per annum. On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values 
or to premium rates. 
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest 
rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value. The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for 
directly in the liabilities. Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee 
shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee. 
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2009 are £13 billion (2008: £14 billion, 2007: £10 billion) analysed 
as follows:

Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa. 
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee. The additional provision for the guarantee was 
£246 million (2008: £226 million, 2007: £70 million). An additional provision of £33 million (2008: £121 million, 2007: 
£19 million) in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held. It is estimated that the 
provision would increase by £180 million (2008: £255 million, 2007: £211 million) if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 
£42 million (2008: £56 million, 2007: £21 million) if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels. 
(iii) Ireland 
Guaranteed annuity options 
Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland. The current net of reinsurance provision for 
such options is £214 million (2008: £180 million, 2007: £160 million). This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making 
conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up 
and long-term interest rates. 
These GAOs are “in the money” at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been 
hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives (swaptions). The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate 
of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.

40 – Financial guarantees and options continued 
‘No MVR’ guarantees 
Certain unitised with-profit policies containing ‘no MVR’ guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland. 
These guarantees are currently ‘in-the-money’ by £10 million (2008: ‘in-the-money’ by £16 million, 2007: ‘out-of-the-money’ 
by £53 million). This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the 
discounted value (excluding terminal bonus) of the guarantees. The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the 
performance of investments held in the with-profit fund. Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses 
declared on these policies. It is estimated that the guarantees would be ‘in-the-money’ by £10 million (2008: ‘in-the-money’ 
by £16 million, 2007: ‘out-of-the-money’ by £46 million) if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by £10 million (2008: 
‘in-the-money’ by £16 million, 2007: ‘out-of-the-money’ by £29 million) if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 
2009 levels. There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these 
funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds. 
Return of premium guarantee 
Until 2005, Hibernian Life wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, 
after five or six years. The provision for these over and above unit and sterling reserves, at the end of 2009 is £11 million 
(2008: £18 million, 2007: £0.1 million). 
It is estimated that the provision would increase by £4 million (2008: £4 million, 2007: £1 million) if equity markets were to 
decline by 10% from the year end 2009 levels. However, the provision increase would be broadly off-set by an increase in the 
value of the hedging assets that were set up on sale of these policies. We would not expect any significant impact on this provision 
as a result of interest rate movements. It is estimated that the provision would increase by £2 million if property values were to 
decline by 10% from year end 2009 levels. This would be offset by an increase in the value of the hedging assets by £0.4 million, 
the difference reflecting the fact that only the second tranche was hedged for property exposure. 
(iv) Spain and Italy 
Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values 
The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain 
and Italy. Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, 
subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business 
the maximum guaranteed rate is lower. Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an 
explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations. At 31 December 2009, total liabilities for the 
Spanish business were £3 billion (2008: £5 billion, 2007: £4 billion) with a further reserve of £11 million (2008: £19 million, 
2007: £16 million) for guarantees. Total liabilities for the Italian business were £6 billion (2008: £5 billion, 2007: £4 billion), with a 
further provision of £52 million (2008: £55 million, 2007: £48 million) for guarantees. Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in 
the level of interest rates. It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by £46 million (2008: £59 million, 
2007: £66 million) in Spain and £16 million (2008: £5 million, 2007: £14 million) in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2009 
values. Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market 
interest rate of 1.6% and no lapses or premium discontinuances. 
(v) United States 
Indexed and total return strategy products 
In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products. These products guarantee the return of principal  

to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index.  

A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder. 

The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.  

The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 1.87% (2008: 5.30%, 2007: 1.05%) for indexed life and 1.65% 
(2008: 5.30%, 2007: 1.05%) for indexed deferred annuities is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the 
embedded options. 
The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction 
to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default. The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded 
options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2009 is an increase of £313 million (2008: £514 million decrease), and is principally 
attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk. There were no significant gains or losses attributable to 
the risk adjustment or instrument specific credit risk. At 31 December 2009, the total liabilities for indexed products were 
£17 billion (2008: £15 billion, 2007: £8 billion), including liabilities for the embedded option of £1.7 billion (2008: £1.9 billion, 
2007: £1.2 billion). If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by £59 million 
(2008: £138 million, 2007: £89 million) and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by £86 million 
(2008: £155 million, 2007: £86 million). 
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to 
allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account. The Group guarantees a minimum return 
of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts. The linked general account assets are fixed maturity 
securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value. At 31 December 2009, the liabilities for total 
return strategy products were £1.2 billion (2008: £1.5 billion, 2007: £1.2 billion). 
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred 
annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their 
financial life. At 31 December 2009, a total of £4.9 billion (2008: £3.2 billion, 2007: £0.7 billion) in indexed deferred annuities 
have elected this benefit taking steps to guarantee retirement income.

40 – Financial guarantees and options continued 
(d) Sensitivity 
In providing these guarantees and options, the Group’s capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including 
foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices. Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as 
those available on guaranteed annuity options (GAOs), are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level. Other 
guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations 
in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made. 
41 – Reinsurance assets 
This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities. 
(a) Carrying amounts 
The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 
2009 2008 2007 
£m £m £m 
Long-term business 
Insurance contracts 4,299 4,466 4,298

Other technical provisions — — 5 
1,975 2,184 2,179 
Total 7,572 7,894 8,054 
Of the above total, £4,493 million (2008: £6,097 million, 2007: £4,796 million) is expected to be recovered more than one year 
after the statement of financial position date. 
The increase in the reinsurers' share of provisions for claims incurred but not reported during 2009 is due to a revised 
allocation between outstanding claims and IBNR of reinsurance assets in respect of certain discontinued run-off business. 
(b) Assumptions 
The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts. 
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability. 
(c) Movements 
The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: 
(i) In respect of long-term business provisions 
2009 2008 
£m £m

Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals (41) 140 
Foreign exchange rate movements (334) 993 
Carrying amount at 31 December 5,557 5,565 
Financial statements IFRS 
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets. 
The reduction in the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to Ireland, with a corresponding reduction made 
to gross insurance contract liabilities. For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a 
corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit. Where assumption changes do 
impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 42, together 
with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.

42 – Effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year 
Certain estimates and assumptions used in determining our liabilities for insurance and investment contract business were changed 
from 2008 to 2009, affecting the profit recognised for the year with an equivalent effect on liabilities. This note analyses the effect 
of the changes. This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition 
costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.

The impact of interest rates for long-term business relates primarily to the US, driven by the reduction in credit spreads on 
corporate bonds; this had the effect of increasing liabilities for indexed business and hence a negative impact on profit. The overall 
impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure. 
Other assumption changes include the effect of business migration and expense inflation adjustments in the UK, and reserve 
releases in Asia.

43 – Unallocated divisible surplus 
An unallocated divisible surplus (UDS) is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between 
shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain. This note shows the movements in this surplus during the year. 
The following movements have occurred in the year: 
2009 2008

Carrying amount at 31 December 3,866 2,325 
In Italy, the UDS balances were £92 million negative in total at 31 December 2009 (2008: France, Italy and Spain £924 million 
negative, 2007: Italy £116 million negative) because of an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market 
value and participating liabilities measured using local practice. In each case, the negative balance is considered to be recoverable 
from margins in the existing participating business liabilities. 
44 – Special bonus and reattribution of the inherited estate 
This note describes the special distribution and reattribution of the inherited estate in our UK Life business. 
(a) Special bonus declared by UK Life business 
On 5 February 2008, the Group’s UK long-term business operation, Norwich Union Life, announced a one-off, special bonus worth 
an estimated £2.3 billion, benefiting around 1.1 million with-profit policyholders in its CGNU Life and CULAC with-profit funds. 
The bonus is being used to enhance policy values by around 10% in total, in three instalments, with the qualifying dates being 
1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2010. In accordance with the way the funds are managed, the bonus distribution 
is being split on a 90/10 basis between policyholders and shareholders. £2,127 million was set aside for policyholders on 1 January 
2008, and subject to market movements from that date, will be allocated over three years. Similarly, shareholders will receive 
£236 million, subject to market movements, over the three year period. 
As explained in accounting policies F and K, the Group’s insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and FRS 27, Life Assurance. The latter requires liabilities for with-profit 
funds falling within the scope of the UK’s Financial Services Authority’s capital regime to be determined in accordance with this 
regime, adjusted to remove the shareholders’ share of future bonuses. This required us to recognise planned discretionary bonuses 
within policyholder liabilities at 31 December 2007, even if there was no constructive obligation at the time. As a result of the 
announcement made above, a transfer of £2,127 million was made in 2007 from the UDS in order to increase insurance liabilities 
by £1,728 million and participating investment contract liabilities by £399 million. Of the original £236 million due to shareholders, 
£69 million has been transferred from the UDS in 2009 (2008: £89 million). 
(b) Impact of the reattribution of the inherited estate 
On 1 October 2009 a reorganisation of the with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance Limited (CGNU) and Commercial Union Life 
Assurance Company Limited (CULAC) was approved by the Board and became effective. The reorganisation is achieved through a 
reattribution to shareholders of the inherited estates of these funds. As part of the reorganisation the two funds were merged and 
transferred to Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (UKLAP). 
Within UKLAP, two new with-profit sub-funds have been created. Policies of non-electing policyholders have been transferred 
to the Old With-Profit Sub-Fund (OWPSF). The inherited estate has not been reattributed and remains in the OWPSF. 
Where policyholders elected to accept the reattribution their policies have been transferred to the New With-Profit Sub-Fund 
(NWPSF). The inherited estate, totalling £1,105 million at 1 October 2009, has been reattributed to a separate long-term fund 
called the Non-Profit Sub-Fund 1(NPSF1), in which 100% of the surplus is attributable to shareholders. 
On the effective date of 1 October 2009, the unallocated divisible surplus of NWPSF was released as it has been allocated 
to shareholders. The release of this liability is included in the impact below. The reorganisation scheme has imposed certain 
restrictions around release of the assets allocated to shareholders as a result of this transaction, to ensure that sufficient protection 
for with-profit policyholder benefits is maintained.

Notes: 
(a)The unallocated divisible surplus transferred to the NWPSF, in proportion to the electing policies, has been allocated to shareholders and released. The remaining UDS, transferred to the OWPSF 
in proportion to the non-electing policies, has not been released and remains unallocated. 
(b)Policyholder incentive payments total £471 million. Payments totalling £450 million were paid in cash and the remaining payments of £21 million were added to the value of certain policies 
in the form of additional benefits. 
(c) During the development stage of the scheme eligible costs were capitalised as a prepayment. As the benefit of the scheme has now been realised, these costs have been charged to the 
Income Statement. 
(d)A deferred tax liability has been recognised in accordance with IAS 12 on the temporary difference between the carrying value of the reattributed estate for tax and IFRS purposes. 
The initial impact of the reorganisation on profit before tax was £202 million, of which a loss of £5 million is recognised in 
operating profit, reflecting the value derived from the reorganisation. The remaining £207 million is recognised outside operating 
profit, off-setting the shareholder tax attributable to the transaction. 
Ongoing impact 
The reattribution has an ongoing impact arising from profits generated in the NWPSF that are attributable to shareholders. 
Included within profit before tax for the year of £2,022 million is £51 million that has been recognised as profit as a result of the 
reattribution of the inherited estate which comprises £56 million relating to the ongoing impact offset by a £5 million charge from 
the initial impact of the reattribution. Previously this profit would have been transferred to the unallocated distributable surplus.

45 – Tax assets and liabilities 
This note analyses the tax assets and liabilities that appear in the statement of financial position, and explains the movements 
in these balances in the year. 
(a) Current tax 
Current tax assets recoverable and liabilities payable in more than one year are £254 million and £49 million (2008: £230 million 
and £362 million). 
The taxation of foreign profits and worldwide debt cap rules were enacted in the Finance Act 2009. Under the foreign profits 
rules, a dividend exemption was introduced which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK corporation 
tax. The Group has applied this legislation in arriving at its UK tax results for 2009. The worldwide debt cap rules apply from 
1 January 2010 and are not expected to apply to the Group due to an exemption for qualifying financial services groups.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised 
in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available. Where this is the case the 
directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits. 
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of £2,975 million (2008: £2,961 million) to carry 
forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned. Of these, trading losses of 
£127 million will expire within the next 15 years. The remaining losses have no expiry date. 
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of £462 million (2008: £556 million). Of these, £345 million will expire 
within the next 15 years. The remaining capital losses have no expiry date. 
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings 
of £144 million (2008: £6,121 million) associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures and associates 
because the Group can control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 2009 are significantly reduced from those at 31 December 2008 
following the UK tax law change which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK tax. The temporary 
differences at 31 December 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries in respect of which a tax 
liability may still arise on remittance of those earnings to the UK, principally as a result of overseas withholding taxes on dividends.

47 – Pension obligations 
This note describes the Group’s pension arrangements for its employees and explains how our obligations to these schemes 
are calculated. 
(a) Introduction 
The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world. The only 
material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by 
far the largest. 
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term 
pension liabilities to past and present employees. In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which 
invests in the life funds of the Group. In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust 
documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes’ beneficiaries. The long-term investment 
objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes 
over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs 
of these schemes. 
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of 
scheme trustees and members. Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate 
methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.

(c) Main UK scheme 
In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme (ASPS) and the smaller RAC (2003) 
Pension Scheme. New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed to new 
employees. This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, 
staff, pensioners and an independent trustee (referred to below as the trustees). 
(i) Defined benefit section of the ASPS 
The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment 
strategy. Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed and funding 
levels are then monitored on an annual basis. 
At 31 March 2009, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over 
available assets, on a funding basis, which uses more prudent assumptions than are required for reporting under IAS 19, of 
£3.0 billion. At 31 December 2009, this figure is estimated to have fallen to £2.7 billion. The Company and the trustees are in 
advanced stages of finalising a long-term funding plan over which it will aim to eliminate the funding deficit. Under the current 
proposals, deficit funding payments in 2010 are expected to be £365 million. 
The employing companies’ contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2009 were 41% of employees’ 
pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year, and additional deficit funding payments totalling 
£52 million. As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected 
unit credit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benefits will continue to increase as the 
membership ages, leading to higher pension costs, and the number of members falls, leading to a higher charge per member. 
Pending finalisation of the funding plan above, the employers’ contribution rate for 2010 has been increased to 43% of 
pensionable salaries, with expected service funding contributions under the current proposals increasing to £130 million. Active 
members of this section of the ASPS contributed between 5% and 7.5% of their pensionable salaries, increasing to between 6% 
and 10% from 1 April 2010.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
47 – Pension obligations continued 
In 2006, the Group’s UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to 
identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements 
(MSAs) and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into pre- and post-MSA 
amounts. The results of this review were agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator. Consequently, 
with effect from 1 January 2006, the Company’s UK with-profit product companies are liable for a share, currently 12%, of the 
additional payments for deficit funding referred to above up to a total of £130 million. This has resulted in movements between 
the unallocated divisible surplus (UDS) and retained earnings via the statement of comprehensive income of £24 million in 2009 
(2008: £78 million) to reflect actuarial movements in the deficit during the year and therefore a change in the amount recoverable 
from the with-profit product companies. 
(ii) Defined contribution (money purchase) section of the ASPS 
The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for 
monitoring the performance of the available investment funds. Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions 
they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans. 
The employers’ contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section up to 30 June 2009 were 8% of pensionable 
salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contributed, and the cost of the death-in-service benefits. 
With effect from 1 July 2009, members of this section have contributed at least 1% of their pensionable salaries and, depending 
on the percentage chosen, the Company’s contribution has increased up to a maximum 14%. These contribution rates are 
unchanged for 2010.

(e) IAS 19 disclosures 
Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are given below. 
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those 
relating to defined contribution pensions. Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2010, including the ASPS deficit 
funding, are expected to be £565 million. 
(i) Assumptions on scheme liabilities 
The projected unit credit method 
The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis. 
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit 
method. This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance 
for their projected future earnings. It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic 
conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect 
the measurement of the pension obligations. 
Alternative measurement methods 
There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation (the present 
value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases) or on a solvency basis, using the 
cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out 
providers. This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations 
transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased 
to cover a part or all of the liability. A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher 
estimate of the pension deficit than under an ongoing approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the 
majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction. However, there are 
only a limited number of organisations that would be able to offer these options for schemes of the size of those in our Group. 
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out 
valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year end liabilities of £8.4 billion could be valued some £3.6 billion 
higher, at £12.0 billion.

47 – Pension obligations continued 
There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current 
capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present. The Canadian defined benefit plan’s 
liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity 
prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation. There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the 
plan’s liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche. 
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities. Neither of the alternative 
methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Group’s obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an 
ongoing basis, so they are not considered further. 
Valuations and assumptions 
The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take 
account of that standard’s requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2009. Scheme 
assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2009. 
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: 
UK Netherlands

The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, 
with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate. For each country, the discount rate is based on current 
average yields of high quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations. A 1% increase 
in this rate (and therefore the net discount rate) would reduce the liabilities by £1.8 billion and the service cost for the year by 
£31 million. 
Mortality assumptions 
Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Group’s obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given 
the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes. The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have 
been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.

The assumptions above are based on commonly-used mortality tables. In the UK, the standard mortality tables have been adjusted 
to reflect recent research into mortality experience. However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to 
considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption. In the UK schemes, which are by far the most 
material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial profession’s 
medium cohort projection table and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% p.a. for males and 
1.0% p.a. for females. The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the above schemes’ liabilities by 
£248 million and the service cost for the year by £5 million. 
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 22 years in the UK schemes and between 12 and 18 years in the 
overseas schemes. The undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme are expected to be as shown in 
the chart below:

(ii) Assumptions on scheme assets 
The expected rates of return on the schemes’ assets are:

2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 
Equities 7.8% 6.3% 6.8% 6.0% 7.6% 4.5% 7.2% 6.0%

Cash 0.9% 3.2% n/a 3.8% n/a n/a 2.9% 3.0% 
The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations. 
The expected returns for equities and properties have been aligned with the rates used for the longer-term investment return 
assumptions, other than in the Netherlands, where they have been developed in conjunction with external advisers due to the 
characteristics of the scheme. The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated 
after deducting investment expenses.

(iii) Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies 
Plan assets include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated statement of financial position of £101 million 
(2008: £99 million, 2007: £150 million) in the UK scheme, and insurance policies with other Group companies of £157 million 
and £1,351 million (2008: £150 million and £1,402 million, 2007: £143 million and £1,025 million) in the UK and Dutch schemes 
respectively. The Dutch insurance policies are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated 
as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions (see note 46). 
The treatment of the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows: 
Plan assets – The treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated statement of financial position is described above. 
Expected rates of return – Where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their 
expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section (ii) above. 
Pension expense – To avoid double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying 
policies, adjustments have been made to the former in the tables in section (iv) below. 
(iv) Pension expense 
As noted above, plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include insurance policies with other Group companies. To avoid 
double-counting of investment income on scheme assets and the assets backing the underlying policies, adjustments have been 
made to the former as shown in the tables below. 
The total pension expense for these schemes comprises:

assumptions in Ireland. 
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses on the pension schemes recognised in other comprehensive income since 
1 January 2004 (the date of transition to IFRS) is a loss of £2,230 million at 31 December 2009 (2008: loss of £1,090 million).

(vi) Risk management and asset allocation strategy 
As noted above, the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to 
meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to 
control the long-term costs of these schemes. To meet these objectives, each scheme’s assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, 
consisting primarily of equity and debt securities. These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard 
to the structure of liabilities within the schemes. 
Main UK scheme 
Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset/liability management of the main UK scheme. It is fully understood that, 
whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the 
scheme’s surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities. 
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: 
Equity market risk – the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets. 
Inflation risk – the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities. 
Interest rate risk – falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets. 
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities. The majority of 
this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments. 
In addition, the trustees have taken measures to partially mitigate inflation and interest rate risks, including entering into 
inflation and interest rate swaps to hedge approximately one third of the scheme’s exposure to these risks. 
Other schemes 
The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.

appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in “Other”. The Dutch insurance policies of £1,351 million (2008: 
£1,402 million, 2007: £1,025 million) are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other 
obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions (see note 46).

underlying the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, partly offset by a rise in equity and property investment values.

Subordinated debt is stated at net of notes held by Group companies of £35 million (2008: £33 million; 2007: £nil). 
Where subordinated debt is undated or loan notes are perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 
15 years. Annual interest payments for these borrowings are £75 million (2008: £89 million). 
Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market 
floating rates as applicable. Year end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies. 
All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost.

Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating 
rates as applicable. The reduction in future contractual undiscounted interest payments mainly reflects lower average interest 
payable at 31 December 2009 on floating rate securitised loan notes issued by our Dutch business, compared to 31 December 
2008. Year end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies. 
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates. Further details about these notes 
are given in note 23. 
All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost, except for the loan notes issued in connection with the UK lifetime 
mortgage business £1,444 million (2008: £1,590 million, 2007: £1,674 million) and £3,664 million (2008: £3,842 million, 2007: 
£3,337 million) of the loan notes issued in connection with the Dutch domestic mortgage business, which are carried at fair value. 
Fair values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity 
premium, and are therefore classified as “Level 2” in the fair value hierarchy. These have been designated at fair value through 
profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they 
are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any 
accounting mismatch.

The subordinated notes were issued by the Company. They rank below its senior obligations and ahead of its preference 
shares and ordinary share capital. The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes. The fair value 
of these notes at 31 December 2009 was £4,372 million (2008: £2,979 million, 2007: £3,006 million), calculated with reference 
to quoted prices.

(ii) Debenture loans 
The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of £1.1 million. This discount and the issue expenses are 
being amortised over the full term of the bonds. Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been 
converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary. 
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by Delta Lloyd to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV 
in 1999. As part of the public offering of Delta Lloyd, their nominal value was increased to €497 million (2008: €490 million). 
However, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is lower at €177 million (2008: €172 million), calculated 
in 1999 and based on the future cash flows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest. The rate of interest paid on 
the notes has been gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009. 
Other loans totalling £13 million (2008: £14 million) comprise borrowings in the United States. 
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2009 was £552 million (2008: £663 million), 
calculated with reference to quoted prices or discounted future cash flows as appropriate. 
(iii) Commercial paper 
The commercial paper consists of £483 million in the Company (2008: £535 million, 2007: £918 million) and £nil in France 
(2008: £5 million, 2007: £4 million). All of this is considered core structural funding. 
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, 
euros and US dollars. Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

(a) As explained in accounting policy D, the UK long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property 
limited partnerships (PLPs). The PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios, and the lenders are 
only entitled to obtain payment of both interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs. 
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders’ funds of any companies in the Aviva Group. Loans 
of £790 million (2008: £978 million, 2007: £485 million) included in the table relate to those PLPs which have been consolidated 
as subsidiaries. 
(b) Certain Irish policyholder investment funds and unit trusts, which have been fully consolidated in accordance with accounting 
policy D, have raised borrowings with external credit institutions. The borrowings are secured on the funds, with the only recourse 
on default being the underlying investments in these funds and unit trusts. The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the 
shareholders’ funds of any companies in the Aviva Group. These loans run for a period of five years, with interest rates fixed 
monthly and based on a fixed margin above the euro inter-bank rate. The amount of these loans can be varied without any 
penalty being charged, subject to a maximum of 50% Loan to Value and a maximum facility of €40 million. 
(c) The UK long-term business entered into a financial reassurance agreement with Swiss Re in 2008, under which up-front 
payments are received from Swiss Re in return for 90% of future surplus arising. The loan will be repaid as profits emerge 
on the business. 
(d) Other loans includes €500 million 10.44% subordinated notes due 2019 of which €400 million of the loan was issued by 
Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering and €100m by Delta Lloyd Schadeverzekering

(v) Securitised mortgage loan notes 
Loan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK and the Netherlands. Details of these 
securitisations are given in note 23. 
For the Dutch securitised mortgage loan notes carried at amortised cost of £2,221 million (2008: £2,353 million, 
2007: £2,283 million), their fair value is £2,170 million (2008: £2,224 million, 2007: £2,283 million), calculated based 
on the future cash flows discounted back at the market rate of interest.

were attributable to changes in market conditions. These loan notes have external credit ratings which have not changed since 
the inception of the loans.

51 – Contingent liabilities and other risk factors 
This note sets out the main areas of uncertainty over the calculation of our liabilities. 
(a) Uncertainty over claims provisions 
Note 38 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims 
provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions. These approaches 
are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of future policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within 
the normal range of outcomes. To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is 
worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect 
of these liabilities. 
(b) Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards 
In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and 
become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising there from, including claims in respect of pollution and other 
environmental hazards. Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including 
Europe, Canada and Australia. Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential 
number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, 
the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of 
provisions made for general insurance claims, and the strengthening of latent claims that took place during 2008, the directors 
consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group. 
(c) Guarantees on long-term savings products 
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate 
guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products. Note 40 gives details of these guarantees 
and options. In providing these guarantees and options, the Group’s capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables 
including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices. Interest rate guaranteed returns, such 
as those available on guaranteed annuity options (GAOs), are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level. Other 
guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations 
in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made. The directors continue to believe that the 
existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient. 
(d) Pensions mis-selling 
The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational 
schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), has largely been completed. 
A provision of some £16 million at 31 December 2009 (2008: £18 million, 2007: £23 million) remains to meet the outstanding 
costs of the very few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme. It continues to be the directors’ view that there will be no material effect either on the Group’s 
ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders. 
(e) Endowment reviews 
In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, 

given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.  

A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least 

as well as they would have done without an endowment. Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Group’s UK  

mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track  

to cover their mortgage. 

In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment 
policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to 
whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity. The Group will send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment 
holders, in accordance with FSA requirements. The Group has made provisions totalling £25 million at 31 December 2009 
(2008: £38 million, 2007: £96 million) to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints. 
It continues to be the directors’ view that there will be no material effect either on the Group’s liability to meet the expectations 
of policyholders or on shareholders. 
In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA 
rules. The Group now includes details of its endowment policyholders’ time bar position within the annual re-projection mailings. 
Customers will be given at least 12 months’ individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable – double the six months’ notice 
required by the FSA.

Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
51 – Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued 
(f) Regulatory compliance 
The Group’s insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates. The FSA 
regulates the Group’s UK business and in addition monitors the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole. The 
FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firm’s authorisation, to investigate 
marketing and sales practices and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources. The Group’s regulators outside the 
UK typically have similar powers but in some cases they operate a system of “prior product approval” and hence place less 
emphasis than the FSA on regulating sales and marketing practices. 
The directors believe each of the Group’s regulated businesses dedicates appropriate resources to its compliance programme, 
endeavours to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and takes corrective action when warranted. However, all 
regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable 
regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required. 
The impact of any such finding (whether in the UK or overseas) could have a negative impact on the Group’s reported results 
or on its relations with current and potential customers. Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse 
publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, 
its results of operations and/or financial condition and divert management’s attention from the day-to-day management of 
the business. 
(g) Aviva USA litigation 
In November 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of the AmerUs Group, a US-based insurer. In common with other 
companies operating in the sector, AmerUs is subject to litigation, including class-action litigation, arising out of its sale of equity-
based index-linked annuity products. The Group is aware of a multi-district class action filed against AmerUs in Pennsylvania but is 
not aware of any adverse development. The directors continue to monitor the situation and consider that the litigation will not 
have a material effect on the Group’s ability to meet shareholder expectations. 
(h) Payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling 
In September 2009, the FSA launched an investigation into sales practices for payment protection insurance. As at 3 March 2010, 
no ruling has been issued by the FSA and, as a result, it is not possible to determine whether, and if so to what extent, any liability 
exists. The directors continue to monitor the situation. 
(i) Structured settlements 
In Canada annuities have been purchased from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to 
claimants. As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to 
fulfil their obligations. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for these arrangements is approximately £984 million as at 
31 December 2009 (2008: £1,029 million, 2007: £742 million) based on estimated replacement cost for the underlying annuities. 
The credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability. The risk is 
reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan. As at 31 December 
2009, no information has come to the Group's attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in the Canadian life insurers 
from which it has purchased annuities. 
(j) Other 
In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become 
involved in actual or threatened related litigation. In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established 
for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect. 
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group 
companies. At 31 December 2009, the total exposure of the Group and Company is £nil (2008: £nil, 2007: £7 million) and 
£77 million (2008: £88 million, 2007: £113 million) respectively and, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise 
in respect of these guarantees and indemnities. 
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have been given guarantees, indemnities and 
warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group. In the 
opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties. 
The Group’s insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate. Given the 
economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders 
if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties. The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any 
need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.  247

1. The “corporate” net liabilities represent the element of the pension scheme deficit held centrally. 
2. In addition to our external funding sources, we have certain internal borrowing arrangements in place which allow some of the assets that support technical liabilities to be invested in a pool 
of central assets for use across the group. These internal debt balances allow for the capital allocated to business operations to exceed the externally sourced capital resources of the group. 
Net internal debt represents the balance of the amounts due from corporate and holding entities, less the tangible net assets held by these entities. Although intra-group in nature, they are 
included as part of the capital base for the purpose of capital management. These arrangements arise in relation to the following: 
— Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy stand alone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities. These loans satisfy arms length criteria and 
all interest payments are made when due. 
— Aviva International Insurance (AII) Ltd acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries. Internal capital management mechanisms in place 
allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance operations. These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets backing technical liabilities to be made available 
for use across the group. Balances in respect of these arrangements are also treated as internal debt for capital management purposes. 
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders’ funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and 
borrowings (including internal borrowings as described in footnote 2 above). 
At 31 December 2009 we had £25.2 billion (2008: £25.1 billion) of total capital employed in our trading operations, measured 
on an MCEV basis. Over the period the benefit of operating profits and investment gains have been offset by foreign exchange 
losses and actuarial losses on staff pension schemes. 
In April 2009 we issued a private placement of £245 million equivalent of Lower Tier 2 hybrid in a dual tranche transaction 
(£200 million on 1 April 2009 and a further €50 million on 30 April 2009). These transactions had a positive impact on group IGD 
solvency and economic capital measures. 
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves, was 31.8% (2008: 
34.0%). If centre assets were offset against this debt the financial leverage would be 19.0% (2008: 25.4%). Fixed charge cover, 
which measures the extent to which external interest costs, including subordinated debt interest and preference dividends, are 
covered by MCEV operating profit was 8.5 times (2008: 9.2 times).

Further analysis of the movement in the liabilities of the long-term business can be found in notes 38 and 39. 
The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Group's life business 
for the year. This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the 
Group's life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital. 
As detailed in note 44(b), on 1 October 2009 the with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance Limited (CGNU) and Commercial 
Union Life Assurance Company Limited (CULAC) were reorganised. This reorganisation was achieved through a reattribution 
to shareholders of the inherited estates of these funds. As part of the reorganisation the two funds were merged and transferred 
to Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (UKLAP). 
Within UKLAP two new with-profit sub-funds have been created. Policies of non-electing policyholders have been transferred 
to Old With-Profit Sub-Fund (OWPSF). The inherited estate has not been reattributed and remains in OWPSF. 
Where policyholders elected to accept the reattribution their policies have been transferred to New With-Profit Sub-Fund 
(NWPSF). The inherited estate, totalling £1,105 million at 1 October 2009, has been reattributed to a separate long-term fund 
called the Non-Profit Sub-Fund 1(NPSF1), in which 100% of the surplus is attributable to shareholders. 
The negative shareholders’ funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation 
and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure 
on an IFRS basis. 
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of £1,177 million, known as the Reattribution Inherited Estate External 
Support Accounts (RIEESA), at 31 December 2009, held within NPSF1 (a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK 
life operations), in the form of a capital support arrangement. This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure 
that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis therefore it 
forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources. 
For UKLAP/RIEESA, equity market performance has had little impact, as the funds mitigate materially all of the equity risk of 
the estate/RIEESA through internal hedging. 
Commercial property returns have been negative, and this has had adverse impact, less so in UKLAP WP as the risk had been 
partially hedged. However, credit risk is largely unhedged, and the reduction in spreads on corporate bonds through 2009 
contributed to increases in the estate/RIEESA. Stabilisation in financial markets saw implied volatility reduce significantly through 
2009, from near 35% at start of year to 25% at year end. This has significantly reduced the market consistent cost of guarantees 
and hence increased estate/RIEESA. 
For the Overseas life operations, the positive variance between actual and expected experience is driven mainly by market 
movements which has led to capital appreciation of fixed interest assets and consequential increase of the unallocated divisible 
surplus in France and other European businesses. 
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of £17.1 billion (2008 restated: £13.7 billion), representing 
the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses. 
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives. 
After effecting the year end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds' have available capital of £2.9 billion (2008: 
£2.7 billion) (including amounts held in RIEESA). Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new 
non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business. The capital is 
comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support. 
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to £14.2 billion (2008 restated: 
£11.0 billion) is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is 
available to shareholders. In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide 
appropriate cover for risk.

Aviva plc 	 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
55 – Capital statement continued 
As the total available capital of £17.1 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and 
liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher. This is a limitation of the 
Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare 
it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist 
in our Group. 
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units. Included in these 
arrangements is a subordinated loan of £200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to the Aviva Annuity Limited to provide 
capital to support the writing of new business. 
The available capital of the Group’s with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the “Realistic balance sheet” regime 
prescribed by the FSA’s regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive 
obligation for future bonuses not yet declared. The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective 
estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus. The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any 
constructive obligation to policyholders. It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is 
available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may 
arise. 
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders’ 
portion of future bonuses. However, the shareholders’ portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet 
regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement. 
In accordance with the FSA’s regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital 
in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin (RCM). The determination 
of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions 
management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

of future bonuses are £42.1 billion (2008: £43.2 billion, 2007: £48.8 billion). 
1. These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis. The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is £0.3 billion, 
£2.2 billion and £3.1 billion for OWPSF, NWPSF and UKLAP respectively (2008: £1.4 billion, £1.5 billion and £4.1 billion, 2007: £0.7 billion, £0.8 billion and £0.3 billion respectively). 
2. Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2008 was £0.7 billion, £0.7 billion and £1.2 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively (2007: £1.4 billion, £1.2 billion, 
£1.9 billion respectively). 
3. The risk capital margin (RCM) is 3.6 times covered by the inherited estate and capital support arrangement (2008: 1.8 times, 2007: 3.5 times). 
4. The UKLAP fund includes the Provident Mutual (PM) fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of £1.7 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate. 
5. This represents the reattributed estate of £1.1 billion at 31 December 2009 held within the non-profit fund with UKLAP included within other UK life operations. 
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profit business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of the regulatory 
requirement based on EU Directives (‘regulatory peak’) and the FSA realistic bases (‘realistic peak’) described above. 
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in 
accordance with FSA regulations. The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction 
of capital resources requirement. 
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined 
in accordance with the FSA requirements. 
For overseas businesses in the EEA, US, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum 
requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes. The businesses outside these territories are subject 
to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement. 
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement 
determined in accordance with the local regulator’s requirements for the specific class of business. 
All businesses hold sufficient available capital to meet their capital resource requirement.

— (i) UK with-profit funds – (NWPSF,OWPSF and existing UKLAP WP funds) – any available surplus held in each fund can be 
used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and 
OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above (for OWPSF only to the extent support has been 
provided in the past). In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the 
shareholders receive the balance. The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund. 
— (ii) UK non-participating funds – any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders. Capital in the non-profit 
funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of 
the fund. Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group. 
— (iii) Overseas life operations – the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are 
calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime. The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to 
local regulatory restrictions which may constrain management’s ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group. Any transfer 
of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group. 
— (iv) General insurance operations – the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas 
businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime. The available capital resources in all these businesses 
are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain management’s ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group. 
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group. 
56 – Risk management 
This note sets out the major risks our businesses face and describes our approach to managing these. It also gives sensitivity 
analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in our earnings and capital 
requirements. 
(a) Risk management framework 
Aviva has established a risk management framework to protect the Group from events that hinder the sustainable achievement 
of its performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities. 
The risks faced by the Group can be categorised as follows: 
— Financial risks cover market and credit risk, insurance risk, liquidity and capital management. 
— Strategic risks include issues such as customer, brand, products and markets as well as any risks to our business model arising 
from changes in our market and risks arising from mergers and acquisitions. 
— Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from people and systems or from external events. 
— Operational risks include business protection, information technology, people, legal and regulatory compliance. 
The risk management framework provides the means to identify, assess, mitigate, manage, monitor and report all of the different 
types of risk faced by the Group to provide a single picture of the threats and uncertainties faced and opportunities that exist. 
Responsibility for risk management resides at all levels within the Group with appropriate risk related objectives embedded 
within performance measurement plans. As part of our risk management framework we employ a three lines of defence model 
that encourages close working relationships between line management and the risk function whilst facilitating independent 
assurance by internal audit. Primary responsibility for risk identification and management lies with business management (the first 
line of defence). Support for and challenge on the completeness and accuracy of risk assessment, risk reporting and adequacy of 
mitigation plans are performed by specialist risk functions (the second line of defence). Independent and objective assurance on the 
robustness of the risk management framework and the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control is provided by group 
audit (the third line of defence). 
The Group sets limits to manage material risks to ensure the risks stay within risk appetite (the amount of risk the Group is 
willing to accept). The Group assesses the size and scale of a risk by considering how likely it is that the risk will occur and the 
potential impact the risk could have on our business and our stakeholders. Where risks are outside appetite actions are agreed 
to mitigate the exposure. 
The Group’s risk management framework is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk to business objectives and 
mitigates the risk of material financial misstatement or loss. New and emerging risks, or risks we currently deem as immaterial may 
also pose a risk to business objectives. 
The Group recognises the critical importance of maintaining an efficient and effective risk management framework. To this 
end, the Group has an established governance framework, which has the following key elements: 
— Defined terms of reference for the Board, its committees, and the associated executive management committees. 
— A clear organisational structure with documented delegated authorities and responsibilities from the Board to Board 
committees, executive management committees and senior management. 
— A risk management function operating across Group centre, regions and business units, with clear responsibilities and 
objectives; 
— A Group policy framework that defines risk appetite and sets out risk management and control standards for the Group’s 
worldwide operations. The policies also set out the roles and responsibilities of businesses, regions, policy owners and the risk 
oversight committees; and 
— Risk oversight committees that review and monitor aggregate risk data, assess whether the risk profile is within appetite and 
take overall risk management decisions. The committees monitor adherence to the risk management policies and oversee 
mitigating actions being taken where risks are outside of appetite.

56 – Risk management continued 
The Group has developed economic capital models that support the measurement, comparison and monitoring of our risks. The 
results of the modelling are incorporated into key decision making processes. These models show the relative impact to economic 
capital from the risks we face. In turn this supports the assessment of appropriate and effective mitigating strategies where risks 
are outside of appetite. 
The financial impact from changes in market risk (such as interest rates, equity prices and property values) is examined through 
stress tests adopted in the Individual Capital Assessments (ICA) and scenario analysis which consider the impact on capital from 
variations in financial circumstances on either a remote scenario, or to changes from the central operating scenario. Both 
assessments consider the management actions that may be taken in mitigation of the change in circumstances. 
Stress and scenario testing help give an indication of the size of losses that could be experienced in extreme but plausible 
events and complements other risk measurement techniques. It helps identify concentration risk across businesses and portfolios 
and is a useful tool for management to use in their capital planning process. A number of stress tests and economic scenarios have 
been developed to capture the adverse impact on the businesses of extreme events. The stress tests are designed to cover major 
asset classes and insurance risks. The stress tests are produced at least monthly and are reviewed and discussed by senior 
management. 
The sensitivity of Group earnings to changes in economic markets is regularly monitored through sensitivities to investment 
rate and investment return and asset values in IFRS and MCEV reporting. 
The Financial Services Authority (FSA) requires Aviva to assess its economic capital requirements to ensure that it adequately 
reflects business and control risks. In turn this analysis supports our strategic planning and decision-making processes. 
(b) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from 
fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, property prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk arises in business units 
due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held. At Group level, it also arises in relation to the 
overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders. 
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in 
respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group monitors adherence to this market risk 
policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Group Assets Committee and 
ultimately the Group Asset Liability Committee. For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, 
the Group has put in place additional processes and procedures to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and 
the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite. 
The management of market risk is undertaken in businesses, regions and at Group level. Businesses manage market risks 
locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints. Businesses may also be constrained by the 
requirement to meet policyholders’ reasonable expectations and to minimise or avoid market risk in a number of areas. The Group 
Assets Committee is responsible for managing market risk at Group level, and a number of investment-related risks, in particular 
those faced by shareholder funds throughout the Group. 
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, 
the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required. The Group has 
criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of 
assets and the liabilities due to market movements. The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions 
under which assets and liabilities are to be matched. 
In addition, where the Group’s long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the 
majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing 
literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders’ risk and reward objectives. 
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations. In unit-linked business, the policyholder bears the 
investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds, as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets 
in the fund. The shareholders’ exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset 
management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund. 
Equity price risk 
The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio. The Group’s 
shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: 
— Direct equity shareholdings in shareholder funds and the Group defined benefit pension funds. 
— The indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders’ funds from which management charges 
or a share of performance are taken; and 
— Its interest in the free estate of long-term with profits funds.

Other information 
56 – Risk management continued 
At a business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements 
where this lies outside the risk appetite of either the company in respect of shareholder assets or the fund in respect of 
policyholder assets concerned. In addition local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified 
portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities. The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted 
equity securities. 
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options. Businesses actively model 
the performance of equities through the use of stochastic models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance 
on guarantees, options and bonus rates. 
The Group Assets Committee actively monitors equity assets owned directly by the Group, which may include some material 
shareholdings in the Group’s strategic business partners. 
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section (i) below. 
Property price risk 
The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide. Investment 
in property is managed at regional and business level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity 
requirements and the expectations of policyholders as well as overall risk appetite. The Group Assets Committee also monitors 
property assets owned directly by the Group. 
As at 31 December 2009, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes 
in property prices. 
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section (i) below. 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Group’s investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities, which are exposed 
to fluctuations in interest rates. 
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between 
the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements. 
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the Group’s interest rate risk. The major features include 
guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values. Details of material 
guarantees and options are given in note 40. 
In short-term business such as general insurance business, the Group requires a close matching of assets and liabilities to 
minimise this risk. 
Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Group Assets Committee, and the Group Asset Liability Committee. 
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include Value-at-Risk analysis, position limits, scenario 
testing, stress testing and asset and liability matching using measures such as duration. The impact of exposure to sustained low 
interest rates is regularly monitored. 
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors, 
in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing 
technical liabilities. 
As at 31 December 2009, the Group had entered into a number of initiatives, including interest rate swap agreements and 
changes in asset mix, to mitigate the effects of potential adverse interest rate movements, and to enable closer matching of assets 
and liabilities. 
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section (i) below. 
Further information on borrowings is included in note 48. 
Currency risk 
The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their 
functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities. For this reason, 
no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings. 
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in 
exchange rates of various currencies. Approximately half of the Group’s premium income arises in currencies other than sterling 
and the Group’s net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling, and US dollars. The 
Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Group’s 
business and meet local regulatory and market requirements. 
The Group’s foreign exchange policy requires that each of our subsidiaries maintains sufficient assets in its local currency to 
meet local currency liabilities. Therefore, capital held by the Group’s business units should be able to support local business 
activities regardless of foreign currency movements. However, such movements may impact the value of the Group’s consolidated 
shareholders’ equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, 
against pre-determined limits. The Group’s foreign exchange policy is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of 
regulatory capital by currency with the Group’s regulatory capital requirements by currency. Limits are set to control the extent 
to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Group’s regulatory capital requirement for each major currency. 
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.

The changes arise from retranslation of business unit statements of financial position from their functional currencies into sterling, 
with above movements being taken through the currency translation reserve. These movements in exchange rates therefore have 
no impact on profit. Net assets are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities. 
Derivatives risk 
Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of Directors, as set out in the 
Group policy on derivatives use. Activity is overseen by the Derivatives Approvals Committee, which monitors implementation of 
the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by businesses. Derivatives are primarily used for 
efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retail savings products. Derivative transactions are 
covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities. Speculative activity is prohibited, unless prior approval has been 
obtained from the Derivatives Approvals Committee. Over the counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved 
counterparties and using ISDA documentation and credit support annexes (or equivalent) in accordance with the Group derivatives 
policy. Adherence to the collateral requirements as set out in the Group derivatives and Group credit policies thereby reduces the 
risk of credit loss. 
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that 
is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken. 
Correlation risk 
The Group recognises that identified lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and 
interdependent with market movements and interest rates. These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the ICA 
in the aggregation of the financial stress tests with the operational risk assessment and in scenario analysis. 
(c) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to pay on their obligations to Aviva. Our 
credit risks arise through exposures to debt investments, structured asset investments, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending 
and reinsurance placement counterparties. We hold these investments for the benefit of both our policyholders and shareholders. 
The Group manages its credit risk at business unit, regional and Group levels. All business units and regions are required to 
implement local credit risk processes (including limits frameworks), operate specific risk management committees, and ensure 
detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria. At Group level, we manage and monitor 
all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate group limit frameworks that must be adhered to by all. 
The Group risk management framework also includes the market related aspect of credit risk. This is the risk of a fall in the 
value of fixed interest securities from changes in the perceived worthiness of the issuer and is manifested through changes in the 
fixed interest securities’ credit spreads. 
Management of credit risk is effected by five core functions: 
— The maintenance and adherence of an effective governance structure. This includes clear guidance, scope and frameworks for 
all aspects of the credit risk function to ensure accountability and clarity. This also includes delegated authority to the Group 
Credit Approvals Committee, a quorum of key senior risk officers, that is authorised to make key decisions within certain risk 
appetite levels. 
— The accurately and timely reporting of detailed exposure information, and their aggregation by counterparty, exposure types, 
sectors, geography and ratings. 
— The implementation of a sophisticated capital charge based credit limits framework that considers and quantifies the key specific 
attributes of each exposure (eg seniority, maturity etc) and provides a counterparty level aggregation methodology 
on a risk neutral basis. This is then managed against centrally set limits. Absolute upper bound limits are also set to ensure 
unexpected jump to default risks are kept within appetite. Additional limit frameworks are applied for structured assets and 
reinsurance counterparty exposures. The limits framework also considers more systemic risk factors such as sector and 
geographic concentrations, and these are continually assessed throughout our global portfolio to ensure optimal diversification 
levels are maintained and improved.

— Additional committee and credit risk function oversight is provided on all credit risk related matters. This includes regular 
consideration and review of our key counterparties, monitoring and addressing key credit themes and news that emerge 
in the markets. The Group Credit Approvals Committee provides an effective forum to ensure that all key recommendations 
are considered, and decisions implemented throughout the Group. The regional and Group credit divisions ensure that all 
qualitative aspects of risk management are considered and evaluated to provide further oversight and balance to the 
quantitative aspects. 
— The employment of risk mitigation techniques where and when deemed appropriate. These are utilised where possible to 
remove residual unwanted risks, as well as bring limits within appetite, and include methods such as collateralisation, purchase 
of credit protection and diversification strategies. 
A detailed breakdown of Aviva’s current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below. 
Financial exposures by credit ratings 
Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued. AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade 
financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings. Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as 
speculative grade. The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with 
external credit ratings, of the Group. Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.

Other investments 
Other investments include: 
— £29, 944 million of unit trusts and other investment vehicles. The underlying credit ratings of these assets are not reflected in 
this analysis. 
— Derivative financial instruments of £2,078 million, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements. 
— Other assets of £2,804 million, which are primarily deposits with credit institutions and investments in hedge funds. 
The Group loan portfolio principally comprises: 
— Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy; 
— Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions. These loans 
are fully collateralised by other securities; and 
— Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets. 
Unit trusts and other investment vehicles 
The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within these vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment 
mandates for these funds. We rely on our understanding that the trusts and their asset managers are only approved if they satisfy 
certain selection criteria (including due diligence in the form of a questionnaire and/or research by dedicated teams). In addition, 
the asset managers are mandated to make investments in line with the funds’ risk profiles as marketed to prospective customers 
and policyholders. Accordingly, as part of reviewing the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles, we monitor 
the assets within the funds and their performance to ensure they remain in line with the respective investment mandates for 
these funds. 
For certain of the unit trusts in our other investments, we apply minimum requirements affecting both the underlying 
counterparties and the investments issued by those counterparties such as a minimum size for the counterparty’s programme, 
a limit on the size of the overall exposure to the underlying counterparty and, where appropriate, explicit approval of the 
counterparty by internal credit risk management teams is required. These criteria are indicators of the asset quality for these 
investments, as they represent minimum criteria for liquidity and diversification. 
A proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally 
applicable. Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall market risk appetite. 
Derivatives 
Derivative transactions must comply with Group guidance on the quality of counterparties used and the extent of collateralisation 
required. The counterparty must have a minimum credit rating from rating agencies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch) and the collateral 
process must meet certain minimum standards as set out by Group guidelines. 
The largest shareholder notional positions are exchange traded, rather than over the counter (OTC), with the added protection 
that provides (ie the credit risk is mitigated significantly through regular margining and protection offered by the exchange, and 
is controlled by the Group’s local asset management operations). 
Other assets 
The vast majority (over 90%) of the investments in deposits and credit institutions is with an individual financial services 
counterparty which benefits from both implicit and explicit backing of AAA rated governments as a function of its 
ownership structure.

Loans 
The majority of the Group loans portfolio is unrated. However, we use the following metrics to internally monitor our exposure: 
— Property collateralisation 
— Interest service cost 
— Diversity of the tenant base 
— Lower risk nature of loans made to the UK healthcare sector; and 
— Existence of government guarantees for some residential mortgages. 
Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies. As such, we believe 
such collateralisation minimises our risk. 
Credit concentration risk 
The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations 
of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes 
supplemented by the Group credit policy and limits framework. In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk 
(eg in respect of defaults on mortgages matching annuity liabilities) this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate 
used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement, and this credit risk is actively managed. The impact of 
aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above. With the exception of Government bonds the largest aggregated 
counterparty exposure is approximately 0.8% of the Group’s total shareholder assets. 
Reinsurance credit exposures 
The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the 
restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings. The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance 
counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer. Reinsurance 
exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite. The Credit Approvals Committee 
has a monitoring role over this risk. 
The Group’s largest reinsurance counterparty is Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (including subsidiaries). At 31 December 
2009, the reinsurance asset recoverable from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was £1,433 million. This exposure is monitored 
on a regular basis. In the event of a catastrophic event, the counterparty exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 
4.6% of shareholders’ equity. 
Securities finance 
The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK. The risks within this business are mitigated by over 
collateralisation which is designed to result in minimal residual risk. The Group operates strict standards around collateral 
management and controls. 
Derivative credit exposures 
The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades. This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost 
all trades (the exception being certain FX trades where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise). The Group 
operates strict standards around collateral management and controls including the requirement that all “Over the Counter” 
derivatives are supported by credit support annexes and ISDAs. 
Unit-linked business 
As discussed previously, in unit-linked business the policyholder bears the market risk, including credit risk, on investment assets 
in the unit funds, and the shareholders’ exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent that their income arises from asset 
management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.

Credit terms are set locally within overall credit limits prescribed by the Group Credit Committee and within the framework of the 
Group Credit Policy. The credit quality of financial assets is managed at the local business unit level. Where assets have been 
classed as “past due and impaired”, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek collateral 
from the counterparty. 
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.

(d) Liquidity risk 
At Group level, we maintain a prudent level of liquidity which meets the expectations of the financial services authority (FSA) and 
the wider investment community. We maintain a buffer of liquid assets, determined by liquidity stress tests, which is designed to 
cover unforeseen circumstances in any of our businesses. 
The Group and Company have a strong liquidity position (£2.2 billion of financial assets held at Group) and through the 
application of a Group Liquidity policy seek to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In 
addition to this strong liquidity position, the Group and Company maintain significant committed borrowing facilities (£2.1 billion) 
from a range of highly rated banks to further mitigate this risk. 
Asset liability matching 
Generally, our individual business units generate sufficient capital from the receipt of premiums, fees and investment income, 
along with planned asset sales and maturities, to pay claims and expenses. However, there may be instances where additional cash 
requirements arise in excess of that available within the operating businesses. In such instances, we have several options to fund 
these cash requirements including the selling of assets from the investment portfolios, using centre funds, issuing commercial 
paper and the committed borrowing facilities. 
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, 
the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required. The Group has 
criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of 
assets and the liabilities due to market movements. The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions 
under which assets and liabilities are to be matched. The Asset Liability matching (ALM) methodology develops optimal asset 
portfolio maturity structures for our businesses which seek to ensure that the cash flows are sufficient to meet the liabilities as 
they are expected to arise. 
Where any decision to adopt a position in respect of policyholder assets and liabilities is not closely matched but is within the 
business unit’s investment risk appetite, the impact is monitored through our economic capital measurement process. The decision 
taken must be justified to the local management board and Group management by a full analysis of the impact of the level of 
mismatch on both risk and return. 
ALM strategy may be determined at a sub-fund level for a block of closely related liabilities. Alternatively, if ALM strategy 
is determined at a fund or company level, it will usually be appropriate (for pricing, financial reporting and risk management 
purposes) to develop a hypothecation of assets to notional sub-funds with different liability characteristics. It is for this reason that 
Group Risk provides a framework of corporate objectives within which the operating businesses develop specific and appropriate 
ALM methodologies, to seek to ensure that our businesses have sufficient liquidity to settle claims as they are expected to arise. 
ALM modelling is based on a projection of both assets and liabilities into the future. Stochastic models are used to set ALM 
policy where fund particulars contain a range of outcomes. 
A further tenet of our risk management strategy involves investment strategies, which also take into account the accounting, 
regulatory, capital and tax issues. The ALM strategy also takes into account the reasonable expectations of policyholders, local best 
practice and meets relevant regulatory requirements. 
Our investment strategies are designed to seek to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists in extreme business scenarios. For 
example, our investment strategy must consider a scenario of high lapses accompanied by poor investment markets or a general 
insurance catastrophe event. 
Maturity analyses 
The following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance 
assets to meet them. A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivatives is given in notes 48 
and 57 respectively. Contractual obligations under operating leases and capital commitments are given in note 52. 
(i) Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities 
For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2009 analysed by remaining 
duration. The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, 
as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. 
Almost all investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand. For such contracts, the earliest contractual 
maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the 
current statement of financial position liability. We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and 
the tables reflect the expected cash flows for non-linked investment contracts. However, contractually, the total liability for non-
linked investment contracts of £59,504 million (2008: £60,264 million, 2007: £45,492 million) would be shown in the “within 
1 year” column below. Unit-linked contracts are repayable or transferable on demand and are therefore shown in the “within 
1 year” column.

The assets above are analysed in accordance with the earliest possible redemption date of the instrument at the initiation of the 
Group. Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment 
vehicle, it is included in the “On demand or within 1 year” column. Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are 
generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument. 
The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic 
for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis. The first repricing and 
call date is normally 10 years or more after the date of issuance. Most of the Group’s investments in equity securities and fixed 
maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice. 
As explained in note 2(a)(ii), comparative information for the disclosures required by the IFRS 7 amendments is not needed 
in the first year of application and so no table for 2008 is presented above. 
(e) Insurance risk 
(i) Life insurance risk 
Types of risk 
Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than 
anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses. 
Risk management framework 
The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and guidelines on the practical application of this policy. Individual life 
insurance risks are managed at a business unit level but are also monitored at Group level. 
The impact of life insurance risks is monitored by the business units as part of the control cycle of business management. 
Exposure is monitored through the assessment of liabilities, the asset liability management framework, profit reporting (under both 
IFRS and MCEV), and the ICA process. Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework 
and overseen by the Life Insurance Committee. At Group level the overall exposure to life insurance risk is measured through the 
ICA and other management reporting. 
The Life Insurance Committee monitors the application of the risk policy in each business, and receives management 
information on life insurance risks. The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor 
mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, product development and pricing, unit pricing and expenses. 
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses. It confirms that guidance and procedures 
are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that the businesses mitigate against any life insurance risk 
outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite. 
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk 
to ensure best practice is shared throughout the Group and common standards are adopted.

Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
56 – Risk management continued 
Management of life insurance risks 
The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: 
— Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance. The Group allows business units to select reinsurers, from 
those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures 
and monitor the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk. 
— Longevity risk is carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends. Whilst individual businesses 
are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital 
implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a 
consequence. The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity where possible and desirable and 
continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further. 
— Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against 
local market information. Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed. 
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design. Businesses also implement specific 
initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse. The Group Life Insurance Committee has developed 
guidelines on persistency management. 
— Product Design and Pricing risk arises from poorly designed or inadequately priced products and can lead to both financial loss 
and reputation damage from the Group. Guidelines have been developed to support the businesses through the complete cycle 
of the product development process, financial analysis and pricing. 
— Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent 
monitoring of expense levels. 
Apart from the ICA, sensitivity testing is widely used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to 
life insurance risks, typically through MCEV reporting (examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report). This assessment is 
taken at both business unit level and at Group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured. This enables 
the Group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite. 
Concentration risk 
The Group writes a diverse mix of business in worldwide markets that are all subject to similar risks (mortality, persistency etc). The 
Group assesses the relative costs and concentrations of each type of risk through the ICA capital requirements and material issues 
are escalated to and addressed at the Life Insurance Committee. This analysis enables the Group to assess whether accumulations 
of risk exceeds risk appetite. 
One key concentration of life insurance risk for the Group is improving longevity risk from pensions in payment and deferred 
annuities in the UK and the Netherlands where the Group has material portfolios. The Group continually monitors this risk and the 
opportunities for mitigating actions through reinsurance, improved asset liability matching, or innovative solutions that emerge in 
the market. 
When looking at concentrations of risk, for example market risk, the risk within Aviva staff pension schemes is also considered. 
ICA analysis and MCEV sensitivity testing help identify both concentrations of risk types and the benefits of diversification of risk. 
Embedded derivatives 
The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering 
varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different 
products on pre-agreed terms. The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units. 
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: 
— Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for 
withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options. 
— Guarantees: embedded floor (guaranteed return), maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate 
of annuity payment. 
— Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus. 
The impact of these is reflected in ICA and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.

(ii) General insurance risk 
Types of risk 
General insurance risk in the Group arises from: 
— Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations 
— Unexpected claims arising from a single source 
— Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten 
— Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques 
— Inadequate reserves 
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and 
commercial property insurances. The Group’s underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and 
communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines. Like life insurance risk, general insurance risk is managed primarily 
at business unit level with oversight at a Group level, through the General Insurance Committee. 
The vast majority of the Group’s general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile 
of the customer. 
Management of general insurance risks 
Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group risk management framework. Additionally, the ICA is used to assess 
the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and 
calculating appropriate capital requirements. Increasingly risk-based capital models are being used to support the quantification of 
risk under the ICA framework. All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output 
from which is a key input into the ICA and risk-based capital assessments. 
The General Insurance Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business 
units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure. It is responsible for the development, implementation, and review of the Group 
policies for underwriting, claims, reinsurance and reserving that operate within the Group risk management framework. 
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within 
the limits of the appetite of the Group. The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Aviva UK Digital Flood Map to 
effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils. Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business 
units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard. 
General insurance claims reserving 
Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General 
Insurance Reserving policy. The General Insurance Committee monitors and maintains the General Insurance Reserving policy, 
and conducts quarterly reviews of the Group’s general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy. The reviews include peer 
reviews of the business unit’s own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews. 
The adequacy of the Group’s general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the General Insurance Committee. 
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries (often as part of the local 
regulatory requirement). 
Reinsurance strategy 
Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection 
being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group. Reinsurance purchases must be in line with 
the strategy set out in our Group General Insurance Reinsurance policy. The basis of these purchases is underpinned by extensive 
financial and capital modelling and actuarial analysis to optimise the cost and capital efficiency benefits from our reinsurance 
program. For the larger business units, this involves utilising externally sourced probabilistic models to verify the accumulations 
and loss probabilities based on the Group’s specific portfolios of business. Where external models are not available, scenarios 
are developed and tested using the Group’s data to determine potential losses and appropriate levels of reinsurance protection. 
The reinsurance is placed with providers who meet the Group’s counterparty security requirements, and large reinsurance 
placements may also require approval from the Group Asset Liability Committee. 
Concentration risk 
Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a Group level. The Group cedes much of its 
worldwide catastrophe risk to third party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit. 
The total Group potential loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure (Northern European windstorm) is approximately 
£335 million, for a one in ten year annual loss scenario, compared to approximately £620 million when measured on a one in a 
hundred year annual loss scenario. 
For the 2010 underwriting year the Group will participate in a share of a reinsurer’s US property catastrophe reinsurance 
portfolio. This exposure is not correlated with the Group’s other General Insurance exposure and therefore provides diversification 
benefit. The total expected loss from a one in ten year annual loss scenario is approximately £50 million compared to 
approximately £145 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.

(f) Operational risk 
Types of operational risk 
Operational risk is the risk of loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from people and systems, 
or from external events. Operational risks include business protection, information technology, people, legal and regulatory 
compliance risks. 
Operational risk management 
We process a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse products, and are highly dependent on the 
proper functioning of information technology and communications systems. We are partially reliant on the operational processing 
performance of our outsourced partners including certain servicing and IT functions. The long-term nature of our business means 
that accurate records have to be maintained for significant periods. Significant resources are devoted to maintaining efficient and 
effective operations within our framework of corporate responsibility, policies and business ethics code. 
Our businesses are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks in line with minimum standards of 
control set out in our policies. Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event 
occurring. Impact assessments are considered against financial, operational and reputation criteria. 
Business management teams must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, 
monitored and reported to an appropriate level. Any risks with a high potential impact level are monitored centrally on a regular 
basis. Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment. They also identify and 
capture loss events; taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning from these 
occurrences. 
The Group Operational Risk Committee (ORC) oversees the Group’s aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the 
Group Executive Committee and reports to the Board Risk & Regulatory Committee. It makes recommendations on the risk 
appetite that the Group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying 
any concentrations of operational risk across the Group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented. 
The ORC operates a number of sub-committees which focus on specific areas of strategic and operational risk including customer, 
brand, business protection, IT, people, legal and regulatory compliance. 
(g) Strategic risk 
We are exposed to a number of strategic risks. Our strategy needs to support our vision, purpose and objectives and be responsive 
to both the external and internal environment, for example changes in the competitive landscape, customer behaviour, regulatory 
changes, merger and acquisition opportunities and emerging trends (such as climate change, pandemic and improving longevity). 
Strategic risk is explicitly considered throughout our strategic review and planning process. Developments are assessed during our 
quarterly performance management process where all aspects of our risk profile are considered. 
We closely monitor regulatory, legal and fiscal developments as well as actively engaging with external bodies to share the 
benefit of our expertise in supporting responses to emerging risks to challenge developments that could be damaging to our 
business and the industry as a whole. 
(h) Brand and reputation risk 
We are dependent on the strength of our brands, the brands of our partners and our reputation with customers and agents 
in the sale of our products and services. 
Our success and results are, to a certain extent, dependent on the strength of our brands and reputation. As part of our 
ongoing “One Aviva, Twice the Value” strategy, we have been working to create a global Aviva brand, as well as rebrand 
businesses in the UK under the Aviva name. While we as a group are well recognised, we are vulnerable to adverse market and 
customer perception. We operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount. We are exposed 
to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, press speculation 
and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, amongst others, whether or not founded, 
could impact our brands or reputation. Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services 
recommended by us (or any of our intermediaries) do not perform as expected (whether or not the expectations are founded) 
or the customer’s expectations for the product change. 
One of the FSA’s strategic objectives is to help customers get a fair deal through its “treating customers fairly” principle. 
Examples of “treating customers fairly” include: products and services targeted to meet customers’ needs and which perform in 
line with what customers have been led to expect; clear information (and advice where relevant); good service; and making sure 
there are no unfair barriers that prevent customers from getting access to their money, changing products or making a successful 
insurance claim. The FSA regularly checks that we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of 
various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints. Failure to meet these 
requirements could also impact our brands or reputation. 
If we do not manage successfully the perception of our brands and reputation, it could cause existing customers or agents 
to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to be reluctant or elect not to do business with us. This would 
adversely impact our business and results of operations.

(i) Risk and capital management 
Sensitivity test analysis 
The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility 
of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently. Primarily, MCEV, ICA, and scenario analysis are used. 
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Group’s financial performance 
measurements to inform the Group’s decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and 
quantifying the risks that each of its business units, and the Group as a whole are exposed to. 
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of MCEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non­ economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process. More information 
on MCEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an MCEV basis in the supplementary section of this report. 
Life insurance and investment contracts 
The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements. 
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates, and persistency in connection with the in-force policies 
for each business unit. Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business. A number of the 
key assumptions for the Group’s central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting 
under MCEV methodology. 
General insurance and health business 
General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. 
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years. 
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims. 
Sensitivity test results 
Illustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management 
and non-insurance business are set out below. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor 
is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged. 
Sensitivity factor	 Description of sensitivity factor applied 
Interest rate and investment return	 The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase 
or decrease. The test allows consistently for similar changes to 
investment returns and movements in the market value of backing 
fixed interest securities. 
Equity/property market values The impact of a change in equity/property market values by ± 10%. 
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%. 
Assurance mortality/morbidity (life insurance only) The impact of an increase in mortality/morbidity rates for assurance

1. The comparative 2008 economic sensitivities for insurance non-participating business have been restated to reflect modelling enhancements in Delta Lloyd. 
The different impacts of the economic sensitivities on profit and shareholders' equity arise from classification of certain assets 
as available for sale in some business units, for which movements in unrealised gains or losses would be taken directly to 
shareholders’ equity. 
The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK, US and the Netherlands. In general a fall in 
market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders’ funds, due to the increase in market 
value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities; similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative 
impact. In the US most debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest 
rate movements. The sensitivity to movements in equity and property market values relates mainly to holdings in the Netherlands, 
although the impact on IFRS profit is moderated by the classification of equities as available for sale. 
Changes in sensitivities between 2008 and 2009 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to 
asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities, asset liability management actions, and reattribution of inherited estate 
in the UK. 
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK.

Impact of the reattribution of the inherited estate on IFRS long-term business sensitivities 
Prior to the reattribution of the inherited estates of CGNU Life Assurance Limited (CGNU) and Commercial Union Life Assurance 
Company Limited (CULAC) (as detailed in note 44(b)), movements in the value of assets and liabilities in the with-profit funds 
of CGNU and CULAC would result in corresponding movements in the value of the unallocated divisible surplus. IFRS profit in 
these funds would only arise on the shareholders’ share of bonuses paid on claims during the year or added to policies at the 
end of the year. 
As a result of the reattribution, movements in the value of assets and liabilities in the New With-Profit Shareholders Funds 
(NWPSF) and in the reattributed assets will lead to increased volatility of IFRS profit as the result will be borne by shareholders. 
The main drivers of this increased volatility will be investment returns, the effect of writing new with-profit business in the fund, 
changes in the cost of guarantees and changes in assumptions. This increase in potential volatility is the primary driver of the 
change in IFRS long-term business sensitivities between 2008 and 2009. 
The impact on the Group’s results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the MCEV sensitivities included 
in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

Limitations of sensitivity analysis 
The above tables demonstrate the effect of a change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged. In reality, 
there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and 
larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results. 
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Group’s assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, 
the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group’s 
financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations. 
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing 
investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action. 
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities. Consequently, a 
change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the 
statement of financial position will be affected. In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets 
may lead to volatility in shareholder equity. Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit 
and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest (discount) rates or future inflation. 
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential 
risk that only represent the Group’s view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty; and 
the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion. 
57 – Derivative financial instruments 
This note gives details of the various derivative instruments we use to mitigate risk. 
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, 
in line with our overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or 
interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases. 
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments. The 
notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall 
scale of the derivative transaction. They do not reflect current market values of the open positions. The fair values represent the 
gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held (or issued) by the Group. 
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and 
documented under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc) master agreements or their equivalent. Such 
agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure. In addition, 
the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. 
(a) Hedged derivatives 
The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its hedged derivatives in accordance with IAS 39, Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. To aid discussion and analysis, these derivatives are analysed into cash flow, fair value 
and net investment hedges, as detailed below. 
(i) Cash flow hedges 
The Group uses forward starting interest rate swap agreements in the United States to hedge the variability in future cash flows 
associated with the forecasted purchase of fixed-income assets. These agreements reduce the impact of future interest rate 
changes on the forecasted transaction. Fair value adjustments for these interest rate swaps are deferred and recorded in equity 
until the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, at which time the interest rate swaps will be terminated. The accumulated gain 
or loss in equity will be amortised into investment income as the acquired asset affects income. The Group is hedging its exposure 
to the variability of future cash flows from interest rate movements for terms up to 10 years, therefore the cash flows from these 
hedging instruments are expected to affect profit and loss for approximately the next 10 years. For the year ended 31 December 
2009, none of the Group’s cash flow hedges was ineffective or discontinued. 
The notional value of these interest rate swaps was £3 million at 31 December 2009 and their fair value was £0.1 million 
liability. The Group had no cash flow hedge activity at 31 December 2008.

(ii) Fair value hedges 
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps in order to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of part of its portfolio 
of mortgage loans and debt securities in the Netherlands and the United States. The notional value of these interest rate swaps 
was £3,060 million at 31 December 2009 (2008: £1,088 million, 2007: £nil) and their fair value was £184 million liability (2008: 
£86 million liability, 2007: £nil). These hedges were fully effective during the year. 
(iii) Net investment hedges 
To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into the following net investment hedges: 
— The Group has designated a portion of its Euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its 
European and American subsidiaries. The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2009 was £2,806 million (2008: £2,914 
million, 2007: £1,988 million) and its fair value at that date was £2,709 million (2008: £1,962 million, 2007: £1,972 million). 
— The foreign exchange gain of £255 million (2008: loss of £716 million) on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement 
of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders’ equity. This hedge was fully 
effective throughout the current and prior years. 
— The Group holds a Sterling/Euro cross currency swap derivative, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investment 
in its European subsidiaries. The notional value of the derivative at 31 December 2009 was £500 million (2008: £500 million, 
2007: £1,000 million) and its fair value at that date was £120 million liability (2008: £185 million liability, 2007: £27 million 
liability). During 2008, the Group reduced the size of the notional amount from £1 billion to £500 million, realising a loss of 
£164 million in closing out this part of the hedge. The fair value gain during 2009 was £65 million (2008: £158 million loss; 
2007: £27 million loss) on revaluation of the derivative which was recognised in other comprehensive income and the hedging 
instrument reserve in shareholders’ equity. This hedge was fully effective throughout the year. 
The losses on the Group’s net investment hedges during the year were more than offset by gains on the relevant subsidiaries which 
are recognised in the currency translation reserve (see note 34). 
(b) Non-hedge derivatives 
Non-hedge derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.

Notes to the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
financial statements  

A – Restatement of prior year figures 
The Company runs sterling and currency intercompany accounts with subsidiaries. During the year, it was discovered that incorrect 
foreign exchange rates had been applied to one of these accounts, with the result that the Company incorrectly recorded a foreign 
exchange loss of £87 million in 2008. The correcting entry has resulted in a reduction in expenses in 2008 of £87 million, an 
increase to the 2008 tax charge of £25 million, a reduction in the 2008 current tax asset of £25 million, an increase in other 
amounts owed by subsidiaries of £87 million and an increase in retained earnings of £62 million as at 31 December 2008. 
B – Investments in subsidiaries 
(i) Movements in the Company’s investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 
2009 2008 2007 
£m £m £m 
Fair value as at 1 January 16,353 24,466 27,886 
Movement in fair value 883 (8,113) (3,420) 
At 31 December 17,236 16,353 24,466 
Fair values are estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Company’s market capitalisation, and are classified 
as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 24(b) to the Group consolidated financial statements. 
(ii) At 31 December 2009, the Company has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in Great Britain. These are General 
Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited. Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General 
Accident plc no longer carries out this function. The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2008 are listed on 
pages 33 and 34.

Total 130 86 
(iii) Pension costs 
The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension 
Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme. There is no contractual agreement or policy for 
charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in 
the financial statements of the main UK employing company. The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its 
contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above. 
Full disclosure on the Group’s pension schemes is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 47.

(iv) Equity compensation plans 
All transactions in the Group’s equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company. Full 
disclosure of these plans is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 29. The cost of such options and awards is 
borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge. As the majority of the charge 
to the Company relates to directors’ options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors’ remuneration report, 
no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

The Company has unrecognised other temporary differences of £nil (2008: £30 million). 
The taxation of foreign profits and worldwide debt cap rules were enacted in the Finance Act 2009. Under the foreign profits 
rules, a dividend exemption was introduced which largely exempts dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK corporation 
tax. The Company has applied this legislation in arriving at its tax results for 2009. The worldwide debt cap rules apply from 
1 January 2010 and are not expected to apply to the Company due to an exemption for qualifying financial services groups.

Where subordinated debt is undated, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years. Annual interest payments for 
these borrowings are £74 million (2008: £77 million). 
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2009 was £4,372 million (2008: £2,979 million). The fair value of the 
9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2009 was £238 million (2008: £224 million). The fair value of the commercial 
paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value. 
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in the Group consolidated financial 
statements, note 48.

H – Risk management 
Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56. 
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations. Its risks are considered 
to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the risk management policies are given in the Group 
consolidated financial statements, note 56. Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting 
policy D. 
The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the 
Company’s market capitalisation. This uses a three month rolling average of the Company’s share price. Given that the key input 
into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the 
valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions. Management believes the resulting estimated fair values 
recorded in the balance sheet and any changes in fair values recorded in the income statement are reasonable, and are the most 
appropriate values at the balance sheet date. 
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. 
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. 
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings (details of which 
are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48) and loans owed to subsidiaries. Loans owed to 
subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date. 
Interest rate risk 
Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these 
rates. The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments (which are also exposed to interest rate 
fluctuations) held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each company’s net exposure. 
The majority of the Company’s external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in 
these rates. However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates. Further 
details of the Company's borrowings are provided in note F and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48. 
Currency risk 
The Company’s direct subsidiaries are all incorporated and operating in the UK, and therefore are not exposed to currency risk. 
However, these subsidiaries are themselves exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the 
course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world. The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk 
is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56. 
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in euros and US 
dollars. However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds financial investments in these currencies, 
generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 57(a)(iii).

Other information 
M1 – Basis of preparation 
The condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of financial position on pages 284 to 286 
present the group’s results and financial position for the life and related businesses on the Market Consistent Embedded Value 
(MCEV) basis and for its non-life businesses on the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) basis. The MCEV methodology 
adopted is in accordance with the MCEV Principles published by the CFO Forum in October 2009. 
The directors consider that the MCEV methodology gives useful insight into the drivers of financial performance of the group’s 
life and related businesses. This basis values future cash flows from assets consistently with market prices, including more explicit 
allowance for the impact of uncertainty in future investment returns and other risks. 
Embedded value is also consistent with the way pricing is assessed and the business is managed. 
The results for 2009 and 2008 have been audited by our auditors, Ernst & Young. Their report in respect of 2009 can be found 
on page 316 in the Report and Accounts. 
CFO Forum principles update 
The CFO Forum issued updated MCEV Principles and Guidance in October 2009, replacing the guidance issued in June 2008. 
The main change was to permit the use of liquidity premium on contracts with predictable cashflows. Aviva’s methodology of 
applying liquidity premium to contracts where backing assets can be held to maturity is unchanged. Further details are given 
on page 308. Aviva’s methodology is compliant with the updated CFO Forum Principles. 
Covered business 
The MCEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, 
pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share 
of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release 
business written in the UK. 
Covered business includes the group’s share of our joint ventures including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland 
Group (RBSG) and our associated undertakings in India, China, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea. In addition, the results 
of group companies providing significant administration, fund management and other services and of group holding companies 
have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business. Together these businesses are referred to as “Life and 
related businesses”. 
New business premiums 
New business premiums include: 
— premiums arising from the sale of new contracts during the period; 
— non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) rebate premiums; and 
— expected renewals on new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to new contracts. 
The group’s definition of new business under MCEV includes contracts that meet the definition of “non-participating investment” 
contracts under IFRS. 
For products sold to individuals, premiums are considered to represent new business where a new contract has been signed, 
or where underwriting has been performed. Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are 
reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-defined and reasonably predictable. 
For group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts. 
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected 
to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates. 
Life and pensions operating earnings 
For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns. The use of asset risk premia reflects 
management’s long-term expectations of asset returns in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes. 
Within the 2008 results, the normalised investment returns were calculated by reference to the one year swap rate in the 
relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium for bonds, equities and properties. For 2009, the group considers that the 
return over the typical duration of the assets held is more appropriate and is more consistent with the group’s expectation of long-
term rates of return. 
Therefore, the expected return on equities and properties has been calculated by reference to the 10 year swap rate in the 
relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium. The expected return on bonds has been calculated by reference to the swap 
rate consistent to the duration of the backing assets in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk premium. 
This assumption does not impact the embedded value as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned. 
MCEV methodology 
Overview 
Under the MCEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products defined within covered business. 
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the IFRS basis of reporting, but the timing of 
recognition is different.

Calculation of the embedded value 
The shareholders’ interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value. The embedded value is the total 
of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business. Calculations are performed 
separately for each business and are based on the cash flows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group 
reinsurance. Where one life business has an interest in another, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the 
dependent company. 
The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known 
changes. Where gross results are presented, these have been calculated by grossing up post-tax results at the full rate of 
corporation tax for each country based on opening period tax rates, apart from the US, where a nil tax rate has been used 
in the post-tax results, and consequently for ‘grossing up’. 
Net worth 
The net worth is the market value of the shareholders’ funds and the shareholders’ interest in the surplus held in the non-profit 
component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-
admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus. 
Required capital is the market value of assets attributed to the covered business over and above that required to back liabilities 
for covered business, for which distribution to shareholders is restricted. Required capital is reported net of implicit items permitted 
on a local regulatory basis to cover minimum solvency margins which are assessed at a local entity level. The level of required 
capital for each business unit is set equal to the higher of: 
— The level of capital at which the local regulator is empowered to take action; 
— The capital requirement of the business unit under the group’s economic capital requirements; and 
— The target capital level of the business unit. 
This methodology reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business, and includes 
any additional shareholder funds not available for distribution, such as the reattributed inherited estate in the UK. The same 
definition of required capital is used for both existing and new business. 
The free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the in-force covered business at the 
valuation date. The level of required capital across the business units expressed as a percentage of the EU minimum solvency 
margin (or equivalent) can be found on page 308. 
Value of in-force covered business (VIF) 
The value of in-force covered business consists of the following components: 
— present value of future profits; 
— time value of financial options and guarantees; 
— frictional costs of required capital; and 
— cost of residual non-hedgeable risks. 
Present value of future profits (PVFP) 
This is the present value of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best 
estimate basis. 
Distributable profits generally arise when they are released following actuarial valuations. These valuations are carried out 
in accordance with any local statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds. 
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, 
mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions. Releases to shareholders arising in future years 
from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using assumptions of future experience. 
Future profits are projected using best estimate non-economic assumptions and market consistent economic assumptions. 
In principle, each cash flow is discounted at a rate that appropriately reflects the riskiness of that cash flow, so higher risk cash 
flows are discounted at higher rates. In practice, the PVFP is calculated using the “certainty equivalent” approach, under which the 
reference rate is used for both the investment return and the discount rate. This approach ensures that asset cash flows are valued 
consistently with the market prices of assets without options and guarantees. Further information on the risk-free rates is given in 
note M18. 
The PVFP includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, 
investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business. This is referred to as the “look 
through” into service company expenses. In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or 
maintaining covered business have been allowed for. Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, 
their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.

M1 – Basis of preparation continued 
Time value of financial options and guarantees (TVOG) 
The PVFP calculation is based on a single (base) economic scenario. However, a single scenario cannot appropriately allow for 
the effect of certain product features. If an option or guarantee affects shareholder cash flows in the base scenario, the impact 
is included in the PVFP and is referred to as the intrinsic value of the option guarantee. 
However, future investment returns are uncertain and the actual impact on shareholder profits may be higher or lower. 
The value of in-force business needs to be adjusted for the impact of the range of potential future outcomes. Stochastic 
modelling techniques can be used to assess the impact of potential future outcomes, and the difference between the intrinsic 
value and the total stochastic value is referred to as the time value of the option or guarantee. 
Stochastic modelling typically involves projecting the future cash flows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios 
that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns. Under a 
market consistent approach, the economic scenarios generated reflect the market’s tendency towards risk aversion. Allowance 
is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and/or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future 
assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates. 
Stochastic models are calibrated to market yield curves and volatility levels at the valuation date. Tests are performed to 
confirm that the scenarios used produce results that replicate the market price of traded instruments. 
Where evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, dynamic lapse assumptions are set that vary 
depending on the individual scenarios. This cost is included in the TVOG. Dynamic lapses are modelled for parts of the US and 
French businesses. Asymmetries in non-economic assumptions that are linked to economic scenarios, but that have insufficient 
evidence for credible dynamic assumptions, are allowed for within mean best estimate assumptions. 
Frictional costs of required capital 
The additional costs to a shareholder of holding the assets backing required capital within an insurance company rather than 
directly in the market are called frictional costs. They are explicitly deducted from the PVFP. The additional costs allowed for are the 
taxation costs and any additional investment expenses on the assets backing the required capital. The level of required capital has 
been set out above in the net worth section. 
Frictional costs are calculated by projecting forwards the future levels of required capital. Tax on investment return and 
investment expenses are payable on the assets backing required capital, up until the point that they are released to shareholders. 
Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks (CNHR) 
The cost of residual non-hedgeable risks (CNHR) covers risks not already allowed for in the time value of options and guarantees or 
the PVFP. The allowance includes the impact of both non-hedgeable financial and non-financial risks. The most significant risk not 
included in the PVFP or TVOG is operational risk. 
The methodology includes a cost of non-hedgeable risk equivalent to a charge of 2.5% applied to group-diversified capital. 
The cost has been calculated as a 1.5% charge applied to business unit-level capital that is, allowing for diversification within a 
business unit, but not between business units. The charge was set so as to give an aggregate allowance that was in excess of the 
expected operational risk costs arising from the in-force covered business over its remaining lifetime. 
The capital levels used are projected to be sufficient to cover non-hedgeable risks at the 99.5% confidence level one-year after 
the valuation date. The capital is equal to the capital from the ICA results for those risks considered. The capital has been projected 
as running off over the remaining life of the in-force portfolio in line with the drivers of the capital requirement. 
In addition to the operational risk allowance, financial non-hedgeable risks and other product level asymmetries have been 
allowed for. These allowances are not material as significant financial non-hedgeable risks and product level asymmetries are either 
modelled explicitly and included in the TVOG or are included in the PVFP through the use of appropriate best estimate 
assumptions. 
Asymmetric risks allowed for in the TVOG or PVFP are described earlier in the Basis of preparation. No allowance has been 
made within the cost of non-hedgeable risk for symmetrical risks as these are diversifiable by investors. 
Participating business 
Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected 
future market-consistent returns on assets deemed to back the policies. 
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal 
bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies. However, 
under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the group’s with-profit funds 
are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims. The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been 
included in the TVOG. 
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benefits and shareholder value depend on the timing of 
realising gains, the apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders and shareholders reflect contractual requirements 
as well as existing practice. Under certain economic scenarios where additional shareholder injections are required to meet 
policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the TVOG. 
The embedded value of the US spread-based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for 
contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees. This includes the ability to change the crediting rates and 
indexed strategies available within the policy. Consideration is taken of the economic environment assumed in future projections 
and returns in excess of the reference rate are not assumed. Anticipated market and policyholder reaction to management action 
has been considered. The anticipated management action is consistent with current decision rules and has been approved and 
signed off by management and legal counsel.

Consolidation adjustments 
The effect of transactions between group life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements have been included in the 
results split by territory in a consistent manner. No elimination is required on consolidation. 
As the MCEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing 
administration, investment management and other services to the group’s life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have 
been removed from the relevant segment (non-insurance or fund management) and are instead included within the results of life 
and related businesses. In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the IFRS basis to the 
MCEV basis. 
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and 
value of new business calculations for the relevant business, but the net assets (representing historical profits and other amounts) 
remain under non-insurance or fund management. In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each 
segment with the assets on the opening and closing statement of financial positions, a transfer of IFRS profits from life and related 
business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur. An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our 
holding companies. The assessments of goodwill, intangibles and pension schemes relating to life insurance business utilise the 
IFRS measurement basis. 
Restatements 
(i) 	 Following a review, the scope of business using adjusted swap rates has been increased to cover all contracts that contain 
features similar to immediate annuity contracts. Prior year results have been restated to include the effect of adjusting the risk 
free rates on paid-up and single premium group deferred annuity business in Delta Lloyd and immediate annuities in France and 
Spain. At 31 December 2008, this increased the embedded value by £467 million and increased total earnings by £234 million 
in 2008. The impact of these changes by country at 31 December 2008 was Delta Lloyd (£352 million), France (£48 million) and 
Spain (£67 million). 
(ii) The 2008 figures for present value of new business premiums and value of new business have been restated to reclassify 
premium on Annual Renewable Term (ART) business in Spain as other operating existing business variances rather than new 
business. There is no impact on profit. 
(iii)The 2008 embedded value has been restated for the US, primarily reflecting modelling corrections in the valuation of assets 
on a market consistent basis identified in 2009. 
(iv)During 2009, the Group undertook a review of our accounting policy for cash and cash equivalents. Previously, we defined 
these as normally having a maturity of three months or less from date of acquisition. To avoid ambiguity, our accounting policy 
has been refined to impose a cut-off date of exactly three months, allowing us to delete “normally” from the policy wording. 
This refinement of policy has resulted in a reclassification of certain short-dated instruments between cash and cash equivalents 
and financial investments. 
The impact of this refinement has been to increase financial investments and reduce cash and cash equivalents in 2008 by 
£538 million compared to the amounts previously stated. As a consequence of this, cash flows from operating activities in 2008 
have decreased by £58 million, with the effect of exchange rate movements accounting for the remaining £50 million. 
(v) During 2009, the Group’s Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, carried out a review of the way it had been applying IAS 19, Employee 
Benefits, in its own financial statements where the corridor method of smoothing actuarial gains and losses in its pension 
schemes is followed; in accounting for its self-insured pension obligations and intercompany eliminations; and in its reporting 
to Group where the corridor accounting is reversed. The review concluded that errors had been made locally in applying IAS 19 
on the transition to IFRS and in subsequent years, such that gains on certain assets had been reported in provisions, to be 
released over time, rather than through other comprehensive income. The impact of correcting these errors is to reduce 
provisions by £129 million as at 1 January 2008, increase deferred tax liabilities by £33 million and increase retained earnings 
at that date by £96 million. 
Exchange rates 
The group’s principal overseas operations during the period were located within the Eurozone and the United States.  

The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated at the average rates for that period and the assets and  

liabilities have been translated at the period end rates. Please refer to note 1 on page 151 of the IFRS financial statements.

1.Maintenance expense experience in the UK relates to profits from existing business administration. Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic 
initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the simplification of systems and processes. Project and other related expenses in Delta Lloyd 
relate to integration costs in Belgium. 
2.Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses. 
3.Persistency experience has been volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting wider economic volatility. In France, positive persistency experience including the release of a short term 
provision, in line with positive underlying experience. In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both Life and Pension products. 
4.Other experience is favourable overall. Both France and Italy include one off adjustments reflecting final commission payments from prior years. The favourable impact in Italy reflects to one-off 
profit sharing on a reinsurance treaty. The favourable impact in Delta Lloyd relates to the revised investment and bonus strategy in Germany following the decision to close this operation to new 
business. The adverse impact in the USA relates to the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates. 
5.Favourable expense assumption changes reflect the impact of cost reductions in Delta Lloyd and Poland, together with the impact of revisions to expense allocations in Delta Lloyd. The adverse 
impact in Spain relates to the capitalisation of certain governance costs in respect of bancassurance joint ventures. 
6.Favourable mortality assumption changes in France, Poland reflecting recent experience. The adverse impact in the Delta Lloyd reflects the net impact of using updated mortality tables in the 
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, following the issuance of revised advice from the respective actuarial associations. 
7.Persistency assumptions have been strengthened across most of our businesses, in light of experience. In Poland, persistency assumptions have been weakened following sustained favourable 
experience. 
8.Other assumption changes in the US primarily relate to the timing of management action in setting policyholder credited rates. In Delta Lloyd, the change represents tax effects resulting from 
a reallocation of assets. 
9.Other operating variances in France, Poland and Asia have arisen as a result of more accurate modelling. In the Delta Lloyd, these relate to revisions to investment and bonus strategies and 
expenses in Delta Lloyd Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business. In Spain, these reflect the impact of re-pricing actions on risk products.

1. In Spain £34 million has been reclassified from value of new business to other operating variances. 
2. 	 Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the 
simplification of systems and processes. Expenses in Delta Lloyd reflect an overrun in Belgium following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium, and restructuring within the intermediary division. 
3. Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses. 
4. 	 Lapse experience has been volatile, in part reflecting wider economic volatility. In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both life and 
pension products. 
5. 	 In France, other experience profits include the reduction in value arising from reductions in fees and commissions received. In Ireland, certain statutory provisions were increased following 
a review. The movement in Delta Lloyd reflects changes on group pension scheme contribution. In the USA, other experience reflects the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates. 
6. In Delta Lloyd, expense assumptions have been updated following a review of expense allocations. 
7. 	 In UK, favourable mortality assumption changes are in respect of mortality and morbidity changes across a range of products. In Delta Lloyd, mortality assumption changes reflect the impact 
of using a new industry mortality basis. 
8. 	 In the UK, an additional lapse provision has been set up in anticipation of higher short-term recession related withdrawals (pre tax £50 million) and higher mortgage and income protection 
claims (pre tax £20 million) to reflect rising unemployment. In France, persistency assumptions have been weakened following continual favourable experience on AFER products. 
9. 	 In the UK, other operating assumption changes include the impact of the with-profit special distribution. In Ireland, other assumption changes reflect a reduction in the assumed future tax 
charges. In Poland, other assumptions reflect a change in the pattern of future mortality charging structure. 
10.Other operating variances in France are mainly in respect of the impact of the mutualisation of funds following the merger of two legal entities. In Delta Lloyd, changes are mainly in respect 
of aligning the profit sharing policy for existing group business in Belgium, following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium.

1.Maintenance expense experience in the UK relates to profits from existing business administration. Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic 
initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the simplification of systems and processes. Project and other related expenses in Delta Lloyd 
relate to integration costs in Belgium. 
2.Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses. 
3.Persistency experience has been volatile across most of our businesses, in part reflecting wider economic volatility. In France, positive persistency experience including the release of a short term 
provision, in line with positive underlying experience. In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both Life and Pension products. 
4.Other experience is favourable overall. Both France and Italy include one off adjustments reflecting final commission payments from prior years. The favourable impact in Italy reflects to one-off 
profit sharing on a reinsurance treaty. The favourable impact in Delta Lloyd relates to the revised investment and bonus strategy in Germany following the decision to close this operation to new 
business. The adverse impact in the USA relates to the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates. 
5.Favourable expense assumption changes reflect the impact of cost reductions in Delta Lloyd and Poland, together with the impact of revisions to expense allocations in Delta Lloyd. The adverse 
impact in Spain relates to the capitalisation of certain governance costs in respect of bancassurance joint ventures 
6.Favourable mortality assumption changes in France, Poland reflecting recent experience. The adverse impact in the Delta Lloyd reflects the net impact of using updated mortality tables in the 
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, following the issuance of revised advice from the respective actuarial associations. 
7.Persistency assumptions have been strengthened across most of our businesses, in light of experience. In Poland, persistency assumptions have been weakened following sustained favourable 
experience. 
8.Other assumption changes in the US primarily relate to the timing of management action in setting policyholder credited rates. In Delta Lloyd, the change represents tax effects resulting from 
a reallocation of assets. 
9.Other operating variances in France, Poland and Asia have arisen as a result of more accurate modelling. In the Delta Lloyd, these relate to revisions to investment and bonus strategies and 
expenses in Delta Lloyd Germany following the decision to close this operation to new business. In Spain, these reflect the impact of re-pricing actions on risk products.

1.In Spain £12 million has been reclassified from value of new business to other operating variances. 
2.Project and other related expenses in the UK reflect project costs associated with strategic initiatives, including developments designed to offer a wider range of products to customers, and the 
simplification of systems and processes. Expenses in Delta Lloyd reflect an overrun in Belgium following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium, and restructuring within the intermediary division. 
3.Mortality experience continues to be better than the assumptions set across a number of our businesses. 
4.Lapse experience has been volatile, in part reflecting wider economic volatility. In Poland, lapse experience continued to be better than the long-term assumptions for both life and pension 
products. 
5.In France, other experience profits include the reduction in value arising from reductions in fees and commissions received. In Ireland, certain statutory provisions were increased following 
a review. The movement in Delta Lloyd reflects changes on group pension scheme contribution. In the USA, other experience reflects the cost of enhancing policyholder crediting rates. 
6.In Delta Lloyd, expense assumptions have been updated following a review of expense allocations. 
7.In UK, favourable mortality assumption changes are in respect of mortality and morbidity changes across a range of products. In Delta Lloyd, mortality assumption changes reflect the impact of 
using a new industry mortality basis. 
8.In the UK, an additional lapse provision has been set up in anticipation of higher short-term recession related withdrawals (pre tax £50 million) and higher mortgage and income protection claims 
(pre tax £20 million) to reflect rising unemployment. In France, persistency assumptions have been weakened following continual favourable experience on AFER products. 
9.In the UK, other operating assumption changes include the impact of the with-profit special distribution. In Ireland, other assumption changes reflect a reduction in the assumed future tax 
charges. In Poland, other assumptions reflect a change in the pattern of future mortality charging structure. 
10. Other operating variances in France are mainly in respect of the impact of the mutualisation of funds following the merger of two legal entities. In Delta Lloyd, changes are mainly in respect 
of aligning the profit sharing policy for existing group business in Belgium, following the acquisition of Swiss Life Belgium.

2.Included within capital and dividend flows is the transfer to Life and related businesses from other segments consisting of service company profits and losses during the reported period that have 
emerged from the value of in-force. Since the “look through” into service companies includes only future profits and losses, these amounts must be eliminated from the closing embedded value. 
We have reported other non operating variances of £264 million for 2009 (2008: loss £232 million). This represents the impact on 
the Life MCEV of the reattribution of the inherited estate in the UK and the adverse impact of legislation changes relating to the 
capping of management changes on pension funds in Poland. In 2008 the impact related to the settlement agreed by Delta Lloyd 
for its unit-linked policyholders, following an industry-wide challenge on the level of fees. Acquired/divested businesses consist of 
the disposal of our Australian life and pensions business and the IPO of Delta Lloyd in 2009.

1.For Delta Lloyd, the 2008 value of new business is a loss on a real world basis and so it is not possible to calculate a meaningful payback period. Consequently the total and Europe average

M15 – Implied discount rates (IDR) 
In the valuation of a block of business, the implied discount rate is the rate of discount such that a traditional embedded value 
for the business equates to the MCEV. 
The cash flows projected are the expected future cash flows including expected investment cash flows from equities, bonds 
and properties earning a risk premium in excess of risk free, statutory reserves and required capital. The risk premiums used are 
consistent with those used in the expected existing business contribution within operating earnings. As the risk premiums are 
positive, a discount rate higher than risk-free is required to give a value equal to the market-consistent embedded value. 
Average derived risk discount rates are shown below for the embedded value.

M16 – Analysis of fund management and service company business within embedded value 
The MCEV methodology incorporates the impact of earnings arising from subsidiary undertakings providing administration, fund 
management and other services where these arise in relation to covered business. The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva group 
providing such services include Aviva Life Services Limited (UK) and Aviva Investors. The following table provides an analysis of the

The “look-through” value attributable to fund management is based on the level of after-tax profits expected to be earned in the 
future over the outstanding term of the covered business in respect of services provided to the group’s life operations. The MCEV 
basis income statement excludes the actual statutory basis profits arising from the provision of fund management services to the 
group’s life businesses. The MCEV income statement records the impact on new business, experience profit or loss compared to 
the assumed profitability, the expected return on the in-force value and the effect on the in-force value of changes to economic 
assumptions. 
In the United Kingdom, Aviva Life Services Limited (UK) (ALS) is the main provider of administration services to the UK Life 
business. ALS incurs substantially all of the UK businesses’ operating expenditure, comprising acquisition, maintenance and project 
costs. Costs are recharged to the UK Life companies (the product companies) on the basis of predetermined Management Services 
Agreements (MSAs).

M18 – Principal economic assumptions 
(a) Economic assumptions – Deterministic calculations 
Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each 
reporting period. 
In setting the risk-free rate we have, wherever possible used the mid-price swap yield curve for an AA-rated bank. 
The curve is extrapolated if necessary to get rates suitable to the liabilities. For markets in which there is no reliable swap yield 
curve the relevant government bond yields are used. 
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin or equivalent. 
The adjustments made to swap rates to derive a risk-free rate for immediate annuity type contracts and all US contracts are 
shown below the reference rate table. 
The principal economic assumptions used are as follows: 
Reference rate (spot, swap rates) and expense inflation

For service companies, expense inflation relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company. 
In current markets, the following adjustments are made to the swap rate for immediate annuity type contracts and all US 
contracts. The risk-free rate is taken as the swap yield curve for the currency of the liability, adjusted by:

Risk premium – used for operating profit, Implied Discount Rates (IDR), Internal Rates of Return (IRR) and payback period 
For life and pensions operating earnings, Aviva uses normalised investment returns. For 2008, the normalised investment returns 
were expressed as one year swap returns plus an asset risk premium. For 2009, the normalised investment returns are expressed as 
a swap rate based on the typical duration of the assets held plus an asset risk premium. More detail is given in note M1 – Basis of 
Preparation. 
The use of asset risk premia only impacts operating earnings as expected returns reflect management’s long-term expectations 
of asset returns in excess of the reference rate from investing in different asset classes. This assumption does not impact the 
embedded value or value of new business as asset risk premia are not recognised until earned. The asset risk premia set out in the 
table below are added to the ten year swap rate to calculate expected returns.

1.The required capital in the United Kingdom under MCEV is 100% for unit-linked and other non-participating business and 110% for annuity business. with 200% for an immaterial amount 
of BPA business. In addition, the reattribution of the inherited Estate has led to additional capital being locked in to support the with profit business, and this has been included within 
required capital. 
2.Required capital in Italy under MCEV is 184% of the EU minimum for Eurovita and 115% for other companies.  

3.Required capital in Spain is 125% of the EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.  

4.This capital level is the aggregate capital required for Delta Lloyd.  

5.Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.  

Other economic assumptions 
Required capital relating to with-profit business is generally assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and 
no effect has been attributed to shareholders. Where the fund is insufficient, and additional shareholder support is required, this is 
included within required capital, including the RIEESA in the UK. Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels 
consistent with the economic assumptions. The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit 
funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the United Kingdom and Ireland continues at 
the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus. 
(b) Economic Assumptions – Stochastic calculations 
The calculation of time value of options and guarantees allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to 
varying future investment conditions. The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix, bonus rates and rates of 
interest and other guarantees granted to policyholders. Modelled policyholder actions are described under “Other assumptions”. 
The embedded value of the US spread based products anticipates the application of management discretion allowed for 
contractually within the policies, subject to contractual guarantees. This includes the ability to change the crediting rates and 
indexed strategies available within the policy. Consideration is taken of the economic environment assumed in future projections 
and returns in excess of the reference rate are not assumed. Anticipated market and policyholder reaction to management action 
has been considered. The anticipated management action is consistent with current decision rules and has been approved and 
signed off by management and legal counsel.

M18 – Principal economic assumptions continued 
Model – United Kingdom, Europe (excluding Delta Lloyd) and North America 
Swap rates are generated by a model, the LIBOR Market Model (LMM), that projects a full swap curve at monthly intervals. 
Forward rates are assumed to have a log-normal distribution which guarantees non-negative interest rates. The model is calibrated 
to at-the-money swaptions of a variety of terms and tenors. Swaption volatilities are taken from Bloomberg. Tests have been 
performed to ensure that sufficient scenarios have been used that the result converges to the stochastic value of the business 
being valued. 
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year swaps plus an excess return. This excess return is 
modelled using a log-normal model where volatility varies by time horizon. This allows the model to capture the term structure of 
implied volatilities. The model is calibrated to at-the-money options of a variety of terms. Option volatilities are taken from a survey 
of investment banks. 
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva 
outside the UK. In the absence of liquid market data, the volatilities of these asset classes are based on historic data. 
Assumptions for correlations between asset classes have been set based on historic data. 
Model – Delta Lloyd 
In Delta Lloyd, yield curves are based on De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) yield curve data. 
The interest rate model used is a short rate G2++ model. The model is calibrated to the DNB yield curve and the swaption 
implied volatilities. Swaption implied volatilities are taken from Bloomberg. The equity model is a Heston model. 
Asset classes 
The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term fixed rate bonds. The most 
significant assumption is the distribution of future long-term interest rates, since this is the most important factor in the cost 
of guaranteed annuity options. 
For many businesses, including US, France and Delta Lloyd, the most important assets are fixed rate bonds of various 
durations.

M18 – Principal economic assumptions continued 
Property implied volatilities 
Best estimate levels of volatility have been used, in the absence of meaningful option prices from which implied levels of volatility 
can be derived. 
For the UK and Delta Lloyd, model property implied volatility is 15% for 31 December 2009 (31 December 2008: 15%). 
Demographic assumptions 
Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Aviva’s recent operating experience 
with a view to giving a best estimate of future experience. We have anticipated future changes in experience where that is 
appropriate, e.g. we have allowed for improvements in future policyholder longevity. 
We have set the assumptions based on a best estimate of shareholder outcomes. In particular, where the policyholder 
behaviour varies with economic experience, we have set assumptions which are dynamic, i.e. vary depending on the economic 
assumptions. For example, surrender and option take up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under 
consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely 
policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios. 
Additionally, where demographic experience is not driven by economic scenarios but is asymmetric on a stand-alone basis, the 
best estimate assumption considers the weighted-average expected experience, not simply the median or most likely outcome. 
Expense assumptions 
Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included 
in the MCEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-
force and project expenses. Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of 
recurring project expenses. Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identified separately and are generally 
charged as incurred. No future productivity gains have been anticipated. 
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to our life businesses, the value 
of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and value of new business. 
Non-hedgeable risk 
A charge of 2.5% has been applied to the group-diversified capital required on a 1-in-200 one-year basis over the remaining 
lifetime of in-force business. 
(c) Other assumptions 
Valuation of debt 
Borrowings in the MCEV consolidated statement of financial position are valued on an IFRS basis, consistent with the primary 
financial statements. At 31 December 2009 the market value of the group’s external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares 
including General Accident plc preference shares of £250 million (classified as minority interests) and direct capital instrument was 
£6,634 million (31 December 2008: £4,911 million).

M19 – Sensitivity analysis 
(a) Economic assumptions 
The following tables show the sensitivity of the embedded value and the value of new business to: 
— 10 basis point increase in the adjustment to risk free rates for immediate annuity type contracts and all US contracts; 
— one and two percentage point increase and decrease in the risk-free rate, including all consequential changes (including 
assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of fixed interest assets, risk discount rates); 
— 10% increase and decrease in market values of equity and property assets; 
— 25% increase in equity and swaption volatilities; 
— 50 basis point increase and decrease in credit spreads; and 
— decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum (or equivalent). 
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised 
economic conditions. For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reflect sensitivity changes to future investment 
returns. Some of the sensitivity scenarios may have consequential effects on valuation bases, where the basis for certain blocks of 
business is actively updated to reflect current economic circumstances. Consequential valuation impacts on the sensitivities are 
allowed for where an active valuation basis is used. Where businesses have a target asset mix, the portfolio is re-balanced after a 
significant market movement otherwise no re-balancing is assumed. 
For new business, the sensitivities reflect the impact of a change immediately after inception of the policy. 
In general, the magnitude of the sensitivities will reflect the size of the embedded values, though this will vary as the 
sensitivities have different impacts on the different components of the embedded value. In addition, other factors can have a 
material impact, such as the nature of the options and guarantees, as well as the types of investments held. 
The credit spread sensitivities assume that the change relates to credit risk and not liquidity risk; in practice, credit spread 
movements may be partially offset due to changes in liquidity risk. 
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the 
intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees. Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the 
sensitivities where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios. This can be seen in the sensitivity of 
a 1%–2% movement in the interest rate for Delta Lloyd and US, where there is a significant amount of business with investment 
return guarantees.

(b) Non-economic assumptions 
The following tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value and the value of new business to the following changes 
in non-economic assumptions: 
— 10% decrease in maintenance expenses (a 10% sensitivity on a base expense assumption of £10 pa would represent an 
expense assumption of £9 pa). Where there is a “look through” into service company expenses the fee charged by the service 
company is unchanged while the underlying expense decreases; 
— 10% decrease in lapse rates (a 10% sensitivity on a base assumption of 5% pa would represent a lapse rate of 4.5% pa); and 
— 5% decrease in both mortality and morbidity rates disclosed separately for life assurance and annuity business. 
No future management actions are modelled in reaction to the changing non-economic assumptions. In each sensitivity calculation 
all other assumptions remain unchanged. No changes to valuation bases have been included.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) basis 
When compliance with the European Insurance CFO Forum Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles (MCEV Principles), 
published in October 2009, is stated, those principles require the directors to prepare supplementary information in accordance 
with the methodology contained in the MCEV Principles and to disclose and explain any non-compliance with the guidance 
included in the MCEV Principles. 
In preparing this supplementary information, the directors have done so in accordance with these MCEV Principles and have 
also fully complied with all the guidance included therein. Specifically, the directors have: 
— determined assumptions on a realistic basis, having regard to past, current and expected future experience and to relevant 
external data, and then applied them consistently; 
— made estimates that are reasonable and consistent; and, 
— provided additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements of the MCEV Principles is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions and the group's financial position and 
financial performance.

properly prepared in accordance with the Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles issued in October 2009 by the CFO Forum 
(“the MCEV Principles”) and the basis of preparation set out on pages 289 to 292. 
We have reported separately on the statutory Group financial statements of Aviva plc for the year ended 31 December 2009. 
The information contained in the consolidated MCEV financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial 
statements prepared on an IFRS basis. 
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with our engagement letter dated 5 August 2009. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors are responsible for preparing the consolidated MCEV financial statements in accordance with the MCEV Principles. 
Our responsibilities, as independent auditor, in relation to the MCEV financial statements, are set out in our engagement letter 
dated 5 August 2009. We report to you our opinion as to whether the consolidated MCEV financial statements have been properly 
prepared in all material respects in accordance with the MCEV Principles and the basis of preparation set out on pages 289 to 292. 
We also report to you if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit of the consolidated 
MCEV financial statements. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and Accounts and consider whether it is consistent with the 
consolidated MCEV financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated 
MCEV financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the 
preparation of the consolidated MCEV financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the consolidated MCEV financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the consolidated MCEV financial statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion the consolidated MCEV financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 have been properly prepared, 
in all material respects, in accordance with the MCEV Principles and the basis of preparation set out on pages 289 to 292.

annuity, deferred annuity and other contracts 
in the US. 
Net written premiums 
Total gross written premiums for the given 
period, minus premiums paid over or ‘ceded’ 
to reinsurers.

major European listed and non-listed 
insurance companies. 
“Soft” insurance market 
A term used to describe the state of the

Market Consistent Embedded Value 
(MCEV) terms cont. 
New business margin 
New business margins are calculated as the 
value of new business divided by the present 
value of new business premiums (PVNBP), and 
expressed as a percentage. 
Present value of new business 
premiums (PVNBP) 
Present value of new regular premiums plus 
100% of single premiums, calculated using 
assumptions consistent with those used to 
determine the value of new business. 
Required capital 
The amount of assets, over and above the 
value placed on liabilities in respect of covered 
business, whose distribution to shareholders 
is restricted. 
Risk-free rate (reference rate in CFO 
Forum terminology) 
In stable markets, including the period from 
31 December 2006 to 30 June 2007, the risk-
free rate is taken as the swap curve yield. 
In current markets, including the period from 
1 July 2007, the risk-free rate is taken as swaps 
except for all contracts that contain features 
similar to immediate annuities and are backed 
by appropriate assets, including paid up group 
deferred annuities in the Netherlands, and 
deferred annuities and all other contracts in 
the US. The adjusted risk-free rate is taken as 
swaps plus the additional return available for 
products and where backing asset portfolios 
can be held to maturity. 
Service companies 
Companies providing administration or fund 
management services to the covered business. 
Solvency cover 
The excess of the regulatory value of total 
assets over total liabilities, divided by the 
regulatory value of the required minimum 
solvency margin. 
Spread business 
Contracts where a significant source of 
shareholder profits is the taking of credit 
spread risk that is not passed on to 
policyholders. The most significant spread 
business in Aviva are immediate annuities and 
US deferred annuities and life business. 
Statutory basis 
The valuation basis and approach used 
for reporting financial statements to 
local regulators. 
Stochastic techniques 
Techniques that incorporate the potential 
future variability in assumptions. 
Symmetric risks 
Risks that will cause shareholder profits to 
vary where the variation above and below the 
average are equal and opposite. Financial 
theory says that investors do not require 
compensation for non-market risks that are 
symmetrical as the risks can be diversified 
away by investors. 
Time value and intrinsic value 
A financial option or guarantee has two 
elements of value, the time value and intrinsic 
value. The intrinsic value is the discounted value 
of the option or guarantee at expiry, assuming 
that future economic conditions follow best 
estimate assumptions. The time value is the 
additional value arising from uncertainty 
about future economic conditions. 
Value of new business 
Is calculated using economic assumptions 
set at the start of each quarter and the same 
operating assumptions as those used to 
determine the embedded values at the end 
of the reporting period and is stated after 
the effect of any frictional costs. Unless 
otherwise stated, it is also quoted net of 
tax and minority interests.

Be on your guard – beware of fraudsters 
In recent years, many companies have become aware that 
their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. These are typically 
from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high 
risk shares in US or UK investments. These operations are 
commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free company 
reports. If you receive any unsolicited advice: 
— Make sure you get the correct name of the person and 
organisation 
— Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before 
getting involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/

Aviva plc 
Annual Review 2009 
Chairman’s introduction 
In good shape for
 
the new decade
 
Lord Sharman of Redlynch OBE 
Chairman 
Dear Shareholder 
It is traditional for the Chairman to close his statement by formally thanking employees. 
This year, however, I think it’ s more appropriate to begin by saying that our strong results 
for 2009 are due to the extraordinary efforts made by the executive team and our people 
throughout the Aviva group. 
A strong, single brand name is essential for us to compete effectively in the global 
insurance marketplace so the launch of the Aviva name worldwide in 2009 was fundamental. 
This was just one of a number of key deliverables during the year including: a successful partial 
sale of our Dutch business, Delta Lloyd, and the distribution of monies to our policyholders 
from the UK inherited estate. 
In a year of ‘business as usual’, these would have been great achievements, so I am 
extremely proud that, through 2009’ s adverse conditions, at Aviva we have remained strong, 
resolute and on track. 2010 is unlikely to be any easier but we’re now in an even better 
position to take advantage of new opportunities, and of achieving our vision for ‘One Aviva, 
Twice the Value’. 
Dividend 
I am pleased to announce that the final dividend for 2009 will be 15 pence, bringing the 
total dividend to 24 pence. This follows our decision last year to reduce the dividend to 
a sustainable level, from which Aviva can grow over time. Our dividend policy remains 
unchanged and the final dividend cover of 1.8 times remains within the 1.5 to 2.0 times 
target range, which is based on IFRS operating earnings after tax. 
Changes to the Board 
I would like to thank Philip Scott, who retired from his role as chief financial officer (CFO) at 
the end of 2009 with an impressive 36 years’ service with Aviva. With his knowledge of the 
insurance industry, he has successfully navigated us through some difficult market conditions. 
In February 2010, we welcomed Patrick Regan as our new CFO. He joined us from Willis Group 
Holdings in the US where he was group chief operating officer and CFO. 
We further strengthened our Board with the appointment of Andrea Moneta, chief 
executive of Aviva Europe, Middle East and Africa, in September 2009. Other Board changes 
include: the retirement after nearly ten years of our senior independent non-executive director, 
Wim Dik; the resignation of Nikesh Arora, due to relocation to the United States; the 
appointment of new independent non-executive directors, Leslie Van de Walle, former chief 
executive officer of Rexam plc, who joined us in May 2009 and, from January 2010, Michael 
Hawker , who was previously chief executive and managing director of Insurance Australia Group. 
Looking forward 
As a realist, I am sure that 2010 will not be an easy year for the financial markets but there may 
be some cause for optimism as the year progresses. I am particularly pleased at how well we 
have reorganised the business and are ready to take full advantage of the upturn when it arrives.

A year of 
significant progress 
Progress

ensure it’ s much more than a name change. 
We’re making progress towards delivering 
‘Twice the Value’ – improving the way we serve 
our customers, increasing our efficiency, 
focusing on profitability, removing cost from 
the business and delivering strong results.

I’m pleased with our progress this year. It has been a year 
of strong financial performance and delivery against our 
strategic plans. I’m proud of the way my team has performed 
and I’m confident that by remaining focused on our strategy 
we will make further progress in 2010. 
Aviva has delivered a strong return to profit with IFRS total profit after 
tax at £1,315 million. On an MCEV basis, which takes into account the 
long-term nature of life insurance business, the total profit after tax 
was £2,935 million compared to a loss of £7,707 million in 2008. This 
rebound in total profits reflects the combined effects of a recovery in 
equity markets, together with our disciplined business management 
and cost control. Operating profit is 12% lower at £2,022 million on 
an IFRS basis and up 3% on an MCEV basis to £3,483 million. 
We have strengthened Aviva’ s capital position substantially over 
the past year and IGD solvency surplus, the buffer we hold above our 
liabilities, has more than doubled to £4.5 billion reflecting some bold 
capital management initiatives and a recovery in investment markets. 
We have made excellent progress in the delivery of our strategy, 
including our move to a single brand, the IPO of our Dutch business, 
the reattribution of the inherited estate in the UK and the restructuring 
of our cost base. 
In driving Aviva forward, we will retain our disciplined approach. 
We expect the external environment to remain unpredictable for some 
time but are encouraged that we saw the first signs of an improved 
appetite to save among our customers in the final quarter of last year. 
We will continue to deliver against the strategy that has helped us 
to navigate the global economic crisis so successfully. We will maximise 
the value of being a single, global group, as we aim to deliver a consistently 
positive experience for our 53 million customers around the world.

Aviva plc 
Group chief executive’s review continued 
Annual Review 2009 
Q.
How has Aviva performed 
throughout a difﬁcult 2009? 
Like all financial services companies, 
we have been affected adversely, both 
by market volatility and understandable 
customer caution. However, the business 
has stood up well. This is due, in part, to 
our global diversity, having both life and 
general insurance operations and also 
because of the decisive action we have 
taken through the strategy put in place 
two years ago. 
Several months into 2010, we have 
made great progress in transforming our 
UK business under one team. We are also 
starting to see positive results from the 
creation of our ‘one Europe’ operating 
model. In North America, the life market 
has been really challenged and it’ s good 
to see that coming back. In Asia Pacific, 
despite customers being cautious, we 
have continued to grow our business, 
particularly in China and South Korea. 
Aviva Investors’ investment performance 
has radically improved along with 
solid earnings. 
Q.
How ﬁnancially strong is Aviva? 
We’ve seen a marked improvement in 
our capital position. Focusing on costs 
in order to improve margins has meant 
that, whilst we have seen volumes drop, 
we still reported a resilient operating 
profit and a strong balance sheet. We 
have worldwide sales of £45 billion and 
£379 billion of funds under management. 
We are managing our financial risks 
prudently and skilfully. 
Q.
Why did you cut your dividend 
mid-year? 
In light of Aviva’ s lower IFRS operating 
earnings, the continuing economic 
uncertainty and our desire to retain 
flexibility, we felt it was the right decision 
to make. So in spite of it being a tough 
decision, we believe it was the right one. 
Q.
Do you remain committed to 
your ‘One Aviva, Twice the 
Value’ strategy? 
We have made good progress towards 
our target this year . If you compare 
earnings per share of 37.8 pence in 2009 
with those of 2008 (a loss of 36.8 pence), 
it’ s a great improvement. 
In the past 12 months we’ve 
increased the pace of transformation and 
restructured our portfolio, giving us new 
opportunities to redeploy capital to 
support profitable growth. 
Our senior management team is 
committed to this target and it remains 
our focus in 2010. 
Q.
How is your business changing? 
In 2008 we initiated a programme to 
create a simplified and more modern 
way of doing business to improve 
efficiency and reflect customers’ 
preference to do business online; 
we’ve invested in new technology 
and streamlined our processes. 
This fundamental change in the 
way we operate means our business 
is now fit for the future, with improved 
capacity and productivity. We have 
reduced our costs by £500 million and 
Aviva has 19% fewer employees than 
two years ago. 
What’ s really pleasing is that during 
this period our customer satisfaction 
has improved, with nearly 70% of our 
businesses at or above the local market 
benchmark and 50% are in the 
upper quartile. 
Q.
What are you most proud 
of in 2009? 
I’m most proud of our people: their 
dedication and resilience over the past 
year has been incredible. They’ve 
remained focused on what we’re here 
for – delivering prosperity and peace 
of mind to our customers – and have 
done a great job. 
I’ve already talked about our 
financial strength and the strategically 
significant achievements in our business. 
However, none of this could have been 
done without the hard work of all of 
our people around the world. 
Q.
Looking forward – how would 
you sum up your priorities 
for 2010? 
There’ s no question that the economic 
climate remains uncertain: 2010 is still 
challenging but I’m confident we have 
the right team, strategy and commitment 
to make it another successful year. 
We will continue to deliver our strategy, 
maintain our capital strength and focus 
on the profitable growth of our company . 
53 million customers place their 
business with us. That’ s a great 
responsibility and we will be working 
harder than ever in 2010 to continue 
to earn their trust and attract new 
customers to Aviva.

Aviva plc 
In 2009, the group’s strategy was underpinned by
Annual Review 2009 
Key performance 
focusing on a number of key financial performance
indicators 
measures. The key measures that are used to assess 
performance at a group level are set out below: 
Our key performance indicators 
Earnings per share* 
IFRS earnings per share for 2009 increased to 
37.8 pence. This mainly reflects the improvement 
in financial markets in 2009 partly offset by lower 
IFRS operating profits. 
Proposed ordinary dividend 
per share and dividend cover* 
The total dividend for the year is 24.00 pence 
per share. This is in line with last year’ s decision 
to reduce the dividend to a sustainable level from 
which it can grow. 
Group operating profit 
before tax* 
2009 operating profits reflect higher long-term 
and savings results (both IFRS and MCEV) offset 
by lower general insurance and health profits and 
increased group debt costs. 
Worldwide sales* 
Sales were lower in both long-term and savings 
and general insurance mainly reflecting the tough 
economic environment and our focus on writing 
for profit rather than volume in general insurance. 
Return on equity shareholders’ funds* 
The improvement in return on equity reflects the 
increase in the post-tax MCEV operating profit and 
the impact of lower opening equity shareholder’ s 
funds following falls in asset values in 2008. 
Employee engagement 
and leadership 
Employee KPIs are now based on more robust 
scale and against stronger benchmarks. As we’ve 
changed our supplier, historical data is not 
comparable and has therefore been removed. 
Customer advocacy 
24 businesses took part in our 2009 Net Promoter 
Score ® survey (2008: 12). 16 met or exceeded the 
benchmark with 12 in the upper quartile. The ratio 
beating benchmark is the same as 2008; however, 
more businesses are in the upper quartile rankings. 
Relevancy 
To demonstrate our commitment to ‘One Aviva, 
Twice the Value’ we are aiming to double earnings 
per share by 2012. 
Our intention is to pay a dividend on a basis judged 
prudent using dividend cover of 1.5 – 2.0 times, 
while retaining capital to fund future growth. 
We aim to achieve steady sustainable growth in our 
operating profit, both on a MCEV and IFRS basis. 
In seeking to achieve this growth, we continue to 
adopt strict financial management disciplines 
underpinned by strong corporate governance. 
While our focus is on capital efficiency and profit 
rather than volumes, sales remain an important 
indicator. Worldwide sales comprise the PVNBP 
of long-term savings new business sales and net 
written premiums from the general insurance and 
health businesses. 
Return on equity shareholders’ funds is calculated 
as after-tax operating return, before adjusting 
items, on opening equity shareholders’ funds, 
including life profits on a market consistent 
embedded value (MCEV) basis. 
Employee engagement represents the degree to 
which people believe in Aviva being a great place 
to work and are contributing to help meet our 
collective goals and ambitions. 
Customer advocacy gives us, in a single, simple 
measure, an accurate predictor of customer 
retention and cross-selling opportunity.

Annual Review 2009 
UK 
A leader in our
 
home market
 
From 1 January 2010 we have brought 
together the Aviva UK life and general 
insurance businesses, creating a new 
organisation led by one chief executive 
officer. In 2009, in addition to completing 
the rebranding to Aviva, both businesses 
have continued their extensive transformation 
programmes, which will make significant 
improvements to customer service, and they 
have delivered combined cost savings of 
£450 million, a year ahead of plan. 
Strategy 
The core strategies for the UK business are: 
— to leverage our extensive distribution 
network and customer base to increase 
profits in a mature but evolving marketplace; 
— to maintain market leadership through 
balanced distribution and broad product 
mix, improved customer retention and the 
simplification of processes, services and costs. 
Aviva UK 
T otal sales were £14,261 million in 2009, 
down 24% on 2008. IFRS operating profit 
for the year decreased 15% to £1,165 million 
reflecting the impact of lower premiums and 
lower investment returns. For full details of our 
financial reporting visit www.aviva.com/reports. 
The rebrand to Aviva in the UK took place on 
1 June 2009. Our successful advertising 
campaigns, highlighting Aviva’ s products and 
services and encouraging customers to ‘get 
the Aviva deal’, have increased recognition 
and awareness of the Aviva brand significantly. 
UK long-term and savings business 
Market environment 
During 2009 the overall long-term savings market declined by 17%. 
This contraction, for the second consecutive year, was primarily driven 
by falls in the pension and bond markets as lower consumer confidence, 
limited salary increases and higher unemployment reduced customers’ 
propensity to save and invest for the future. Specific regulatory events, 
such as the cessation of sales of single premium creditor business, also 
impacted the market. Despite this, we have maintained a disciplined 
focus on profitability, significantly improving our new business margin 
Peace of mind at a difficult time 
Paul* and his family have been through 
a really difficult time during the last year. 
In May his wife died of breast cancer, 
leaving him to look after their two 
young children on his own. After she 
was diagnosed as terminally-ill, her main 
concern was that the family she was 
leaving behind would be financially OK. 
Paul was determined to give her the 
peace of mind that she needed and 
also to make sure that, should anything 
subsequently happen to him, their 
children would be well provided for. 
He wrote to say thank you for the 
support that we gave him: “Your staff 
throughout that time were incredibly 
courteous and professional, and that 
really helped her. When we spoke to 
some other companies during that time 
you’d have thought she had just broken 
a nail – not had a critical illness. Thank 
you for everything.”

Annual Review 2009 
Performance 
In the UK life market, Aviva has built a leading position 
across a broad product range. We have gained competitive 
advantage through our financial strength, product 
development and taking actions to simplify the business 
making it easier for customers. 
We delivered new propositions recognising consumer 
needs, including offering 12-months free life cover to new 
parents, the launch of a With-Profit Guaranteed bond and 
recently re-opening our Wrap and Sipp platforms to new 
business. Our innovative Simplified Life protection product 
continues to go from strength to strength with a 147% 
increase in new applications compared to 2008, whilst our 
market-leading individual annuity pricing capability attained 
record new business volumes for this product in the fourth 
quarter of 2009. 
As a result of our major simplification and efficiency 
initiatives, designed to better meet customer needs, we 
have outsourced the administration of almost three million 
policies to industry experts: Swiss Re, Scottish Friendly and 
International Financial Data Services. We have decommissioned 
over 300 IT systems, delivered a more flexible cost base and 
made £100 million of annualised cost savings. 
We have continued to invest in our e-commerce offerings 
with the launch of further new propositions to help our 
customers and distribution partners. ‘Customer Portal’ and 
‘Aviva for Advisers’ provide secure on-line access to over 
4.5 million policies, enabling customers and advisers to 
manage their Aviva Life products quickly and easily at a time 
convenient to them. We were also the first in the industry to 
offer a virtual online guide as part of our innovative ‘Pension 
Tracker’, making it possible for almost 1.5 million customers 
to manage their Aviva pension plans online. This approach 
contributed to Aviva winning the Personal Finance ‘Pension 
Provider of the Year’ award voted for by customers and 
judged on proposition quality, brand, service and sustainability. 
Throughout 2009 our commitment to deliver service 
excellence has driven improved satisfaction and advocacy 
results. By listening to and understanding what matters most 
to our customers and distributors, we can ensure they have 
a better service experience.

Outlook 
We expect the market to remain challenging in the short term 
as the impact of the recession continues to influence demand 
for investment and savings products. Longer term, major 
regulatory changes including the Retail Distribution Review 
and Solvency II will be implemented. Our strategies will enable 
us to exploit the opportunities emerging in our market as we 
continue to build on our e-commerce and service capability 
and product and distribution breadth.

Fair play 
We are paying out £471 million 
to policyholders 
Fair reattribution payments 
Following the announcement in May 2009 of a new, more 
flexible offer – and the subsequent FSA and High Court 
approval in September – the reattribution of our inherited 
estate completed on 1 October. Our objective was always to 
create a reattribution that was fair to both shareholders and 
policyholders, making sure that customers had a choice of 
whether they wished to accept the offer, depending on their 
personal circumstances. As a result, over 87% of eligible 
policyholders voted during the election process, with 96% 
of these voting in favour of the offer. By the end of 2009, 
the majority of the £471 million reattribution payment 
had been distributed to those policyholders who 
accepted the offer.

Aviva plc 
UK continued 
Annual Review 2009 
UK general insurance business 
Market environment 
2009 has been a challenging year, with strong 
competition and the recession impacting all lines 
of business. More customers are searching for 
cheaper deals, while fewer are making discretionary 
purchases such as breakdown cover. A significant 
fall in creditor volumes, resulting from lower lending, 
was compounded by a sharp rise in creditor claims. 
Fewer start-ups, more business failures and reduced 
exposures have resulted in shrinking commercial 
markets. However, there have been some recent 
encouraging signs that more realistic pricing is emerging 
in the market, particularly in personal motor. 
Performance 
The UK general insurance operation has significantly 
improved the profitability of business written in 2009. 
By simplifying the business, reducing costs, achieving 
scale benefits and taking a disciplined approach to 
underwriting and distribution, we have created a 
platform for future growth. 
Progress on our transformation programme 
remains ahead of plan, with all business now being 
undertaken in our new ‘centres of excellence’. We are 
on track to deliver annualised savings of more than 
our £150 million target from this phase by 2010, in 
addition to savings of £200 million already delivered. 
We have refocused our brands to offer our 
customers the best price when they buy direct from 
Aviva supported by our ‘Get the Aviva Deal’ marketing 
campaign, complimented by the RAC panel which is 
available on all major online price comparison sites 
and supported by 17 insurers. The impact has been 
extremely positive: we sold more Direct personal 
motor policies in the fourth quarter than in the same 
period in the previous three years and the RAC panel 
had gained a share of around 3.5% of new business 
in the UK personal motor market by the end of 2009. 
Overall business volumes have fallen reflecting 
the action we have taken to exit unprofitable business 
and the challenging market conditions. We continue 
to support independent brokers through a range of 
initiatives including customised networks (such as the 
Broker Independence Group and Club 110) as well 
as providing easy and fast access to our best prices. 
In addition, we were delighted to renew the Barclays 
homeowner account. 
Outlook 
In the general insurance market, quality of earnings 
remains our priority and we aim to increase profitability 
through enhanced risk selection and tightly controlling 
our costs. Whilst there are some encouraging signs in 
personal motor , we continue to see intense competition 
in many segments of the market and we await the 
significant shift in attitude that the market requires. 
This is particularly true in the case of Commercial 
lines and there is little evidence that the market is 
hardening significantly. 
RAC insurance 
RAC continues from strength to strength as a leading UK 
service brand, coming fifth in the Institute of Customer 
Service’ s 2009 survey, comparable with John Lewis, Waitrose 
and M&S. In its core breakdown category it won the JD Power 
survey for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year. The 
service culture is not just delivered by our patrol staff either: 
RAC’ s membership call centre entered the Times T op 50 UK 
call centres at 14th. 
In January 2009 we launched our car insurance panel 
under the iconic RAC brand to complement our existing direct 
offering from Aviva. This ensures that almost every customer 
that calls us can be provided cover at competitive prices. 
The panel is on all the major online price comparison sites 
and it is writing growing volumes of business through this 
channel of distribution.

Building a truly pan-
European business 
with a broad and 
diverse portfolio 
We have a clear strategy to exploit the considerable 
opportunities in Europe. There is significant growth 
potential in the region, in both under-penetrated Western 
markets and developing markets in Eastern Europe. 
With our proven ability to operate across distribution 
channels, we will be able to respond favourably to market 
developments as customer confidence begins to return. 
Strategy 
Our strategy is to capitalise on the significant opportunities 
within Europe through: 
— Aviva Europe’ s Quantum Leap transformation plan, 
creating one market leading pan-European business 
from 12 federated businesses, 
— the strategic development of our 58% investment 
in Delta Lloyd following the IPO in November 2009. 
Our principal financial objective is long-term, sustainable, 
profitable growth.

Market environment 
Europe is already the largest insurance market in the world 
with an affluent population of over 800 million people, 
generating 31% of global insurance premiums
1
 and 
accounting for over 30% of global personal financial assets
2
. 
Europe offers significant growth opportunities in both 
under-penetrated Western markets and developing markets 
in Eastern Europe. 
As elsewhere, the slowdown in economic growth 
has impacted customer behaviour in the majority of the 
region with customers favouring deposit bank accounts or 
guaranteed insurance products. Customer confidence is 
beginning to return particularly in France, Italy and Poland 
where customers are starting to re-invest in more attractive 
insurance products such as unit-linked bonds. 
Health plan meant that they would even 
be covered for cancer care and cardiac 
procedures – she hoped they would 
never have to use them but it made her 
feel safer; the maternity benefits were 
great too (just in case) and, with her 
daughter growing up, the cervical 
cancer vaccination would mean one 
less thing to worry about. And by just 
knowing that the plan gave them fast 
access, if they needed it, to hospitals 
and treatment centres close to home, 
she would certainly sleep better now.

The campaign slogan ‘Looking out for

immediately also appealed to her. When

Annual Review 2009 
Aviva Europe performance 
Aviva Europe operates in 12 businesses across Europe 
(excluding the UK) with substantial operations in 
France, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Spain. We also have 
a presence in the developing markets in Central and 
Eastern Europe of Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, 
Romania, Russia, Turkey and Slovakia. As part of our 
strategy, we are transforming our 12 federated 
businesses through our ’Quantum Leap’ programme 
into one market leading pan-European business. 
Since January 2010, Aviva Europe has assumed 
responsibility for developing Aviva’ s business interests 
in the Middle East, based in the United Arab Emirates. 
We expect this high-potential market to grow, 
benefiting from Aviva Europe’ s experience and resources. 
We achieved total sales of £16,258 million during 
2009, up 8% on 2008. IFRS operating profit for the year 
decreased 4% to £797 million, reflecting exceptional 
weather losses in France and Ireland. For full details of 
our financial reporting visit www.aviva.com/reports 
We have made significant progress in our 
migration to a single Aviva brand. Having operated as 
Hibernian Aviva in 2009, we adopted the Aviva name 
in Ireland at the start of 2010 and we will complete 
our brand migration programme in June when we will 
operate as Aviva in Poland. Recognition of the Aviva 
brand continues to grow in both markets, with Ireland 
recording prompted awareness rates in excess of 90%.

Our bancassurance franchise is the largest in 
Europe with 50 bank agreements and our retail
4 
channel accesses nine million customers through 
18,000 financial advisers. With this proven ability to 
operate across distribution channels, we are able to 
meet different customer preferences and respond 
favourably to market developments. 
Our business is performing strongly in both 
distribution channels. In retail, our partnership with 
AFER, a leading savings association in France, 
continues to be extremely successful with customer 
numbers growing by 5% to 712,000 in 2009. In 
bancassurance, our Italian partnership with Banco 
Popolare that commenced in 2008 performed strongly 
in highly profitable protection products, one of our 
key strategic objectives.

Making a ‘Quantum Leap’ 
in performance 
In 2009, we announced 
our new strategy to make 
a ‘Quantum Leap’ in 
performance by integrating 
the operations of our 12 
separate Aviva Europe 
businesses. We are creating 
a single pan-European 
organisation which will create 
significant value for Aviva’ s 
customers and shareholders. 
By moving to a pan-
European operating model, 
we are simplifying our product 
range, shortening the time 
to launch new products for 
our customers and making 
significant efficiency gains by 
centralising our operations, 
enabling us to improve cost 
management, grow net 
profits and enhance dividends 
remitted to the Group. 
As part of our transformation, 
we are also establishing a 
single holding company for 
our European operations in 
Ireland. This new structure 
will deliver economic, 
operational and regulatory 
benefits, especially with the 
anticipated introduction of 
Solvency II in 2012. 
Our two pan-European 
distribution channels, 
bancassurance and retail, 
supported by pan-European 
product development, 
operations and governance 
will enable us to take full 
advantage of the significant 
growth potential and 
opportunities in Europe and 
contribute fully to the ‘One 
Aviva, T wice the Value’ target.

In 2009, we developed our suite of guaranteed products which 
have proved attractive particularly in France, Spain and Italy. 
Being there for customers in times of need is crucial: 
following flooding and storms in France during 2009, we paid 
out 90% of claims in the year. And to reinforce this, 94% of 
our customers in France who were hit by Hurricane Klaus were 
happy with the way we handled their claims. 
Delta Lloyd performance 
Our Delta Lloyd business is one of the top five financial 
services providers in the Netherlands and also operates in 
Belgium and Germany. In 2009, we completed the successful 
IPO and partial sale of Delta Lloyd on Euronext Amsterdam 
with gross proceeds of £1 billion for a 42% stake. This was 
a significant strategic milestone in our management of Delta 
Lloyd and gives us further opportunity to reallocate capital 
within the group. 
The market environment in the Netherlands remained 
challenging, with weak asset values constraining activity in the 
corporate pensions market, before improving in the latter part 
of the year when Delta Lloyd secured two large group 
contracts. T otal sales in 2009 of £5,492 million were down 
18% reflecting the sale of the health business. IFRS operating 
profit for the year increased 29% to £399 million. These 
results are discussed in more detail on page 45 of this report. 
Delta Lloyd continues to offer innovative, high quality 
products backed by strong fund management performance. 
In June, in collaboration with Rabobank, Delta Lloyd launched 
a €200 million fund, which offers an alternative source of 
capital for this promising Dutch venture. 
In 2009, we successfully integrated the Swiss Life Belgium 
operation with our existing Belgian life operations. Belgium 
extended the ABN AMRO distribution arrangement to include 
Fortis branches when they are rebranded in 2010.

North America 
Poised to benefit 
from recovery 
in the world’s 
wealthiest market 
The North American marketplace provides us with access 
to a strategically attractive population with a growing 
demand for products that offer prosperity and peace 
of mind in both the general insurance and life and 
annuities marketplaces. 
Strategy 
We will continue to grow our existing businesses and raise 
our profile in North America on the back of the strength 
of the global brand, communicating with financial analysts, 
key financial and business media, consumers and distributors. 
Our strategic priorities for the region are: 
— to enhance capital efficiency and optimise margins 
— to selectively expand and grow our core life insurance 
and annuity distribution and product capabilities 
— to operate as a great underwriting company 
— to make best use of the synergies created within 
the regional operating model 
— to enhance strong and valuable relationships with 
our customers and distributors.

Market environment 
The US economy, and its financial sector in particular, suffered 
a severe contraction as a result of the financial crisis. The 
recession also had a major impact on Canada, the US’ s largest 
trading partner. There are now increasing signs of economic 
recovery and, despite the recession, North America’ s economies 
remain among the world’ s largest and its population among 
the world’ s wealthiest.

Jane knew that she 
could count on Sherri to 
encourage her to move 
forward: “I have never had 
a claim before, I didn’t know 
what to do and I wasn’t sure 
where to go. Sherri turned 
this around for me, she gave 
me strength, human kindness 
and dispelled any previous 
concepts I had about 
insurance companies.” 
She’ s now planning a trip to

Jane* has been an Aviva

divorced and on her own for 
the first time in a long time, 
she returned home one day 
to find she had been robbed. 
The break-in left her “scared

Sherri of Aviva’ s London, 
Ontario, office was assigned 
as Jane’ s adjuster. She herself 
had been a victim of a home

shock and fear that Jane was

Innovative pricing 
In the Canadian business we have successfully implemented 
an innovative approach to the pricing of personal property 
business known as ‘Rate by Peril’. We have used a detailed 
and sophisticated mapping approach combined with 
proprietary and public information to deconstruct the blended 
approach to pricing used for multi-peril household policies. 
Using this approach we are able to determine a unique rate 
for each individual property reflecting its unique exposure to 
the perils covered by the policy including fire, water damage, 
wind-storm, sewer back-up, theft and liability. The increased 
pricing precision that we are able to apply enables us to 
‘right-price‘ each property.

Performance 
T otal sales were £6,345 million in 2009, down 
13% on 2008. IFRS operating profit for the 
year improved 43% to £213 million reflecting 
the improved long-term and savings result.

In our US business we have deliberately 
moderated annuity sales in comparison to the prior 
year and centred on capital management. We have 
grown our life insurance portfolio, outperforming 
in a market that contracted by 19% in the first nine 
months of the year. 
In the Canadian business we have focused 
on initiatives that improve our operational and 
underwriting effectiveness. Examples include 
the implementation of our three-company model, 
enabling us to price the auto business in the heavily 
regulated Ontario market more accurately, and 
enhanced underwriting through the use of more 
standardised and automated processes. Elsewhere 
the Canadian business has seen an unusually high 
frequency of large losses through a combination of 
commercial fires and Ontario personal auto claims. 
‘ Life assurance outperforms 
in contracting market’ 
As part of the ‘One Aviva, T wice the Value’ strategy, 
we are consolidating each of our non-market-facing 
functions into single North American business areas 
giving us improved capability at lower cost. 
Outlook 
A number of economic indicators are starting to 
point to a steady recovery in 2010. We will continue 
to grow our life insurance portfolio in the US, 
building on 2009 successes. We await the outcome 
of the SEC151A debate concerning the future 
regulation of annuity products and will respond 
appropriately. In Canada we will further enhance 
our underwriting processes to improve risk 
selection, profitability and capital efficiency.

Asia Pacific 
Committed to 
building a high-
growth and value-
creating region 
We operate in eight countries across the Asia Pacific region 
through both joint ventures and wholly-owned operations. 
India and China, both with large populations and relatively 
high economic growth, are ‘must-win’ markets capable of 
generating a significant proportion of our future expansion 
within Asia. Throughout the rest of the region, our focus is 
on developing the strength of our bancassurance business 
with joint venture partners. 
Strategy 
Our ambition is to build a high-growth and value-creating 
region driven by the ‘must-win’ markets of China and 
India. We will achieve this by: 
— securing strong organic growth across all our markets 
— leveraging our multi-distribution platforms and core 
capabilities in bancassurance 
— exploring new growth opportunities, in particular 
health and general insurance 
— expanding our regional footprint in fast-growing, 
high potential insurance markets 
— investing in the Aviva brand.

Market environment 
Trading conditions were 
difficult in 2009. Long-term 
savings sales were affected 
by the economic climate 
as investors turned to low 
volatility investments such as 
bank deposits. The industry 
also experienced an increase 
in lapses and clients 
exercising their premium 
holiday options.

widely held belief in China 
that insurance generally is 
‘easy to buy, but hard to 
claim’ and is one that Aviva 
has been working hard to 
overcome. Since starting this 
project over five years ago, 
Aviva’ s health angels have 
not only made a positive 
impact in changing people’ s 
views about the insurance 
industry but have also 
improved customer loyalty, 
retention rates and helped 
to trigger repurchasing of 
products by customers.

Innovative approach to healthcare

China: Health angels lend 
a helping hand 
Jessica* admits that she had 
been very sceptical about 
making an insurance claim 
when a minor operation last 
year meant that she was 
unable to work for some 
weeks. With very little savings 
to fall back on, she was 
naturally anxious about how 
she would find the money to 
cover her everyday expenses. 
So she was pleasantly 
surprised when Aviva China 
sent their ‘health angels’ to 
visit her in hospital to provide 
a face-to-face medical 
consultation and to assist 
with her claim. Jessica’ s

Annual Review 2009 
Performance 
T otal sales were £2,712 million in 2009, down 22% 
on 2008. IFRS operating profit for the year improved 
114% to £77 million reflecting the improved long-
term and savings result. For full details of our financial 
reporting, please visit www.aviva.com/reports 
During 2009, customers’ increased caution has 
led to a growing demand for protection and health 
products and those savings products with guarantee 
features. We have strengthened our proposition in 
these areas which, together with our investment 
product capabilities, will enable us to harness the 
expected economic rebound. 
We made substantial efforts to conserve capital 
and control costs, reducing the sale of capital intensive 
products in Hong Kong, Malaysia and T aiwan and 
implementing a region-wide cost-reduction programme. 
The sale of our Australian business in October also 
realised a £0.4 billion contribution to capital. 
As part of our commitment to achieving ‘One 
Aviva, Twice the Value’, we launched a number of 
new initiatives in the region. These included our wrap 
platform in Hong Kong and new protection, savings 
and investment products, both conventional and 
takaful (Islamic insurance), in Malaysia through our 
shared services platform. 
‘ Opening up in new markets 
across the region’ 
We expanded our customer reach in local markets 
during the year with a particular focus on 
bancassurance, we renewed our partnership with 
DBS Bank in Singapore and Hong Kong until 2015, 
extended to additional markets in India, China and 
T aiwan, and also agreed extended terms with key 
partners in India. We opened our tenth provincial 
branch in China, ahead of our 2010 target; achieved 
encouraging sales through Woori Bank in South Korea 
and opened 13 new branches around the Seoul area. 
Outlook 
Looking forward, we expect recovery in Asia Pacific to 
be ahead of other regions. Prospects for 2010 are more 
optimistic with the Asia Development Bank predicting 
GDP growth of 6.6% for emerging Asia versus 4.3% 
in 2009. We are committed to building a high-growth 
and value-creating region and establishing Aviva as a 
leading international player in Asia.

Joint venture in Malaysia 
We signed a joint venture partner deal with CIMB, the second 
largest bank in Malaysia in 2007 , to capitalise on its distribution 
network by providing market leading insurance products and 
excellent servicing capability. T o achieve this we drew on our 
regional shared services capability and technical infrastructure 
in Singapore to deliver and administer the product set. We 
successfully launched a portfolio (EasyLife Solutions) of ten 
investment-linked products within a six-month timeframe. 
Sales of EasyLife Solutions have gone from strength to 
strength, contributing to our position as fourth in the 
industry for single premium business in 2009. This has also 
strengthened our partnership with CIMB at all levels.

focused on 
performance 
Aviva Investors combines the group’ s asset management 
components into a single, globally-integrated business. 
We manage internal funds for Aviva, as well as for a 
growing range of institutional and retail third party clients. 
Our focus on client service has brought external recognition 
and contributed to a strong performance in 2009. 
Strategy 
Our core strategic objective is to build our presence as 
a globally-integrated asset manager and establish Aviva 
Investors as a leading player in the market for retirement 
solutions. We aim to increase revenues and profitability by 
delivering significant growth in higher-margin assets under 
management from external clients. 
The key strategic imperatives central to our success are: 
— our commitment to client focus, delivering investment 
solutions that fully meet their requirements 
— delivering strong investment performance to underpin 
product sales activity 
— finalising the roll-out of a global business development 
function with a footprint in mature and emerging markets 
— a high performance culture that rewards those who 
make the strongest contribution to the achievement 
of our goals 
— further increases in business effectiveness and efficiency 
through the adoption of global core processes.

Market environment 
Following a turbulent start to 2009, market 
conditions improved with some markets registering 
their best annual performance in over 20 years. 
The pace of any further rally across markets is 
likely to be more modest with the uncertainty 
around central banks removing stimulus measures. 
Although some economies remain in recession, 
we remain optimistic that recovery will gather pace. 
However , Aviva Investors were 
not put off by this and really 
worked at it, coming up 
with a specific global credit 
mandate and setting out how 
it would be implemented. 
They really convinced our 
consultant and the trustees 
were also persuaded.”

A number of positive trends emerged to support 
our strategic objectives in 2009. Our focus on client 
service gained us improved rankings in UK-focused 
independent client service/investment performance 
surveys for investment quality. Investment 
performance was also an area of strength. Where 
clients have specified performance benchmarks, Aviva 
Investors has met or exceeded 83% of these over one 
year and 68% over three years, with particularly 
strong performance in France, Australia and Poland. 
We also generated record levels of performance fees. 
Our liquidity funds attracted strong inflows in 
France and the UK and from our continental European 
distribution channel through our SICAV range. In the 
UK, our Sterling Government Liquidity and Sterling 
Liquidity Funds gained Standard & Poor’ s highest 
possible ‘AAAm’ stability rating. 
We have made significant progress in developing 
a global marketing, sales and distribution capability, 
re-engineering our global business development 
function to facilitate sales to external clients and 
underpin our client-centric approach. This was enhanced 
by group-led PR and advertising for the global rebrand, 
which helped to cement trust in, and recognition of, the 
Aviva name in both established and new markets and by 
our own marketing efforts which helped to raise Aviva 
Investors’ profile in a competitive market. 
Aviva Investors also received a number of external 
accolades in Austria, Singapore, Australia and the UK. 
In November we were proud to work alongside the 
United Nations for the launch of their report on 
‘sustainable stock exchanges’, a programme that is 
continuing in 2010. 
‘ New business model comes 
together in 2009’ 
Outlook 
Since Aviva Investors launched in September 2008 we 
have made strong progress. The loss of confidence in 
financial markets has meant that clients are increasingly 
looking for risk-aware investment options and, as an 
insurance-owned asset manager, we are well placed to 
capitalise on that trend. We look forward to 2010 with 
confidence and anticipation.

First Securities Investment Trust (FSITC) is a leading asset 
manager, marketing investment products to customers in 
T aiwan. In 2009, we won a mandate to handle a new global 
high yield product through our high yield investment team in 
North America. We supported the local Aviva Investors team 
in T aiwan and managed FSITC’ s successful initial offering. 
As a follow-up, we initiated a customer survey to ensure 
that issues and insights from FSITC were captured and acted 
upon. Despite the significant commercial success of the new 
launch the survey uncovered some concerns and a need for 
improvement on operations and communications. 
We were able to act quickly and decisively to resolve 
these concerns. FSITC’ s response was very positive: our actions 
had shown that we had listened to their feedback at a senior 
level, creating a much stronger relationship.

in reducing costs. 
The Aviva CR programme encompasses our

Business ethics and financial crime 
We aspire to the highest standards of conduct and set out our 
principles in our business ethics code. This stipulates fairness, 
honesty and transparency in all we do. Our financial crime 
policy reinforces our zero tolerance approach and ensures that 
risks relating to fraud, money laundering, market abuse and 
bribery and corruption are adequately controlled. 
People 
Delivering on our strategic plans and commitments requires 
strong leadership and the energy, dedication and belief of 
all our employees. Over the past three years, we have built 
a strong global human resources function to lead our culture 
transformation. We have a clear purpose: to drive a talent 
leadership and culture-led transformation to deliver 
exceptional business performance. 
Diversity, equality and human rights 
Aviva’ s principles and policies embody the key tenets of respect, 
valuing differences and inclusion and are aligned with the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNUDHR) and 
International Labour Organisation’ s core labour standards. 
Community 
In 2009 we invested £8.0 million (2008: £9.6 million) in line 
with our strategic focus to support community and charitable 
initiatives in education, life trauma and financial literacy. We 
launched ‘Street to School’, our five-year global charitable 
initiative which aims to get children and young people off 
the street and into education. 
Employee volunteering in support of these areas is 
encouraged as part of their personal development. Our people 
can apply for up to three days’ paid leave per year, as well 
joining company-led programmes. 
Environment 
Our established and proven strategy focuses on controlling our 
own impacts and resources, including gas, water, electricity and 
waste – and by pursuing this long-term policy we have reduced 
our carbon emissions by a further 5.2% this year, on a

Notes on KPIs 
— Business ethics: This KPI covers 98% of our employees. 
— 	Customers: Using our NPS methodology, 67% of businesses met or exceed performance last year against a local market average (2008: 67%). However, within that percentage, 
24 markets are participating in NPS compared to 12 in 2008 and 58% are exceeding the benchmark, compared to 33% in 2008. 
— 	Last year we reported the percentage of businesses that met/exceeded performance against local market average where no local benchmark was available (2009: 75%). Businesses 
that were covered by this metric are now all rated against a local market average. This metric has therefore been removed. Also in 2009, we replaced an employee survey question 
relating to the percentage of employees who consider that their business is customer focused with a new customer index KPI. This gives an average favourable employee response 
against five customer indicators. 
— 	Environment: We want to show clearly that we have reduced our emissions as a result of energy management and behavioural change and not merely due to divestments. The KPI 
for ‘Actual emissions’ are absolute emissions for total Aviva operations in each year stated while the KPI with ‘emissions based on 2009 ownership’ show our emissions over the last 
two years based on operations that we have in 2009 allowing for a like-for-like comparison. Water has been restated following an independent review of Aviva Canada’s water 
consumption between 2006 and 2008. This has increased the overall Group consumption figures. 
— 	People: Current and historical data for women in senior management excludes Delta Lloyd group. We also report KPIs relating to employee engagement. These can be found in our 
on-line CR Report: www.aviva.com/corporate-responsibility/reports 
— 	Suppliers: We adjusted our 2009 target and 2008 return for the number of business unit suppliers signing Aviva’s Supplier Code of Conduct due to a statement of compliance from 
our business in North America which could not be validated by Group Procurement. 
— Community: These KPIs cover all Aviva employees and Aviva joint venture employees.

Aviva plc 
Annual Review 2009 
Summary financial statements 
These statements are aimed at giving shareholders a summary 
of the position and performance of Aviva. They do not 
however, contain all the information to allow as complete 
an understanding of the group as would be provided by the 
full audited Annual Report and Accounts. 
The auditor has issued unqualified reports on the full 
annual financial statements, the auditable part of the directors’ 
remuneration report and on the consistency of the directors’ 
report with those annual financial statements. Their report on 
the full annual financial statements and the auditable part of 
the directors’ remuneration report contained no statement 
under sections 498(2) or 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
A copy of the full Annual Report and Accounts is 
available on the Aviva internet site at www.aviva.com/reports 
or free of charge from Equiniti, at the address at the end of 
this document. 
2009 financial statements 
The summary financial statements on page 32 and 33 have 
been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out in the 
Aviva Group’ s (the Group) 2009 Annual Report and Accounts. 
The consolidated income statement has been presented on 
both a Market Consistent Embedded Value (MCEV) basis and 
an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) basis. 
The Group continues to believe that the MCEV basis provides 
a useful measure of the performance of the life business 
alongside the statutory IFRS basis. Results of an insurance 
business in any particular year can be affected by significant 
movements in investment values, which influence the reported 
profits before tax. Therefore, to measure the underlying 
business performance, operating profit before tax based on 
longer term rates of investment return is used, eliminating 
the volatility caused by movements in investment values. 
As a result, managers are encouraged to focus on operational 
performance and aspects of the business that are under 
their control. 
Summarised directors’ report 
Annual general meeting 
The 2010 Annual General Meeting of the Company will be

year of 24.00 pence per share (2008: 33.00 pence). The total 
cost of ordinary dividends paid in 2009, was £775 million 
(2008: £902 million). The final dividend for 2009 will be paid

Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements 
At no time during the year did any director hold a material 
interest in any contract of significance with the Company 
or any of its subsidiary undertakings other than an indemnity 
provision between each director and the Company and 
service contracts between each executive director and a 
Group company. 
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout 
the year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of 
itself and its directors. The directors also have the benefit of 
the indemnity provision contained in the Company’ s Articles 
of Association. The Company has executed deeds of indemnity 
for the benefit of each director of the Company, and each 
person who was a director of the Company during the year, 
in respect of liabilities that may attach to them in their capacity 
as directors of the Company or of associated companies. 
These indemnities were granted at different times according 
to the law in place at the time and where relevant are 
qualifying third-party indemnity provisions as defined by 
Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. These indemnities 
were in force throughout the year and are currently in force.

Aviva plc 
Annual Review 2009 
Summary remuneration report 
— Andrea Moneta, Chief Executive Officer, Aviva Europe, 
Middle East and Africa, was appointed an ED of Aviva plc 
on 29 September 2009. Information on his remuneration 
therefore appears in this report for the first time. 
— On 1 January 2010, Mark Hodges was appointed Chief 
Executive Officer of the whole of Aviva’ s UK insurance 
operations, which brought together Aviva’ s life and 
general insurance businesses. As a result of this significant 
expansion of his managerial responsibilities, his basic 
salary was increased. 
— On 26 January 2010, Philip Scott retired from the Board. 
He continues to be employed by the Group and will retire 
on 31 July 2010. Further details of his leaving arrangements 
are disclosed in the full Annual Report and Accounts. 
— Patrick Regan joined Aviva as the new Chief Financial 
Officer on 22 February 2010. His joining arrangements 
and on-going annual remuneration are disclosed in the 
full Annual Report and Accounts. 
Remuneration policy 
The Committee’ s key objectives are to: 
— Establish a competitive remuneration package to attract, 
retain and motivate high quality leaders; 
— Promote the achievement of both the Company’ s annual 
plans and its strategic objectives by providing a remuneration 
package that contains appropriately motivating targets that 
are within the Group’ s risk appetite; and 
— Align senior executives’ remuneration with the interests of 
shareholders and other stakeholders, including customers 
and employees. 
The remuneration package 
Against this background, the Committee seeks to ensure that 
whilst a competitive basic salary is paid, a substantial element 
of the remuneration package should be closely linked to the 
performance of the business and delivered in the form of 
shares. During 2009, the remuneration package for the 
Company’ s EDs comprised the following elements: 
— A basic salary. 
— An annual bonus plan (ABP) to encourage executives to 
meet annual targets relating to business and agreed 
personal performance targets. Two-thirds of any bonus is 
paid in the form of shares and deferred for three years. 
— A One Aviva Twice The Value (OATTV) Plan to align senior 
executives with the Group Chief Executive’ s clear strategic 
imperative of doubling earnings per share by the end of 
2012. The plan matches 100% of the deferred ABP shares 
for the Group Chief Executive (75% for other EDs). For the 
2009 awards, the vesting of these matched shares is 
dependent on the achievement of 49.2 pence per share 
and then compounded annual growth targets. 
— A Long T erm Incentive Plan (LTIP) to align executives’ longer 
term interests with those of shareholders. 
— A pension entitlement, although no ED is currently accruing 
service based benefits in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme. 
— A long term discretionary savings plan called the Aviva 
Capital Accumulation Plan (ACAP), used primarily for 
employees who can no longer accrue pension benefits 
or whose benefits are restricted under the Aviva Staff 
Pension Scheme. 
— A car allowance, private medical insurance and 
participation in the Company’ s all employee share plans. 
Annual bonuses have targets set against a range of financial, 
customer and employee metrics, accounting for 70% of the 
bonus opportunity, with personal objectives accounting for 
the remaining 30%. 
Awards granted under the LTIP are subject to meeting 
performance conditions based on relative T otal Shareholder 
Return (TSR) and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) targets. 
The TSR performance conditions require Aviva to achieve 
median or better performance against the TSR of a peer group 
of major European financial services companies over the three 
year performance period for that element to vest. RoCE 
targets are set taking account of the Company’ s three year 
business plan and are set on a Market Consistent Embedded 
Value basis.

All EDs have a service contract which can be terminated by 
the Company upon giving 12 months’ notice. Non executive 
appointments can be terminated by either party at any time 
upon giving one month’ s written notice. 
Future actions and changes 
The Company does not anticipate any significant changes 
to the structure of EDs’ remuneration packages in 2010, 
compared with that outlined below. There are, however, 
three points to note: 
— 2009 has seen a series of regulatory and governance 
guidelines issued by organisations such as the Financial 
Services Authority and the Financial Stability Board of 
the G20. Whilst many of the issued guidelines do not 
yet formally apply to Aviva, the Company has already 
reviewed its existing remuneration arrangements against 
these provisions.

Aviva plc 
Summary remuneration report continued 
Annual Review 2009 
— UK personal tax changes, effective April 2010, will create 
a significantly different tax position for some employees. 
Due to the relatively large deferral of senior manager 
remuneration, it is the Company’ s view that they will 
be penalised more than their industry counterparts. 
The Company, therefore, has made available the option 
for these employees to receive deferred ABP awards as 
restricted stock. Any potential cost to the Company is 
judged to be minimal. In addition, the 2010 LTIP grant 
will be underpinned by an approved share option grant. 
This will have no additional cost to the Company. These 
changes have been discussed with Her Majesty’ s Revenue 
and Customs before being implemented. 
— The Company is required every five years to seek 
shareholder approval for the operation of its share based 
incentive plans. It was agreed in 2008 that the review 
would be delayed by 12 months from 2009 to 2010 to 
enable Aviva to reflect on the new regulatory and 
governance requirements that emerge from the global 
financial crisis and to put new proposals to shareholders 
in 2011. 
2009 awards 
In addition to the remuneration set out in the table below, 
the following shares were awarded to EDs in 2009 under 
the Company’ s share incentive plans. The shares granted 
under the LTIP will only vest if certain conditions relating to 
the Company’ s performance over the three financial years 
commencing 1 January 2009 are met, as explained previously.

Notes 
1. Bonuses show the value at the date of award inclusive of the two-thirds of bonus which Aviva requires its EDs to defer into Aviva shares for three years. 
2. ‘Benefits’. All the EDs received life assurance benefits during the year that relate to the cost incurred by the Company of insuring the directors’ life and relevant spouses’ benefits which, 
had the director died during the year, could not have been wholly paid by the pension scheme and would therefore have been met by the Company had the insurance not been in place. 
The disclosure also includes the cost of private medical insurance and, where appropriate, accompanied travel, accommodation and car benefits. All the numbers disclosed include the 
tax charged on the benefits. No directors received an expense allowance during the year. 
3. Figures shown for Mr Moneta have been converted from Euro to Pound Sterling at the average exchange rate for 2009 of €1.12297 : £1.00. Further details of Mr Moneta’s benefits 
are contained in the full Annual Report and Accounts. The grossed element for schooling and housing as outlined in the full Annual Report and Accounts will be delivered in 2010. 
4. For the purposes of the disclosure required by Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006, the total aggregate emoluments of the directors in respect of 2009 was £6.7 million 
(2008: £5.2 million). 
5. No compensation payment for loss of office was made to any director, or former director, during the year. 
6. Annual bonuses are one-third paid in cash and two-thirds deferred into shares for three years.

Shareholder services continued 
Annual Review 2009 
Be on your guard – beware of fraudsters 
In recent years, many companies have become aware 
that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls 
or correspondence concerning investment matters. These 
are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to 
be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments. 
These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’. 
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers 
of free company reports. If you receive any unsolicited advice: 
— Make sure you get the correct name of the person and 
organisation 
— Check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before 
getting involved by visiting www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ 
— Report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0300 500 
5000 (calls should cost no more than 01 or 02 UK-wide 
calls, and are included in inclusive mobile and landline 
minutes). If calling from overseas, please dial +44 20 7066 
1000 or visit www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk 
— If the calls persist, hang up. 
More detailed information on this can be found on the FSA 
website www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk

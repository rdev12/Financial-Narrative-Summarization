 It’s all adding up
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:48  Page FC1 We are fast realising our goal of becoming a self-sustaining
specialty pharmaceuticals company.
Through the acquisition of Protherics, we have added
marketed products, manufacturing capabilities and we 
have strengthened our team and pipeline. The integration 
is going well and is already delivering on financial and
operational objectives.
Our finances are in good shape. We have a strong cash
position and substantial revenues, and we are on track 
to achieve planned cost savings. We can confidently 
continue to build value in our pipeline, add new products 
and expand our US commercial operations.
It’s all beginning to add up at BTG.

We strengthened our 
business model…
Four years ago we began transforming BTG’s business. We focused
on investing in our development pipeline, we exited non-core
activities and we reduced our cost base. The acquisition of
Protherics in December 2008 has further strengthened our business.
We have added sales revenues to our royalties and gained 
new capabilities, including a polyclonal manufacturing platform. 
We have the opportunity to sell our own products and to become 
a successful specialty pharmaceuticals company.

…and created a strategy to
deliver sustainable profitability
To deliver sustainable profitability we are pursuing three medium-
term goals. The first is to establish US commercial operations to sell
products to specialist hospital-based physicians. These products
include our critical care products CroFab™ and DigiFab™, to which
we regain US marketing rights in 2010. Second, to maximise returns
on this investment we plan to acquire additional products to develop
and market to US hospital specialists. The third goal is to generate
additional revenues by building value in and commercialising our
current development pipeline.
Priorities
for 2009/10
Progress preparations for establishing a US hospital sales
force in preparation for selling CroFab™, DigiFab™ and 
additional products

…and we are reducing costs
We are generating substantial cost savings and synergies following
the acquisition of Protherics. Savings have come from achieving
efficiencies in manufacturing operations, closing or merging 
a number of offices, and from eliminating duplicated functions. 
By 2010/11, we aim to reduce overhead costs by £10m. In addition,
we are targeting reducing R&D investment by £10m from 2010/11.

We are investing
in our own pipeline…
Our pipeline (see pages 26 and 27) is our engine for growth.
Currently, we have eight clinical programmes targeting cancer,
neurological and other disorders. We plan to take most of these
through studies to show safety and efficacy, then to seek partners
to complete development and commercialisation. Going forward,
we intend to add to our pipeline, with a focus on later-stage
programmes that we can sell through our planned US hospital 
sales force.
Replenish
In future, we intend to acquire programmes 
we can develop and potentially market ourselves
Commercialise
Most programmes in our current pipeline are 
out-licensing candidates. We will look for the right
partner for each programme as it approaches 
the appropriate milestone
Develop
Our development programmes are designed both
to establish early safety and efﬁcacy signals and
with the optimum regulatory pathway in mind
Acquire
We do not conduct basic research but instead 
in-license or acquire assets that meet strict 
technical and commercial criteria
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 12 13/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
…and will share in the success
of our partnered programmes
We have a strong partnered pipeline (see pages 28 and 29) and 
a track record in finding the right partners to take programmes
forward. We expect this pipeline to grow, as current internal pipeline
programmes are partnered. After this time, our partners are
responsible for completing development and commercialisation,
and we expect to receive milestone payments and a share of
royalties if the products successfully reach the market.

Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
We have created the platform
to build a successful specialty
pharmaceuticals company .
I am delighted that the acquisition of
Protherics PLC, which was completed 
in December 2008, received such
overwhelming support from both 
sets of shareholders. I believe that 
the enlarged Group has the resources,
capabilities, scale and strategy 
to become a sustainably profitable
specialty pharmaceuticals company.
Progress with integrating the
businesses has been rapid. By March, 
we had made key decisions about the
pipeline, personnel and sites and so
we were ready to start the new financial
year with clarity on goals, roles and
responsibilities. 
Results for the year
The reported financial results for the year show
strong underlying financial performance with 
organic growth from our recurring revenues and 
cash of £78.2m at the year-end. 
Revenues of £84.8m (07/08: £75.0m)
included £13.4m from new lines of business acquired
following the acquisition of Protherics. Gross profit
after revenue sharing and cost of sales increased 
by 11.2% to £47.7m (07/08: £42.9m). Total operating
expenses increased during the year as we included
the costs of the expanded BTG operations in the UK,
Australia and the United States. Operating profit
before acquisition adjustments and reorganisation
costs was £7.0m (07/08: £16.6m). After providing for
the costs of reorganisation and making acquisition
adjustments, the operating loss for the year was
£9.2m (07/08: £8.5m profit). We ended the year 
with a loss after tax of £13.1m (07/08: £8.8m profit)
delivering a loss per share of 7.1p (07/08: earnings
per share of 5.9p).
The acquisition of Protherics has provided 
BTG with the opportunity to build a profitable specialty
pharmaceuticals business. We are working quickly 
to leverage the underpinning strength of our revenue
streams and to drive the cost savings from integration.
Our strong financial position provides an excellent
platform for us to grow as well as stability in the
current uncertain economic climate.
Board changes
Christine Soden, who joined BTG in July 2005 as Chief
Financial Officer and became Chief Operating Officer
following the acquisition of Protherics, retired from 
the Board on 31 March 2009 and leaves BTG in June
2009. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank
Christine for her many contributions to the company’s
strategic, financial and operational development. 
We wish her well for the future.
Rolf Soderstrom, former Protherics Financial
Director, joined BTG as Chief Financial Officer
following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December
2008. He is a strong addition to the Board and has
already played a major role in integrating the
business and getting it on track to achieve the
planned cost savings.
We are pleased that Jim O’Shea joined us as
a non-executive director on 2 April 2009. He brings
significant industry experience from his previous roles
at Sepracor and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals that will be
valuable as we build our US commercial operations.
Outlook
We anticipate continued good performance in 
our underlying business. Our revenues derive from 
a broad range of products, many of which serve
critical medical needs. Having taken key decisions 
on restructuring, we are on track to reduce operating
expenses by £10m by the end of the 2010/11 financial
year. In addition, having completed our portfolio
review, we anticipate that research and development
expenses will reduce as planned by £10m by 2010/11.
I would like to thank our management 
and employees, including those newly joined from
Protherics, who have worked very hard and shown
professionalism and commitment as we have
integrated the businesses. I believe that we have 
the team, resources and strategy to continue our
transformation into a sustainably profitable specialty
pharmaceuticals business.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Chief Executive Officer’s review
We have a clear strategy
for growth.
Q: How do you see BTG’s business
developing?
Our growth strategy has three components.
The first is to build commercial operations 
in the US, enabling us to sell CroFab™ and
DigiFab™ to hospital-based critical care
physicians when sales rights return in 2010.
Second, to leverage these operations we
intend to acquire additional products to sell
to US hospital specialists. The third part is 
to continue to invest in our pipeline to build
value. We will seek to partner most of our
current development programmes in return
for milestones and a royalty on sales. 
Future pipeline additions will be focused 
on products we can sell ourselves.
Q: What makes the specialty
pharmaceuticals sector attractive?
It provides niche products to specialist
physicians, who are generally accessed
through small sales forces supported by 
one back office. Products are often used 
in critical situations, so appropriate pricing
and reimbursement is usually achievable.
Competition is often limited because of
the niche status of products, and product
lifecycles can be long. While products 
may not often have blockbuster potential,
margins are good. Also, the model is readily
scaled, so the addition of new products can
improve revenues and margins for modest
incremental investment.
Q: What are the key challenges 
in the year ahead?
The main challenges relate to implementing
our growth plans – so they are really
opportunities. The first is our goal of
establishing a US hospital sales force. This 
is obviously much more than just putting
sales reps on the ground – it’s about
establishing the infrastructure to support 
a professional sales operation. We have 
the financial resources this requires, and 
we have strengthened our team with
experienced people to ensure we do it 
right. Another challenge is to acquire new
products that we can develop and sell. 
We have the resources and capabilities, and
the current economic climate means there
are good opportunities out there, but we
have to choose carefully. Finally, a number 
of programmes in the internal and partnered
pipelines will soon reach key decision points
and choices will need to be made in relation
to further development activities.
Q: How competitive is the market for
acquiring later-stage programmes?
There is always competition for good
programmes and products. BTG has
substantial financial resources and we have
strengthened our late-stage development
capabilities, so we are in a good position to
compete for the sorts of products we want 
to acquire. Our focus is on products we can
sell through the planned US hospital sales
force, which is another attraction to licensors,
and we are prepared to complete late-stage
development or to take on products that are
already approved or marketed.

Performance against 08/09 priorities
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 22 23/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s review
Q: Is the risk profile of the business
increasing by moving into later-stage
development, manufacturing and sales?
By acquiring later-stage products,
development risks may actually be lower 
as more safety and efficacy data have
already been generated. Access and
development costs are generally higher
for later-stage assets, but product selection
plays an important role. We plan to take 
on programmes only where there is a clear
and affordable development pathway.
Manufacturing adds complexity, though 
we believe our polyclonal antibody
manufacturing platform is among the 
most advanced in the industry, and has
the potential to generate additional value
beyond the current products it supports.
Selling products adds a layer 
of commercial risk, but also provides the
opportunity to retain much more of a
product’s value than out-licensing. CroFab™
and DigiFab™ are established products, 
so launch risks are eliminated. Throughout
the business, we operate a sophisticated
risk management programme and have
appropriate mitigating activities in place. 
Q: Are other corporate acquisitions 
a possibility?
The Protherics acquisition has given us 
the means to address many of the growth
challenges we faced. It brings established
marketed products, smoothing our revenues
through 2011 and adding higher product
margins to our royalty revenues. Together,
we are more efficient and we have the
resources and capabilities to get value from
the combined pipeline, to establish US
commercial operations and to acquire
additional, later-stage products to feed 
into the planned hospital sales force.
We have to be flexible and ready 
to respond to opportunities. To strengthen
our pipeline we have to license or acquire
products. We will always first make sure the
product fits our strategy and then find the
best way to bring it in. If the best way to do
that is to acquire a company we will do so 
if it makes financial and strategic sense.
Q: What is the outlook for the business 
over the next two-to-three years?
The next few years will be busy and I’m 
sure there will be challenges we don’t yet
know about, but I believe we’re in great
shape to deliver on our plan to become 
a sustainably profitable specialty
pharmaceuticals company. I feel very
confident about our future.

We report good progress 
in development and in our
underlying financial performance.
Overview
BTG’s business is the development and
commercialisation of new and improved medicines
that meet the needs of patients and physicians. 
Our focus is on niche products that are prescribed 
by specialist physicians in the hospital setting, often
to treat relatively rare, serious disorders.
Core activities of the Group are:
• identifying and acquiring promising drug
programmes and marketed products from other
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies
• developing the programmes to show efficacy 
and safety in target disease indications
• commercialising the programmes, either by
partnering with other companies to complete
development and market the products or by 
taking them to market ourselves
• manufacturing of polyclonal antibodies.
We do not conduct basic research but instead license
or acquire programmes from biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Our in-house
professionals design and manage development
programmes, with input from external scientific
advisers as required, and conduct development
activities through networks of external contract
research organisations.
Our current internal development pipeline
comprises programmes targeting oncology,
neurological and other disorders. We plan to take
most of these programmes through Phase IIa or IIb
proof of concept studies; if they demonstrate positive
efficacy and safety data, we intend to find partners 
to complete development and commercialise the
programmes.
Most programmes in our current pipeline
should reach data and commercialisation points over
the coming two years. When licensing programmes,
we seek fair returns on investment and product
success by negotiating upfront, development and
commercial milestones, together with a royalty on
sales. For polyclonal antibody products, we may also
enter into manufacture and supply agreements in
return for an additional royalty on sales. Currently
there are eight programmes under clinical stage
development by partners.
Going forward, our focus is on acquiring
later-stage programmes that we can develop and
market ourselves in the US.
A major focus for the Group during the
current year is to establish commercial operations 
in the US in preparation for the contractual return 
of rights to CroFab™ and DigiFab™. These are
established, approved critical care products that 
we manufacture and are currently marketed by
Nycomed in the US. We intend to sell these and other
suitable products we are able to acquire ourselves.
The Group’s current revenues are principally
royalties from marketed products we have licensed to
other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies
and sales revenues from CroFab™ and DigiFab™.
Other revenues include milestones when licensees
successfully progress products still in development

OncoGel™
A reformulation of paclitaxel designed to provide
high concentrations of the agent at the tumour
site, OncoGel™ is being investigated in a 
Phase IIb study in 124 patients with oesophageal
cancer. Preliminary data are anticipated in 
H2 2010, with survival data in H1 2011.
ATV
The Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine stimulates
production of antibodies to angiotensin I, a
hormone involved in the regulation of blood
pressure. Dosing was halted in a Phase II study,
and a new study is planned to explore different
doses of the adjuvant, CoVaccine HT™.
Acadra™
A Phase I/II study is under way to investigate
Acadra™ (acadesine) in up to 30 patients with
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Although its mechanism of action is not yet fully
understood, acadesine has been shown to
induce B-cell death with little effect on T-cells
ex vivo in samples taken from healthy volunteers
and patients with B-cell CLL.
BGC20-0134
BGC20-0134 is an orally administered structured
lipid in development for the treatment of multiple
sclerosis. It is designed to restore the balance
between pro-inﬂammatory and anti-
inﬂammatory cytokines implicated in the 
pathogenesis of the disease.

CB7630 (abiraterone acetate)
By reducing testosterone levels in the testes
and adrenals, through inhibition of a key enzyme
involved in testosterone production, CB7630
may inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells.

core IP acquired some years ago when the Group
had interests in physical science and other
technologies.
A share of the royalty revenues and certain
milestones we currently earn is paid to the originators
from which BTG acquired the relevant technology.
Key performance indicators
The Board uses a number of performance indicators
to monitor progress against the Group’s strategy.
These include financial and non-financial metrics. 
The key financial metrics used are EBITDA and cash
flow from operations. Non-financial objectives 
include progress in establishing US commercial
operations, achieving development and
manufacturing project milestones, and in-licensing
and out-licensing activities.
Pipeline progress
Following the acquisition of Protherics, we completed
a detailed review of the enlarged portfolio, assessing
programmes in relation to the development pathway
and associated investment, technical risks, time to
market, competitive landscape, potential returns and
strategic fit. The Group’s current internal development
pipeline, shown on pages 26 and 27, comprises 
eight programmes in clinical development.
Voraxaze™ is an investigational new drug that is not
approved in any indication but is currently available 
in the US under a Treatment Protocol and cost
recovery programme for patients receiving high dose
methotrexate (≥1g/m
2
) who are experiencing, or at risk
of, methotrexate toxicity. Voraxaze™ is progressing
through a rolling Biologics Licence Application in 
the US, and we plan to market Voraxaze™ in the 
US ourselves if the product is approved. 
Varisolve
®
, the investigational endovenous
microfoam therapy for varicose veins, successfully
completed a Phase II safety study and is progressing
towards pivotal Phase III trials in the US. In parallel,
discussions are progressing with potential
commercial partners. These discussions, and the
requirements and costs of the Phase III trials, product
registration and launch, will inform BTG’s decisions 
on the future technical and commercial development
of the programme.
OncoGel™, a sustained-release formulation of 
the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel, is progressing
through a Phase IIb study in patients with
oesophageal cancer. Preliminary data are anticipated
in H2 2010 and survival data in H1 2011.
Prolarix™, the prodrug tretazicar co-administered
with the co-substrate caricotamide, is being studied
in 20 patients with inoperable liver cancer in a 
Phase IIa study, which is anticipated to report in 2010.

Acadra™ (acadesine) is progressing through 
a Phase I/II study in patients with B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, with results anticipated 
in H1 2011.
BGC20-1531, an EP4 receptor antagonist targeting the
treatment of migraine headaches, showed promising
analgesic-like activity in an experimental pain study
and is expected to commence a Phase IIa study early
in H2 2009 with data anticipated in H2 2010.
BGC20-0134, a novel structured lipid, is anticipated to
start a Phase IIa study in H2 2009 as an oral treatment
for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
The study is expected to finish in 2011.
ATV, the Angiotensin Therapeutic Vaccine, was
progressing through a Phase IIa study but dosing
was suspended In April 2009 as a precaution
following several injection site reactions and ‘flu-like’
symptoms in patients. Data were reviewed from all
patients dosed, and preliminary safety conclusions
are that there were no differences between the
treatment and control groups. The adverse events
were therefore most likely related to the adjuvant
rather than the vaccine.
Although the sample size was low and
statistical significance could not be achieved in 
some measurements, the preliminary data were
encouraging in relation to differences observed
between ATV and control groups in respect of
antibody response and other measures. BTG plans 
to initiate a new Phase IIa study which will explore
different doses of adjuvant.
As a result of the portfolio review, we decided not to
conduct further in-house development of a number
of programmes including Digoxin Immune Fab for
severe pre-eclampsia, BGC20-1259 for Alzheimer’s
disease, BGC20-0582 for head lice infestation 
and BGC20-0166 for obstructive sleep apnoea.
Where possible we will seek partners to continue
development of these and other programmes 
not under active development. If partners cannot 
be found, or where we believe the technical 
or commercial barriers are too high to make
programmes attractive to potential partners, 
we will seek to return the assets to the originators.
Partnered programmes
There has been very good progress in programmes
partnered with other pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies.
Enrolment of patients with active relapsing-
remitting multiple sclerosis has completed in a Phase
III trial of Campath
®
(alemtuzumab), which is under
development by Genzyme Corporation. Enrolment
into a second Phase III trial is expected to finish by 
the end of 2009. Data from the trials are expected 
in 2011, with approval potentially in 2012.
Cougar Biotechnology, Inc. commenced a second
Phase III trial of CB7630 (abiraterone acetate) in
patients with chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). The co-primary endpoints 
of the trial are progression-free survival and overall
survival. Cougar plans to use the progression-free
survival data as the basis for submission of a New
Drug Application and a Marketing Authorisation
Application for Accelerated and Conditional Approval
from regulatory agencies.
Tolerx, Inc. initiated a Phase III trial of TRX4
in patients with autoimmune new-onset type 1
diabetes. Recruitment of European patients
commenced in March 2009, and the study is now
actively recruiting patients in the US, Canada,
Sweden, Finland, Italy, Germany and the UK. Tolerx
has a worldwide collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline
to develop and commercialise TRX4 in a range of
autoimmune disorders.
A Phase II study of CytoFab™, a polyclonal
antibody that neutralises TNF-α and is under
development by AstraZeneca for severe sepsis, 
has made good progress and is expected to finish
around mid-2009.
A Phase I safety study commenced 
in April 2009 of Nexvax 2, a novel vaccine under
development by Nexpep Pty Ltd for coeliac disease.
Key partnered programmes are shown in
the pipeline on pages 28 and 29. 
Financial review
On 4 December 2008, BTG completed the acquisition
of Protherics PLC for £171.3m funded through the
issue of 104m BTG shares. The acquisition of
Protherics added revenues from the sales of its
marketed products, CroFab™ and DigiFab™,
supplemented by named patient sales and cost
recovery from Voraxaze™. The R&D pipeline has
been broadened by the addition of Protherics
development programmes and our partnered
programmes have expanded to include CytoFab™,
which is partnered with AstraZeneca.
The financial statements include the results 
of the Protherics business for the period from
4 December 2008 to 31 March 2009 as well as the
results of the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired and reorganisation costs. For comparative
purposes only we have included as an appendix 
to the accounts, unaudited pro forma consolidated
income statements which have been extracted from
the books and records of BTG plc and Protherics PLC
combining the results of both companies for the 
years ended 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008.
BTG’s overall financial performance was
strong, with organic growth in recurring royalties and
sales revenues. The reported results have benefited
from the retranslation of US$ revenue at more
favourable rates. The average exchange rate for the
US$/£ was $1.69 (07/08: $1.98). The Group ended the
financial year with a healthy cash position of £78.2m.
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 31 32/

Business review
Revenue
Revenue increased by 13.1% to £84.8m (07/08:
£75.0m). Recurring royalties grew by 30.4% to
£55.3m (07/08: £42.4m). BTG continues to benefit
from out-licensing its technology and received 
£16.1m (07/08: £32.6m) in non-recurring revenues. 
In addition, we have benefited from revenues 
of £13.4m following the acquisition of Protherics.
We have seen good organic growth 
in recurring royalties underpinned by a strong
performance from BeneFIX
®
, the treatment for
haemophilia B, marketed by Wyeth, at £24.7m 
(07/08: £16.9m). The two-part hip cup continues 
to show steady growth with royalties of £10.3m
(07/08: £8.5m). At constant currency, US$
denominated recurring royalties were 13% higher
than in the prior year.
Non-recurring revenues included milestones
totalling £5.9m gross (£3.0m net) from Cougar
Biotechnology and Tolerx, following initiation of 
Phase III clinical studies of CB7630 and TRX4, and
£8.0m gross (£7.3m net) from licensing BGC 945 
to Onyx Pharmaceuticals. The prior year’s non-
recurring revenues of £32.6m included two significant
contributions: £22.4m ($44m) gross from licensing
the semiconductor chip memory capacity patents
and a £4.9m ($10m) gross milestone from Tolerx.
Between 4 December 2008 and 31 March
2009, CroFab™ sales revenues were £9.2m,
DigiFab™ sales revenues were £2.2m and
Voraxaze™ generated £1.0m from named patient
sales and cost recovery.
From the pro forma accounts, in the full year
to 31 March 2009, total revenues from the Protherics
business were £32.3m (07/08: £26.1m). Revenues
from CroFab™ were £20.6m (07/08: £15.7m).
DigiFab™ revenues were £5.5m (07/08: £4.8m) 
and Voraxaze™ delivered £2.9m (07/08: £2.8m)
from named patient sales and cost recovery. As the
majority of the Protherics revenues are denominated
in US$, the results have benefited from favourable
US$ exchange translation. Organic sales growth
for these products in US$ was approximately 8%.
Other revenues from Protherics, including revenue
recognition of milestones received in prior periods
under the CytoFab™ contract, totalled £3.3m 
(07/08: £2.8m).
Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 11.1% to £47.7m (07/08:
£42.9m), delivering a gross margin of 56.3% (07/08:
57.2%). Revenue sharing was £23.2m (07/08: £17.5m)
on recurring royalties resulting in net recurring
royalties of £32.1m (07/08: £24.9m). Revenue 
sharing on non-recurring royalties was £5.1m (07/08:
£14.6m) resulting in net non-recurring revenues 
of £11.0m (07/08: £18.0m). The cost of sales relating
to the £13.4m post-acquisition revenues was £8.8m,
including a non-cash fair value adjustment of £2.3m
relating to profit in stock on acquisition.
Operating expenses
Total operating expenses, including research and
development but before acquisition adjustments and
reorganisation costs, increased to £43.0m (07/08:
£26.3m) reflecting the increased employee numbers
and activities of the Group following the acquisition 
of Protherics in December 2008. BTG’s activities now
include manufacturing facilities in Australia and
Wales together with enhanced R&D capabilities both
in the UK and USA supporting a broader
development pipeline.
As part of the integration of Protherics, 
BTG stated it would seek to reduce G&A costs by
£10m and R&D expenditure by £10m by the 2010/11
year-end. Progress on integration is well advanced.
Site rationalisation has commenced with the closure
of two London offices and relocation of staff to a
smaller London office. The decisions to close the
former Protherics Runcorn office and manufacturing
facility in Salt Lake City have been announced and
closure of the sites is expected at the end of June
2009 and August 2009 respectively.
In addition, a company-wide rationalisation
plan has been implemented which will result in a
reduction in headcount of approximately 20% with
employee levels falling from a combined total of 365
when the deal was announced to 290. Research and
development expenses increased to £21.6m (07/08:
£12.9m) as a result of the increased number of
programmes under development. An R&D portfolio
review has been completed, identifying programmes
that we will take forward to market ourselves; those
that we will develop further with a view to out-licence
and those where we will seek a partner but not
develop further ourselves. 
Business review continued
Progress on integration is well advanced. 
Site rationalisation has commenced and 
an R&D portfolio review has been completed.

Business review
During the year BTG realised profits on sale 
of investments and IP of £2.6m and recorded
impairment provisions of £3.4m against other
investments.
The pro forma full year operating expenses,
excluding acquisition and reorganisation costs, 
were £61.8m.
Acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs
As a result of the acquisition of Protherics, acquisition
adjustments and reorganisation costs of £16.2m 
have arisen. Reorganisation costs were £10.9m,
including redundancy payments, site closure costs
and impairment charges, of which cash costs are
expected to be in the region of £8.0m. Payments 
of £0.6m had been made by 31 March 2009.
BTG valued the inventory acquired from
Protherics at acquisition to reflect profit accrued up to
the stage of production at the time of the transaction.
As a result of the subsequent sale of this inventory, 
a non-cash fair value adjustment of £2.3m has 
been charged to cost of sales. Included in operating
expenses is a £3.0m charge for amortisation 
of intangible assets arising on acquisition.
Operating profit/loss
BTG made an operating profit of £7.0m (07/08:
£16.6m) before acquisition adjustments and
reorganisation costs. The loss from operations after
acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs 
was £9.2m (07/08: £8.5m profit).
Financial income and costs
The net financial costs were £2.1m (07/08: net financial
income of £2.2m). Financial income of £2.9m was only
slightly higher than in the previous year (07/08: £2.7m)
despite higher cash balances due to lower interest
rates. Financial expenses of £5.0m (07/08: £0.5m)
included fair value losses of £4.9m on marking 
to market BTG’s forward contracts to sell US dollars. 
Taxation
The taxation charge for the year is £1.8m, arising 
as a result of a corporate tax charge of £2.9m offset
by movements on deferred tax liabilities of £1.1m. 
Loss/profit after tax
BTG made a profit after tax before acquisition
adjustments and reorganisation costs of £3.1m
(07/08: £16.9m).
After acquisition adjustments and
reorganisation costs, BTG made a loss after tax 
of £13.1m (07/08: profit after tax of £8.8m) resulting 
in a loss per share of 7.1p (07/08: earnings per 
share of 5.9p).
Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased from £14.1m to
£211.1m. The majority of this increase derives from
the valuation of the assets acquired from Protherics
which resulted in intangible assets of £164.1m and
£30.0m of goodwill. The principal components 
of the intangible assets include Protherics developed
technology (£120.3m), contractual relationships
(£36.1m) and various development programmes
(£7.7m). The developed technology will be amortised
over periods of between 20 and 25 years.
Contractual relationships are amortised over the
contract period. Development programmes will 
be amortised once they generate revenue streams 
and then will be amortised over their useful lives. 
The net book value of the Group’s property, plant
and equipment increased to £11.1m (07/08: £0.8m)
primarily due to the inclusion of Protherics
manufacturing assets.
Current assets, current and non-current liabilities
Inventory of £10.5m represents raw material, work
in progress and finished goods of CroFab™ and
DigiFab™ manufactured at the Group’s facilities 
in Australia and Wales. Trade and other receivables
have increased from £15.2m to £29.6m reflecting 
the inclusion of Protherics year-end receivables 
and accrued royalty revenues.
Current liabilities have increased from
£24.2m to £69.7m. Within this total, £13.5m 
relates to deferred revenue that will not give rise 
to a cash outflow.
Non-current liabilities have increased from
£6.9m to £47.1m. The major movements include 
a £35.2m provision for deferred taxation that arises
on the valuation of the intangible assets acquired
from Protherics.
Cash
Net cash and cash equivalents increased by 
£21.2m to £78.2m at 31 March 2009 (31 March 2008:
£57.0m). The increase in cash was generated
primarily by £23.2m of cash acquired from Protherics
offset by marginal cash outflow from operating
activities.
Outlook
2008/09 has been a transformational year for BTG.
We have made significant progress in delivering our
integration goals and cost savings. The underlying
growth in our recurring revenues, combined with 
a focus on cost reduction, provides a solid financial
platform on which to develop our growth strategy.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Business review
Trends affecting performance and development
BTG’s performance and prospects are and will
continue to be affected by developments in the
global healthcare sector.
Regulation
BTG operates in a highly regulated, changing
environment in which substantial evidence of the
safety and efficacy of a medicine is required before 
it is approved for use in patients. These requirements
contribute to the long timescales and significant 
costs involved in developing new pharmaceuticals.
Although BTG conducts its clinical studies
through a network of contract research organisations
(CROs), as the sponsor of the studies, BTG is ultimately
responsible for their proper conduct and adherence to
all regulations. By employing people with appropriate
skills and experience, working with high-quality CROs
and implementing appropriate quality systems, BTG
is well placed to meet the regulatory requirements 
of the territories in which it operates. 
Demand for new medicines
Despite significant advances over the past few
decades in treating life-threatening conditions and
disorders that impact quality of life, patients and
physicians still have many unmet needs. In addition,
an increasingly health- and appearance-conscious,
wealthy and motivated population continues to fuel
demand for improved medicines and products to
improve quality of life.
BTG has positioned itself to try to address
some of these needs by focusing on medicines that
are used in critical care situations, to treat cancer,
neurological and other disorders that cause
significant quality of life issues.
Price regulation
The increasing demand for new medicines is leading
to rising costs for healthcare providers. Most countries
now control the cost of medicines, and there is
increasing pressure to demonstrate value for money
and economic as well as clinical benefits before
healthcare providers agree to pay or part-reimburse
the cost of new medicines.
BTG monitors developments in pricing and
reimbursement in key markets but it is not possible
currently to quantify the impact on its business 
of any future changes.
Partnering
Product failures and pipeline gaps have led to
increased competition among biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies to acquire programmes.
BTG does not conduct its own research and needs 
to acquire programmes from other organisations 
to operate its business. BTG has the financial
resources and technical capabilities to be able to
compete effectively for the niche products it intends 
to develop and sell to US hospital specialists.
To realise value from its own development
pipeline, BTG seeks partners to take forward
programmes it does not intend to develop through 
to approval and market itself. To maximise the return
on investment when partnering, BTG directs its
development activities to generate proof of concept
safety and efficacy data, and establishes strong
intellectual property to protect the programmes and
maximise their value to partners.
Products and competition
BTG ’s key current royalty-generating products are
expected to continue to provide royalty revenues until
their patents or licence agreements expire. Partners
are responsible for all sales and marketing; BTG has
no role in this but it does monitor sales and market
trends. While some of the current licensed products
are expected to continue to generate royalties
through to 2017 or 2019, a number of royalties will
cease in 2011 when patents expire, including
BeneFIX
®
, the current largest revenue earner and the
only approved recombinant Factor IX treatment for
the bleeding disorder haemophilia B. However, from
around this time, a number of new royalty streams
may emerge including CB7630, if approved as 
a treatment for prostate cancer, and Campath
®
, 
if approved to treat multiple sclerosis.
BTG also earns revenues from sales of 
its critical care products including CroFab™ and
DigiFab™. These products are currently distributed 
by third parties, but from 2010 BTG intends to sell
them itself in the US. There is no current competitor 
to CroFab™ and only one competitor to DigiFab™
(BTG estimates that DigiFab™ has approximately 
80% of the market). Although these are established
niche products and the manufacturing processes 
are complex, providing some protection, future
competition cannot be ruled out.
BTG’s approach is to build a strong pipeline
of products addressing unmet needs, to conduct
high-quality development programmes, and to
assess the commercial prospects of programmes 
at appropriate intervals. BTG is well placed to acquire,
develop and commercialise new programmes that, 
if successfully approved, should generate sales 
or royalty income to replace and potentially exceed
current royalty and revenue streams.
Business review continued
Patients and 
physicians still have 
many unmet needs.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Business review
Principal risks and uncertainties
Competition
We face competition when seeking to acquire 
new programmes and products, and, if we are
unsuccessful in accessing new programmes and
products, our ability to generate new revenue
streams would be adversely affected. The products
on which BTG currently earns revenues, or from 
which it anticipates earning revenues once they are
on the market, face competition from other products
that are already approved or in development; such
competition could reduce revenues.
Pricing and reimbursement
The failure of a product to qualify for government or
health-insurance reimbursement or changes to the
environment for reimbursement could adversely
impact revenues. The failure to achieve an appropriate
sales price could adversely impact revenues.
Development
The development of drug and medical products 
is inherently uncertain and the timelines and costs 
to approval may vary significantly from budget 
or expectation. The drug may not demonstrate the
expected efficacy or safety benefits and may not 
be approved by the regulatory bodies, such as the
US Food and Drug Administration.
Manufacturing
BTG relies on third-party contractors for the supply
of key materials and services, such as filling and
freeze-drying of end products. These processes 
carry risks of failure and loss of product. Problems
at contractors’ facilities may lead to delays and
disruptions in supplies. Some materials and services
may be available from one source only and
regulatory requirements make substitution costly 
and time-consuming. BTG’s polyclonal antibody
products rely on serum produced from our sheep
flocks in Australia, which could be subject to disease
outbreaks. BTG relies on its single site in Wales 
for the supply of manufactured product, with the
consequent possibilities for disruption to supplies.
Regulatory
The pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated.
Compliance with such regulations, including
demonstrating compliance with Good Manufacturing
Practice and Good Clinical Practice standards, can 
be time-consuming and expensive and alterations 
to the regulations may result in delays or even non-
approval of a product in development. Moreover,
failure by BTG or a BTG partner company to comply
with regulations may result in a product being
withdrawn from market with a subsequent loss 
of revenues.
Intellectual property
Failure by BTG to maintain or renew key patents might
lead to losses of earnings and liability to suit from
both the licensee and licensor. BTG’s patents may 
be subject to challenge for infringement which might
result in litigation costs and/or loss of earnings. 
BTG might be obliged to sue third parties for their
infringement of its patents. BTG may not be able to
secure the necessary IP rights in relation to products
in development, limiting the potential to generate
value from these products. BTG’s patent portfolio is
subject to a number of challenges.
Currency and treasury
Many of BTG’s revenues and receipts are
denominated in US$ and movements in foreign
exchange rates could adversely impact results. BTG
actively manages its exchange risks where feasible,
using short-term hedging transactions guided 
by market expectations and economic forecasts, 
to seek to match actual receipts and payments over
a rolling 24 month period to those forecast. This
policy can result in both exchange gains and losses
but provides a level of certainty.
BTG focuses on medicines that are used in critical 
care situations and to treat cancer, neurological 
and other disorders that affect quality of life.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility
We are committed to good practice and
ethical behaviour, and we recognise that 
we have responsibilities to all stakeholders.
We regularly review our employee, ethical
and environmental policies and improve
them where appropriate.
Framework
An Ethics & Policy Guide, which is reviewed annually
and updated where appropriate, is made available
to all employees.
Rolf Soderstrom is the Board member with
specific responsibility for CSR matters. The Board
receives regular updates on CSR policies and reviews
recommended changes.
BTG is a member of the FTSE4Good index
series, created to measure the performance of
companies that meet globally recognised corporate
responsibility standards.
Summaries of key policies follow.
Equal opportunities policy
BTG is committed to achieving equal opportunities for
all its employment policies, procedures and practices.
The Company respects employee human rights and
dignity and recognises the advantages of a diverse
workforce. BTG does not tolerate any harassment 
of, or discrimination against, employees or potential
employees, irrespective of their race, creed, colour,
sexual orientation, nationality, ethnic origin, religion,
disability, age, gender or marital status.
Employment of people with disabilities
BTG makes every effort to ensure that disabled
employees are treated fairly and without prejudice.
Job applicants with disabilities have an equal
opportunity to be selected for employment, and
disabled employees have an equal opportunity 
to be selected for promotion and receive training 
to aid their career development. 
Family friendly employment policies
BTG’s maternity and paternity leave policies meet 
and in many aspects exceed the statutory minimum
standards. Flexible approaches to returning to work
after maternity leave, including part-time and non-
standard hours of work, are adopted where viable.
Employee training and development
BTG considers continuous learning to be one 
of its core Company values and training is a key
constituent of the employee appraisal process. 
The Company employs a dedicated training resource,
which, together with the wider Human Resources
team, is responsible for sourcing appropriate
employee training across sites. In addition, 
an apprenticeship scheme operates in our UK
manufacturing facility which enables specialist
pharmaceutical manufacturing skill development,
benefiting the local community.
Employee communication and involvement
Management acknowledges the importance of
internal communication, especially in a Company
with global operations. Briefing and consultative
procedures exist throughout the Group to keep
employees informed of general business issues and
other matters of interest. Monthly company-wide
meetings, the intranet and email are used both to
communicate Company matters to employees and
to elicit questions, feedback and requests. Employee
Representative Committees have been formed
in both BTG’s Welsh and Australian manufacturing
facilities and meet regularly to discuss items
of interest to employees and management alike. 
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 36 37/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate social responsibility
Health and safety
Health and Safety is a priority within the Group’s 
work spaces. All sites are compliant with the local
relevant legislation and regular Health and Safety
audits are undertaken. Risk assessments are used 
to review and improve workplaces and working
practices. The Group has an excellent safety record
and maintains strong local relationships with
government Health and Safety bodies. Consultative
processes are in place in both manufacturing sites 
to allow employee involvement in Health and Safety
issues. The Company’s Health and Safety Manual,
Policies and Procedures are issued to all employees
on joining the Company.
Environment
BTG offices occupy parts of large, managed office
buildings and therefore the Company has no control
of overall building emissions, energy usage or 
waste. However, the Group seeks to reduce usage 
by encouraging employees to turn off equipment 
and lights outside of normal office hours. 
Other initiatives in the UK, US and Australian
sites include sourcing local materials, suppliers and
contractors, recycling of paper, and sourcing recycled
consumables and energy-efficient IT equipment.
During the past two years, recycling of wet waste
including food waste, food containers and
contaminated paper and tissues, has been introduced
in the UK office. The Group encourages recycling 
and makes this easy through strategic placement 
of recycling facilities, but it does not consider
measurement of the percentage achieved viable. 
In the UK, the Group also works with suppliers to
source fair trade products where possible and similar
initiatives have been implemented at the US office.
The Australian operation has been actively pursuing a
reduction in water usage, given the drought currently
being experienced in South Australia. Several rain
collection and storage systems have been installed
with more planned in the coming year. 
Business travel is an essential component 
of BTG’s activities and, as the amount will vary
depending upon activity cycles, it is not appropriate
to set targets. A car sharing initiative has been set up
at the Company’s UK manufacturing site which helps
to reduce local carbon emissions and increase the
efficiency of car travel to and from the site. The Group
has installed and encourages the use of video and
telephone conferencing facilities in its UK and US
offices to reduce travel wherever possible.
It is Company policy to adopt the ‘best available
techniques not entailing excessive costs’ (BATNEEC)
and ‘best practicable environmental option’ (BPEO)
approach at all times to prevent pollution of the air,
land and water and to protect everyone from all
foreseeable hazards connected with the Company’s
activities, wherever necessary in consultation with 
the Environment Agency, local enforcing authorities
and other external bodies.
The Company’s UK manufacturing operation
has been granted an Integrated Pollution and
Prevention Control (IPPC) permit from the Environment
Agency and the site passed a recent audit without
any concerns raised. A Monitoring and Targeting
(M&T) system has been installed as part of the site
energy management strategy. The system is yielding
savings in electrical energy and steam usage.
Investment is also being made in a waste water
treatment plant that will use membrane bio-reactors
(MBR) further reducing the site’s impact on the
environment. BTG’s UK manufacturing site has 
been independently assessed to the Green Dragon
Environmental Level Two, and good progress 
has been made toward achieving the higher Level 
Three standard. Green Dragon is a recognised 
UKAS Accredited and independently inspected
Environmental Management System (EMS).
Regulation
There is a legal requirement to ensure medicines 
are tested in animals prior to exposure to human
volunteers and then patients. All such research in the
UK is regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures)
Act 1986, which is administered by the Home 
Office. BTG supports the key principles of reduction,
refinement and replacement and applies them as
part of the Group’s standard operating procedures 
to each study before it is commissioned. All studies
are conducted through external contract research
7716 Report 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:08  Page 37 38/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate social responsibility
organisations, and BTG works only with organisations
that uphold the highest standards of welfare and, 
as a minimum, conform to local regulatory and legal
requirements and standards of care. 
Ethical dealings
BTG has identified six values which it believes 
best embody the Company culture: openness,
accountability, teamwork, integrity, delivery and
continuous learning. Through company-wide
communications, staff are encouraged to embrace
these values in their every-day work and the 
values are being incorporated into the employee
appraisal system over the course of the current 
year. BTG endeavours to be honest and fair in 
its relationships and dealings with its suppliers,
customers and other stakeholders and extends 
its own values to relationships with these parties,
working only with companies that uphold high
standards of ethical conduct and fair practices. 
The Company Code of Conduct details BTG’s
approach to these matters and includes policies 
on data protection, corrupt practices, and competition
and anti-trust matters. A comprehensive section 
on whistle blowing encourages employees to report
any concerns and provides means for them to do
so with anonymity. 
Political and charitable donations
BTG’s policy is that it does not donate money, 
services or facilities to political parties. However, 
BTG may campaign for, or against, proposed
changes in legislation or regulations that might affect
its business or the environment in which it operates.
Officers or employees, with BTG’s approval,
participate in government advisory committees or
non-governmental organisations that are relevant 
to the business. No political contributions were 
made during the current or prior financial years.
BTG encourages employee involvement 
in charitable causes in a number of ways. Following 
the acquisition of Protherics, BTG is consolidating 
and updating its Give As You Earn Scheme, whereby
employees can make a regular donation to any
registered charity from their monthly pay, and the
Company plans to relaunch this scheme by the end
of 2009. In addition, BTG will top up other donations
made by employees up to a fixed amount that is set
annually, based on the previous year’s donations.
BTG strives to work with charities and
organisations that are either in some way local, 
or of interest to BTG employees. In the UK, BTG
employees annually by ballot select charities 
to sponsor. In 2008/09, BTG’s first nominated charity
was the Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group. 
As the fundraising target was exceeded, a second
charity, Cancer Research UK was chosen and 
good progress is already being made to meet the
fundraising goal. Employees are encouraged to
organise money-raising activities for the charity
throughout the year: reasonable use of BTG time 
and facilities is allowed. 
BTG promotes interaction with the local
community including schools and has hosted 
a number of open days at its UK manufacturing
facilities. This year, the Company sponsored the 
Top of the Bench Competition for the Mid-Wales 
Local Section Trust of the Royal Society of Chemistry
(RSC). In addition, computing equipment, surplus 
to requirements following the Protherics acquisition
and London office consolidation, was donated to
schools in mid Wales. 
In Australia, the Company strives to be 
a good corporate citizen in the local environment,
and, as a relatively large employer in two rural areas,
the Company aims to support the local community
wherever possible. The Company has supported
numerous local charity appeals during the last year,
most recently donating AU$8,860 to the Victorian
Bushfire Appeal generated by local employee,
subsidiary and plc contributions.
Charitable contributions made by the Group
during the year amounted to £5,955 (07/08: £2,356).

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Directors’ report
The directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of
the Group, together with the audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 March 2009.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activity of the Group is the development and
commercialisation of life science technologies. The Group
in-licenses, develops and commercialises pharmaceuticals
and has a broad pipeline of development programmes
targeting neurological and other disorders including
varicose veins. The Company has a substantial and
growing revenue stream of milestones and royalties from
out-licensed products. On 4 December 2008 BTG acquired
Protherics PLC which is principally involved in the research,
development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical
products and potential drugs for use in the treatment 
of human diseases. The results of the Group are set out 
in detail on pages 68 to 71 and the accompanying notes.
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business
Review, including a review of the business, the principal
business risks, key performance indicators and likely future
developments, can be found in the Chief Executive Officer’s
Review on pages 20 to 23 and the Business Review 
on pages 24 to 35. These are incorporated into this report
by reference.
Further information on the Group is available on the
Company’s website: www.btgplc.com
Results and dividends
The Group made a loss on ordinary activities before
taxation of £11.3m (07/08: profit £10.7m). The loss after 
tax was £13.1 m (07/08: profit £8.8m). The directors do 
not recommend the payment of a dividend for the year
(07/08: nil). The results of the Group for the year are
explained further on pages 31 to 35. 
Directors and their powers and interests
The directors of the Company at the date of this report,
together with their biographical details and dates of
appointment, are shown on pages 40 and 41. The Board
confirms that each of the directors who served during 
the year has been formally appraised during the period
and that they continue to demonstrate commitment to 
the Group and the Board and to their role.
There were a number of Board changes during the year: 
• Rolf Soderstrom joined the Board as Chief Financial
Officer on 4 December 2008 and became Company
Secretary on 31 March 2009
• Christine Soden became Chief Operating Officer on
4 December 2008 and retired as Company Secretary 
and as a director on 31 March 2009
• James O’Shea was appointed as a non-executive
director subsequent to the year end on 2 April 2009.
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association,
each director is subject to re-election at intervals of not more
than three years. Any director appointed during the year is
separately required to retire and seek election at the next
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The following directors are
subject to election at the Company’s 2009 AGM:
• William Jenkins retires in accordance with the articles 
of association and, being eligible, the Board is
recommending he offers himself for re-election
• Rolf Soderstrom and James O’Shea, having been
appointed since the last AGM retire and, being eligible,
the Board is recommending that they offer themselves
for election.
During the year the Company has maintained cover for its
directors and officers and those of its subsidiary companies
under a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy as
permitted by sections 232 to 235 of the Companies Act
2006. The Company has entered into separate Deeds of
Indemnity in favour of each of its directors to the extent
permitted by law. These deeds provide substantially the
same protection as that already provided to directors in
article 75(6) of the Company’s existing articles of association. 
Information on directors’ remuneration, contracts, options and
their beneficial interests, including those of their immediate
families, in the shares of the Company are shown in the
Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 64. None of the directors
had an interest in any contract of significance to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries was party during the
year. Giles Kerr is Director of Finance at Oxford University,
an organisation with which the Group has a number of pre-
existing agreements. See page 115 for further information.

Acquisition of Protherics PLC
On 18 September 2008, the Board of BTG announced that 
it had agreed the terms of a recommended all share offer
with the board of Protherics PLC to acquire the entire issued
and to be issued share capital of Protherics. The acquisition
was effected by a Scheme of Arrangement under part 26 
of the Companies Act 2006. Under the terms of the Scheme,
Protherics shareholders who were on the register of
members on 3 December 2008 were entitled to receive
0.291 new BTG shares for every Protherics share they held 
at that date. The new BTG shares were admitted to trading
on the London Stock Exchange at the start of business 
on 4 December 2008 and were credited as fully paid and

Directors’ report
Directors’ report continued
ranked pari passu in all respects to the existing BTG shares.
Certain non-UK nationals and holders of Protherics PLC
ADRs were not eligible to receive BTG shares and received
the value of the equivalent BTG shares which were sold in
the market on their behalf following the acquisition.
Share capital and shareholders
During the year 104,044,710 ordinary shares were issued
pursuant to the acquisition of Protherics referred to above.
A further 226,426 BTG shares were issued to employees
and former employees of BTG as a result of the exercise 
of share options under the Company’s employee share
schemes. Under the terms of the acquisition, current and
former employees of Protherics who were holders of
options under the Protherics share schemes were entitled
to exercise their options and receive shares in BTG in 
the same ratio as shareholders at the acquisition date. 
A further 7,275 BTG shares were issued to a former
employee of Protherics under this arrangement. There 
are no restrictions on voting rights or on the transfer 
of securities. Share capital comprises solely of ordinary
shares and all have the same voting rights.
Details of outstanding share options and awards under
both the pre-existing BTG schemes and those carried 
over from Protherics, are set out in note 31 to the financial
statements on pages 105 to 109.
Details of the movements in the Company’s share capital
are shown in note 25 to the financial statements on
page 99. At 31 March 2009, the Company had 10,429
shareholders (07/08: 4,869). Further details of shareholdings
and Company reporting dates may be found on page 128. 
At the date of this report the Company had been notified 
of the following interests held, directly or indirectly, 
in 3% or more of the Company’s issued share capital.

The Company’s articles of association permit the Company
to purchase any of its shares, however this cannot be done
without the approval of shareholders at an AGM and there is
no current intention of requesting this authority. The Company
may also issue shares in accordance with the resolutions 
set out in the AGM Notice, enclosed with this report.
Policy on payment of creditors
It is the BTG Group’s policy to abide by the terms of
payment agreed with suppliers. In many cases, the terms
of payment are as stated in the supplier’s own literature. 
In other cases, the terms of payment are determined by
specific written or oral agreement.
0 
At 31 March 2009 the total owed to trade creditors by 
the Group was equivalent to 35 days average purchases
(07/08: 22 days). The Company had no trade creditors 
at that date (07/08: nil). 
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections and cash
resources and facilities available, and after making enquiries,
the directors believe that the Company has adequate
resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements. See page 72 for
further details.
Change of registered office
On 16 March 2009, as part of the cost saving exercise
following the acquisition of Protherics, BTG vacated 
its existing London head office and the nearby Protherics
offices and all staff moved to new smaller premises 
at 5 Fleet Place, London EC4M 7RD. This is now the new
head office and registered office of the Group.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of the Company will be held at 10.30 am on
15 July 2009 at the offices of Ashurst LLP , Broadwalk House,
5 Appold Street, London EC2A 2HA. The details of the
resolutions to be proposed are set out in the Notice of the
Annual General Meeting which is enclosed with this report.
Among the resolutions at the AGM are proposals to adopt
new share plans following the expiry of the previous
versions at the end of their ten year life. Further details are
set out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this
Report confirm that, so far as they are each aware, there is
no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor
is unaware; and each director has taken all the steps that
they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
Resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM, to
re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditor and to authorise the
directors to determine its remuneration.

Corporate governance
The Board of BTG recognises that good corporate
governance is essential to running a successful company
and is committed to ensuring that high levels of corporate
governance are maintained that underpin the management
of the Company’s affairs. UK-listed companies are required
by the Financial Services Authority to report on their
governance practices and the extent to which they comply
with Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the ‘Code’), published in June 2006 by the
Financial Reporting Council (FRC).
The Board considers that the Company complied with all
the provisions of the Code throughout the year to 31 March
2009. More information on the Code can be found on the
FRC website, www.frc.org.uk.
The information set out below explains how the Company
complies with the Code’s main principles and detailed
provisions. 
Board composition, responsibilities and balance
Each company should be headed by an effective board
which is collectively responsible for the success of the
company. The role of the board is to provide entrepreneurial
leadership of the company within a framework of prudent
and effective controls which allow risk to be assessed and
managed. The board should set the strategic aims 
of the company, ensure the necessary financial and 
human resources are in place for the company to meet 
its objectives and review management performance. 
The board should set the company’s values and standards
and ensure its obligations to its shareholders and others
are understood and met.
There should be a clear division of responsibilities between
the running of the board and executive responsibility for 
the running of the company’s business. The board should
include a balance of executive and non-executive directors
(and in particular independent non-executive directors)
such that no individual or group of individuals may
dominate the board’s decision making.
The BTG Board currently comprises a non-executive
Chairman, two executive directors, the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), together
with a further five independent non-executive directors
(including a Senior Independent Director). Their names,
together with brief biographical details, are set out on pages
40 and 41. The table below details the composition of the
Board and its committees, together with their attendance 
at meetings since the last Annual Report and the Company’s
assessment of the independence of the directors.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance
The Board applies a rigorous process in order to satisfy 
itself that its non-executive directors remain independent.
The Board reviews the independence of the non-executive
directors every year, using its own judgement when
applying the criteria in the Combined Code. Having
undertaken this review, the Board confirms that all the non-
executive directors are considered to be independent in
character and judgement. The Chairman, John Brown, was
considered to be independent at the date of appointment
although, in line with best practice, he is no longer deemed
independent in light of his role as Chairman of the Company.
Whilst the executive and non-executive directors are
collectively responsible for the success of the Company 
and have fiduciary duties towards shareholders, their roles
are strictly delineated. The executive directors have direct
responsibility for the business operations of the Company,
the non-executive directors have a responsibility to bring
independent and objective judgement to Board decisions
and the Chairman’s primary responsibility is for the 
effective running of the Board. The non-executives’ duties
include helping to develop the Company’s strategy and
constructively challenging the executive directors where
they consider it appropriate. 
The Board as a whole monitors operating performance, 
the performance of management, succession planning,
health, safety and environmental performance and
standards of ethical and social behaviour. It is also
responsible for developing robust corporate governance
and risk management procedures aimed at safeguarding
the Company’s reputation and assets and the integrity 
of its financial information.
Matters specifically reserved to the Board for decision or
approval include the approval of the interim and annual
financial statements, the interim management statements
and major public announcements, setting strategic
direction, budgets and long-term plans. Other areas
include the approval of major investments and disposals,
major capital expenditure, major litigation, significant
financing, dividend policy and senior executive
remuneration and appointments. 
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take
independent professional advice, if necessary, at the
Company’s expense. Directors have direct access to the
advice and services of the Company Secretary who 
is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are
followed. The Company arranges appropriate directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance. The removal of a director 
or of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board 
as a whole. 
Information and training, performance evaluation
and re-election of directors
The board should be supplied in a timely manner with
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to 
enable it to discharge its duties. All directors should receive
induction on joining the board and should regularly update
and refresh their skills and knowledge. The board should
undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own
performance and that of its committees. All directors should
be submitted for re-election at regular intervals, subject 
to continued satisfactory performance. The board should
ensure planned and progressive refreshing of the board.
The directors are sent an agenda and a full set of papers
for each item to be discussed, in advance of each Board 
or Committee meeting. Additional information is provided
as appropriate and senior executives regularly make
presentations at Board meetings on the results and
strategies in their areas of responsibility.
Upon joining BTG each director receives a comprehensive
induction package, including written information and
opportunities to meet key and relevant members of staff.
All directors refresh their knowledge regularly through
publications and conferences and through information
provided by the Company and its advisers.
The Board evaluates its own effectiveness and that of its
Committees on an annual basis, both through measuring
performance against annual objectives and through 
an individual appraisal process. The Chairman of each
Committee reports the results of the reviews back to the
Board with identified areas for future action.
The CEO is responsible for appraising the performance of
the CFO, the Chairman and non-executive directors review
the performance of the CEO. Each director was asked 
to complete a questionnaire comprising both qualitative
and quantitative responses. The Chairman, John Brown,
subsequently interviewed each director separately to
discuss individual performance as a director over the past
year and the effectiveness of the Committees and the
Board as a whole, and how it might improve its monitoring
of the business. The Committees also reviewed their
performance and reported the results to the Chairman 
and the Board as a whole. The operation of the Board 
and its members was felt to be effective and the Board
considered it had a good mix of experience and skills. The
non-executive directors meet at least once a year without
the executive directors in order to discuss the performance 
of the executive directors and any concerns over their
management of the Company’s affairs.
Corporate governance continued
7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:28  Page 45 46/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance
All directors are required to stand for election at the first
AGM following their appointment and then to be re-elected
at least once every three years thereafter. The Board
reviews its constitution regularly and has established 
a clear plan for refreshing its members. During the year
ended 31 March 2008 Sir Brian Fender retired and was
replaced as Chairman by John Brown. Fred Weiss retired,
having served for two three-year terms, and was replaced
as chairman of the Audit Committee by Giles Kerr, and
Colin Blakemore was also appointed as a director. At the
2008 AGM Consuelo Brooke retired from the Board, having
served for two three-year terms and Alison Wood retired
due to other commitments. In December 2008 Rolf
Soderstrom joined the Board following the acquisition of
Protherics and Christine Soden retired on 31 March 2009.
Following the year end, on 2 April 2009, James O’Shea 
was appointed to the Board. After these changes the 
Board will be comprised of the non-executive Chairman,
five independent non-executive directors, the CEO and 
CFO. Details of the three directors standing for election 
at the 2009 AGM are set out on page 42.
Financing reporting and internal control
The board should present a balanced and understandable
view of the company’s position and prospects and should
maintain a sound system of internal control to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the company’s assets.
The statement of directors’ responsibilities in relation 
to the preparation of the financial statements is set out 
on page 65 and the auditor’s statement on the respective
responsibilities of directors and the auditor is included
within its report set out on pages 66 and 67. 
Communications with shareholders, be they results
announcements, interim reports, annual reports or AGM
and trading updates, are reviewed carefully and approved
by the Board or a sub-committee thereof in order to ensure
they are transparent and balanced in the view they give of
the Company’s progress and prospects.
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the
Group maintains an adequate system of internal control 
and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Audit Committee on behalf of the Board undertakes 
the detailed monitoring of the controls and reports to the
Board on its findings. The Board has reviewed the system 
of internal controls including financial controls for the year
under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual
Report and Accounts. Such a system is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The criteria applied by the directors in judging the
effectiveness of these controls are that they allow the
maximisation of shareholder value by exploiting business
opportunities whilst ensuring that risks are properly
identified and managed. The controls are regularly
reviewed to ensure that they enable the proper
management of business risks without so restricting
efficiency and entrepreneurial nature that they inhibit
proper running of the business. 
BTG has a management structure with clear lines of
responsibility and accountability, staffed by appropriate
personnel. The Board is responsible for setting the overall
strategy and reviewing the performance of the Group. 
The day to day running of BTG’s operations is managed 
by the Company’s Senior Leadership Team, chaired by the
CEO. Other members include the CFO and senior staff
members from the business. This team is also responsible
for the recommendation to the Board of the Company’s
strategy and its subsequent implementation, for ensuring
that appropriate internal controls are in place to manage
and assess risk and that they are fully complied with.
The Company set up an Integration Committee, at the time
of the acquisition, to manage all aspects of bringing the
two businesses together. This committee has continued 
to operate until the year-end.
The review of risk and risk management is embedded
throughout the Group. Following the acquisition of Protherics
a senior team, chaired by the CFO and including staff from
all sections of the enlarged business, was set up to review
the risks of the enlarged Group and to identify and evaluate
risks which may impact on the Group’s strategic and
business objectives. The risk team has developed a risk
management plan that identifies the key risks. The plan is
designed to assess the probability of those risks occurring,
the impact should they occur, how such risks may be
mitigated and monitored and the actions and individuals
responsible for managing the risks. Having completed 
the risk review the new team will also be responsible for 
the continual monitoring of risk and the progress of actions
designed to mitigate such risks. The risk team meets
quarterly to review progress and reports its findings 
twice-yearly through the Audit Committee to the Board. 
The Board has reviewed the risk management process 
and confirms that ongoing processes and systems ensure
that BTG continues to be compliant with the Turnbull
guidance as contained in ‘Internal Control: Guidance for
Directors on the Combined Code’.
Corporate governance continued
7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:28  Page 46 47/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance
The fundamental elements of the Group’s internal control
and risk management framework are described below.
Structure and reporting
Under the operating guidance of the Senior Leadership
Team, BTG is organised into a number of business and
operating units and within these there are defined
management structures and processes for acquisition,
assessment and evaluation of technology opportunities,
and development and execution of commercialisation
strategies. 
The Group has two committees containing senior 
members of staff who review all stages of its development
operations; a committee responsible for the review and
recommendation of potential acquisitions or in-licensing 
of new drug programmes and a committee responsible 
for the review and proactive management of all projects 
in BTG’s development portfolio. These committees report
regularly to the Senior Leadership Team and are able 
to call on the expertise of various internal and external
experts to ensure the programmes are developed
effectively and meet commercial and market needs. 
BTG actively monitors its revenue streams from partnered
products and from time to time audits its major licensees 
to ensure compliance with the terms of agreements. 
BTG also has a system for supporting the protection and
maintenance of patents.
The Senior Leadership Team meets formally at least once
each month to review business performance measured
against annual budgets and longer-term plans and an
agreed set of objectives and performance criteria for each
business unit. Reporting to the Board is based on these
monthly reviews including non-financial as well as financial
information and a review of development progress within
the portfolio. 
Approval procedures
BTG has delegated authority structures that ensure that
decisions are taken at an appropriate level, with an
appropriate level of input by internal and external expert
advisers. The delegated authority structure prescribes
financial limits of approval at each level and requires
decisions with significant financial, legal or reputational
impact for BTG to be approved by the Board.
Corporate policies, values and compliance
A statement of corporate values and a guidance booklet 
on ethics, business practices and compliance are distributed
throughout the Group. Relevant employees meet regularly to
discuss external changes in the regulatory, legal and financial
environments in which BTG operates to ensure it remains
fully compliant with new legislation and best practice.
The Board, through the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the internal controls of the Group. The
controls described above operate and are embedded
within the day to day business. There is an ongoing process
for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks
faced by the Group. A reporting structure has been in place
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the
financial statements and is regularly reviewed by the
directors in accordance with the Code.
As required by the Code, the Board has considered
whether it would be appropriate to have a dedicated
internal audit function within the Group and has concluded
that, taking into account its relatively small size, and the
way the business is run, this is not appropriate at present.
This decision will be reviewed on an annual basis. 
The internal audit process is under review. The finance
function of each office will monitor and review controls on 
a regular basis. Each office will also be visited once a year
by head office finance staff. Internal audit work will focus 
on reviewing and testing key internal controls in the most
important areas of expenditure, revenue and business
processes. The results are reported to the Board, via the
Audit Committee, twice a year. 
Related parties and conflicts of interest
BTG maintains robust procedures to ensure that related
party transactions and potential conflicts of interest are
identified, disclosed and managed. These procedures
include: directors declare interests in other businesses 
on appointment to the Board and annual self-certification 
by directors. Where it is identified that a related party
relationship exists, the Board agrees specific additional
procedures to ensure the effective management of
potential conflicts of interest.
Giles Kerr, a non-executive director of BTG plc, is also the
Director of Finance for Oxford University and a director 
of Isis Innovations Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Oxford University. BTG plc’s wholly owned subsidiaries
BTG International Ltd and British Technology Group 
Inter-Corporate Licensing Ltd have pre-existing licence
agreements with Oxford University and Isis Innovations
under which they are obliged to pay royalties on amounts
received from commercialising certain Intellectual Property.
Corporate governance continued
7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:29  Page 47 48/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate governance
As a non-executive director of BTG plc, Giles Kerr will 
not participate in any discussions concerning the relevant
agreements either within the Board meetings of BTG plc 
or in any other discussions or meetings with the executives
of BTG plc and its subsidiaries.
Within Oxford University and Isis Innovations Limited, Giles
Kerr will not participate in any other discussions concerning
the relevant agreements.
The Board has considered and is satisfied with this
separation of duties. See page 115 for additional related
party disclosures.
Market abuse directive
As required by the Market Abuse Directive, the Company
has set up a Disclosure Committee, comprising the CEO,
CFO and one other senior member of staff. The Committee
meets quarterly and on an ad hoc basis in between as
required. The Committee reviews all significant items of
business within the Group on a regular basis and maintains
an Insider List recording both those employed within 
the Group and at external advisers who may have access 
to inside information. Whenever individuals are placed 
on or removed from the List they are notified accordingly
and advised of their responsibilities.
Relations with shareholders and constructive 
use of the AGM
There should be a dialogue with shareholders based 
on the mutual understanding of objectives. The board as 
a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a satisfactory
dialogue with shareholders takes place. The board 
should use the AGM to communicate with investors and
encourage their participation.
BTG endeavours to maintain good communications 
with shareholders through formal and informal dialogue. 
The Company formally reports its results twice a year with
full year results announced in May and interim results in
November. The CEO and CFO give presentations of these
results to the Company’s institutional shareholders, analysts
and the media. The presentations are broadcast live on the
internet for the information of shareholders and are available
thereafter as an archive on the Company’s website. 
In addition, the Company prepares Interim Management
Statements that are released to the UK Listing Authority 
and are available on the Company’s website, or from the
Company on request.
The directors receive a regular investor relations briefing 
at each Board meeting giving information on the changes 
in shareholdings and any feedback from the Company’s
brokers and investors. Following the twice-yearly results
announcements, detailed feedback is obtained from
external advisers and brokers and reported to the Board,
detailing the views and reactions of investors and analysts.
The opportunity for shareholders to meet the Chairman or
Senior Independent Director, separately from the executive
directors, is available on request.
The Annual Report contains a full business review and the
interim report gives an update at the half year. Extensive
information, including annual and interim reports, interim
management statements and all press releases, is
published on the Company’s website (www.btgplc.com) 
for access by all shareholders. In addition, through the
website, individuals can register to receive electronic copies
of all Company announcements on the day they are issued. 
The AGM is the principal opportunity for private
shareholders to meet and discuss the Group’s business
with the directors and other senior management. A full
business presentation is given and there is an open
question and answer session during which shareholders
may ask questions both about the resolutions being
proposed and the business in general.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting, which will be held 
at 10.30 am on 15 July 2009, at the offices of Ashurst LLP ,
Broadwalk House, 5 Appold Street, London EC2A 2HA, is
included with this report. The Notice of the Annual General
Meeting is sent to all shareholders at least 20 working days
before the meeting. The Directors’ Report on pages 42 
and 43 summarises the main resolutions and the letter
accompanying the Notice of the Annual General Meeting
includes details of the resolutions and explanatory notes
thereon. A proxy form is enclosed with this report for use 
by those members of the Company unable to attend. Crest
members may send their proxy votes to the Company’s
Registrars electronically. 
At the AGM the number of proxy votes cast in favour,
against and withheld in respect of each resolution will be
disclosed and subsequently published on BTG’s website.
The chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees will be present at the AGM to answer
shareholders’ questions.

Corporate governance
Audit Committee and auditor
The board should establish formal and transparent
arrangements for considering how it should apply the
financial reporting and internal control principles and 
for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the
company’s auditor.
BTG has an established Audit Committee with the principal
responsibilities of overseeing financial reporting and
internal control matters and maintaining appropriate
relations with the Company’s auditor.
Details of the members of the Audit Committee, all of
whom are considered by the Company to be independent
non-executive directors, plus information on attendance, 
is set out in the table on page 44. The terms of reference 
of the Audit Committee can be found on the Company’s
website or from the Company on request. These terms 
of reference reflect the recommendations of ‘The Smith
Guidance’. At the invitation of the Chairman of the Audit
Committee, the CEO, CFO, Chairman and external auditor
attend part or all of its meetings. The Company Secretary 
or his deputy acts as secretary for the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Giles Kerr who, in the
opinion of the Board, has the necessary significant recent
and relevant financial experience. The Committee
Chairman receives additional remuneration to compensate
him for his responsibilities, as set out on page 57.
A report on the work of the Committee is set out on page 50.
Appointments to the Board
There should be a formal, rigorous and transparent
procedure for the appointment of new directors to the
board.
The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Brown.
Membership of the Committee and members’ attendance
at meetings is set out in the table on page 44. The
Committee terms of reference can be found on the
Company’s website or from the Company on request. 
The prime responsibilities of the Nomination Committee 
are reviewing the size and composition of the Board;
making recommendations to the Board on the appointment
of executive and non-executive directors, and their 
re-appointment following retirement by rotation; and 
for ensuring that succession planning is in place. The
Committee also advises the Board on matters generally
relating to Board appointments and meets as required 
but at least twice a year.
A report on the work of the Committee is set out on page 51.
Compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code
The Board considers that the Company complied in full 
with the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2009. Details of
directors’ remuneration, as required by the Combined Code
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002,
are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 64.
The Company’s auditor, KPMG Audit plc, is required to
review whether this corporate governance statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with nine of the Code’s
provisions as specified in the Listing Rules of the FSA,
relating to Accountability and Audit. Having conducted 
such a review KPMG is obliged to report if it considers 
this statement of compliance does not reflect such
compliance and the Company confirms that no such
report has been made.

Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 March 2009
A summary of matters considered at the Committee since
the last Annual Report and actions taken is shown below:
• Review of the Group’s interim results to 30 September
2008 and full year results to 31 March 2009
• Review of the reports from the external auditor on the
interim and full year results to 31 March 2009
• Review of the scope, nature, resource planning and fee
estimate for the full-year audit
• Review of trading updates issued by the Group and
amendments thereto
• Review of the valuation of the assets and liabilities
acquired as part of the Protherics acquisition
• Appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis 
for the preparation of the financial statements
• Review of risk management systems, internal controls
and fraud procedures
• Review of the disclosures relating to material risks
in the Business Review
• Assessment of the need for a dedicated internal 
audit function
• Review of monitoring process for equity portfolio 
and its valuation
• Considering report of internal review work covering
employment and company law, the listing rules 
and market abuse regulations
• Completed effectiveness review
A key role of the Committee is to undertake detailed
monitoring of the interim and annual financial statements.
As part of this review it discusses the audit findings and
auditor’s report with management and the external auditor
and considers significant judgements and issues contained
in them, whether the financial statements comply fully with
the relevant statutes and accounting standards and if they
present a balanced assessment of the Company’s financial
position and prospects. Following this discussion the
Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the results of the
Committee’s review to the full Board. The external auditor
generally meets with the non-executive directors at the
time when the half and full-year results are discussed.
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of internal controls
and risk management systems. It also reviews the scope
and results of the external audit and the independence 
and objectivity of the auditor. The Company currently has 
no dedicated internal audit function and the Committee
reviews on an annual basis as to whether this is still
appropriate. However, internal review work is carried out
each year focusing on key risk areas such as expenditure,
revenue and business processes. The results are reported
to the Committee twice a year. Internal audit compliance is
included as part of the responsibilities of each local finance
function and at least annually head office finance staff will
visit each location to conduct testing of key controls in order
to provide reports to the Audit Committee.
As part of the accounting for the acquisition of Protherics
PLC, the assets and liabilities of Protherics have to be
valued at fair value to the business. The Committee carried
out a detailed review of the valuation of the various assets
and liabilities acquired seeking input from appropriately
qualified external advisers as it deemed necessary. 
The Audit Committee reviews the overall performance of
the auditor annually and approves its terms of engagement
and remuneration. The Committee reviewed the auditor’s
proposed work plan prior to the commencement of the
audit of the results for the year to 31 March 2009 and also
reviewed the non-audit work carried out by the Company’s
auditor, KPMG Audit Plc (KPMG), to ensure that such
services do not impair its independence or objectivity.
KPMG may not be appointed to undertake any non-audit
work without the approval of the Committee where the 
cost of the work is expected to exceed £50,000. 
The auditor is appointed by the shareholders at the AGM 
to ensure its independence. The Audit Committee regularly
discusses the independence of the auditor and whether
there should be a need to rotate audit firms. Given the
relative size of BTG to that of KPMG and that the lead audit
partner is changed on a regular basis (at least every five
years), the Audit Committee is presently satisfied that
KPMG is independent in its reporting on the audit of the
Group and rotation of firms is not necessary.
At least twice a year, the Audit Committee meets with 
the auditor in the absence of the executive directors and
management.
As part of corporate governance, the Committee also
carried out a review of its effectiveness and reported 
the results and its recommendations for improvement 
to the Board.

Nomination Committee report for the year ended 31 March 2009
The Committee has continued its review of Board
membership to ensure it has the right balance of experience
and expertise as the business develops and it is Company
policy to refresh Board membership on a regular basis. 
Following the acquisition of Protherics, Rolf Soderstrom,
Finance Director of Protherics joined the BTG Board as Chief
Financial Officer and Christine Soden moved to become
Chief Operating Officer. On 31 March 2009 Christine Soden
resigned from the Board.
Purchasing Protherics brought a manufacturing and sales
operation to the Group. Recognising that the Board did not
have significant expertise in international sales, a decision
was made to recruit a non-executive director with this
experience. After undertaking a detailed search process
and interviewing a number of candidates, the Committee
recommended to the Board the appointment of James
O’Shea as a non-executive director and he joined the
Board on 2 April 2009. His biographical details may be
found on page 41. 
The Committee has employed external consultants to assist
it in making the appointments. Prior to any appointments
being made, the Committee prepares a full description 
of the role, desired skills and capabilities required for the
appointment. It interviews candidates and produces a
shortlist for a subsequent interview by all Board members. 
Following their appointment the Committee ensures that all
new directors receive a full induction programme. As part
of the induction process, the new director is given a full
briefing on the financial history of the Company and details
of operating plans, budgets and forecasts for future years.
Arrangements are also made for the director to meet with
the heads of the various business units for an in-depth
briefing on the areas in which the Company is involved. 
A briefing on corporate governance and directors’
responsibilities may also be given and the opportunity 
to attend external courses is also available.
The Committee reviews succession plans and plans for
emergency cover of key managers and directors on at least
an annual basis.
As part of corporate governance, the Committee also carried
out a review of its effectiveness and reported the results
and its recommendations for improvement to the Board.

Introduction and compliance
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration
Committee on behalf of the Board in accordance with 
the requirements of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002, and explains how the Company has
applied the principles of the Combined Code in respect 
of directors’ remuneration. 
In accordance with the regulations, a resolution inviting
shareholders to approve the report will be put to the AGM
on 15 July 2009.
The following sections have been subject to audit: directors’
emoluments, shareholdings, share awards, long-term
incentive schemes and pensions.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) has been
established by the Board which has responsibility for
executive remuneration. The Committee was chaired by
Consuelo Brooke until she resigned from the Board at the
time of the 2008 AGM. She was replaced by William
Jenkins and the Committee is comprised of independent
non-executive directors. The membership of the Committee
and attendance at meetings is detailed in the table on
page 44. The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) may attend meetings, other
than where their own remuneration is being considered,
and provide input as required. The Company Secretary 
or his deputy serves as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee’s full terms of reference, which are available
on the Company’s website or from the Company on
request, are summarised below:
• to make recommendations to, and determine on behalf
of the Board, remuneration packages for the Chairman
and each of the executive directors in accordance with
current best practice;
• to give advice and make recommendations on the
framework and broad policy for all aspects of the
remuneration of senior management and on the overall
policy for total compensation for all other employees; and
• to determine policy and advise on equity participation
schemes, employee share trust matters, pensions and
other benefits. 
Advisers to the Committee
The Committee has authority to appoint such advisers as 
it sees fit. During the year the Committee carried out a
review of advisers and as a result appointed Hay Group 
to replace Hewitt New Bridge Street to provide advice 
to the Committee. Hay Group has carried out a review 
of directors’ remuneration and long term incentive
arrangements taking account of market levels of
remuneration in comparator companies. Other than for 
the provision of advice as detailed below, the firm does 
not have any other connections with the Group. 
The Group continues to use Hewitt New Bridge Street 
to advise on other matters including remuneration matters
in general. Following the expiry of the majority of the
Company’s share schemes, Hewitt New Bridge Street has
drafted new rules and these will be presented to the AGM
for approval. The firm also assists with the total shareholder
return (TSR) performance measurement. 
The Committee has not formally appointed any US advisers
but, where relevant, the Group uses Smart & Associates 
or Radford, specialist remuneration consultants, for matters
specific to the US employment market. In Australia the
Group uses Mercer Ltd.
Matters considered by the Committee
A summary of matters considered at the Committee
meetings since the date of the last Annual Report and
actions taken is as follows: 
• A review of external advisers and the appointment 
of Hay Group
• A review of executive director remuneration and 
long-term incentive awards to the executive directors
• Following the review, approving the pay increases for the
CEO and CFO to take effect from 1 April 2009, changes

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report
The Committee continues to believe that:
• the overall remuneration package must be market
competitive
• short- and long-term variable pay should continue 
to be a substantial part of overall remuneration
• significant rewards should be available for delivering 
the Group’s short- and long-term objectives
• the structure of the remuneration package should continue
to provide significant ‘lock-in’ for the executive team
• executives should be required to build significant
shareholdings in the Company to increase alignment
with shareholders.
Base salary: Base salary takes into account the areas 
and level of responsibility together with the performance 
of the individual, benchmarked against information from
independent sources and consultants on market levels. 
In addition to considering external data, the Committee
also takes account of general pay and employment
conditions elsewhere in the Group. Salaries are reviewed
annually by the Committee and any increase for directors
has effect from 1 April in each year. 
Following the acquisition of Protherics PLC, Hay Group were
asked to carry out a full review of directors’ remuneration,
taking account of changes in the complexity and size 
of the business. As a result of this review Hay Group
recommended salary increases of 12% for each of the
executive directors. As a result, effective from 1 April 2009,
Louise Makin’s salary will increase from £367,200 to
£411,000 and Rolf Soderstrom’s salary will increase from
£232,000 to £260,000. 
Following the acquisition, a full review of benefits is taking
place for all employees of the Group, including executive
directors. Certain employees of BTG, who were in
employment prior to April 2006, were entitled to a car
allowance, which replaced company car provision which
was phased out a few years previously. As this affected
only a proportion of BTG staff and no Protherics staff, 
it was decided to merge this benefit into basic salary 
for all current recipients of the allowance. Louise Makin
received £8,400 pa and as from 1 April 2009 this has been
rolled into her basic salary. As a result, her overall base
salary is now £419,400 and she is no longer in receipt 
of a car allowance.
Remuneration policy
The policy for remuneration is that the package offered
should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate staff,
including the executive directors, of the quality and
experience required, but not more than is necessary 
for this purpose. The Group operates an annual bonus
scheme and targeted long term incentives, both subject 
to demanding performance conditions, to ensure that
variable pay comprises a significant proportion of total
remuneration, particularly for more senior employees. 
The Committee considers that the targets set for the
different elements of performance-related remuneration
are appropriate and demanding in the context of the
Group’s trading environment and the business challenges
it faces. However the Committee keeps such targets under
regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate. 
Remuneration levels are reviewed annually and the
Committee seeks to target reward packages around 
the mid-market level for companies of the size, market
capitalisation and sector in which the Group operates.
There are very few companies whose activities are 
directly comparable to the Group so the Committee and 
its advisers use a number of surveys of the employment
market from which to obtain data. 
Remuneration package
The remuneration package comprises both fixed and
variable elements. Fixed elements include base salary,
pension and other benefits; variable elements include annual
bonus and long-term incentive arrangements. Employees 
of the Group (including executive directors but excluding 
non-executive directors) are remunerated using the policy
described above. The remuneration policy is established 
by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee. 
The intention is that executive directors’ remuneration should
move towards 50% fixed and 50% variable.
Given the expansion of the business and following the
acquisition of Protherics PLC, the Remuneration Committee
has carried out a full review of executive remuneration
strategy.
Following the review the Remuneration Committee has
concluded that changes should be made to the long-term
incentives operated by the Company. Subject to
shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM, awards
under the new arrangements will be made to the
Company’s most senior executives. Full details of the
proposals are contained in the Circular which accompanies
the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report
Benefits and pension: Benefits mainly comprise the provision
of a car allowance, medical benefits and permanent health
insurance. As stated above, the car allowance was phased
out as at 31 March 2009 when it was merged into basic pay.
It will be merged into basic pay for other staff at the time 
of their annual pay review in June.
The Company closed its defined benefit final salary pension
scheme to new entrants on 31 May 2004. Subsequent 
to this date, new employees may join only at the request 
of the Company. The Scheme enables members to retire at
60, although the standard retirement age is 65, in line with
age discrimination legislation, with a maximum pension 
of two-thirds of the average of the last three years’ base
salary after 40 years’ service. For benefits accrued up to
31 May 2004, the pension is based on the final year’s base
salary. The Scheme also offers lump sum death benefits
equal to four times base salary and dependants’ pensions.
Members contribute 5% or 7% of salary depending on
whether they have chosen to accrue benefits at the rate of
an 80th or a 60th respectively. Louise Makin and Christine
Soden each contribute 7% of salary. Bonuses and other
benefits payable to executive directors and other staff are
not pensionable.
The Company makes contributions to the Scheme based 
on the recommendations of the Scheme actuary. In the
year to 31 March 2009, the Company made contributions 
of 16.8% of pensionable salary up to November 2008. 
As from December 2008 Company contributions were
increased to 17.1%. The Company had previously agreed 
to contribute a further £2.2m pa, for five years commencing
in 2006/07, in order to further improve the financial position
of the scheme. Following the completion of the valuation,
the Company agreed a new statement of funding principles
and as part of this the additional payments were increased
to £3.4m pa until 2013. It was also agreed to pay future
administration costs of the Fund and to reimburse previous
costs since 1 April 2007. As a result of this agreement, 
in the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company paid a total
of £4.2m in additional payments and a total of £0.8m 
in current and reimbursed costs.
Following the simplification provisions of the Finance Act
2004, the Company and pension fund trustees decided 
to institute an earnings cap similar to that previously 
in place under H M Revenue & Customs (HMRC) Earnings
Cap rules. This took effect from 1 April 2006 based on the
£105,600 cap in place at that time, increased annually 
by inflation (the ‘BTG Cap’). The BTG Cap for the 2008/09 
year was set at £117,600 and will be £123,600 for 2009/10. 
It was also agreed that the Company would not
compensate executives for any additional tax burden 
they might suffer as a result of these changes. 
Louise Makin and Christine Soden are members of 
the defined benefit pension scheme and are affected 
by the HMRC imposed ‘Earnings Cap’. As part of her
arrangements, Louise Makin is making additional pension
contributions to a separate Executive Pension Scheme
to which the Company made employer contributions of
£49,920 during the year (07/08: £47,962) to bring its total
contribution to 20% of salary above the BTG Cap. The
Company made employer contributions of £21,819 (07/08:
£20,496) to a SIPP for the benefit of Christine Soden, being
equal to a contribution of 20% of salary above the BTG Cap.
Rolf Soderstrom is a member of the Protherics company
defined contribution pension scheme to which the
employer contributed 20% of base salary. In the period
from 4 December 2008 when he joined the Board, the
Company paid contributions of £15,467 to the pension
scheme for his benefit.
BTG and Protherics both have defined contribution pension
schemes for the benefit of their staff. During 2009/10 
it is proposed that pension provision will be reviewed but
currently both schemes are in operation. In both cases, 
the assets of the schemes are held separately from those
of the companies.
The BTG Group Personal Pension Plan has been offered to
all new employees since the closure of the defined benefit
pension scheme and members of the latter scheme may
elect to transfer to this plan. The Company contributes
between 3% and 10% of base salary up to the BTG Cap 
to this plan, depending on seniority and levels of employee
contribution. Former Protherics employees contribute 
to a defined contribution pension scheme to which the
company contributes between 2.5% and 10% of base salary
depending on the level of employee contribution. The US
subsidiaries offer 401k Savings and Retirement Plans to
their staff with the Company contributing between 3% and
15% of base salary up to a cap, depending on levels of
employee contribution. Australian employees are offered 
a defined contribution pension scheme with the Company
contributing between 9% and 12% of base salary,
depending on the level of employee contribution.
Annual bonuses: The annual bonus incentive scheme
applies to all members of staff, including executive directors.
The intention of this bonus is to link incentives more closely 
to Group performance over the short to medium term.
Bonuses are calculated based on personal and business
performance. For the year ended 31 March 2009 bonuses
may not exceed 100% of base salary for executive directors
and 30% for other staff. Half of the bonuses earned by 
the executive directors is deferred under the Company’s
Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’) into a conditional award
over shares, to be held for three years. Normally these will
be subject to forfeiture on a time-prorated basis should they
leave the Company during the deferral period unless they
Remuneration report continued
7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:29  Page 54 55/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report
leave as a ‘good leaver’ (due to death, redundancy, or any
other permitted reason). If a participant is a ‘good leaver’
their deferred shares award will vest in full on cessation 
but may be pro-rated for time. In the event of a takeover,
scheme of arrangement, demerger or winding-up etc.,
all awards will vest in full unless the Committee determines
to pro-rate the awards for time.
Bonus objectives were set at the start of the financial 
year for both Louise Makin and Christine Soden payable
weighted 90% on a mix of Group financial, strategic and
operating performance and 10% on personal performance.
The level of bonus payable is dependent on the degree 
to which the threshold target is exceeded. 
The Committee feels that the bonus opportunity aligned
with the deferral into shares and forfeiture provisions,
together with other elements of the long-term incentive
plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package 
for the executive team.
Objectives for Louise Makin and Christine Soden in the year
to 31 March 2009 included the achievement of net revenue
and profit targets (before external R&D), cost and cashflow
management measures and personal objectives with a
focus on the creation of future shareholder value. For each
category the Committee defined threshold, target and
stretch levels. Following the acquisition of Protherics, the
Committee agreed revised objectives for the last four
months to 31 March 2009 for Louise Makin, Christine 
Soden and Rolf Soderstrom. They centred around financial,
integration and targets for growth of the business. 
Following a review the Committee recommended that
bonuses for the period be payable as to 98% for Louise
Makin, 95% for Christine Soden and 83% for Rolf
Soderstrom. Overall Louise Makin was awarded a bonus 
for the year of £359,856, Christine Soden was awarded 
a bonus for the year of £216,248 and Rolf Soderstrom was
awarded a bonus of £193,333. Half of Louise Makin’s bonus
and 40% of Rolf Soderstrom’s bonus is awarded in deferred
shares under the DSBP , the vesting of which is deferred 
for three years. Rolf Soderstrom is receiving a smaller
percentage of bonus in shares due to the different bonus
arrangements during the period he was employed by
Protherics. Christine Soden’s bonus is all payable in cash.
Business performance objectives for the executive directors
for 2009/10 focus on the achievement of targets for EBITDA,
cash generation and growth in the business. 
Other employees and senior managers were also eligible
to receive annual bonuses for the year to 31 March 2009,
ranging to a maximum of 10% to 30% of base salary
depending on seniority, and subject to the achievement 
of both business performance and personal performance
targets. Depending on seniority, a further sum equal 
to 50% of the bonus awarded may also be payable.
Long-term incentive arrangements: Executive directors 
and senior managers, together with all other employees,
are entitled to participate in the Company’s share schemes
as operated from time to time, details of which are set out
on pages 60 and 61.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the long-term
incentive plans operated by the Company and has
concluded that changes should be made. Shareholders’
approval of the changes will be sought at the AGM. 
Details of existing awards are set out below.
For awards covering the years to 31 March 2009 the
executive directors were entitled to receive annual awards
of shares with a face value of up to 100% of base salary
under the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
In setting performance conditions, it was the view of the
Committee that it was of primary importance that the
Company continued to deliver an operating profit in order to
fund R&D investment aimed at delivering future value and
returns for shareholders. In addition, generating returns 
for shareholders would also be a likely outcome from the
successful management of the strategic direction of the
business as well as delivering on other internal measures 
of performance, namely, cost control and developing the
Company’s pipeline.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report
As stated above, the Remuneration Committee has
reviewed the long-term incentive plans operated for senior
executives (including executive directors) and wishes 
to introduce a new plan, the BTG Executive Share Option 
Plan 2009 (the ‘New Plan’). The objectives of the proposed
long-term incentive arrangements are as follows:
• to place a heavier weight on longer-term performance
given the strategy to transition the business from an
R&D-focused biotech company to an earnings-driven
speciality pharma company
• to ensure that packages for the executive directors
include a strong emphasis on the absolute growth
in shareholder value (by the use of share option grants)
• to ensure that the Company is line with corporate
governance best practice through operating performance
conditions on an inter-dependent rather than
independent basis. 
Under the New Plan, participants will be granted awards 
of options the vesting of which will normally be dependent
upon performance conditions measured over a period 
of not less than 3 years. Awards will typically be limited 
to 100% of base salary under the New Plan, although, 
in exceptional circumstances, there will be an individual
limit on each award of 150% of base salary. Awards may
be satisfied using new issue shares or shares purchased 
in the market.
Performance conditions
Initially, the Remuneration Committee intends that 
awards made under the New Plan will have performance
conditions based on a combination of earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and 
on a total shareholder return (TSR) measure comparing 
the Company’s TSR with that of a peer group comprising 
FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts,
companies in the financial services sector (banking,
insurance, broking, fund management etc.) and companies
in the consumer discretionary sector (non-food retail,
media, leisure, gambling). The combination of the two
measures ensures that: 
• the rewards for achievement against the EBITDA metric
are very limited if relative TSR is materially below median;
• the matrix is more stretching than a typical additive
approach plan based 50% on relative TSR and 50% 
on a financial condition; and
• interdependent performance conditions are in line with
best practice as endorsed by the ABI.
For further details of the Plan and the matrix being used 
see the circular accompanying the Notice of the Annual
General Meeting. 
The Committee chose the following two performance
conditions for awards made under the PSP in 2006/07,
2007/08 and 2008/09 as they took into account the
Company’s relative performance as well as its strategic
objectives:
• the delivery of cumulative pre-tax profit targets (before
external R&D investment) (the ‘Profit Condition’) over 
a three-year period, where:
– No award to vest if the cumulative Profit is less than 
a floor (see below)
– 15% of the total award to vest if the cumulative 
Profit equals the floor
– 50% of the total award to vest if the Profit equals 
or exceeds the ceiling (see below)
– Vesting between these points will occur on a straight-
line basis
• the generation of an above market level of total
shareholder return relative to a peer group of companies
selected from the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding
Investment Trusts) (the ‘Index’) (the ‘TSR Condition’) where: 
– No award to vest if the TSR performance is below 
the Index
– 15% of the total award to vest if the TSR performance
equals the Index
– 50% of the total award to vest if TSR performance 
out-performs the Index by 30% or more
– Vesting between these points will occur on a straight-
line basis
The Profit Condition and the TSR Condition are measured
over a single fixed period of three years (the ‘Performance
Period’). The Committee may amend the targets and other
performance conditions for future awards having regard to
the Company’s strategy and prospects relevant at that time.
The parameters used for current awards under the PSP are
as follows:
2006/07 2007/08 2008/09
Percentage of total 
award subject to
the TSR Condition 50% 60% 60%
Percentage of total 
award subject to
the Profit Condition 50% 40% 40%
Cumulative profit floor £30m £50m £54m
Cumulative profit ceiling £50m £80m £88m

7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:29  Page 56 57/
BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Remuneration report
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that these
conditions are stretching and that the full award will only
vest if exceptional performance has been achieved.
The directors will receive awards under the PSP and the
new Plan in the coming year equal to 100% of salary under
each plan.
The Remuneration Committee proposes to offer long-term
incentives under the existing PSP to executive directors, 
the performance conditions to be the same as those to 
be awarded under the New Plan referred to above. It is
intended that certain senior executives below Board level
may also receive awards under the Company’s share plans.
External appointments
The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the
Company for executives to hold non-executive directorships
outside the Group. Any such appointments are subject 
to approval by the Board and the director may retain 
any fees payable. Louise Makin received fees, from her 
position at Premier Foods plc, of £57,000 during the year 
to 31 March 2009 (07/08: £55,000). Christine Soden and 
Rolf Soderstrom did not hold any outside directorships. 
Service contracts
The Company’s policy on directors’ service contracts is that,
in line with the best practice provisions of the Code, they
should be terminable by the Company on a maximum of
one year’s notice. Additionally, contracts do not provide for
predetermined compensation in the event of termination or
provision for enhanced payments in the event of a takeover
of the Company. The Company may terminate the contracts
of the executive directors with immediate effect by making
a payment in lieu of notice. Any payments made would be
determined by reference to normal contractual principles
with mitigation being applied wherever relevant or
appropriate.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts,
but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three
years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement,
normally for a further three-year term. The terms of
appointment do not contain any contractual provisions
regarding a notice period or the right to receive
compensation in the event of early termination. The only
exception is the Chairman whose appointment is on six
months notice unless if he is not re-elected at an AGM.
Details of contracts and letters of appointment, for directors
serving at the date of this report, are as set out below.

Non-executive directors’ fees
The Chairman, in consultation with the executive directors,
is responsible for proposing changes to the non-executive
directors’ fees. In proposing such fees, account is taken 
of similar fees paid to non-executive directors in listed
companies within the Group’s listing sector and of similar
size. The decision on fee changes is taken by the Board 
as a whole. Individual non-executive directors do not take
part in discussions on their remuneration. 
Non-executive directors do not receive benefits or pension
contributions from the Group and do not participate in any
Group incentive scheme. 
For the year ended 31 March 2009, non-executive directors
received the following annual fees. The Chairman received
£80,000 pa and each non-executive director received 
a fee of £35,000 pa. The Chairman of the Audit Committee
received a further fee of £6,000 pa and the Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee received a further fee 
of £3,000 pa to reflect the additional responsibility and
duties they undertake. 
In May 2009 the Committee reviewed the fees payable to
the Chairman, following advice from Hay Group. Following
this review it was agreed that the Chairman’s fees should
be increased by 12% to £89,600 pa as from 1 April 2009.
Hay Group also advised the Board on the fees for the 
non-executive directors. As a result the executive directors
recommended that non-executive director’s fees should
remain unchanged for this year and be subject to a further
review in May 2010.

The executive directors have a beneficial interest in ordinary shares of the Company by direct holdings and by virtue 
of their entitlements in the Company’s employee share schemes. As employees of the Group, all executive directors
also have an interest in any unallocated shares held on behalf of all employees in the BTG Employee Share Trust, which 
at 31 March 2009 amounted to 650,724 ordinary shares in the Company. The non-executive directors are not entitled 
to participate in any of the Company’s employee share schemes.
Remuneration report continued
7716 Accounts 2009.qxd  16/6/09  16:29  Page 59 Company share schemes
The Company has a number of share schemes open to all eligible employees of the Group, including the executive
directors. It also has an employee share trust, the BTG Employee Share Trust, which holds shares for the general benefit 
of all employees, including executive directors, who may eventually become legally entitled to them.
Share option schemes
The Company operates both HMRC approved and unapproved share option schemes. All the options are exercisable
between three and ten years from grant as long as certain performance criteria have been met. No payment is made 
for the grant of an option. All options are granted at an exercise price equal to the closing mid-market price on the date 
of issue. Whilst these schemes are still open to all employees, including executive directors, whether based in the UK 
or overseas, the Company has greatly reduced their use.
Performance criteria on outstanding options are as follows.
Exercise prices 
Dates of grant of awards outstanding Performance criteria
1
Prior to September 2001 254.37–1142.74p • Share price grown faster than FTSE SmallCap 
Index over period of at least three years from grant
• Improvement in earnings over period of at 
three years from grant
September 2001 to July 2005 90.00–174.50p • Share price grown faster than FTSE techMARK 
All-Share Index over period of at least three years
from grant
• Total receipts (revenue and equity realisations) 
at least 130% of those of financial year prior to grant
Post July 2005 123.25–143.50p • Performance criteria as for 2006/07 performance 
share plan awards set out on page 56
1 Both have to be achieved before options vest.
For option grants prior to September 2001, should both performance criteria not be met by the vesting date, regular re-
testing was permitted. For grants made after that date and until 1 June 2005, re-testing was permitted every six months
up to a maximum of five years after grant. If both criteria have not been met by the end of the five-year period the 
options will lapse. For grants made after 1 June 2005, no retesting has been allowed under any share option plan. 
As from 1 June 2005, a further restriction was brought in so that should any employee leave the Group but be deemed 
a ‘good leaver’ under the share scheme rules and hence be entitled to retain their option grant, their grant is subject 
to a pro-rata reduction based on the number of months employed compared with the three-year vesting period for 
the option. The maximum level of grant under the Company share option schemes, in any one year, may not exceed
300% of salary. 
The existing share option scheme expired in July 2008 on reaching its tenth anniversary so no more grants may 
be made under the scheme. As stated on page 56, it is proposed to set up a new share option plan and rules will 
be presented to the AGM on 15 July 2009 for the approval of shareholders.

Performance share plan
The Company has established a performance share scheme for the purpose of making conditional awards to executive
directors and selected full time employees below Board level. The awards are subject to the performance conditions
described on pages 55 and 56. These nil cost awards are granted under this scheme at the discretion of the Board 
on the recommendation of the Committee. Subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, awards will normally be 
pro-rated for time in the event that an award vests early upon the cessation of a participant’s office or employment 
or in the event of a takeover. 
Restricted share scheme
The Company has established a restricted share scheme for the purpose of making nil cost conditional awards to
selected full time employees below Board level. Awards are granted under this scheme at the discretion of the Board 
on the recommendation of the Committee. Subject to Remuneration Committee discretion, awards will normally be 
pro-rated for time in the event that an award vests early upon the cessation of a participant’s office or employment 
or in the event of a takeover. 
Sharesave scheme
The Company operates HMRC-approved save-as-you-earn schemes, open to all eligible employees (including executive
directors) who open an approved savings contract, to enable them to purchase shares in the Company. The options 
are exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant. 
The existing sharesave scheme expired in July 2008 on reaching its tenth anniversary so no more grants may be 
made under the scheme. It is proposed to set up a new sharesave scheme and rules will be presented to the AGM
on 15 July 2009 for the approval of shareholders. The scheme rules will include an international section to include the
Group’s Australian employees.
Stock purchase plan
The Company operates a US-style stock purchase plan for its US employees, open to all US employees who open an
approved savings contract, to enable them to purchase shares in the Company. The options are exercisable after two
years at a price not less than 85% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant. 
At the same time as renewing the other options schemes it is proposed to set up a new stock purchase plan and rules
will be presented to the AGM on 15 July 2009 for the approval of shareholders.

Options were granted for nil consideration. Sharesave options were granted on the condition that participants agree 
to enter into a monthly savings contract. During the year each director exercised 1,432 options under the sharesave
scheme.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance conditions of the share options granted to Louise Makin 
and Christine Soden. As a result 198,986 of the share options granted and due for release to Louise Makin in August 2006
will vest and 121,487 of the share options granted will be released to Christine Soden.
The executive directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s share schemes on the same basis as all other
employees of the Group. The performance conditions to which directors’ entitlements to share options are subject are
summarised on page 56. The same performance conditions apply for each director. The performance conditions were
chosen in order to further align the interests of option holders with shareholders. The Committee, with advice from 
Hewitt New Bridge Street, is responsible for assessing whether the relevant performance conditions have been achieved. 
Further to the share awards shown above, as part of their compensation at the time of joining the Company, it was
agreed that Louise Makin and Christine Soden should receive special awards under section 9.4.2(2) of the UK Listing
Authority Listing Rules which permits awards under such circumstances.

Total shareholder return
The performance of the Company’s ordinary shares compared with the FTSE SmallCap Index (excluding Investment Trusts)
(the ‘Index’) for the five-year period ended on 31 March 2009 is shown in the graph below.
This graph shows the value at 31 March 2009 of £100 invested in BTG plc on 31 March 2004 compared with £100 invested
in the Index. The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
The Company operates in a rather unusual market so it is not easy to find a specific index for comparison. However, 
the Board has chosen the Index as a comparator for its current share awards as it believes that it gives shareholders 
a reasonable comparison with the total shareholder return (TSR) of other equity investments in companies of a broadly
similar size across all sectors. The TSR performance has been measured by Hewitt New Bridge Street. 
The middle market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2009 was 124p. During the year the share price ranged from 
a low of 84p to a high of 244.5p.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the Group and Parent Company financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group 
and Parent Company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the
Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial statements 
on the same basis.
The Group and Parent Company financial statements are
required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present
fairly the financial position of the Group and the Parent
Company and the performance for that period; the
Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial
statements that references in the relevant part of that 
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are
references to their achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Parent Company and enable
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report,
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information included
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Independent auditor’s report to the members of BTG plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of BTG plc for the year
ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Group Income
Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets,
the Group and Parent Company Cash Flow Statements, 
the Group Statement of Consolidated Recognised Income
and Expense and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for 
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the EU are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report
includes that specific information presented in the Business
Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our review by 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. We consider the implications
for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the preparation 
of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain 
all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion 
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
BTG plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom and listed on the London 
Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2009 comprise 
the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest 
in associates.
The financial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 13 May 2009.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest £0.1m except where
otherwise indicated.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies approved by the 
Board and are described below.
No new accounting standards and interpretations have been adopted in the year.
Accounting standards issued but not adopted
• Amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 – Cost of an investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly-Controlled Entity or Associate
• Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements: A Revised Presentation
• IFRIC 14; IAS 19 – The Limit of a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Finding Requirements and their Interaction
• Amendments to IFRS 2 – Share Based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
• IFRIC 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes
• Amendments to IAS 23 – Borrowing Costs
• Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 – Reclassification of Financial Instruments
All of the above standards and interpretations have been endorsed by the EU and will be relevant for BTG’s results 
for the financial year ended 31 March 2010.
IFRS 8 – ‘Segmental Reporting’ is due to replace IAS 14 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The amendments
to disclosure requirements will have no effect on the reported results but may change the analysis of segmental
information contained in note 5.
The Group does not consider that any of the other standards or interpretations will have a significant impact on the
financial statements.
Going concern basis
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
This conclusion has been reached having considered the effect of liquidity risk on the Group’s ability to operate effectively.
Currently, liquidity risk is not considered a significant business risk to the Group given its level of net cash and cashflow
projections. The Group does not currently require significant levels of debt financing to operate its business. Further details
of the Group’s policies and objectives around liquidity risk are given in note 34 to the Accounts. The key liquidity risks faced
by the Group are considered to be the failure of banks where funds are deposited and the failure of key licensees or
insurers.
In addition to the liquidity risks considered above, the directors have also considered the following factors when
reaching the conclusion to continue to adopt the going concern basis:
• The Group’s principal licensees are global industry leaders in their respective fields and the Group’s royalty-generating
intellectual property is a broad portfolio of both licensees and industries; and
• The Group’s sales products are life-saving in nature, providing some protection against the current uncertain 
economic outlook.

Acquisition adjustments and reorganisation costs
The Consolidated Income Statement includes a separate column to disclose significant acquisition adjustments 
and reorganisation costs arising on the acquisition of Protherics PLC. The costs relate to the following:
• The release of the fair value uplift of inventory acquired;
• Amortisation arising on intangible assets acquired; and
• Reorganisation costs comprising redundancy, property costs and asset impairments.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.
(a) Basis of accounting
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Consolidated Financial Statements also 
comply fully with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
Details on the transition of the Company accounts to IFRS are given on pages 123 and 124.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for investments classified as available-
for-sale.
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting
policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment
in the next year are discussed in note 3.
(b) Basis of consolidation
Subsidiary undertakings
Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing
control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements
of subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences
until the date that control ceases.
Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating
policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate share of the total recognised gains and
losses of associates on an equity-accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that
significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds the carrying value of its interest in an associate,
the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and no further losses are recognised except to the extent that the Group 
has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Acquisition accounting
The purchase method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date
of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values on the date of acquisition, irrespective of the extent of any
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets,
including intangible assets acquired, is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the
Group’s share of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group.
Merger reserve
A merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration 
includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions,
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(c) Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing particular products or services
(business segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical
segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
(d) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair 
value was determined.
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, 
are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated into sterling at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in the translation reserve.
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal of the investment.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised
immediately in the Income Statement. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present
value of the quoted forward price.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(f) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on
the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and associates. In respect of business combinations that have occurred since
1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable
assets, including intangible assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and 
is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy 2(l)). In respect of associates, the carrying value of goodwill is
included in the carrying value of the investment in the associate.
(ii) Intangible assets – patents and other intellectual property
Initial recognition Intangible assets acquired as a result of a business combination are initially recognised at their fair 
value in accordance with IFRS 3 – ‘Business combinations’.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. Cost includes the cost of obtaining patent protection for intellectual
property rights (‘IPR’), the cost of acquisition of patents and the costs of the internal patent attorney specific to obtaining
patent protection. Income from patents is derived through licensing and other agreements.
Amortisation All intangible assets are amortised in a manner calculated to write off the cost, on a straight-line basis, 
over the effective life of the asset. In determining the appropriate life of the asset, consideration is given to the remaining
patent life and the expected cash generating life of the asset if different. 
In the event that a patent is abandoned, the balance of unamortised expenditure is written off immediately. If an
intangible asset is considered to have suffered impairment in value it is written down to its estimated recoverable amount
in accordance with the Group’s policy on impairment (see accounting policy 2(l)). 
Income statement disclosure Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets is included within operating expenses 
in the income statement.
Subsequent expenditure Expenditure subsequent to the initial acquisition of intangible assets is capitalised only when 
it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is
expensed as incurred.
(iii) Intangible assets – computer software
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (see accounting policy 2(l)). 
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the licence period and 
three years to write the assets down to their residual value.
(g) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy 2(l)).

(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write assets down to their residual value 
at the following annual rates:
Buildings and improvements 5–10%
Leasehold improvements 10–50%
Plant and machinery 10–15% 
Furniture and equipment 10–50%
Motor vehicles 20%
Computer hardware 20–33% 
Depreciation is not charged until the asset is brought into use. The residual value is reassessed annually. 
Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the
asset may not be recoverable. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the
carrying amount exceeds the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Any impairment charge 
is recorded in operating expenses in the income statement unless it results from a reorganisation of the Group.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These are included 
in profit/loss on sale of tangible assets in the income statement. 
(h) Investments
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group, classified as being available-for-sale, are stated at fair 
value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity, except for impairment losses and, in the case 
of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses which are taken to the income statement.
When these investments are no longer recognised as assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly 
in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using
the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
(i) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises materials, direct labour and a share 
of production overheads appropriate to the relevant stage of production. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving 
or defective items where appropriate. Net realisable value is determined at the balance sheet date on commercially
saleable products based on estimated selling price less all further costs to completion and all relevant marketing, 
selling and distribution costs. 
Inventories relating to research and development projects are fully written down in the income statement unless 
the Group considers it probable to realise economic value from their sale or use. If the circumstances that previously
caused these inventories to be written down below cost subsequently change and there is clear evidence of an 
increase in realisable value, the write down is reversed.
(j) Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest and are stated at amortised cost less impairment losses (see accounting
policy 2(l)).
(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there 
is any indication of impairment in value. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated 
(see accounting policies 2(f), 2(g) and 2(h)).
For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. In the case of equity investments, an impairment is deemed to arise when there is a significant or
prolonged decline in the fair value of the equity instrument. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Tangible fixed assets are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date and whenever there are events that
indicate that an impairment may have occurred. An impairment loss is recognised if an asset’s carrying amount exceeds
the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
Unamortised intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. All intangible assets are 
also tested for impairment whenever there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cashflows. Any impairment losses are
recognised immediately in the income statement. When assessing the recoverable amount of an intangible asset the
Group uses a risk adjusted discounted cashflow model.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective
evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in 
the income statement. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference
between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised
in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed
through the income statement. If the fair value of an investment classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase
can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the
impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in the income statement.
(m)Government grants
Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods in which the related 
costs are incurred and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the 
income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
(n) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with in the same
manner as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent 
to a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. The funds of the schemes are independent of the Group’s finances.
(ii) Defined benefit plan
For the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected 
unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. The assumptions used 
to determine the valuation are shown in note 30. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period 
in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the
statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise 
is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit
obligation, reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service
cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Assets of the pension scheme are held separately from the Group’s assets. 
(iii) Share-based payments
In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1 (First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards),
IFRS 2 (Share-based Payments) has been applied to all share-based grants made to employees after 7 November 2002
that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company, subject to certain criteria. The
fair value of options granted is recognised as an expense of employment in the income statement with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at the date of grant and spread over the period during which the employees
become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as 
an expense in any year is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. However if share options fail to
vest due to share prices not achieving the designated performance threshold for vesting, no such adjustment takes place.
(o) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect
is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
A charge for restructuring costs is taken to the income statement when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs
are not provided for.
(p) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
(q) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts received or receivable in respect of the sale of goods and services to customers during 
the year, net of trade discounts given and value added tax, and in respect of licence agreements and research and
collaboration agreements.
A description of the various elements of revenue and the associated accounting policies is given below:
Licence agreements
Revenue from licence agreements is credited to the income statement on an accruals basis based on royalty periods
completed in the financial year. Up-front, non-refundable licence down payments where the Group has met all its
obligations are credited to the income statement on signature of the relevant agreement. Other conditional payments 
are credited to the income statement as the Group becomes entitled to them, usually on the achievement of specific
technical or regulatory milestones stipulated in the agreement.
A ‘paid-up’ licence typically involves a fixed one-off payment by the licensee for freedom from suit by the Group rather
than ongoing milestone or royalty payments. Where there is no ongoing obligation on the Group, the receipt is credited 
to income when the Group becomes entitled to it. If the Group has continuing obligations, such as to maintain the patents,
revenue is recognised in line with the ongoing performance obligation.
Outright sales or assignments of IPR are treated as disposals of non-current assets.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Products 
The Group recognises revenue for product sales when each condition of IAS 18, paragraph 14 is wholly-satisfied. 
Where sales arrangements specify a second element of revenue contingent upon a specified event, this revenue is not
recognised until this event has occurred and it is certain that the economic benefit triggered by this event will flow to the
Group. In cases where product is sold to a customer with a right of replacement, the Group views the transaction as a
multi-element arrangement and a portion of the value from the sale is deferred and allocated to the replacement right
based on the fair value of the replacement right.
Upfront and milestone payments
Non-refundable upfront and milestone payments are deferred and recognised as the earnings process is completed.
Where the Group has performance obligations, upfront payments are deferred over the period in which these obligations
are satisfied. In determining the performance obligations under the contract, consideration is given as to whether
elements of the obligations meet the criteria for separate accounting. The Group applies the substantive milestone
method in accounting for subsequent milestone payments. Milestone payments that are considered substantive are
recognised into income in the year in which they are received. Milestones that do not satisfy the criteria to be considered
as substantive are amortised over the remaining period in which the Group expects to fulfil its performance obligations
under the agreement. The Group considers the following when assessing whether a milestone is considered substantive:
• Are the milestone payments non-refundable?
• Does the achievement of the milestone involve a degree of risk that was not reasonably assured at the inception 
of the arrangement?
• Is substantive effort involved in achieving the milestone?
• Is the amount of the milestone payment reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with 
the achievement of the milestone? 
• How does the time that passes between the payments compare to the effort required to reach the milestone?
Out-licensed product royalties 
Royalty income is generated by sales of products incorporating the Group’s proprietary technology. Royalty revenues 
are recognised once the amounts due can be reliably estimated based on the sale of underlying products and
recoverability is assured. Where there is insufficient historical data on sales and returns to fulfil these requirements, 
for example in the case of a new product, the royalty revenue will not be recognised until the Group can reliably 
estimate the underlying sales. 
(r) Research and development
Research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure incurred on development projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) is
recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will generate future economic benefit, considering
factors including its commercial and technological feasibility, status of regulatory approval, and the ability to measure
costs reliably. Other development expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development expenditure
previously recognised as an expense is not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Development expenditure
that has a finite useful life and which has been capitalised is amortised from the commencement of the commercial
production of the product on a straight line basis over the period of its expected benefit. 
No development expenditure has been capitalised in either the current or prior year.
Property, plant and equipment used for research and development is depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy.
(s) Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the direct costs incurred in manufacturing and bringing products to sale in the market and revenue
sharing costs.
Revenue sharing costs represent amounts due to licensors or assignees of technology upon recognition by the Group 
of amounts due from a licensee. They are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the individual agreements
held with respect to the relevant technology in line with revenue recognition.

2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
(t) Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability
to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Such assets are depreciated over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the length of the lease. Assets purchased under hire purchase agreements are accounted
for similarly, except that these assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
(u) Financial income
Net financial income comprises interest income less interest payable during the year, calculated using the effective 
interest rate method, and fair value adjustments relating to foreign exchange forward contracts.
(v) Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiary
undertakings to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised.
(w) BTG Employee Share Trust
Included within the Group’s financial results are those of the BTG Employee Share Trust, the costs of which are expensed
within the financial statements of the Trust as incurred.
In the Company accounts the cost of BTG shares held by the Trust is deducted from shareholders’ funds.
(x) Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within 
its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company
will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Management and the Audit Committee discussed and agreed the selection, application and disclosure of the Group’s
critical accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the accounts.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, described in note 2, management and the Audit Committee
discussed and agreed the selection, application and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and the
estimates used in the preparation of the accounts.
Revenue recognition
As described in note 2, it is the Group’s policy to recognise non-refundable upfront payments over the period in which any
performance obligations are satisfied. In December 2008, the Group acquired Protherics which had received £16,300,000
from AstraZeneca UK Ltd in a Patent and Know How Licence Agreement for CytoFab™. The Group considers that its
obligations under the licence agreement consist of the licence, provision of development services, regulatory support and
steering committee participation. The Group considers that the development services and the regulatory support it can
supply will cease with the approval of CytoFab™ by the FDA and while the steering committee continues to operate after
product approval by the FDA, the Group has received confirmation that its participation after this date would become
voluntary. Based on the clinical development plan to be undertaken by AstraZeneca, the Group currently estimates that its
performance under the agreement will be completed over the period to December 31, 2012 and, therefore, is recognising
the £16,300,000 on a straight-line basis, over the estimated performance period.
In determining the revenue recognition period, management considered the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue
per IAS 18, Revenue, and is satisfied that all requirements have been met by the Group.
Acquisitions
Judgements have been made in respect of the identification of intangible assets made on acquisitions based on 
pre-acquisition forecasts, analysis and negotiations. In addition to the judgements and estimates made in establishing
the intangible assets acquired and their value, in certain instances, these assets are in development and are only
amortised once the development phase has been completed, although these assets are subjected to impairment review
in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 2(l).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date,
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which goodwill or other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation
requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate present value. See note 2(l) for further details.
Fair value of listed and unlisted investments 
Note 2(l) explains the basis for estimating the fair value of listed and unlisted investments. 
Pension assumptions
Note 30 details the key actuarial assumptions used to establish the pension funding position. These are the best
estimates chosen based in historic experience and future expectations. Should the discount rate used to establish 
scheme liabilities or the long-term expected rate of return on investment vary significantly then the pension fund 
valuation would be impacted.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY continued
Carrying value of patents and other IPR
Patents and other IPR with a carrying value of £165.8m are included in the financial statements. The Group carries out
twice yearly portfolio reviews to establish the economic value of each technology in the patent portfolio. If the economic
value of a technology is believed to be lower than the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced accordingly. The
economic value is based on estimated future income potential, taking into account technical and commercial risks. The
tests require an estimation of future marketability or value-in-use. There is a risk that should these estimations require
significant downward revision, there would be a material adverse impact on the income statement in any one year.

5 BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS
Segment information is presented in respect of the Group’s business and geographical segments with the primary 
format, business segments, being based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s-length basis.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be
allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses,
and corporate assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected 
to be used for more than one period.
Business segments 
The Group comprises the following main business segments:
• Life sciences – The acquisition, development and commercialisation of pharmaceutical and other medical technologies.
• Technology commercialisation – The commercialisation of technology outside the life sciences area.
Geographical segments
The life sciences and technology commercialisation business segments are managed on a worldwide basis, but 
operate with customers in four principal geographical areas, these being the US, UK, Europe (excluding UK) and Asia.
In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue for royalties is based on the
geographical location of customers. Segment assets are based on the geographical location of the assets.

In the year ended 31 March 2008, employment costs associated with research and development activities amounting

the increasing focus of the business on research and development activities, the Group now considers that it is more
appropriate to shows such costs as research and development expenditures and accordingly have restated the
expenditures for the prior year.

The Group considers reorganisation costs to be those resulting from decisions to rationalise both operating sites and
business operations.
1 Following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December 2008, the Group undertook a restructuring to integrate and align
the two businesses. The principal costs incurred relate to redundancy, property costs associated with onerous leases
and impairment of assets made redundant as part of the restructuring. The majority of costs will have been paid 
within a year of completion of the acquisition, although commitments on onerous leases extend for four years (note 33).
The £10.9m total charge to the Income Statement arises in the Life Sciences business segment.
2 In the prior year, the Group reassessed the economics of the existing facility for the manufacture of products for
Varisolve
®
given the design improvements and outsourcing of the manufacturing process, which triggered an
impairment review. The Group made full provision against the carrying value of this asset. This was done on the basis
that the fair value less costs to sell of the asset was deemed to be nil. In addition, a provision of £0.6m was made 
in relation to an onerous lease in respect of the Wrexham site. This provision was triggered by the decision to exit 
the Wrexham facility. The £8.1m total charge to the Income Statement in the prior year arose in the UK Life Sciences
business segment.

segment and £0.2m to Technology Commercialisation.

amounted to £2.6m. Between 4 December 2008 and 31 March 2009, £2.3m of the fair value adjustment was
incorporated within the cost of sales as the inventory was sold to customers. There were no fair value adjustments

The deferred tax asset, which relates to trading losses incurred in Australia, has been recognised in the financial
statements following the development of the Group’s products in prior years and the directors are of the opinion, based
on recent and forecast trading, that the level of profits in Australia in the forthcoming years will lead to the realisation 
of this asset.
In addition to the losses on which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, the Group has additional taxable losses
and other timing differences in the UK and the US which arose as a result of the research and development incurred
during the start-up of the Group’s activities. These losses are available for offset against future taxable profits in these
territories. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses and other temporary differences 
since there is uncertainty as to how quickly such losses and temporary differences would be utilised and consequently 
the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. The total amount of deferred tax asset not recognised, measured 
at 28% is approximately:

Impairment review – goodwill and intangible assets
An impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets was conducted as at 31 March 2009. 
Goodwill relates to one cash generating unit, being the Protherics business acquired on 4 December 2008 (see note 39).
There has been no material change in the underlying value in use of the Protherics business assets acquired since the
date of acquisition.
The impairment review required the estimation of the recoverable amount based on the value in use of the underlying 
cash generating unit. Near-term projections are based on the Group’s approved three-year plan. Longer-term projections
through to the end of an asset’s estimated useful economic life are included due to the long-term nature of pharmaceutical
product development and product life cycles. The main assumptions on which the forecast cashflows were based 
include market share and gross margin for the marketed products, individual probability-adjusted cashflow models for 
all in-process R&D and an assessment of the net present value of future net royalty income for licensed patents. 
Cashflow projections for all assets were included for a period equal to the estimated useful economic life of the assets. 
No terminal values were applied. All cashflows were discounted back to present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
of between 10% (for net royalty income) and 24% (for in-process R&D) which takes into account the individual risk
characteristics of each particular asset and related income stream.
For marketed products, near term sales projections are based on past experience, adjusting for expected changes 
in future conditions, including those anticipated as a result of our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment 
of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry. Long-term sales projections follow a well established sales profile 
for products in this industry. 
For in-process R&D the key assumptions are the chance of product launch, market share and overall market size. Industry
average statistics are used to assess the chance of product launch, taking in to account the stage of development of the
asset, the therapeutic area targeted and any known specific characteristics of the asset. Market share and overall market
size are assessed by reference to independent industry market reports.
In assessing whether there has been an impairment the net present value of future cashflows is compared to the carrying
value in the accounts.

Impairment review – intangible assets
Note 17 contains details of the Group’s impairment review which was conducted on goodwill and intangible assets as at
31 March 2009. As a result of this review, impairment charges of £1.3m have been made against individual assets within
‘Patents and other IPR’ as the assessed value in use was lower than the carrying value. The impairment charge is included
within ‘operating expenses’ in the income statement. In addition, £0.9m of impairment charges have been reflected through
‘Reorganisation costs’ in the income statement as the impairments arose as a direct result of management decisions to limit
future investment in certain in-process R&D assets following the acquisition of Protherics PLC and a subsequent detailed review
of all in-process R&D assets within the Group’s portfolio. All impairment charges relate to the Life Sciences business segment.

At 31 March 0.3 0.7
During the prior year, the Group’s investment in Senexis Ltd temporarily increased above 50%, resulting in its consolidation
for a short period of time and a transfer out of associates of £0.8m. Dilution of BTG’s shareholding back below 50%
resulted in a loss of £0.3m being recognised in the income statement in the prior year and a lower transfer value of the
investment back into associates of £0.5m.
The Board of Mesophotonics was actively in negotiations with third parties for the sale of its key business assets at
31 March 2008. For this reason the Group’s investment in Mesophotonics was transferred to current assets as at that date
and is within the technology commercialisation business segment. See note 23 for further information.

Other investments comprise non-current equity investments which are available-for-sale that are recorded at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the
relevant stock exchange price. The fair value of unlisted investments is estimated to be the valuation following the latest
round of equity funding or cost if no valuation is available.
Where the fair value of an available-for-sale asset is impaired, the impairment charge is recognised in the income
statement together with any amounts recycled from the fair value reserve (see note 25). These impairments initially arise
from the prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent 
to which any further decline in fair value is immediately taken to the income statement. During the year, £0.5m was
recycled from the fair value reserve on the sale or impairment of investments.

Investment in associates classified as held for sale
The Group’s investment in Mesophotonics Ltd was reclassified as held for sale at 31 March 2008 as the Mesophotonics
Board was actively engaged in discussions with third parties that led to a sale of the company’s Intellectual Property
during April 2008. Mesophotonics Ltd is in a Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (‘MVL’). BTG has estimated the fair value 
of its investment in Mesophotonics to be £0.1m at 31 March 2009 based on the expectation of likely returns from the MVL.

of share options and rank pari passu in all respects with existing ordinary shares.
Share options and warrants
Details of outstanding share options are set out in note 31. 
At 31 March 2009, there were unexercised warrants for 100,000 ordinary shares in Enact Pharma Ltd, a subsidiary 
of Protherics which was acquired by the Company in December 2008. These warrants expire on 9 July 2012 and are
exercisable at 30p per ordinary share of Enact Pharma Ltd. Should these be exercised, the Company is entitled to
repurchase these shares for consideration of 19,846 ordinary shares in BTG plc which creates an equivalent exercise 
price of 151.2p per ordinary BTG share.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements
of foreign operations that are not integral to the operations of the Company.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments. If an
investment suffers impairment due to a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value below acquisition cost, its share
of the reserve is recycled to the income statement and any further declines in fair value of that investment are no longer
charged to the reserve but immediately taken to the income statement.

Contracts with negative fair values:
Forward foreign exchange contracts 7.3 0.4
Derivative instrument liabilities 7.3 0.4
The Group utilises foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cashflows. At 31 March 2009
the Group had forward contracts to sell US$56m in the period to February 2010 at rates in the range £1:$1.98–£1:$1.44
(2008: Sell US$41.1m in the period to February 2009 at rates in the range £1:$1.98–£1:$2.04). The fair value of these
derivative financial instruments has been marked to market at 31 March 2009 at £7.3m (31 March 2008 £0.4m). 
The fair value loss for the year associated with these forward contracts has been included within ‘net financial expense’.
A 5% weakening of the US$ as at 31 March 2009, all other variables being unchanged, would result in a reduction 
of £2.0m being shown within ‘Net financial expense’ in the Income Statement and an associated fair value liability 
of £5.3m within ‘Derivative instruments’. A 5% strengthening of the US$ would have had the equal and opposite effect 
on the Income Statement and would have increased ‘Derivative instruments’ to £9.3m.

All finance leases were acquired on acquisition of Protherics. It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its plant and
equipment under finance leases. The average lease term on inception is three to five years with an option to purchase
equipment for a nominal amount at the conclusion of the lease agreement. 
For the year ended 31 March 2009, the average effective borrowing rate for the Group was 7.1% (2008: nil). Interest rates
are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into 
for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
The Group’s lease obligations are denominated in sterling.
The obligations under hire purchase agreements for the Group are secured by a charge over the leased assets.
30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES
Defined benefit scheme
A funded defined benefit final salary pension scheme is in operation for all eligible staff of the Group. Scheme funds are
administered by trustees independently of the Group. Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits
accruing at the rate of one sixtieth or one eightieth of salary, dependent on the employee’s personal level of contribution,
with a maximum of 40 years service. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme has a history of raising
pensions in line with price inflation and these increases are reflected in the measurement of the obligation.
Following the simplification provisions of the Finance Act 2004, the Company and pension fund trustees decided to
institute an earnings cap similar to that previously in place under HM Revenue & Customs Earnings Cap rules. This took
effect on 1 April 2006 and was based on the £105,600 cap in place at that time, increased annually by inflation (the 
‘BTG Cap’). The BTG Cap for the year to 31 March 2009 was £117,600 and from 1 April 2009 has been set at £123,600.
The defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants as from 1 June 2004, although under certain conditions new
employees may still join at the request of the Company. At the same time, a review of benefits was carried out. Following
this review, employees in the defined benefit scheme were offered the opportunity to increase their contributions to 
7% in order to retain the previous accrual rate of a sixtieth of pensionable salary up to the BTG Cap or to maintain their
contribution rate at 5%, which would result in their future accrual rate reducing to an eightieth. In addition, the pension
payable is calculated on the average of the last three years’ salary rather than the final year’s salary as previously. 
Past benefits were unaffected by this change.

30 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES continued
A full independent actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation scheme
is carried out every three years by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method, although, following a change 
of advisor in the year to 31 March 2008, the triennial review was brought forward one year to be carried out as at 
1 April 2007. This valuation was carried out by David Jones, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The results of this valuation
were updated to the accounting date by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS 19. 
The Group agreed with the pension fund trustees to make special contributions to the fund. In 08/09 the Group
contributed an additional £4.2m and has also agreed to make additional contributions of approximately £3.3m pa 
for the next four years in order to improve the financial position of the scheme. The estimated amount of contributions
expected to be paid to the plan during 09/10 is £3.6m (08/09 actual: £5.0m).
The expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ended 31 March 2009 was 5.5% pa (07/08: 5.5%). This rate is
derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term rate of return on each of the asset classes in which the scheme
was invested at 31 March 2009, based on the plan’s long-term investment strategy at that date.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used for the plan:

The cost has been included in administrative expenses. 
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the
respective expected return on separate asset classes. The expected rate of return on government bonds has been based
on long-term yields at the accounting date. For corporate bonds, the expected return has been based on long-term yields
at the accounting date adjusted for the risk of default and downgrade in the future. The long-term returns on equities are
assumed to be 3.75% pa in excess of the expected returns on long dated gilts.
The actual return on scheme assets for the year was a loss of £2.9m (07/08: £4.5m).
A reconciliation of the present value of the defined benefit obligation is as follows:

In accordance with the transitional provisions for the amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ in December 2004, 
the disclosures above are determined prospectively from 2004.
The estimated amount of regular employer contributions expected to be paid to the scheme during the financial year
ended 31 March 2010 is £0.3m.
Defined contribution scheme
The Group offers defined contribution pension schemes both for its UK, US and Australian employees. The total income
statement charge in relation to these schemes was £0.8m (07/08: £0.2m).
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit pension scheme, a new defined contribution scheme was offered 
to new entrants employed by an existing BTG Group company. This was replaced by a Group Personal Pension Scheme
as from 1 April 2006. Members of the existing defined benefit final salary scheme may elect to transfer to this scheme.
The Group contributes between 3% and 10% of base salary up to the BTG Cap to this scheme, depending on seniority 
and levels of employee contribution.
Qualifying UK employees who were employed by Protherics and its subsidiaries benefit in a defined contribution
retirement benefit scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the
control of the trustees. Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions made by the 
Group fully vesting, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of the forfeited contributions.
Eligible employees of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries are members of externally operated defined contribution
schemes. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these schemes is to make the specified contributions.
31 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Share options
The Group makes awards under an equity-settled share option plan that entitles employees to purchase shares in the
Company. Grants have been made to employees on a number of occasions under the current plan since it was set up 
in 1998, subject to amendments made to the plan in 2001 and 2005. In accordance with the rules of the plan, options are
granted at the market price of the shares on the date of grant with a vesting period of generally three years. They may
only be exercised upon the attainment of certain performance criteria. If the performance criteria are not met by the date
specified at the time of grant, the options do not vest and will lapse. If the options remain unexercised after a period of
ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group
before the options vest unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered to be a ‘good
leaver’. In this case their options remain exercisable for a limited period of time. For further details see the Remuneration
Report on pages 52 to 64.

Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based compensation charge, a binomial lattice option pricing
model has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows.

Risk-free interest rate 3.7%–5.8% 3.7%–5.8%
Dividend yield Nil Nil

• Restricted share awards 2–3 years 2–3 years
• Section 9.4.2(2) awards 3 years 3 years
• Performance share plan 3 years 3 years
• Deferred share bonus plan 3 years 3 Years
Weighted average fair value for share option plan grants in the year – 67.2p

Weighted average fair value for performance share awards in the year 106.0p 88.5p
Weighted average fair value for deferred share bonus awards in the year 121.2p 123.2p
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life 
of the share options or restricted shares), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly-available
information.
Share options are granted under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition. Service and 
non-market conditions are not taken into account in calculating the fair value measurement of the services received. 
Performance shares are awarded under a service condition, a non-market condition and a market condition. Service 
and non-market conditions are not taken into account in calculating the fair value measurement of the services received.
As explained in the Remuneration Report, certain of the share options and performance shares have a market-based
performance condition, such that the Company’s share price over the performance period will be compared with the
performance of the techMARK (All Share) or FTSE SmallCap (excluding Investment Trusts) indices (depending on the 
index chosen for the specific award) on the date of grant. If the Company’s share price at least matches the performance 
of the relevant index over the vesting period, the market-based performance condition will be considered to have been
achieved. The fair value of an award of shares under the share option and performance share plans have been adjusted
to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about
volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the relevant index and which incorporates into the valuation the
interdependency between share price and index performance. This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the
share price at the date of grant.
Restricted shares are awarded to certain key management under a service condition and a non-market performance
condition. There are no market conditions related to the restricted share awards.

Restricted share awards
The Company established a restricted share scheme for the purpose of making awards to selected members of senior
management below Board level. The vesting period is either two or three years. Awards are forfeited if the employee
leaves the Group before the awards vest, unless the conditions under which they leave are such that they are considered
to be a ‘good leaver’; in which case their award is released following their departure. For further details see the

In addition to the options in BTG plc, at the point of acquisition, options remained outstanding in Protherics under its
unapproved, approved and sharesave plans as well as certain individual options. All options had vested at the point 
of acquisition and thus the Group has not experienced a share based payment charge in respect of these options.
Should these options be exercised, the newly issued shares in Protherics would be exchanged for shares in BTG plc 
at a ratio of 0.291 BTG plc ordinary share for each Protherics ordinary share.

32 BTG EMPLOYEE SHARE TRUST
The Group includes an employee share trust, the BTG Employee Share Trust (the ‘Trust’), which was established in
Guernsey in 1992. It holds shares for the general benefit of all employees who may eventually become legally entitled to
them. At 31 March 2009 the Trust held 1,436,024 (07/08: 1,298,831) shares in BTG plc and a further 12,596 (07/08: 12,596)
shares in Torotrak plc. The Trust may distribute these shares to employees of the Group on the recommendation of the
Company. These distributions may be as a result of awards under Section 9.4.2(2), the Restricted Share Scheme, the
Performance Share Plan or the Directors’ Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
At 31 March 2009 the Trust has 240,000 shares set aside under the Restricted Share Scheme, 245,321 shares under the
Performance Share Plan and a further 299,979 under the Directors’ Deferred Share Bonus Plan.

Lease provisions relate to onerous leases and represent the net present value of future obligations, not covered by income
from tenants, both in the UK and US offices of the Group (see note 2(l)).
The provision for reorganisation costs arises as a result of the Group’s rationalisation activities following the acquisition 
of Protherics on 4 December 2008 (note 39). The provision principally comprises redundancy and other site closure costs.
34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Overview
The Group has exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks from its use of financial instruments. This note sets out the
Group’s key policies and processes for managing these risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a licensee fails to meet its contractual obligations or a customer fails 
to pay for goods and services received. The Group’s primary objective with respect to credit risk is to minimise the risk 
of default by licensees or customers.
A substantial element of the Group’s revenue is derived from royalties which are only payable if a licensee is generating
income from sales of licensed products. In such instances the Group’s exposure to credit risk is considered to be inherently
relatively low, although it is influenced by the unique characteristics of individual licensees. Approximately 45% of the
Group’s recurring royalties are derived from one licensee who has held a licence for six years. The Group’s policy is to
provide against bad debts on a specific licence by licence basis.
The majority of the product revenue is currently generated from sales to one customer in the US Management are
constantly in communication with this customer and monitor both sales to and payments from this customer to minimise
the credit risk exposure.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its
liabilities as they fall due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group has limited debt facilities, in the form of assets held under finance leases and a small bank loan, but has
substantial cash balance to fund its operations.
The Group’s policy is to place surplus cash resources on short-term fixed interest deposits, to the extent that cash flow 
can be reasonably predicted. Term deposits are denominated in UK sterling with institutions rated as A or higher by both
Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.

BTG plc Annual Report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings in financial instruments. The Group has little exposure to interest rate
risk other than that returns on short term fixed interest deposits will vary with movements in underlying bank interest rates.
The Group’s principal market risk exposure is to movements in foreign exchange rates. 
Foreign currency risk
The Group has several overseas subsidiary undertakings, the revenues and the expenses of which are denominated 
in local currencies, these being US$ and Australian dollars (A$). As a result, the Group’s sterling income statement,
balance sheet and cashflows may be affected by movements in sterling exchange rates with these currencies. 
The Group’s primary objective with respect to managing foreign exchange risk is to provide certainty over the value 
of future cashflows.
A significant element of the Group’s revenue is denominated in US$ with the remainder split between sterling, euros, 
yen and other currencies. The majority of the Group’s operating expenses are in sterling along with smaller elements in
US$ and A$. Where possible, anticipated foreign currency operating expenses are matched to foreign currency revenues.
The excess exposure over and above this natural hedge, to the extent that cash flows are predictable, is managed using
forward contracts (see note 27).
Sensitivity analysis
A 5% weakening of the US$ at 31 March 2009 would have resulted in increased equity and profit or loss by the amounts
shown below:
31 March 31 March
2009 2008
£m £m
Profit or loss 0.5 0.3
Equity 0.9 –
Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to mitigate partially against increased interest rates whilst maintaining a degree of flexibility to benefit
from decreasing rates of interest by holding a mix of fixed and floating rate financial liabilities. The Group seeks to
maximise the amount of interest income from its cash balances by using a variety of short-term, fixed high-interest
deposit and money-market accounts
Market price risk
It is, on occasion, deemed appropriate to take equity stakes in early-stage companies utilising the Group’s technology 
as part of the overall licensing arrangement and small loans may be granted to these companies to further technology
development. These investments will be realised at an appropriate time in the development cycle. Regular reports are
made to the Board on the status of investments. These investments form part of the Group’s overall technology portfolio
and do not materially affect liquidity.

Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity. The Group’s objectives when managing 
capital are: 
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future 
benefits for inventive sources and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group’s capital and equity ratio are shown in the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry.
Financial instruments

34 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued
Net gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities
Foreign exchange losses of £0.9m (07/08: gains of £0.3m) were recognised within Operating profit in relation 
to settlement of trade receivables and payables.
The Group recognised a fair value loss of £4.9m (07/08: loss of £0.5m) relating to forward foreign exchange contracts
within ‘Net financing expense’.
£0.5m of previously recognised fair value losses were recycled from the fair value reserve within equity in relation 
to investments sold or impaired during the year. During 07/08 £0.3m fair value losses were recognised within equity 
in relation to investments held at fair value. 
Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments
reflected in the table.
Other investments
These comprise both listed and unlisted investments, available-for-sale. The figure recorded in the balance sheet 
is the best estimate of fair value.
Borrowings
These consist of bank and other loans along with obligations under finance leases. The fair values of such balances 
are estimated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents
Trade payables and receivables have a remaining life of less than one year so their value recorded in the balance 
sheet is considered to be a fair approximation of fair value.
35 OPERATING LEASES
Total non-cancellable operating lease rentals are due in the following periods:

Within one year 2.1 – 2.6 –
Between two and five years 4.3 – 1.1 –
After five years –– ––
6.4 – 3.7 –
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable for certain of its office properties, plant and equipment under 
non-cancellable operating lease agreements. Vehicle, plant and equipment leases have lease terms between one and
five years with no option to extend nor purchase at expiry of the lease period.
The Group leases varying offices and facilities in London, Runcorn, Philadelphia, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Australia.
These leases have terms of between one month and five years with the exception of certain leases in London where 
the Group has exercised a break clause on two of its leases and these two leases expire in the forthcoming year.
The leases in Nashville, Salt Lake City, Australia and London contain options to extend for a further three, three, five and
five years respectively. In the event of renewal, the lease contracts contain market review clauses. None of the property
leases provide the Group with an option to purchase the leased asset at the expiry of the lease period.

35 OPERATING LEASES continued
The Group has entered into sub-leasing agreements with third parties for space in its some of its UK and US offices.
Rental of £2.0m was receivable under these agreements in the year ended 31 March 2009 (2008: £1.5m). The total future
minimum lease payments expected to be received over the respective terms of the sub-leases is £0.5m (07/08: £2.3m).
This is analysed as follows:

Within one year 0.1 1.9
Between two and five years 0.4 0.4
0.5 2.3
In the UK, the Group signed a sublease in March 2007 to provide a managed office to its tenant. The expiry of this
sublease coincides with the break in the Group’s own lease in 2009. In the US, a tenant took occupancy of the space 
in June 2006, with minimal fit-out expenditure incurred by the Group. The expiry of this sublease coincides with the expiry
of the Group’s own lease in 2011.
36 OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS
The Group has entered into agreements with a number of early-stage companies and venture capital funds. At 31 March
2009 the Group is committed to invest £1.3m under these agreements (07/08: £1.5m). 
As with any business whose core assets are intellectual property, the Group will from time to time resort to litigation or
threats of litigation, or other legal processes, to defend its rights. Litigation costs are regarded as a cost of doing business
and will vary from year to year. In the current year the Group incurred £0.1m in litigation costs (07/08: £0.1m).
The Company has entered into an agreement to guarantee payments under the lease of a US subsidiary undertaking.
The Company has provided a guarantee to certain subsidiary undertakings in respect of the BTG Pension Scheme to make
payments to the Scheme up to a maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to 
the assets of the Scheme, would result in the Scheme being at least 105% funded on the date on which any liability arose,
calculated on the basis set out in section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004, were a valuation to be conducted at that date.

39 ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS
On 4 December 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Protherics PLC (subsequently renamed
Protherics Ltd), a listed UK Group, in exchange for 104,044,710 new BTG plc ordinary share of 10p each, giving a fair value of
consideration of £171.3m (based on the share price of £1.61 in existence at the time of acquisition). No cash consideration was
paid. Protherics Ltd is the parent company of the Protherics Group, a leading international biopharmaceutical company
focused on critical care and cancer. The acquisition of the Protherics Group provides the platform to create a self-sustaining
specialty pharmaceuticals business. This transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
Details of the net assets acquired are set out in the table below:

The goodwill arising on acquisition resulted from assets which could not be recognised separately including early stage
pipeline products and a highly skilled workforce. The fair value adjustments are provisional as the fair value review has 
not been wholly completed. Any adjustments to the above values will be incorporated into the Group’s interim financial
statements 2009/10.
The main elements of the significant provisional fair value adjustments are described below:
• Intangible assets in respect of the marketed products, in-process research and development and contractual
relationships in accordance with IFRS 3 – Business Combinations
• Revaluation of inventory reflecting profit accrued up to the stage of production at the time of the transaction
• Deferred tax liabilities in relation to the acquired intangible assets over and above £18.2m of deferred tax assets 
in recognition of acquired accumulated tax losses
Protherics Group contributed revenue of £13.4m and a loss of £5.3m in the period from acquisition to 31 March 2009. 
If the acquisition of Protherics had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year
would have been £103.7m and Group loss attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £23.8m.

certain accounting and valuation methods applied in the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with the recognition

Company’s financial statements. The Company is required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 31 March 2009,
and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at the date of transition. In line
with the Group financial statements, the Company has adopted an effective date of transition to IFRS of 1 April 2005. 
IFRS 1 provides a number of optional exemptions on transition to IFRS, of which the Company has adopted the following:

11 ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) FOR COMPANY ACCOUNTS
Explanation of the Transition to IFRS
This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under IFRS. The following disclosures are
required in the year of transition. The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2008
and the date of transition to IFRSs was 1 April 2005.
Differences between IFRS and UK GAAP impacting on BTG plc
The principal effects of IFRS on the financial statements of the Company are as follows:
• Presentation – IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements
The presentation format of IFRS is different from UK GAAP and the illustrative financial information herein is designed
to assist the reader to understand these changes.
• Share-based payments – IFRS 2
IFRS 2 required a charge for share awards to be included in the financial statements a year earlier that FRS 20, the
standard used under UK GAAP . An adjustment is required to adjust the existing charge to be in line with IFRS 2.

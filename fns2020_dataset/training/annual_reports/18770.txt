Inland Homes is an established land regeneration business, 
focused on developing sites in southern England for residential 
and mixed use projects. Our foundations have been built on a 
proactive and decisive approach to identifying the right land 
opportunities, and our ability to navigate the complex planning 
system and maximise the potential of the final development.
Our versatile structure, relatively small team, local insight 
and opportunistic approach give us a competitive advantage, 
ensuring we can react fast to secure the sites we want at a price 
that works. Once secured, our knowledge of and relationships 
with local authorities, and the wealth of experience in our land 
team, is reflected in our 100% record of securing planning 
consent for our sites.
Our ambitious developments, combining style, comfort and 
sustainability for a wide social demographic, deliver for our 
business, our stakeholders, our shareholders and the local 
community. 
Increasingly, we are utilising our own land bank to grow as 
a housebuilder and this growth will continue to change our 
revenue profile.
Land Portfolio
The land portfolio consists of 2,306 plots across the 
south of England, owned, controlled or managed by 
Inland Homes.

Our Business Model continued 
We are proud of the developments we plan and design, 
and are always looking to create communities attractive 
to future residents. Delivering on our commitment to 
quality and comfort, developed sites feature open 
spaces, play areas and immaculate landscaping to suit 
the needs of a wide variety of people.
Identify land
Our local insight and established 
relationships mean that Inland Homes is 
always aware of opportunities to increase 
its land bank. We have particularly strong 
ties with central London agents, the MOD 
and other Government organisations, which 
frequently lead to new deals. 
Sites of varying value and size located 
in the south of England, the south east 
and around the M25 are our priority, but 
other locations are investigated where 
appropriate. Intensive legal, financial 
and land research is carried out at the 
identification stage, supported by our  
in-house architect and a number of 
planning/architectural consultants.  
Research into key factors such as local 
employment and transport links also 
influences our decisions.
Our appraisals and due diligence  
minimises risk and reinforces the land’s 
potential, ensuring that we fully  
understand the opportunity and that only 
sites with the right risk/reward balance are 
chosen. Payment terms for land can be 
up to three to four years with land being 
released to Inland Homes as and when 
payment is made.
Acquire land
Our flexible structure and motivated,  
close-knit team combine to make us a 
swift and astute land buyer. As well as 
typical sites for development, strategic 
parcels of land — the value of which may 
come from being key to securing further 
land or development in the future — may 
also be purchased. 
Government organisations and vendors 
generally sell to developers that can make 
a success of the land acquired and meet 
potential future contractual terms such as 
overage. In that respect, Inland Homes has 
a reputation for meeting and exceeding 
these expectations, thus strengthening 
our case when making offers on new land 
acquisitions.
Sites acquired can often deliver short 
term returns through the sale of surplus 
assets or rent from tenants (acquiring sites 
can sometimes mean that Inland Homes 
becomes a short term landlord until new 
development can begin).
Achieve planning 
permission
Once a site is acquired, work begins to 
achieve planning permission. Our record 
of achieving planning permissions on 
our sites is second to none. We place 
the needs of all affected parties — 
Government, Local Authorities, local 
residents, potential end users, local 
wildlife and the environment — alongside 
our own. 
Our expertise in designing sites involves 
detailed surveys, public consultations and 
presentations to create developments that 
naturally blend into the local environment. 
Plans produced by Inland Homes are 
designed to deliver the maximum value 
for our stakeholders.
Inland Homes produces comprehensive 
development proposals that are 
supported by robust financial viability 
assessments and a strong track record. 
Applications are further leveraged by our 
ability and experience in delivering ‘green’ 
sites that are energy efficient and offer 
carbon reductions. We typically allow 
18 to 24 months to secure a planning 
permission for a site.

Sell land with planning 
permission to developers
Historically, once consent has been 
achieved, Inland Homes would sell the 
site with outline planning permission to 
developers or housing associations for 
a short term return. Depending on our 
interests as an expanding housebuilder, this 
will still continue where appropriate. 
We have good relationships with our  
land-buying customers and most 
transactions happen once the necessary 
ground remediation (removal of pollution 
and contaminants) has happened and 
the infrastructure has been installed. A 
‘serviced site’ contains all the necessary 
drainage and roads, etc. already in place. 
As housebuilders ourselves, we know how 
to meet the needs of potential developers in 
order for them to be able to move quickly. 
Those developing on our sites are  
required to follow our ‘Design Code’  
for consistency. This ensures the site 
has a look and feel in keeping with the 
development as a whole and with the  
local area.
Develop all or part of  
the site
While portions of our sites are still sold 
to other developers, Inland Homes is 
increasingly using its land bank to grow  
as a housebuilder. By installing 
infrastructure and selling parts of a site, 
whilst carrying out our own housebuilding 
on other parts, we are delivering revenue 
in the medium term. 
Our customers for land are typically 
major housebuilders, medium tier and 
smaller local developers and our homes 
are acquired by private purchasers as 
owner occupiers and investors. We also 
have strong relationships with Housing 
Associations and investors in the Private 
Rented Sector. 
Value is returned to Inland Homes either 
as milestone payments as construction 
takes place, or as payments when units 
are completed, both of which provide 
regular cash flow. Large projects usually 
require a ‘mixed use scheme’, where 
Inland Homes will develop the commercial 
plots that are let to tenants. Value is 
realised by managing the asset for a 
short period of time before selling the 
investment to a third party.
Retain all or part of the 
site, build using main 
contractors and joint 
ventures
With greater gross margins achieved on 
our own housebuilding, building a whole 
development ourselves takes longer but 
maximises the revenue a site can deliver 
over the long term. Inland Homes has 
substantially increased its housebuilding 
activities over the recent past and we 
expect this to continue.
We have forged strong relationships 
with main contractors and third parties 
that have a reputation and track record 
for delivering stunning homes. By 
agreeing fixed-price contracts up front 
we are minimising risk in the construction 
stage, with payments only being made 
on ‘valuation certificates’ provided by 
surveyors checking progress on projects.
As well as delivering value, we are 
proud of the developments we plan and 
design, and are always looking to create 
communities attractive to future residents. 
Delivering on our commitment to quality 
and comfort, developed sites feature 
open spaces, play areas and immaculate 
landscaping to suit the needs of a wide 
variety of people.

Our Marketplace
Throughout 2013, the UK housing market has 
shown significant signs of revival. The number 
of transactions has increased and the pent up 
demand has subsequently seen prices rise. 
In the south of England where Inland Homes 
operates, the Office for National Statistics 
(ONS) found that property prices in and around 
London and the south east have soared in 
2013, more so than in any other area of the 
country. With growth in employment expected 
in the south east over the next decade, housing 
demand and prices are set to continue rising.
Government schemes such as last year’s Get 
Britain Building investment fund (which provided 
a £2 million facility to the Queensgate project) 
have seen new housing supply rising, with the 
Government estimating 334,000 new homes will 
be built in the three years up to August 2013.
However, there are currently insufficient houses 
to keep up with the growing demand, which 
is estimated at over 250,000 units p.a. With 
110,530 units built in the 12 months up to June 
2013 (7% up on same time in 2012), demand 
is currently more than double what is being 
built. With an ageing population meaning fewer 
occupants per property, the long term lack of 
homes is likely to continue.
In terms of buyers, Government schemes such 
as Help to Buy are building on these signs of 
recovery. The Help to Buy home ownership 
scheme has been launched in England and 
runs for three years. 
There is also the Build to Rent Fund, which 
was launched to stimulate new private 
rented housing supply. The HCA (Homes and 
Community Agency) which controls all the RSLs 
(Registered Social Landlords) has allocated a 
£15 million facility for Inland Homes and DGVL 
to assist in the development of Build to Rent 
plots being delivered.
The UK Government’s reforms to make the 
planning system less complex and easier to 
understand has recently resulted in a change 
of legislation to promote office to residential 
conversion under “prior approval notification” 
procedures, which will be useful on one of the 
Group’s projects.
Inland Homes has also started to engage with 
lucrative overseas investors, recently selling 
12 apartments from the West Plaza, Ashford, 
Middlesex development to customers in Hong 
Kong. There is evidence that overseas demand 
for UK property is growing, with over half of all 
new buildings in London now purchased by 
foreign buyers.

Our Strategy
With strong demand for land in the south and 
south east, we will continue to capture land 
trading margin by selling brownfield land, with 
planning permission, to developers. At the 
same time we are growing and utilising our 
capabilities as a housebuilder (486 units now 
under construction). We will look to extract 
value using the appropriate option available 
to us through the value chain, with a focus on 
the cash needs of the business. Making use 
of equity, debt funding and vendor financing, 
we will entrepreneurially grow the business 
by capitalising on buoyant market conditions, 
achieving higher margins through our 
housebuilding, whilst being fanatic about our 
cash position and levels of borrowing. 
With short, medium and long term value 
releasing options available, we will support our 
strategy by adding plots to the land bank year 
on year. We will continue to meet the needs 
of our customers and build on our strong 
relationships with Housing Associations. Our 
outsourcing model makes the business agile 
and quick to capitalise on market conditions, 
enabling us to easily scale-up or scale-down 
when appropriate.  
Adding to our team of industry experts we 
have invested in additional resources including 
planners, architectural designers, project 
managers, and sales and marketing people 
to build extra capacity to support our growth 
journey as housebuilders, which will provide 
more regular earnings for shareholders.
Inland Homes has a clear strategy focused on maximising the value 
of our land bank, realising value at appropriate stages during the 
development cycle to support ongoing sustainable growth and 
therefore delivering shareholder value. 
Our strategy focuses on four key goals:
1
To increase the size of 
our land bank year on 
year
2
Continue the core 
activity of plot sales 
to other developers to 
generate cash to fund 
our operations
3
Maximise the value 
from our land bank 
by expanding our 
housebuilding 
programme
4
Maintain borrowings 
at a relatively low level 
through a strong focus 
on cash management 
and vendor financing

Chairman’s Statement
A strong performance in improving market 
conditions
I am delighted to report a very strong set of 
results for Inland Homes, driven by an increased 
number of plots sold to other developers 
as well as a significant contribution from the 
development and sale of new homes built by 
the Group.
We are conscious that we work in an extremely 
cyclical industry and it is therefore crucial that 
we are ‘in the right place at the right time’.  
Our strategy to extract the maximum value from 
our land bank by building more developments 
ourselves appears to have been well timed 
given the improvement in market conditions and 
the increasing volume of housing transactions 
recorded in the UK.
As a result of this increased activity, total Group 
revenue, which includes revenue from land 
and house sales, rental income and project 
management fees, increased by over 400% to 
£31.12 million (2012: £6.11 million). Gross profit 
was nearly doubled to £7.69 million (2012: 
£3.89 million) with a margin of 24.7% and 
operating profit was up over 370% at  
£5.08 million (2012: £1.06 million). 
Profit before tax was up over 225% at  
£5.21 million (2012: £1.60 million) translating 
into a near fivefold increase in earnings per 
share of 1.98p (2012: 0.41p). 
Net asset value per share increased to 28.7p 
(2012: 27.0p). These financial results exclude 
the future value from the development services 
provided by the Group to DGVL where Inland 
Homes’ profit share is expected to increase 
from the current level of 74% to 90% by the end 
of March 2014 once the outstanding deferred 
consideration of £6.7 million for DGV has 
been paid. The Board anticipates that Inland 
Homes’ share of the future profits from DGV 
should be in the order of £10.1 million net of tax 
which is equivalent to 5.0p per ordinary share. 
Shareholders will appreciate that the unrealised 
profit, resulting from the difference between 
the market and carrying values of the Group’s 
land bank, is significant. The Group finished the 
period with cash reserves of £12.2 million, with 
net gearing reduced to 6.7% (2012: 13.0%).
I am pleased to report that during the period 
DGVL sold 76 plots for a total consideration of 
£5.3 million.
Successful fundraisings strengthen  
capital base
During the year the Group strengthened its 
financial position through two successful  
fundraisings: the first raised £8.94 million net of 
costs through the placement of approximately 
9.35 million Zero Dividend Preference shares 
(“ZDPs”), which have a redemption yield of  
7.3% per annum and will be repaid on or before 
10 April 2019 and the second, in May 2013, 
raised £4.73 million net of costs through a 
placing of approximately 18.3 million ordinary 
shares. These fundraisings have increased the 
Group’s financial flexibility and have strengthened 
the Group’s longer term capital base.
Increased dividend reflects progressive 
dividend policy
At the time of our 2012 results, the Board 
announced its intention to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy. In line with this policy, and 
reflecting these strong results, the Board is 
recommending a fourfold increase in the final 
proposed dividend of 0.27p (2012: 0.067p) 
per share if approved by shareholders at the 
“Inland Homes has had a highly productive 
financial year. The Group is well positioned 
to grow its land bank whilst our expanding 
housebuilding activity will help to ensure 
we maximise the profit potential from the 
Group’s asset base.”

Chairman’s Statement continued
Annual General Meeting which is expected to 
be called for Thursday 5 December 2013. The 
final dividend will be paid on 6 January 2014 
to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 6 December 2013. The  
ex-dividend date will be 4 December 2013.
Consistent progress against clear  
strategic goals
Our strategy going forward is demanding but 
we believe achievable and is:
1. To increase the size of our land bank year on 
year;
2. Continue the core activity of plot sales to 
other developers to generate cash to fund 
our operations; 
3. Maximise the value from our land bank by 
expanding our housebuilding programme; 
and
4. Maintain borrowings at a relatively low level 
through a strong focus on cash management 
and vendor financing.
The increase in housebuilding will lead to an 
increase in the Group’s net gearing because 
of the increased working capital requirements 
that this entails. However, this is envisaged to 
reduce over time as legal completions of unit 
sales and land disposals are achieved and the 
Board is focused on keeping net gearing under 
control. In this regard the Group has a good 
level of forward sales on both residential homes 
and development land with planning consent.
The number of residential plots in the land bank 
of the Group and those separately held by 
DGVL is currently as follows:
Owned with planning consent 753
Drayton Garden Village 311
Owned or contracted without 
planning consent 300
Plots controlled or terms agreed 942
Total plots 2,306
Well positioned to exploit market 
opportunities
Inland Homes currently has 348 homes under 
construction on seven sites and a further 138 
units are being developed by DGVL. The Group 
is managing the programme of developing 
some of Drayton Garden Village and this  
should further enhance the returns we expect 
from this project. 
Our housebuilding activity has had a strong 
start to the new financial year with 34 
reservations across three active sites since  
1 July 2013. Forward sales for both Inland 
Homes and DGVL either agreed or contracted 
currently stand at £46.3 million.
The Board believes that, for the foreseeable 
future, the market for new homes will remain 
strong in the areas in which we operate, 
particularly in the price range of £160,000 to 
£400,000 where sales are supported by the 
Government’s “Help to Buy” scheme and the 
continuing fundamental shortfall of housing 
availability in the country. As such, we would 
expect a substantial increase in the number 
of units sold in the current financial year when 
compared with 2013.
In addition, we have a strong land pipeline 
with a number of attractive sites in London 
and the south east already secured and are 
experiencing robust demand for land with 
planning consent.
Inland Homes has had a highly productive 
financial year. The Group is well positioned 
to grow its land bank whilst our growing 
housebuilding activity will help to ensure we 
maximise the profit potential from the Group’s 
asset base. Inland Homes is well placed 
to meet the challenges and opportunities 
presented by the market and we look to the 
future with confidence.

Chief Executive’s Review
This has been a “watershed” year for Inland 
Homes. The Group has made significant 
progress on all fronts including the land bank, 
housebuilding, profitability and financing.
Our operational focus is in the south of England 
with an emphasis on creating well designed 
homes in sustainable communities. The land 
portfolio meets the needs of a wide range of 
purchasers, from first time buyers to investors, 
with a product range that includes houses, 
apartments, commercial units and the sale of 
selected building plots to other developers.
Not only have we delivered a strong set of 
results but have put in place the foundations for 
further growth. We have implemented a clear 
strategy alongside a substantially improved 
housing market in the areas of our operations.
As stated in the Chairman’s Statement, we 
have dramatically increased the scale of our 
housebuilding activities, with 348 homes being 
constructed by Inland Homes and a further 138 
homes by DGVL with forward sales of in the 
order of £46.3 million. Our homes range from 
£160,000 to £400,000 making them ideal for first 
time buyers and investors alike. This price band 
is ideal for demand from purchasers using the 
Government’s “Help to Buy” funding initiative.
Whilst the planning system remains difficult, we 
secured our goals on the following key sites 
where valuable planning permissions were 
achieved:
Carter’s Quay, Poole, Dorset
268 homes with no affordable housing as well 
as 100,000 sq ft of commercial space.
St John’s Hospital, Chelmsford
101 homes including 12 substantial detached 
houses backing on to the golf course.
Drayton Garden Village, West Drayton 
(managed by Inland Homes)
A 4,000 sq ft neighbourhood store pre-let to 
Sainsbury’s.
Despite the considerable management time 
taken up in increasing the housebuilding 
programme to these new levels, I am pleased 
to say that our land acquisition programme has 
continued unabated. Notable sites secured in 
the course of the year were:
Markyate, St Albans, Hertfordshire
Consent for 40 residential units.
High Street, Amersham, Buckinghamshire
Strategic land with an option over 4.8 acres.
Callis Yard, Woolwich, London
Acquired with a lapsed resolution to grant 
planning consent for 177 units — acquired from 
receivers.
Wooburn Green, Buckinghamshire
Consent for 26 residential units.
Europa Way, Ipswich
Acquired with an expired consent for 218 units 
 — acquired from receivers. 
Vale Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire
Option land assembly — planning application 
submitted for 41 units.
Swallow Street, Iver, Buckinghamshire
Option over former garden centre with potential 
for 18 houses.
Station Road, Gerrards Cross, 
Buckinghamshire
Two existing vacant office blocks to be 
converted into 33 units under the Government’s 
“prior approval notification” procedure. Read more online

A 0.9 acre site secured under an option. Site 
allocated for development with a scheme for  
14 units already submitted.
The growth in activity during the year has 
resulted in an increase in the number of staff 
(including Directors) to 22. The increase is 
primarily due to new project managers and  
sales staff.
During the course of the year a decision was 
made by management to terminate discussions 
regarding a joint venture to develop 152 units 
with a major housebuilder on our Ashford 
Hospital project (now branded as “West Plaza”). 
We are now building this scheme as principals 
and have already achieved a good level of 
forward sales prior to the opening of a sales 
centre. The construction is fully funded by a 
senior debt bank facility.
Another major project taking up considerable 
amounts of management time was our 
“flagship” development proposal at Wilton 
Park, Beaconsfield. As shareholders will recall, 
Inland Homes acquired the only viable access 
supported by the Local Authority and achieved 
“special purchaser status” with the Ministry of 
Defence, being the owners of the development 
land (the former Defence School of Languages). 
This site is allocated in the local plan for up 
to 300 homes and a substantial amount of 
commercial space. Work is now advanced 
on the production of a planning brief for the 
development of the land in conjunction with the 
Local Authority, South Bucks District Council.
It is envisaged a planning permission will be 
achieved by the spring of 2015.
Drayton Garden Village (managed by  
Inland Homes)
During the course of the year, the installation 
of major infrastructure and landscaping works 
continued at Drayton Garden Village and the 
Garden Village concept that was envisaged is 
becoming a reality.
Notable events were the sale of 76 plots to 
Bellway Homes, a pre-let of commercial space 
to a leading food retailer and a forward sale of 
107 units to Paradigm Housing Association.
Inland Homes is also managing the 
development of 32 residential units for private 
sale, of which 80% are sold. DGVL is planning 
to keep development continuity by starting a 
further phase of 41 units for sale in this  
calendar year.
Shareholders will be aware that we decided 
to sell our stake in Howarth Homes plc 
(“Howarth”) which was achieved at a profit of 
£292,000. We successfully completed our joint 
venture with Howarth at Croxley Green, Herts 
with the last unit being sold in October 2013. 
The Group has also achieved the repayment 
of all loans to Howarth. Howarth will continue 
as one of our main contractors as part of our 
housebuilding programme.
Summary and prospects
2013 has laid the foundations to deliver a 
successful set of results for the new financial 
year. There is a strong pipeline of new land 
opportunities being investigated by our team, 
although we are extremely discerning as to 
which projects fit our criteria for purchase. We 
are confident that a number of high quality new 
sites will be secured in the current financial year 
and will continue to add value to our projects by 
navigating them through the intricate planning 
system. Inland Homes will also capture the 
development margin on some of its sites by 
delivering successful housing schemes.
In summary, I am confident that our strategy 
will increase the value of our asset base in the 
medium term and deliver sound prospects for 
our shareholders.

Case Study
Drayton Garden Village (“DGV”), managed by Inland Homes, is 
an eco-friendly neighbourhood of 773 family homes located near 
Heathrow in Middlesex. The 31 acre site, which also features 
a care home and commercial properties, is perhaps the best 
example to date of Inland Homes putting sustainability at the 
heart of a development. The site is green in both appearance and 
functionality, typified by its energy centre.
The story of DGV began in 2008, when the former RAF West 
Drayton site was identified as an excellent opportunity given 
its familiar location and proximity to Central London. DGVL 
recognised that Inland Homes could add value to the site and 
appointed the Group to manage the project.
The site was bought from the MOD in January 2009 by DGVL to 
which the Group provides property services in consideration for a 
share of the profit, which has increased from 35% to 74%, and is 
anticipated to increase further. 
Once the site was purchased by DGVL, work began to plan a 
development that would enhance the local area and meet market 
need. In the nine months the outline planning application took 
to compile, a number of consultants were brought on board, 
opinions from local residents and politicians were canvassed, and 
sustainable energy providers were met with.
While this lengthy planning stage was in motion, on behalf of 
DGVL, Inland Homes creatively generated revenue by selling 
a wide variety of surplus assets that had been left on site, 
including excavating a very large amount of copper cables. This 
opportunism meant that by the time the planning was complete, 
the costs of the process had largely been covered by revenue 
generated from the site.
In October 2010, planning consent was granted for the site, 
and the first 59 plots were quickly sold for affordable housing. In 
January 2011, a further 89 plots were sold for private homes. 
In March 2011, DGV gained the prestigious Land Award in 
recognition of Code for Sustainable Homes (Code 4), “zero” waste 
target and the district heating network being built on site with an 
energy centre. The energy centre will use combined heat and 
power (CHP) units and gas boilers to supply heat and hot water 
to every property on site, one of the first times such a system 
has been used across a development of houses and commercial 
units. The centre will benefit not only the environment, with a 40% 
reduction in carbon emissions, but also the residents will receive 
hot water and heat on demand.
During 2012, another 106 plots were sold, as well as the plot of 
land for a care home. July 2013 saw the start of construction on 
the first properties on site to be built by DGVL; of these 32 units 
80% have sold.
As of October 2013, major infrastructure works on the site were 
substantially complete. 340 plots have been sold to date, with 
a further 107 contracted for sale. 326 residential plots remain, 
including the 32 properties that DGVL are building.

Case Study
Queensgate was the first large site acquired by Inland Homes, in 
August 2006. Previously an RAF base, the development of the 
24.5 acre site in Farnborough, Hampshire was hugely affected by 
the financial crisis, but is now well on its way to completion.
Prior to acquiring the site, the MOD were unsuccessful in gaining 
planning permission. Inland Homes acquired the site and secured 
planning consent for 399 residential homes and 100,000 sq ft of 
commercial properties within a year. This is a testament to the 
team’s experience and capability in negotiating the potentially 
tricky planning and design stage.
Queensgate features classic family homes and modern 
apartments set in a beautiful landscaped environment located next 
to Farnborough Airfield. In planning for the site, Inland Homes took 
into account the needs of the local community, which led to the 
employment-generating consent for a care home.
Once consent had been secured, there were a number of issues 
to resolve on the site. Solutions were found for contamination 
due to the site’s previous use and a number of ecological issues. 
The site is home to the UK’s only human centrifuge, which is 
housed in a listed building. While Inland Homes can generate 
revenue from renting this in-demand piece of technology, its listed 
status was another hurdle to overcome in planning the residential 
development in the surrounding areas. Other income has been 
generated from the site throughout the planning process, including 
renting land to Farnborough International Airport.
The Queensgate project was the second that Inland Homes has 
used to expand its operations as a housebuilder. To date, 76 plots 
have been constructed by the Group, with another 60 under way. 
The success of the construction of a phase of 19 houses and 
apartments was a particular milestone in Inland Homes developing 
as a housebuilder. 
150 other plots in the development have been sold to two major 
housebuilders and a Housing Association. As of October 2013, 
113 plots and 100,000 sq ft of commercial space remain.
The success of the construction of a

Case Study
West Plaza is a development of two modern apartment complexes 
in Ashford, Middlesex. Set around two formal courtyards for an 
attractive and relaxed environment, the site is within two miles 
of Heathrow Airport and two other large employers, as well as 
Ashford and St Peter’s Hospital, and has excellent transport links 
to Central London.
The 1.5 acre site of the former Ashford Hospital was purchased 
from the NHS in 2007. It is one of the last sites Inland Homes 
acquired before, and subsequently held up by, the financial crisis. 
Planning consent was secured for 152 apartments — three three-
bedroom and 149 one and two-bedroom apartments — in two 
complexes, with a basement car park.
West Plaza is another development that Inland Homes is using to 
expand its housebuilding operation. The Group has subcontracted 
the building of the development on a fixed price, minimising 
the construction risk to Inland Homes. Phase 1 of the site has 
commenced with the underground car park and the construction 
of the eastern building up to second floor level. 
The first handover of properties for West Plaza is expected to take 
place in June 2014, with the entire development expected to be 
completed by June 2015.
The site will be sustainable, with a large number of Photovoltaic 
(PV) cells on the roof which will power the communal areas of the 
buildings and the excess will be returned to the national grid in 
exchange for revenue. This revenue will help to offset the costs of 
the building’s management, benefitting the tenants financially.
West Plaza is an example of Inland Homes utilising the overseas 
property market to sell its properties for the first time. A recent visit 
to Hong Kong saw the Group’s team sell 12 apartments.

To enable shareholders to appreciate what the business considers are the main operational risks, they are briefly outlined below:
Risk Potential impact Strategy/Mitigation
Land The inability to source, acquire, 
promote and dispose of land
The Group would not be able to 
generate profit and cash flow for 
the longer term
May have a detrimental effect on 
the financial position of the Group
The Group has an experienced 
management team with a strong 
track record in the industry which 
mitigates this risk
Planning Increased complexity and delay in the 
planning process
The adoption of the Community 
Infrastructure Levy by local authorities
May impede sales and thus affect 
the rate of growth of the business
May have a detrimental effect on 
the supply and pricing of land 
being marketed by landowners
The Group undertakes extensive 
pre-acquisition due diligence 
on planning, technical and 
environmental issues together with 
acquiring housing sites identified in 
councils’ Local Plans
Market A severe fall in the housing market 
in the regions in which the Group 
chooses to operate
Inability to realise maximum value 
in a timely fashion
Adverse effect on land values
Adverse effect on the timing of 
sales
The Group ensures that its sites are 
in good locations thus providing 
some protection against any 
downturn in the market
Personnel Loss of/inability to source high calibre, 
experienced staff
The Group would have difficulty 
growing the business in the highly 
competitive markets in which it 
operates
The Group maintains good 
morale in the workplace and sets 
remuneration packages at attractive 
levels
Interest rates Significant upward changes in interest 
rates
May affect residential land prices 
as the demand for residential 
property would be affected
Would lead to increased 
borrowing costs and thus have a 
detrimental effect on profit
The Group mitigates any adverse 
exposure to interest rate changes 
by controlling its gearing and, 
if necessary, by using hedging 
instruments
Environmental Unexpected contamination being 
found on a site
Liabilities in respect of 
decontamination works or fines 
for environmental pollution could 
affect the outcome of a project
The assessment of environmental 
risk is an important element of the 
due diligence undertaken when 
buying land. The Group uses 
reputable environmental consultancy 
firms to assist in this area
Regulation Changes in legislation, government 
regulations, planning policies and 
guidelines
May have a detrimental effect on 
the Group’s business
The Group keeps abreast of 
potential changes in these areas 
and wherever possible allows for 
these in appraising its projects
Construction Cost overruns
Material shortages
Delays
May adversely impact margins on 
infrastructure and housebuilding
The Group tries to build strong 
relationships with subcontractors 
and projects are reviewed frequently 
in order to mitigate these risks
Finance The availability of bank funding for 
land acquisition
May have an adverse effect on 
the Group’s progress
The Group continues to seek 
finance from alternative lending 
sources to improve its liquidity

The Directors present their report and the financial statements of 
the Group and the Company for the year ended 30 June 2013.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries, together 
called the Group, is to acquire residential and mixed use sites and 
seek planning consent for development. The Group develops a 
number of the plots for private sale and sells consented plots to 
housebuilders.
Results and dividends
The trading results for the year are set out in the Group Income 
Statement on page 44 and the Group’s financial position at the 
end of the year is set out in the Group Statement of Financial 
Position on page 45. Further details of the performance during the 
financial year and expected future developments are contained 
in the Chairman’s Statement which forms part of the Directors’ 
Report.
The Directors propose to recommend the payment of a final 
dividend of 0.27p per share (2012: 0.067p).
Business review
A review of the development and performance of the business 
during the year and the future outlook of the Group is set out in 
the Chairman’s Statement on pages 12 to 14. The Group’s key 
performance indicators are revenue, profit before tax, net assets 
per share and the number of plots with and without planning 
consent. These indicators are monitored closely by the Board 
and the details of performance against these are given in the 
Chairman’s Statement.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the business and the nature of the Group’s 
strategy are subject to a number of risks.
The Directors have set out on page 30 the principal risks facing 
the business. Where possible, processes are in place to monitor 
and mitigate such risks. 
These are general in nature and include: obtaining business 
on competitive terms; retaining key personnel; and market 
competition. The Group operates a system of internal control and 
risk management in order to provide assurance that the Board 
is managing risk whilst achieving its business objectives. No 
system can fully eliminate risk and, therefore, the understanding of 
operational risk is central to the management process.
Financial risk management objectives and policies
All potential areas of financial risk are regularly monitored and 
reviewed by the Directors and management. Any preventative or 
corrective measures are taken as necessary.
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include loans, 
cash and trade receivables that arise directly from its operations. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations.
The Group also provides finance to DGVL as part of its 
arrangement with that company. The main purpose of this financial 
instrument is to enhance the Group’s return from this project.
The existence of these financial instruments exposes the Group 
to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail 
below.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are 
liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and capital risk. The 
Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these 
risks and they are summarised below.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient 
liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash 
assets safely and profitably.
Flexibility is achieved by loans and overdraft facilities.
Cash flow fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term 
borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group 
to cash flow interest rate risk. Some of the Group’s borrowings are 
at variable rates but the Group does not consider the risk to be 
significant.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity and 
bank and other borrowings. The Group controls the exposure to 
interest rate fluctuations by ensuring that the level of gearing is 
maintained at a reasonable level.

Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and keeps them informed of all relevant matters on a 
regular basis. The Group is an equal opportunities employer and 
all applications for employment are considered fully on the basis of 
suitability for the job.
Charitable and political contributions
Donations to charitable organisations amounted to £12,000  
(2012: £23,000). These donations were made to a number of 
different charities supporting a broad range of causes. There were 
no political donations made during the year (2012: £nil). 
Payment policy and practice
The Group’s policy is for all companies within the Group to agree 
terms and conditions with their suppliers. Payments are then 
generally made on the basis of this agreement, providing the 
suppliers conform to the terms and conditions stipulated.  
At 30 June 2013 the Group had an average of 57 days’  
(2012: 93 days’) purchases outstanding in trade payables.
Corporate governance
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate 
governance and the guidelines set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2010. Whilst AIM companies are not obliged 
to comply with the Code, the Directors intend to comply with 
the Code so far as is appropriate having regard to the size and 
nature of the various companies making up the Group. The Board 
will take such measures so far as considered appropriate for 
the Group to comply with the Code and, in addition, the Quoted 
Companies Alliance (QCA) Guidelines for AIM companies.
Board composition
The Group is managed through its Board of Directors. The Board 
comprises the Non-executive Chairman, one other Non-executive 
Director, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and a Land Director. 
The Board’s main roles are to create value for the shareholders, 
to approve the Group’s strategic objectives and to ensure that 
the necessary financial and other resources are made available to 
enable them to meet these objectives.
Specific responsibilities reserved to the Board include: setting 
Group strategy; reviewing operational and financial performance; 
approving certain land acquisitions; approving appointments to 
the Board; and approving policies relating to Directors’ and senior 
management’s remuneration. In addition, the Board reviews the 
risk profile of the Group and ensures that an adequate system of 
internal control is in place.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. 
The Chairman is responsible for running the Board and he 
meets the Chief Executive and the other Non-executive Director 
separately as and when required to discuss matters of the Board.
One-third of the Directors retire annually by rotation in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association and this enables the 
shareholders to decide on the election of their Company’s Board.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Terry Roydon (Chairman) and 
Simon Bennett. The Audit Committee meets at least three times a 
year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance 
of the Group is properly reported and monitored and for meeting 
the auditor and reviewing their reports in relation to the financial 
statements and internal control systems. The Group’s auditor 
provides some non-audit services, but these are not considered to 
threaten their independence. The committee reviews the level of 
non-audit fees on an annual basis. The Audit Committee meetings 
are also attended by invitation by representatives of the Group’s 
auditor, the Finance Director and the Chief Executive.
Since 30 June 2012 the Audit Committee has met three times 
to consider the planning of the statutory audit and to review the 
Group’s draft half and full year results prior to Board approval and 
to consider the external auditor’s detailed reports thereon.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Simon Bennett 
(Chairman) and Terry Roydon. The principal functions of 
the committee are to determine the Group’s policy on the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management 
and to determine the remuneration package of each Executive 
Director. The committee also determines the allocation of share 
options to the Executive Directors and other employees. The 
Remuneration Committee meetings are also attended by invitation 
by the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. During the year 
the committee met six times to review the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration package.
The Directors comply with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating 
to Directors’ dealings and take all reasonable steps to ensure 
compliance by the Company’s applicable employees. The 
Company has adopted and operates a share dealing code for 
Directors and employees in accordance with the AIM Rules.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of 
internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Group’s assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system 
is designed to manage, but not eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. There are inherent limitations in any 
control system and accordingly even the most effective system 
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal control on an ongoing basis. Annual budgets are prepared 
and detailed management reports are presented to the Board and 
used to monitor financial performance and compliance with the 
Group’s policies and procedures. All controls are covered including 
financial and operational controls to manage risk. The Board 
meetings are also used to consider the Group’s major risks.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where 
practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. The Chief 
Executive and Finance Director meet with institutional investors 
within the confines of relevant legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors and 
encourages participation by them at the AGM. All Board members 
are present at the AGM and are available to answer questions 
from shareholders.
Internal audit
The Board reviews from time to time the need for an internal audit 
function and remains of the opinion that the systems of internal 
financial control are appropriate to the Group’s present activities 
and that such a function is unnecessary.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and 
forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity. The Directors have 
considered the present economic climate, the state of the housing 
market and the current demand for land with planning consent. 
The Group has continued to see an increase in demand for 
consented land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has 
significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions 
for the sale of some of the land within its projects and expects to 
make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it has 
adequate working capital for its requirements. The Group is also 
in discussions with a number of funders to raise debt finance in 
order to both supplement its working capital and expand its land 
portfolio. The Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate 
sufficient cash to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for 
a period of 12 months from signing these financial statements. 
The Directors therefore can consider it appropriate to prepare the 
financial statements on the going concern basis.

Directors’ Report continued
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and have elected to prepare Parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or 
loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed in relation to 
the Group accounts and applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed in relation to the Parent Company accounts, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
•	 so far as each Director is aware there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
•	 the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Post balance sheet events
There are no events subsequent to the balance sheet date that 
need to be disclosed.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice covering the AGM together with the proposed 
resolutions is contained in the document accompanying this 
report. The AGM will be held on 5 December 2013.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditor for 
the ensuing year will be proposed at the AGM in accordance with 
Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
There is no requirement for companies quoted on AIM to 
produce a formal remuneration report. As a consequence, this 
Remuneration Report is produced for information purposes 
in order to give shareholders and other users of the financial 
statements greater transparency about the way in which the 
Directors of Inland Homes are remunerated.
This report sets out the remuneration paid to the Directors for the 
year ended 30 June 2013 and the remuneration policy for the 
forthcoming financial year and beyond. 
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Board have established a Remuneration Committee 
which currently consists of Simon Bennett, independent Non-
executive Director, who is Chairman of the committee and Terry 
Roydon, the Company’s Non-executive Chairman. The role 
of the Remuneration Committee is to determine the specific 
remuneration package for each of the Executive Directors and 
no Director is involved in any decisions that will affect his own 
remuneration. The Remuneration Committee has access to 
information provided by the Chief Executive, Stephen Wicks and 
the Finance Director, Nishith Malde and independent advice from 
external consultants (currently MM&K) where it considers this to  
be appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee meets formally three times a year 
and on such other occasions as may be required.
Policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration
The policy for Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed 
to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals with a 
competitive remuneration package. The remuneration policy takes 
into account the overall performance of the Company and the 
individual Executive Directors and the prevailing pay structures in 
the markets in which Inland Homes operates.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to provide 
a balance between fixed and variable rewards, although it 
is recognised that it is common industry practice for total 
remuneration to be significantly influenced by annual bonuses and 
long term incentive plans. Consequently, remuneration packages 
for individual Executive Directors comprise a basic salary, 
discretionary annual bonuses, long term incentive awards and 
benefits in kind. In agreeing the basic salary and annual bonuses, 
in addition to the factors outlined above, the Remuneration 
Committee takes into account the aggregate remuneration to be 
received by the individual Executive. 
Basic salary
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an 
annual basis. The Remuneration Committee seeks to establish a 
basic salary for each position commensurate with the individual’s 
responsibilities and performance, and takes into account 
comparable salaries for similar companies of a similar size in the 
same market.
Annual discretionary bonuses
The award of an annual bonus to an Executive Director is on  
a discretionary basis and takes into account the performance 
of the Company on a number of different criteria against the 
performance of its peers in the markets in which Inland Homes 
operates and the contribution of each individual Director towards 
this performance. 
Executive Directors can earn up to 100% of basic annual salary as 
an annual bonus. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Company operates both an unapproved share option scheme 
and a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”).
Awards under the unapproved share option scheme are made on 
a periodic basis to the Company’s employees. The share options 
in this scheme vest three years after the date of grant and have an 
exercise period of seven years. This scheme is cash settled.
The Company’s existing LTIP (the “2007 LTIP”) has been in 
existence since the Company was floated on AIM in April, 2007. 
At the time the three Executive Directors of Inland Homes, 
namely Stephen Wicks, Chief Executive, Nishith Malde, Finance 
Director and Paul Brett, Land Director, were awarded a number 
of redeemable shares of £1 each. The redeemable shares are not 
entitled to receive any dividends but in the event of a takeover (or 
return of capital to shareholders on a winding up), the holders of 
the redeemable shares would be able to redeem these shares at 
a price which is calculated so as to attribute to all the redeemable 
shares a value equivalent to the difference between the takeover 
price per ordinary share (or the total to be returned to shareholders 
on a winding up) and 35p multiplied by 11,123,494. The rights 
to these redeemable shares would be exercisable provided 
the Executive was still employed by the Company and that the 
total return to ordinary shareholders exceeds 10% per annum 
compound annually over a base price of 50p (equivalent to the 
placing price on the Company’s flotation) per ordinary share. 
Further details of the existing redeemable shares are set out in 
Note 21 on page 68. 
The remuneration committee no longer considers that the 2007 
LTIP provides sufficient incentive to the Executive Directors. 
The original strategy of Inland Homes was to build up a land 
bank which would be attractive to a major industry buyer. The 
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 was followed by a 
subsequent global financial crisis where the provision of credit 
by lending banks became increasingly scarce and the ability to 
borrow funds on land with no planning consent disappeared 
completely. Share prices of companies in the housebuilding and 
property sectors were particularly hard hit at that time and many of 
these companies went into liquidation. 
Stock code: INL www.inlandplc.com  39 22901.04     4 November 2013 2:31 PM     Proof 5
In order to achieve any benefit from the 2007 LTIP , the value of an 
ordinary share on a takeover (or a return of capital to shareholders 
on a winding up) would have to be 88.6p (as compared with 
a price per ordinary share of 47.5p on 30 October 2013, the 
latest practical date before the publication of these financial 
statements). As a consequence the Remuneration Committee, 
having taken advice from independent remuneration consultants, 
have concluded that the 2007 LTIP no longer provides any realistic 
incentive to the Executive Directors and should therefore be 
scrapped and a new scheme introduced. Details of the proposed 
changes to the LTIP will be sent to shareholders in due course. 
Other benefits
Depending on the exact terms of the individual Executive’s service 
contract with the Company, they are entitled to a range of benefits 
including either a car allowance or a fully expensed company car, 
contributions to pension schemes, private fuel, private health care 
insurance, permanent and death in service insurance.
Service contracts and notice periods 
Each of the Executive Directors are employed on rolling contracts 
subject to one year’s notice from either Inland Homes or the 
Executive Director in relation to Nishith Malde and Stephen 
Wicks and three months’ notice in relation to Paul Brett and 
contain confidentiality provisions and restrictive covenants for 
the Company’s protection. The current service contracts of the 
Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal office hours and at Inland Homes’ 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) until the conclusion of the AGM. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts do not provide 
specifically for any termination payments, although the Company 
might make payments in lieu of notice. For this purpose, such 
payments would consist of basic salary and other benefits for the 
relevant period excluding any annual discretionary bonus. 
Non-executive Directors 
Inland Homes has two independent Non-executive Directors, 
namely Terry Roydon, the Chairman and Head of the Audit 
Committee and Simon Bennett, Head of the Remuneration 
Committee. Both Non-executive Directors have letters of 
appointment, initially for a three year period and thereafter on six 
months’ notice from either Inland Homes or the individual and 
contain confidentiality provisions for the Company’s benefit.
The Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not 
provide specifically for any termination payments, although the 
Company might make payments in lieu of notice. The current 
letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors are available 
for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal 
office hours and at Inland Homes’ Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) until the conclusion of the AGM.
Non-executive Directors’ fees are determined by the Executive 
Directors, having regard to the requirement to attract high calibre 
individuals with the right experience, the time requirements and 
the responsibilities incumbent on an individual acting as a Non-
executive Director for a company, such as Inland Homes, listed 
on AIM. The Non-executive Directors are not eligible for annual 
discretionary bonuses and do not participate in the Company’s 
long term incentive plans. 
Directors’ emoluments for the year ended 30 June 2013 
A review of the financial results for the year ended 30 June 
2013, as more fully set out in the Chairman’s Statement and the 
Chief Executive’s Review, demonstrates the robustness of the 
Company’s business model and strategy. With turnover up by 
over 400%, operating profit up by over 370%, profit before tax 
up by over 225% and earnings per share up nearly fivefold, the 
Company comprehensively beat its market forecasts. 
Executive Directors at Inland Homes are permitted to earn 
up to 100% of basic annual salary as an annual bonus. As a 
consequence of the strong overall performance of the Company, 
the Remuneration Committee made annual discretionary bonus 
awards to Stephen Wicks and Nishith Malde of £75,000 each 
(approximately 27% of basic annual salary) and to Paul Brett an 
award of £50,000 (approximately 27% of basic annual salary). 
Half of these annual discretionary awards (after the deduction of 
income tax and national insurance contributions) were to be used 
to buy shares in the Company. As announced in October 2013

Corporate, Social, Ethical  
and Environmental Responsibilities
All our developments are designed to ensure 
that our residents can live as sustainably as 
possible. We install renewable energy in our 
homes which ensures cheaper energy.
At Inland Homes we are committed to sustainable development 
as we understand the new homes we build today are going to 
be around for many years to come, and building quality homes 
means respecting the environment. We consider the whole 
life cycle of development from site preparation, responsible 
procurement use during construction through to how the home 
operates over the lifetime of the house.
All our developments are designed to ensure that our residents 
can live as sustainably as possible. So our homes are built with 
materials with the lowest possible environmental impact, we 
provide cycle parking so residents can choose more sustainable 
transport modes, there is dedicated space in all our kitchens for 
recycling bins, we ensure our homes use water efficiently and 
that energy consumption is reduced as far as possible. Energy 
reduction is achieved through good levels of natural daylight 
in living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms, low energy lighting 
is installed throughout every home, and we build to very high 
standards of insulation to minimise heat loss through walls, 
windows and roofs. We install renewable energy in our homes 
which ensures cheaper energy bills for our residents.
We have received prestigious awards recognising the sustainable 
credentials of the developments we work on, such as “zero” waste 
to landfill during demolition and construction of DGV along with 
the Land Award sponsored by the Land Trust, at the 2011 Sustain 
Magazine Awards for achieving 40% carbon reduction across the 
same development.

No two sites are the same and on each 
scheme, we tailor the scheme to achieve our 
carbon and energy standards in the most 
appropriate manner.
DGV was planned on the basis of Garden City principles and the 
district heating system that provides heat to all the homes gives 
an added dimension to the idea of neighbourhoods working as 
communities. People are now living on the site which is one of 
the first private sector schemes to be built in London with such a 
system since it was advocated by the London Plan. The scheme 
has become an exemplar of its type and is visited regularly by MPs 
and interested experts.
No two sites are the same and on each scheme, we tailor the 
scheme to achieve our carbon and energy standards in the most 
appropriate manner. All schemes are delivered through the Code 
for Sustainable Homes or BREEAM accreditation systems.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2013
1. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Group financial statements are set out below.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for financial instruments and the 
investment property which are measured at fair value, and in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the EU and as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The accounting policies that have been applied in the opening Statement of Financial Position have also been applied throughout all 
periods presented in these financial statements. These accounting policies comply with each IFRS that is mandatory for accounting 
periods ending on 30 June 2013.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have 
been published by the IASB but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Group’s accounting policies for the first period 
beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement. Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements is provided below. 
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by 
the Group
•	 IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements
•	 IFRS11 Joint Arrangements
•	 IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
•	 IAS27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements
•	 IAS28 (Revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Standards in issue but not yet effective
•	 IFRS9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2015)
•	 IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement (effective 1 January 2013)
•	 IAS19 Employee Benefits (Revised June 2011) (effective 1 January 2013)
•	 Disclosures — Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Amendments to IFRS7 (effective 1 January 2013)
•	 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Amendments to IAS32 (effective 1 January 2014)
The Directors are currently considering the potential impact of IFRS10, 11 and 12 on the accounting for the Group’s investment in 
Drayton Garden Village. Full details of the impact, if any, will be included in the Interim Financial Statements prepared for the six month 
period ending 31 December 2013.
None of the other standards above are expected to have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 
30 June 2013. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries 
have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.

1. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are dealt with by the acquisition method. The method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable 
assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were 
recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary 
are included in the Group Statement of Financial Position at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for subsequent 
measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. 
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Going concern
The Board has reviewed the performance for the current year and forecasts for the future period. It has also considered the risks and 
uncertainties, including credit risk and liquidity. The Directors have considered the present economic climate, the state of the housing 
market and the current demand for land with planning consent. The Group has continued to see an increase in demand for consented 
land in the areas in which it operates. The Group has significant forward sales of residential units and is in discussions for the sale 
of some of the land within its projects and expects to make sufficient disposals in the foreseeable future to ensure it has adequate 
working capital for its requirements. The Group is also in discussions with a number of funders to raise debt finance in order to both 
supplement its working capital and expand its land portfolio. The Directors are satisfied that the Group will generate sufficient cash to 
meet its liabilities as and when they fall due for a period of 12 months from signing these financial statements. The Directors therefore can 
consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.
Associates
Associates are those entities over which the Group has significant influence through Board representation but which are neither 
subsidiaries nor interests in joint ventures. Investments in associates are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using 
the equity method. Acquired investments in associates are also subject to acquisition method accounting. However, any goodwill or fair 
value adjustment attributable to the share in the associate is included in the amount recognised as investment in associates.
All subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognised in the Group’s carrying amount of the 
investment. Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in ‘share of profits of associates’ in the 
Group Income Statement and therefore affect net results of the Group. These changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or 
impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities. 
Items that have been recognised by the associate in Other Comprehensive Income are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. 
However, when the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
If the associate subsequently reports profits, the investor resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits 
equals the share of losses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the 
associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
Amounts reported in the financial statements of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Joint ventures
Investments in joint ventures are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. All subsequent 
changes to the share of interest in the equity of the joint venture are recognised in the Group’s carrying amount of the investment. 
Changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the joint venture are reported in ‘share of profits of joint venture’ in the Group 
Income Statement and therefore affect net results of the Group. These changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation or 
impairment of the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 June 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
Revenue
Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied, excluding 
VAT and trade discounts. 
Sale of land
Revenue from the sale of land is recognised when all the following conditions have been satisfied:
•	 the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods which is generally when contracts 
have been completed;
•	 the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over 
the land sold which is generally when the contract has been completed;
•	 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
•	 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
•	 the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Sale of residential units
Turnover is recognised on legal completion, which is generally when the title passes.
Fee income
The Group provides planning and property management services to third parties for a fee. The Group recognises revenue based on the 
fair value and stage of completion of the planning and property management services provided to these customers as at the period end, 
in accordance with IAS18.
Interest
Interest is recognised using the effective interest method which calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocates the 
interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
Rental income
Rental income derived from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Disposal of assets
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Any revaluation surplus remaining in equity on disposal of the asset is 
transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by the straight line 
method where it reflects the basis of consumption of the asset. The rates generally applicable are:
Fixtures and fittings – 25%
Office equipment – 25%
Motor vehicles – 25%
Leasehold property – over shorter of lease term and useful economic life
Material residual value estimates are updated as required, but at least annually, whether or not the asset is revalued.

1. Accounting policies continued
Investment property
Investment properties are measured at cost and are reviewed annually for impairment. Any gain or loss resulting from the sale of  
an investment property is immediately recognised in profit or loss. An investment property shall be derecognised on disposal or when 
the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal. As a result, 
investment properties are not depreciated.
Inventories
Inventories consist of land and work in progress and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is 
estimated based upon the future expected selling price, less estimated costs to sell.
Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, 
or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined 
for an individual asset. If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of 
assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. Where the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations 
are recognised in the Group Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses 
may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since 
the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That 
increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in 
which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to 
allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the period.
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences. Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit. Temporary differences include those associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures unless 
reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the foreseeable 
future. In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed for recognition 
as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the year end date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the Group Income Statement except where 
they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income (such as the revaluation of the investment property not included 
in inventories) or directly in equity in which case the related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity 
respectively.

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 30 June 2013
1. Accounting policies continued
Leased assets
Lease payments (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) applicable to operating leases where substantially all 
the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension scheme
The pension costs charged against operating profits are the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. 
Equity-settled share-based payment
All share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the Group financial statements. All goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the Black–Scholes options pricing model. Where 
employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to 
the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of any 
non-market vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the Group Income Statement with a corresponding 
credit to retained earnings.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in 
the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to 
that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.
Financial assets
Financial assets are divided into the following categories: loans and receivables and financial assets at fair value through profit or  
loss. Financial assets are assigned to the different categories by management on initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which 
they were acquired. 
All financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
other than those categorised as at fair value through profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value plus finance costs. Financial assets 
categorised as at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction costs expensed through the Group 
Income Statement.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets that are either classified as held for trading or are designated 
by the entity as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the financial assets included in 
this category are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Group Income Statement. Financial assets originally 
designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss may not be reclassified subsequently.
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated to this category or do not qualify for 
inclusion in any of the other categories of financial assets. The Group’s available-for-sale financial assets include listed securities.
All financial assets within this category are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in value recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income. Gains and losses arising from financial instruments classified as available-for-sale are initially recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income then reclassified from equity to profit or loss when they are sold. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
Trade receivables and loans to associate are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured subsequent to 
initial recognition at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. Any change in their value through 
impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the Group Income Statement.

1. Accounting policies continued
Financial assets continued
Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to 
it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables. The amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Interest and other cash flows resulting from holding financial assets are recognised in the Group Income Statement, regardless of how 
the related carrying amount of financial assets is measured.
A financial asset is derecognised only where the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the financial asset is 
transferred and that transfer qualifies for derecognition. A financial asset is transferred if the contractual rights to receive the cash flows 
of the asset have been transferred or the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset, but assumes a 
contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients. A financial asset that is transferred qualifies for derecognition if the 
Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, or if the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership but does transfer control of that asset.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are obligations to pay cash or other financial assets and are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
All financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest-related charges recognised as an 
expense in finance cost in the Group Income Statement. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are charged to the Group Income Statement on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss where they are classified as held-for-trading or designated as at 
fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition (including deferred purchase consideration). Financial liabilities are designated as at 
fair value through profit or loss where they eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement (or recognition) mismatch.
A financial liability is derecognised only when the obligation is extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or 
expires.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, together with other short term, highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Dividends
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other short term financial liabilities when the dividends are approved 
in a general meeting prior to the year end date.
Equity
An equity instrument is a contract which evidences a residual interest in the assets after deducting all liabilities. Equity comprises the 
following:
•	 ‘Share capital’ represents the nominal value of equity shares;
•	 ‘Share premium’ represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses 
of the share issue;
•	 ‘Treasury shares’ represent the purchase of the Company’s own shares and are deducted from total equity as treasury shares until they 
are sold or cancelled where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in total equity;
•	 ‘Special reserve’ represents the distributable surplus created by the transfer of an amount from the share premium to rectify the deficit 
on the profit and loss reserve; and
•	 ‘Profit and loss reserve’ represents retained profits.

2. Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; cash flow risk; and fair value interest rate risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out centrally under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
(a) Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made 
to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the year end date, as summarised 
below:
2013
£000
2012
£000
Classes of financial assets – carrying amounts
Listed investments held for trading 1 1
Loan to Howarth (former associate) 1,000 1,000
Cash and cash equivalents 12,154 575
Trade and other receivables 15,085 2,632
Receivables due in more than one year 55 55
28,295 4,263
The Group’s policy is to deal with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group’s management considers that all the above financial assets that are not impaired for each of the reporting dates under review 
are of good credit quality.
Some of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral.
The credit risk for liquid funds and other short term financial assets is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks 
with high quality credit ratings.
(b) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and ensuring availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of credit facilities. The Group aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping credit lines available. The Group also purchases 
property under deferred consideration arrangements.
(c) Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group’s cash flow interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
flow interest rate risk. All the Group’s borrowings are at variable rates but the Group does not consider the risk to be significant.
3. Segment information
In accordance with IFRS8, information is disclosed to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of 
the business activities in which the Group engages.
In identifying its operating segments, management differentiates between land sales, housebuilding, fee income and other income. These 
segments are based on the information reported to the chief operating decision maker. An analysis of the Group’s results by segment are 
disclosed in Note 6.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historic experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal 
the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
(a) Valuation of inventories
In applying the Group’s accounting policy for the valuation of inventories the Directors are required to assess the expected selling price 
and costs to sell each of the plots or units that constitute the Group’s land bank and work in progress. Estimation of the selling price is 
subject to significant inherent uncertainties, in particular the prediction of future trends in the market value of land.
Whilst the Directors exercise due care and attention to make reasonable estimates taking into account all available information in 
estimating the future selling price, the estimates will, in all likelihood, differ from the actual selling prices achieved in future periods and 
these differences may, in certain circumstances, be very significant. The critical judgement in respect of planning consent (see below) 
further increases the level of estimation uncertainty in this area.
(b) Income taxes
The Group recognises tax/deferred tax assets and liabilities for anticipated tax based on estimates of when the tax/deferred tax will be 
paid or recovered. When the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such differences impact the 
period in which the determination is made. Critical accounting estimates relate to the profit forecasts used to determine the extent to 
which deferred tax assets are recognised from available losses.
(c) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
The fair value of instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The Group uses its 
judgement to select a variety of methods and make assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing.
(d) Investment properties
Investment properties are reviewed annually for impairment; critical accounting estimates relate to the forecasts prepared in order to 
assess the carrying value.
(e) Discounting on deferred consideration of inventories
The Group discounts deferred consideration of inventories by discounted cash flow method; the Group considers that the cost of debt 
capital is the most appropriate discount rate.
Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies
Inventories
The Group values inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is based on the judgement of the 
probability that planning consent will be given for each site. The Group believes that, based on the Directors’ experience, planning 
consent will be given. If planning consent was not achieved then a provision may be required against inventories. 
Zero Dividend Preference shares
The Group has in issue Zero Dividend Preference shares which are accounted for as debt. ZDP shares are repayable, plus accrued 
interest to date, in the event of a takeover. The Directors consider that the potential early repayment meets the definition of a derivative 
instrument under IAS39. However, they consider that this instrument is closely related to the host contract and therefore have not 
accounted for the embedded derivative separately.

The Group has entered into an Option and Development Services Agreement (The Agreement) with DGVL. The Directors have considered 
the requirements of IAS27 ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’ (revised 2008) and ‘SIC 12 Consolidation – special purpose 
entities’ and do not believe that the Group has the power to control DGVL. DGVL makes its own decisions regarding the development of 
the site even though the director of DGVL receives property advice to consider and property services from the Group. The Directors also 
consider that the Group does not have the decision making powers to obtain the majority of the benefits and the risks of the activities 
of DGVL as the shareholder of DGVL maintains control as to whether he finances the deferred land consideration payments. The key 
requirement in influencing Inland’s profit share is the basis on which deferred consideration is satisfied. This is at the discretion of the 
DGVL director and hence he can improve his profit share, or allow Inland to arrange the funding. Therefore, the Directors do not believe 
that DGVL should be consolidated within the Group’s financial statements.
The Group is entitled to receive a fee for the provision of planning application services, assistance in obtaining statutory and third party 
consents, assistance in entering into development and construction agreements, assistance in achieving sales, assistance in engaging 
professional advisers, seeking opportunities to generate interim revenues and the potential provision of finance to DGVL in respect of the 
site known as Drayton Garden Village. Under the agreement the Group has the potential to earn up to 90% of the profits realised from the 
sale of the property over the life of the project.
The Group’s relationship with DGVL is further explained in Note 14 and balances in Note 17.
Because the final decision on the financial and operational activities of DGVL resides with the director of DGVL, the Directors of Inland 
Homes plc do not consider that they have significant influence over DGVL and therefore DGVL is not considered to be an associate or a 
subsidiary undertaking.
At 30 June 2013 the funding arrangements in place for the satisfaction of deferred consideration entitled Inland to 74.4% of the profits 
expected to be realised from the sale of the property over the life of the project. In accordance with The Agreement, 67.44% of the total 
profits would be due to the Group for the provision of planning application and property management services completed at the balance 
sheet date and this has to be accounted for under IAS18. 6.96% of the profits would be due to the Group for the provision of finance to 
DGVL and would be accounted for under IAS39 as notional interest income.
In calculating the fee for the provision of planning application and property services to DGVL recognised in the year, under IAS18 the 
Group has estimated the following:
•	 total profits (total expected sales less total estimated development costs to completion) to be realised from the sale of the property;
•	 profits would be realised over six years from 1 July 2010;
•	 percentage, where the stage of completion is an appropriate basis for evaluating fair value, of planning application and property 
services provided to DGVL as at the period end with the balance to be provided over the remaining life of the project (i.e. in future 
accounting periods); and
•	 the fair value of completed service components at the year end.
During the year ended 30 June 2013 the Group has recognised £3.00 million (2012: £3.65 million) in revenue within the Group Income 
Statement for such services to DGVL.
In calculating the fee for the provision of finance to DGVL, under IAS39 the Group has estimated the following:
•	 total profits (total expected sales less total estimated development costs to completion) to be realised from the sale of the property; 
and
•	 profits would be realised over six years from 1 July 2010.
Under IAS39 the Group has a choice as to how to account for the asset. The Directors consider the most appropriate classification for 
the asset to be ‘loans and receivables’ due to the underlying asset being a ‘non derivative’ financial asset with fixed or determinable 
payments. The effective interest rate method has been applied in calculating the income in the period. See Note 17. 
During the year ended 30 June 2013 the Group has recognised £0.25 million (2012: £0.24 million) within notional interest income in the 
Group Income Statement in respect of such fees.

74.4% of gross profit (£000) 1,241 2,084 7,513
The accounting policy for revenue recognition by DGVL is as follows:
Turnover comprises the sale of land acquired for resale, the sale of equipment and materials and amounts receivable by the Company in 
respect of other services rendered during the period excluding value added tax. Turnover in respect of the sale of land is recognised at 
the point of completion, when the title passes. Turnover from other services is recognised as the service is delivered. Turnover on the sale 
of equipment is recognised on the completion of the sale.
5. Exceptional costs
The Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land bank in view of current market conditions. Where the estimated 
future net realisable value of the site is less than the carrying value within the Group Statement of Financial Position, the Group has 
impaired the land value. This has resulted in an impairment of £1.5 million (2012: £nil) during the year which is recognised in cost of sales.
6. Income and segmental analysis
The Group generates income by way of land sales. It also generates income from housebuilding, fees from planning and property 
management services and other related services. These operating segments are monitored and strategic decisions are made on the 
basis of segment operating results. The segmental analysis of operations is as follows:

During the year ended 30 June 2012, the Directors reviewed the valuation of the investment on the fair value less costs to sell basis and 
concluded that a £500,000 reversal of the impairment is required, based on a indicative offer received during the year. During the year 
ended 30 June 2013 Howarth purchased Inland’s holding in that company for a consideration of £1.4 million.
On 18 December 2008, Inland entered into an Option and Development Services Agreement with DGVL which granted Inland Limited an 
option for a consideration of £250,000 to purchase the share capital of DGVL at an exercise price of £1. The initial period of the option 
was for one year from the date of the agreement and this can be extended on up to four occasions to a maximum period of ten years by 
making further payments. During the years ended 30 June 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the option period was extended to expire on  
15 January 2019 in consideration of £1,200,000. In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for financial assets, the option has 
been measured at fair value at 30 June 2013, which resulted in a fair value gain of £49,000 (2012: loss of £145,000) that has been 
recognised in the Group Income Statement, resulting in the option being valued at £163,000 over and above the actual consideration 
paid for the option. The option is not currently exercisable and only becomes exercisable when the development owned by DGVL is 
completed.
During the year ended 30 June 2010, the Group entered into a joint venture with Howarth for the development of 51 units at a site 
in Croxley Green, Hertfordshire in a company called Harvey Road (Rickmansworth) Limited. The Group has invested £nil (2012: 
£2,302,000). Although Howarth owns 100% of the issued share capital of Harvey Road (Rickmansworth) Limited, Inland Directors 
constitute 50% of the Board of Directors and therefore control 50% of the entity and Inland is entitled to 50% of the profits made by the 
entity. The Group’s 50% share of the profits after tax for the period to 30 June 2013 amounts to £676,000 (2012: £162,000) that has 
been recognised in the Group Income Statement. The related tax amounts to £213,000 (2012: £55,000).

through future taxable profits is probable. The Group has capital losses amounting to £17,162,000 (2012: £17,162,000) that have not 
been recognised as the Directors consider the realisation of the losses is not expected to crystallise in the future.

During the year a total of £23,431,000 (2012: £2,151,000) of inventories was included in the Group Income Statement as an expense. 
The Group conducted a review of the net realisable value of its land bank in view of current market conditions. Where the estimated 
future net realisable value of the site is less than the carrying value within the Group Statement of Financial Position, the Group has 
impaired the land value. This has resulted in an impairment of £1.5 million (2012: £nil). Included in the value of inventories above is  
£18.2 million (2012: £15.2 million) which is carried at fair value less costs to sell (net realisable value). The amount of inventories pledged 
as security against borrowings is £29.5 million (2012: £23.8 million).

The carrying value of trade and other receivables is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value. No trade receivables are 
considered to be impaired. There were no unimpaired trade receivables that were past due at the reporting date.
Other receivables includes an amount of £13.7 million (2012: £1.5 million) accrued in respect of costs and sales invoices that will be 
reimbursed by DGVL. The carrying value is considered a reasonable approximation of fair value.
All of the Group’s trade and other receivables have been reviewed for indicators of impairment.

The Company currently holds 1,325,000 (2012: 1,325,000) of its own shares in treasury.
During the year ended 30 June 2013 18,299,948 shares were issued at a cash consideration of 27p per share, generating a premium  
of 17p per share.
The redeemable shares are not entitled to receive any dividends and carry one vote per share in general meetings. On a return of capital, 
the holders of redeemable shares will receive £1 per share unless the conditions described below are met, in which event the entitlement 
of holders of redeemable shares will be enhanced as described below.
In the event that: (i) the return to holders of ordinary shares (calculated as dividends received, together with the increase in share price 
over 50p exceeds 10% per annum compounded annually); and (ii) the relevant holder of redeemable shares has not voluntarily ceased to 
be employed by or engaged to provide services to the Company or any Group company or been dismissed for cause then the following 
provisions will apply:
i. on a takeover (including a takeover effected by a scheme of arrangement) the holders of the redeemable shares will become entitled 
to redeem their shares at a price which is calculated so as to attribute to all the redeemable shares the difference between the 
takeover offer price per share and 35p multiplied by 11,123,494; or
ii. on a winding up, the assets attributable to the redeemable shares will likewise be calculated to be such amount as would represent 
the difference between the amount attributable to each ordinary share and 35p multiplied by 11,123,494.
According to the Company’s Articles of Association, the redeemable shares can convert into deferred shares of 10p each. The deferred 
shares shall not confer the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting. On a winding up, after 
the distribution of the first £10,000,000 of the assets of the Company, the holders of the deferred share (if any) shall be entitled to receive 
an amount equal to the nominal value of such deferred shares pro rata to their respective holdings.
The Company operates an unapproved share option scheme. Awards under each scheme are made periodically to employees. Share 
options vest three years after the date of grant and have an exercise period of seven years. The schemes are all cash-settled.

25. Contingencies
The Group has the following contingent liability as at 30 June 2013:
•	 A subsidiary undertaking, Poole Investments plc, ceased to participate in its operating subsidiary’s pension scheme when it 
disposed of former subsidiaries in May 2004. The Scheme’s principal employer, Pilkington’s Tiles Limited went into administration 
on 14 June 2010 and as a result Poole may be liable for a share of the cost of securing the liabilities of the Scheme pertaining to its 
two former employees should there be a deficit on the Scheme’s fund. The Directors consider that, as at the balance sheet date, 
material uncertainty exists over the basis and calculation of any obligation that may fall due to Poole. Advice is being sort to clarify 
the Company’s position. A provision has therefore not been made in the financial statements as the basis of any provision cannot be 
reliably established.
No provisions have been made in these financial statements in respect of this contingent liability.
26. Commitments
The Group leases an office and some plant and machinery under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The leases have varying 
terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:
2013
£000
2012
£000
Due in less than one year 72 68
Due later than one year and not later than five years 10 61
82 129
The rental contract for the office building rented since 28 April 2009 at 2 Anglo Office Park, 67 White Lion Road, Amersham, HP7 9FB 
has a non-cancellable term of five years.
27. Capital management policies and procedures
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
•	 to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders; and
•	 to ensure sufficient liquid resources are available to meet the funding requirement of its projects and to fund new projects where 
identified.
This is achieved through ensuring sufficient bank and other facilities are in place and further details are given in Note 28 to the Group 
accounts. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of the equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on 
the face of the Group Statement of Financial Position.
The movement in the capital to overall financial ratio is shown below. The target capital to overall financing ratio has been set by the 
Directors at 50% and results over this amount are considered to be a good performance against the target.

The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position in 
accordance with the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of 
inputs used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
 — Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 — Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as  
 prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
 — Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair value 
measurement.
The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Group Statement of Financial Position are grouped into the fair value 
hierarchy as follows:

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2013
1. Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the 
historical cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and consider they remain the most appropriate 
for the Company. The principal accounting policies of the Company have remained unchanged from the previous year.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off.
Equity-settled share-based payment
All share-based payment arrangements are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values using the  
Black–Scholes options pricing model. Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ 
services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee. This fair value is appraised at 
the grant date and excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding 
credit to reserves brought forward.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest. Estimates are subsequently revised if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates. Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in 
the current period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options ultimately exercised are different to 
that estimated on vesting.
Upon exercise of share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and, where 
appropriate, share premium.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Company an obligation to pay more tax 
in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when 
it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis.
2. Profit attributable to members of the Parent Company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company’s profit for the year of £1.4 million (2012: £46,000) has been transferred to reserves.
Auditor’s remuneration
The audit fees for the Company were £5,000 (2012: £5,000). Auditor’s remuneration for other services is disclosed in Note 7 to the 
Group financial statements.
Fees paid to the Company’s auditor, Grant Thornton UK LLP , and its associates for services other than statutory audit of the Company 
are not disclosed in Inland Homes plc’s financial statements since the Group financial statements of Inland Homes plc are required to 
disclose non-audit fees on a consolidated basis.
3. Directors’ remuneration
See Note 8 to the Group financial statements.

7. Share capital continued
During the year ended 30 June 2013 18,299,948 shares were issued at a cash consideration of 27p per share, generating a premium  
of 17p per share.
The redeemable shares are not entitled to receive any dividends and carry one vote per share in general meetings. On a return of capital, 
the holders of redeemable shares will receive £1 per share unless the conditions described below are met, in which event the entitlement 
of holders of redeemable shares will be enhanced as described below.
In the event that: (i) the return to holders of ordinary shares (calculated as dividends received, together with the increase in share price 
over 50p exceeds 10% per annum compounded annually); and (ii) the relevant holder of redeemable shares has not voluntarily ceased to 
be employed by or engaged to provide services to the Company or any Group company or been dismissed for cause then the following 
provisions will apply:
i. on a takeover (including a takeover effected by a scheme of arrangement) the holders of the redeemable shares will become entitled 
to redeem their shares at a price which is calculated so as to attribute to all the redeemable shares the difference between the 
takeover offer price per share and 35p multiplied by 11,123,494; or
ii. on a winding up, the assets attributable to the redeemable shares will likewise be calculated to be such amount as would represent 
the difference between the amount attributable to each ordinary share and 35p multiplied by 11,123,494.
According to the Company’s Articles of Association, the redeemable shares can convert into deferred shares of 10p each. The deferred 
shares shall not confer the right to be paid a dividend or to receive notice of or attend or vote at a general meeting. On a winding up, after 
the distribution of the first £10,000,000 of the assets of the Company, the holders of the deferred share (if any) shall be entitled to receive 
an amount equal to the nominal value of such deferred shares pro rata to their respective holdings.
Details of the Company’s share option schemes can be found in Note 21 to the Group accounts.

Chairman’s Statement 
by Richard Inglewood
IN MY FIRST CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT, IT IS A PARTICULAR
PLEASURE TO CONVEY FURTHER
GOOD NEWS. The period ended 
3 September 2005 was one of
major expansion for the Group. 
In November 2004, the acquisition of Meneba (UK) more than doubled
the size of Carr’s flour business, and in July 2005 the acquisition by our
associate company, Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations), of certain
assets of W & J Pye (in administration) nearly doubled volumes of
compound and blended animal feed. In addition, Crystalyx Products, a
feed block joint venture, was established in Germany and a Carlisle-based
fuel oil distributor, Wallace Oils, was acquired.
The year also witnessed a seventh successive annual increase in adjusted
earnings per share.
Prospects for further progress remain good.
the future is
positive 03
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The figures in this paragraph take no account of exceptional items. In
the 53 weeks (2004: 52 weeks), on turnover up 23.4% at £192.1m
(2004: £155.7m), total operating profit increased by 26.9% to £7.33m
(2004: £5.78m), whilst pre-tax profit was 19.8% ahead at £6.14m
(2004: £5.13m). Adjusted earnings per share advanced by 19.5% to
47.7p (2004: 39.9p). 
Exceptional items comprise an exceptional gain of £4.11m on the
disposal of the Bendall’s site and charges of £0.35m and £0.89m for
the post acquisition rationalisation of the acquired flour business and the
Pye business, respectively, a net gain of £2.88m. 
After exceptional items, the reported figures were a total operating profit
of £6.1m (2004: £5.8m), pre-tax profit of £9.02m (2004: £5.13m) and
earnings per share of 87.5p (2004: 39.9p).
Period end equity shareholders’ funds increased by 23.2% to £29.61m
(2004: £24.04m), representing net assets per share of 360.5p (2004:
297.7p). Net debt of £14.92m compared with £5.76m at 28 August
2004, giving gearing of 50.4% and 24.0%, respectively. This reflects the
£8.75m of cash required to fund the Meneba acquisition and the £1.32m
initial cash consideration for the Wallace acquisition. Net interest payable of
£1.19m (2004: £0.65m) was covered 6.2 times (2004: 8.9 times) by
total operating profit before exceptional items.
DIVIDENDS
A final dividend per share of 11.0p (2004: 9.0p), up 22.2%, is
proposed, payable on 19 January 2006 to shareholders on the register
at close of business on 16 December 2005, with an ex-dividend date of 
14 December 2005.
Together with the interim dividend per share of 5.0p (2004: 4.5p), total
dividends per share are 18.5% higher at 16.0p (2004:13.5p), covered
3.0 times (2004: 3.0 times) by adjusted earnings per share.
The AGM will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Monday 9 January 2006 at the
Crown Hotel, Wetheral, Carlisle.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
This has been a significant period for Carr’s, which included major
acquisitions strengthening our position in both the food and agriculture
markets. It is a testament to the underlying strength of our business
that it continued to perform well during this busy period. We are
especially pleased with the performance of our food business which,
despite flooding at a major customer’s premises in Carlisle in January
2005 and a serious fire at another customer one month later,
successfully integrated the Meneba business, with its two mills at
Kirkcaldy (Fife) and Maldon (Essex).
In July 2005 the Pye acquisition comprising four compound feed mills
and one blended feed mill enabled a certain amount of rationalisation 
in animal feed production which was commercially necessary. The
integration of this business with Carrs Billington Agriculture Operations
has proved challenging as we rationalise and we anticipate benefits to
be forthcoming in 2006.
Another major event late in the period was the disposal of the site from
which Bendalls Engineering operated and its relocation to a newly built
factory elsewhere in Carlisle, together with the purchase of new
equipment. The move took place during June and July 2005 and was
completed with minimal disruption to our production timetable and our
customers.
In September, post period end, we formed a joint venture company with
Wynnstay Group PLC and Welsh Feed Producers Limited to market
and sell animal feed, fertilisers and other farm requirements in Wales.
Carr’s interest in the joint venture is 50%.
BOARD
Sadly, David Newton resigned from the Board, because of illness, 
at the time of the Interim Announcement in April 2005, having been 
non-executive Chairman since April 1996. David Newton made a major
contribution to the Group’s growth during his time on the Board for which
we are all grateful. We wish him every good fortune in his retirement.
In September 2005, I was appointed his successor, having been a 
non-executive director since September 2004.
At the same time, Alistair Wannop was appointed a non-executive
director, bringing the number of non-executive directors to three. Alistair is
a major figure in Cumbrian agriculture and brings to the Board expertise in
both agriculture and food.
OUTLOOK
Agriculture
Prospects for Agriculture very much depend upon the successful
integration of the compound and blended feed operations of Carrs
Billington Agriculture with those of the Pye acquisition. Nonetheless 
we are confident that the strategy we have followed will provide real
benefits. More generally, the UK Agriculture business will have to
contend with challenging market conditions made more difficult by the
uncertainty and damage to farmers’ cash flow directly caused by
changes in the support regime.
Food
Flour is trading strongly in a market which continues to be satisfactory.
Flour has and will benefit from the successful integration of the Carr’s
Flour Milling and Meneba operations and from the effect of a full-year’s
ownership of the latter.
Engineering
Engineering, much the Group’s smallest activity, is on an upward trend, but
its continuing success is likely to be influenced significantly by the extent of
Bendalls success in winning nuclear decommissioning work from BNFL.
OVERALL
The Board believes that, in the period ending 2 September 2006, the
expanded business will register another creditable performance for Carrs.

Chief Executive’s Review 
by Chris Holmes
the business
is growing
IN THE PERIOD ENDED 3 SEPTEMBER
2005, THE GROUP AGAIN ACHIEVED
RECORD UNDERL YING RESULTS.
Those were achieved from improved
trading in the Food division, in part as a
result of the Meneba UK flour acquisition,
Engineering division’s return to profit and
from the Agriculture division performing
well with results similar to last year. 05
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
FEED
The Group’s animal feed business comprises (in association with
Edward Billington & Sons Limited) the UK manufacture of animal feeds
by Carrs Billington Agriculture at Carlisle (Cumbria), Langwathby
(Cumbria), Lancaster (Lancashire) and Stone (Staffordshire) and the
blending of animal feeds at Askrigg (North Yorkshire), Kirkbride
(Cumbria) and Lancaster.
The market for ruminant animal feeds was difficult last year with severe
manufacturing over-capacity in the north of England resulting in margins
being under constant pressure. This resulted in reduced profits of own
feed and that of our associate company, Carrs Billington Agriculture
(Operations). In testing trading conditions it is important that we adhere
to our strategy and seize opportunities that secure our trading position.
Accordingly on 15 July 2005 our associate company acquired certain
trade and assets of W & J Pye Limited (in Administration) and
immediately initiated a consultation process with the management to
restructure the business. Following consultation it was agreed to cease
production at the acquired Blackburn and Shrewsbury feed mills in
addition to our feed mill at Penrith. The retained business was
transferred to our newly acquired feed mills in Lancaster and
Langwathby and also to our existing feed mills at Carlisle and Stone. 
On 1 October 2005, subsequent to the period end, we formed a new
joint venture company, Bibby Agriculture Limited, with Carrs Billington
Agriculture (Sales) being a 50% shareholder and Wynnstay Group PLC
and Welsh Feed Producers Limited each having a 25% shareholding.
Bibby Agriculture Limited will market animal feed, fertiliser and other
farm requirements in Wales with the feed supplied from the three
shareholders’ mills.
In the USA our two low-moisture animal feed block plants, at Belle
Fourche, South Dakota and Poteau, Oklahoma, manufacture Smartlic
and Feed in a Drum. During the period, they traded with large cost
increases in the base raw material, molasses. During the period we also
commenced marketing our range of equine products, Horslyx, which is
successfully sold in the UK, to the USA market, resulting in high initial
promotional costs. Consequently, the results are lower than last year.
However, the raw material cost increases are now recovered and, with
lower marketing costs associated with Horslyx, we expect profit growth
in the current year.
In the UK the growth of our speciality equine and calf products
continued. In February 2005, Horslyx Mini Licks, a treat for horses, 
was launched. Sales of Crystalyx continue to benefit from the adjacent
molasses terminal facility to the plant at Silloth in Cumbria.
In December 2005 we will commission a new low-moisture animal feed
plant to manufacture Crystalyx in Oldenburg, Germany with our 50%
joint venture partner, Agravis, one of Germany’s largest agricultural
companies. We look forward to growing new markets in continental
Europe.
FERTILISER
The fertiliser business performed well, with sales volumes of speciality
fertiliser encouraging and of traditional fertiliser similar to last year. The
investment programme to upgrade the production facilities at our three
blending sites – Invergordon (Easter Ross), Montrose (Angus) and
Silloth (Cumbria) – following the restructuring in 2003 was completed
during the period, giving higher capacity to meet seasonal demand.
The commitment to developing fertiliser products and services
appropriate to farming needs, post-CAP reform, is reflected in
increasing sales of our unique range of environmentally protective
fertiliser, New Choice. Through such developments Carr’s is well placed
to provide farmers with a whole-farm, integrated approach to nutrient
management covering all aspects of the soil/plant/animal cycle.
RETAIL
Again, we enjoyed a strong performance from our existing 14 retail
agricultural branches, operating from Milnathort in Kinross to Leek in
Staffordshire, with sales growth of 7%. We gained five branches from
the Pye acquisition which will help achieve our aim of continued growth
in retail. Our branches sell a wide product range to farmers with our
ultimate aim of providing a one stop shop supplying everything from
combine harvesters, tractors, feed, fertiliser, grass seed and wellington
boots, through to animal health products and minerals.
OIL
Pursuing our aim of growing the business and expanding our portfolio,
Wallace Oils was acquired in April 2005. Wallace Oils operates from three
depots in Cumbria and south west Scotland and supplies oils and lubricants
to a broad customer base. Cross-selling opportunities are presented
with both Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) and Carrs retail branches.
The full impact of this acquisition will be seen in the current year.
MACHINERY
Carrs Machinery distributes new and used agricultural and ground care
machinery from branches in Annan (Dumfriesshire), Carlisle and Penrith
(Cumbria), Hexham and Morpeth (Northumberland) and Barnard Castle
(County Durham). These branches have modern workshops and provide
a comprehensive store of spare parts.
Our sales expectations were again beaten, albeit at a lower level of
sales and profitability than the previous year.
Agriculture 06
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Chief Executive’s Review 
continued
Food
Carr’s principal food businesses are Carr’s Flour Mills, with a flour mill at
Silloth and since November 2004, the two flour mills acquired, Hutchisons
at Kirkcaldy (Fife) and Greens at Maldon (Essex). The Silloth mill
experienced a three month loss of flour sales as a result of the flooding at
McVitie’s biscuit factory in Carlisle on 8 January 2005. The impact of the
loss of trade was partly compensated by our insurance programme. In
addition, a serious fire at a customer’s plant bakery, also in Carlisle, in
February resulted in a total loss of flour sales. The bakery is not expected
to re-open. Notwithstanding these events, the Silloth mill performed well,
as did the acquired mills. The integration of the enlarged flour business has
gone well and the business has a strong market presence in the northern
area of the UK and has increased its market in the supply of speciality
mixes. The results of the acquisition in the nine months have been earnings
enhancing, not withstanding reorganisation costs of £0.35 million and are
ahead of expectations. 
The benefits next year of a full year’s trading of Greens and Hutchisons,
combined with the implemented cost savings, should outweigh the severe
increases in energy costs. 
Carrs Breadmaker flour brand range continues to sell well, with listings in
three major multiple retailers. 07

Staff
David Newton, who became the
first non Carr family Chairman in
1996, suffered ill health last year,
retiring from the Board in April
2005. I would like to endorse the
Chairman’s comments by thanking
David for his contribution to the
Group, together with the support
to myself, and wish him a speedy
and full recovery.
2005 has been another year of
record results and I would like to
thank all my colleagues in the UK
and the USA for their individual
contributions in achieving a very
successful year in terms of the
results and positioning the Group
for the future.
Chris Holmes
Chief Executive Officer
21 November 2005 
Engineering comprises Bendalls and R Hind, both 
of which operate from independent sites on the
Kingstown Industrial Estate, Carlisle, and Carrs MSM
which is based in Swindon in Wiltshire. Bendalls,
designs and manufactures specialist steel fabrications
for the global petrochemical, nuclear, renewable
energy and process industries. R Hind provides
vehicle body building and accident repairs for cars
and commercial vehicles. Carrs MSM designs and
manufactures master slave manipulators, which are
key components for many industries but notably the
nuclear industry.
In the period, the Engineering division returned to
profit.
Bendalls performed well and enjoyed a steady flow
of work throughout the period. The high quality of
fabrication work for the nuclear and the oil industries
won many new contracts, not least a contract to
supply pressure vessels to BP for the Caspian Sea
offshore oil development. The sale of the London
Road site in Carlisle and relocation of the division to
the new purpose built 5,000 square metres factory
on the Kingstown Industrial Estate, Carlisle should
give Bendalls the opportunity of winning contracts
which its previous premises would have excluded it
from tendering for. The gain on the disposal of the
site in October was £4.11m and the net cash
retained by Bendalls was £1.3m after incurring the
cost of equipping the new factory and relocating.
Bendalls’ involvement in renewable energy is
ongoing, with the tidal energy project, “SeaGen”,
expected to be commissioned and connected to
the national grid in the second half of 2006. The
project has suffered from delays in release of
government funding resulting in late completion of
front end design activities.
Carrs MSM had a good year and entered the
current year with a good order book.
R Hind improved over the previous year and should
make steady progress this year.

2005. The directors now recommend the payment of a final dividend
of 11.0p per ordinary share, bringing the total for the period to
£1,313,000 (2004: 13.5p per ordinary share, totalling £1,090,000
for the year). Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the
final dividend will be paid on 19 January 2006 to members on the
register at the close of business on 16 December 2005. Shares will
go ex-dividend on 14 December 2005.
SHARE CAPITAL
A total of 100,600 and 39,380 additional ordinary shares of 25p
each were issued during the period as a result of the exercise of
options under the Executive Share Option Plan and the Executive
Share Option Scheme respectively. Further details of the shares
issued under the Executive Share Option Scheme are given in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
ACQUISITIONS
On 18 November 2004 the Company acquired the entire share
capital of Meneba UK Holdings Limited for a consideration of 
£5.1 million including acquisition costs of £0.4 million. Meneba UK
owns and operates two flour mills, one in Kirkcaldy, Fife and the
other in Maldon, Essex. In addition the Company repaid £5.4 million
of inter-company debt owed by Meneba UK to its parent company
immediately following completion of the purchase.
On 28 April 2005 Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited, the
Group’s 51% owned subsidiary company, acquired the entire share

distribution business based in Carlisle and south west Scotland, for
£1.74 million including acquisition costs of £0.1 million, of which
£1.42 million was paid in cash with £0.32 million deferred
consideration payable over two years on achievement of profit targets.
On 15 July 2005 Carrs Billington Agriculture (Operations) Limited, the
Company’s 49% associate company, acquired certain fixed assets,
useable stock and trade debtors of W & J Pye (in administration), an
animal feed producer and distributor based in north west England, for
£15.0 million paid in cash.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
Details of post balance sheet events are given in note 36 to the
accounts.
PERSONNEL
The Group consists of a diverse range of companies which have
developed voluntary practices and procedures for employee involvement
appropriate to their own circumstances and needs. The Group
encourages this approach to provide information and consultation and
believes that this promotes a better understanding of the issues facing
the individual business in which the employee works.
The Group seeks to achieve and maintain a high standard in respect
of health and safety of employees by all practical means and the
active involvement of employees in matters of health and safety is
encouraged.
Employment policies are designed to provide equal opportunities
irrespective of colour, ethnic or natural origin, nationality, sex,
religion, marital or disabled status.

CHARITABLE AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Charitable donations made by the Group during the period
amounted to £12,443 (2004: £7,535). No political contributions
were made (2004: Nil).
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
It is the Company’s policy to agree terms of payment with its
suppliers when agreeing the terms of a business transaction or
transactions. All suppliers are aware of this procedure and the
Company abides by the agreed payment terms subject to the terms
and conditions being met by the supplier. Wherever possible UK
subsidiaries follow the same policy and the overseas subsidiary is
encouraged to adopt similar policies, by applying local best practice.
The amount of trade creditors shown in the Group balance sheet at
the end of the financial period represents 42 days (2004: 36 days)

financial period.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
In common with all UK listed companies the Company is required to
comply and adopt International Financial Reporting Standards for the
first financial statements commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
Therefore the first accounting period affected will be for the year
ending 2 September 2006. The adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards will have both accounting and business
implications and the Company is preparing itself for this transition.
PENSIONS
The directors have considered the financial impact on the Group of
the deficit which exists in the Carr’s Milling Industries Pension

benefit section of the scheme. The directors will continue to monitor
the performance of the scheme investments regularly and take
action should the scheme’s deficit increase.
The interests of the directors, as defined in the Companies Act 1985, in the ordinary shares of the Company, other than 
in respect of options to acquire ordinary shares (which are detailed in the analysis of options included in the directors’

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Notice of this year’s Annual General Meeting appears on page
55 and will be held at 11.30 am on Monday 9 January 2006 at the
Crown Hotel, Wetheral, Carlisle.
The notice of Annual General Meeting includes the following items
of Special Business:
(i) Resolution 7: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
The resolution renews the existing authority to the Directors
under Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985 to allot shares
by way of rights to shareholders and to allot shares for cash
up to a nominal value of £102,670 (representing 5 percent of
the issued share capital) without first offering such shares pro
rata to existing shareholders, as would otherwise by required
under Section 89 of that Act. This will allow the Directors
some flexibility when considering how best to finance new
business opportunities. In accordance with the requirements
of the London Stock Exchange this resolution will come up 
for renewal at the next Annual General Meeting.
(ii) Resolution 8: Purchase its own shares
This resolution renews the existing authority to the directors to
buy, by way of market purchases, up to 821,358 of its own
shares (representing 10 per cent of the issued share capital).
The proposal should not be taken as an indication that the
Company will purchase its own shares. This authority will only
be exercised by the Directors if they are satisfied that it would
result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in
the best interest of shareholders generally.
(iii) Resolutions 9, 10, 11 and 12: Share incentive schemes
These four resolutions cover: approval of the new approved
Executive Share Option Scheme, approval of the new
Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, approval of the
new Sharesave Scheme and the approval of the new Deferred
Bonus Scheme. Details of these resolutions will be set out in
the Chairman’s letter to shareholders dated 8 December 2005.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of
the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been
used and applied consistently and that reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates have been made in the preparation of the
financial statements for the period ended 3 September 2005. The
directors also confirm that applicable accounting standards have
been followed and that the financial statements have been prepared
on the going concern basis.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and of the Group, and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
AUDITORS
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have expressed their
willingness to continue in office as auditors to the Company and
Group. A resolution to appoint them as auditors will be proposed at
the next annual general meeting.

Corporate Governance
The Company remains committed to high standards of corporate
governance. All listed companies are obliged to report on how they
apply the Principles of Good Governance set out in the revised
Combined Code and whether they complied with the Code’s
Provisions throughout the accounting period. The Board complied
throughout the period with the provisions set out in the Combined
Code issued in July 2003 apart from those relating to the following:
• one of the two existing non-executive directors is not independent;
however a third non-executive director, who is independent, 
was appointed on 1 September 2005
• bonuses and benefits in kind paid to executive directors are
pensionable
• the directors’ contract periods are two years
• there are no specific provisions for compensation on early
termination
• the Board did not have in place during the period a formal and
rigorous process of evaluation of its own performance and that
of its committees. Rigorous but informal evaluation has
historically been carried out by the Chairman and Chief
Executive, and evaluation of the performance of the individual
directors has also been carried out by the Remuneration
Committee
• the Remuneration Committee comprised both existing 
non-executive directors, albeit one director is not independent;
however a third non-executive director, who is independent, was
appointed on 1 September 2005
• there is no separate Nominations Committee to assess and
recommend new directors. Instead the Board as a whole
considers these areas following initial scrutiny and
recommendations by the Chief Executive and Chairman
• the audit committee comprised the two existing non-executive
directors, both of whom should be independent but one of
whom is not; however a third non-executive director was
appointed on 1 September 2005
• there has been no formal review by the audit committee of the
arrangements by which staff of the Group may, in confidence,
raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of
financial reporting or other matters
These matters are discussed further in the relevant paragraphs
below and in the Remuneration Report.
BOARD STRUCTURE AND COMMITTEES
The Board at 3 September 2005 comprised two executive directors
(including the Group Chief Executive), who do not hold directorships
outside the Group, and three non-executive directors (including the
Chairman), who bring a range of skills and experience to the Board.
The Combined Code requires the Board to determine whether its
non-executive members are independent. The Board considers that
Lord Inglewood and Alistair Wannop are independent and Robert
Heygate is not independent for the purposes of the code.
Biographical details of all current directors are set out on page 9.
The Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee both have
written terms of reference.
DIRECTORS
The directors supervise the management of the business and the
affairs of the Company and see their prime responsibility as being to
determine the broad strategy of the Company and to ensure its
implementation with a view to enhancing the prosperity of the
Company and its shareholders over time. 
Responsibility for the Group’s day-to-day operations is delegated to
the Chief Executive who, supported by the finance director and
executive management, implement the Board’s strategy and manage
the Group’s business.
The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are
separated and clearly defined. The Chairman’s overall responsibility
is to ensure that the Board carries out its responsibilities. The Group
Chief Executive’s responsibilities are to direct and promote the
operation and development of the Group. 
One of the non-executive directors is not considered independent 
as he is deemed to represent a significant shareholder. The Board
considered the appointment of a third non-executive director and on
1 September 2004, Lord Inglewood was appointed a director of the
Company. In April 2005 the Chairman, David Newton, resigned due
to illness. On 1 September 2005, prior to the period end, Alistair
Wannop was appointed a non-executive director and senior
independent non-executive director taking over this role on the
appointment, on the same date, of Lord Inglewood as Chairman.
The Board considered that Lord Inglewood’s other commitments
were not deemed significant. The Board has not set an objective on
the reduction of directors’ service contract periods to one year or
less. The Board does not wish to reduce the service contract period
below the current level of two years as it feels that this is the
minimum appropriate to retain the services of key executives with
significant knowledge of the business in which the Group trades.
Each director is provided with sufficient information to enable him to
discharge his duties and responsibilities as a director.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary. The Board has also established a formal procedure
whereby directors, wishing to do so in the furtherance of their duties,
may take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the
Company’s expense.
The Articles of Association require one-third of the Board to retire 
by rotation at every Annual General Meeting. The revised Combined
Code requires that directors are required to present themselves for
re-election at intervals of no more than three years. It is the Board’s
intention to amend the Articles of Association at an appropriate time
to ensure compliance with this provision, but in the interim, the
Board intends to operate re-elections of directors in a manner to
ensure compliance with the revised Combined Code.
The Board meets regularly and has reserved certain items for its
review and approval, including the annual and interim results, the
annual profit and cash flow budget, significant acquisitions and
divestments, and senior management appointments. 13

ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS
Details of the number of meetings of, and member’s attendance at, the Board, Audit and Remuneration Committees during the period are
set out in the table below.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, the role of
which is to review the performance of the executive directors and to
set the scale and structure of their remuneration, including bonus
arrangements. The Committee comprised Lord Inglewood as
Chairman and A R Heygate. From 1 September 2005 Alistair
Wannop was appointed to this Committee. The report on directors’
remuneration is set out on pages 16 to 19.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
In submitting this Annual Report and the Financial Statements to the
shareholders the Board has sought to ensure that a balanced and
understandable assessment of the Company’s position and
prospects has been presented to shareholders.
The Board has established an Audit Committee comprising the 
non-executive directors, with Robert Heygate as Chairman. From 
1 September 2005 Alistair Wannop was appointed to this
Committee. The Committee is responsible inter alia for safeguarding
the Company’s assets. The Committee meets at least twice a year
and reviews the annual and interim financial statements and the
other documents to be sent to shareholders before they are
submitted for Board approval. The Committee also has meetings
with the auditors at least twice a year. The Committee reviews the
non-audit services provided by the audit firm comprising taxation
services and considers that these are not a threat to objectivity and
independence in the conduct of the audit. The auditors have direct
access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and an “open door”
policy has also been adopted in relation to any concerns staff may
have concerning the propriety of Group operations and activities. 
No issues or incidents have come to light as a result of this policy.
The Group does not have an internal auditor as the Board consider
that the Group has not yet reached a size where a separate internal
audit function would be an appropriate or cost effective method of
ensuring compliance with Group policies, and therefore does not
currently propose to introduce a Group internal audit function. This
area will be kept under review as part of the Board’s assessment of
the Group’s systems of internal control.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is designed
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss, and in
relation to the maintenance of proper accounting records and the
reliability of financial information.
The revised Combined Code requires directors to introduce
procedures and review the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control, including financial, operational and compliance
controls and risk management. These procedures establish the
process by which the Board will, on an ongoing basis, identify,
evaluate and manage the significant risks faced by the Group and
carry out its annual review of the effectiveness of the internal
controls. These procedures have been in place for the period under
review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and
financial statements. The Board reviewed the internal controls this
period and it is intended that these procedures will be kept under
review each year and adjusted as appropriate.
The Board’s risk management strategy is to follow a prudent risk
policy. Business risks are evaluated at Group level as part of the
annual budgeting process. The executive directors and the senior
management of subsidiary companies have responsibility for
identifying the risks facing each business and then establishing
procedures or putting policies in place to mitigate or monitor them.
Treasury risks are evaluated by the Group Finance Director who is
responsible to the Board for evaluating all significant borrowings,
foreign currency and interest rate management facilities.
The Group has comprehensive budgets and detailed monthly
reporting, together with daily cash reporting. The annual budget is
reviewed with the senior management and submitted to the Board
for approval. Revised forecasts for the year are prepared if results
are deviating significantly from the budget.  14

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Board recognises the importance of good communications with
all shareholders. The Company maintains dialogue with institutional
shareholders and analysts, and general presentations are made
when financial results are announced. Shareholders have access to
the Company’s website at www.carrs-milling.com.
The Annual General Meeting is the principal forum for all the
directors to engage in dialogue with private investors. All
shareholders are given the opportunity to raise questions at the
meeting. The Company aims to send notices of Annual General
Meetings to shareholders at least 20 working days before the
meeting, as required by the revised Combined Code, and it is the
Company’s practice to indicate the proxy voting results on all
resolutions at the meetings.
GOING CONCERN
Based on normal business planning and control procedures the
directors are confident that the Company has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, the directors adopt the going concern basis in the
preparation of the Group’s financial statements.

Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the statement of group total
recognised gains and losses, the note of group historical cost profits
and losses, the consolidated balance sheet, the company balance
sheet, the consolidated cash flow statement, statement of accounting
policies and the related notes. We have also audited the disclosures
required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985
contained in the directors’ remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of
directors’ responsibilities. The directors are also responsible for
preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and
the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not
consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept
proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the financial
highlights, the chairman’s statement, the chief executive’s review, 
the directors’ report, the corporate governance statement and the
unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s or group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part of
the directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in
the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part of the
directors’ remuneration report are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation
of information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the company and the group at 3 September 2005 and
of the profit and cash flows of the group for the 53 week period
then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
• those parts of the directors’ remuneration report required by 
Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
All matters relating to executive remuneration are determined by the
Remuneration Committee, a sub-committee of the Board of Directors.
The Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman and A R
Heygate, the other non-executive director of the Company who
served on the Board of Directors during the period to 3 September
2005. A G M Wannop was appointed to the Board of Directors on 
1 September 2005 and will serve on the Remuneration Committee.
As appropriate, the Committee may invite the Chief Executive
Officer to participate in some of its discussions. The Committee is
responsible for determining the terms and conditions of employment
of executive directors. It is also responsible for considering
management recommendations for remuneration and employment
terms of the Company’s senior staff, including incentive
arrangements for bonus payments and grant of share options.
The Remuneration Committee’s decisions are made on the basis of
rewarding individuals for the nature of jobs they undertake and their
performance therein. Proper regard is given to the need to attract
and retain high quality, well-motivated staff at all levels and to the
remuneration being paid by similar companies. 
DETAILS OF REMUNERATION
The remuneration of directors is set out in detail on page 18. The
Company’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration
policy that applies to executive directors and the Group’s other
senior management.
Each of the executive directors has a two-year rolling contract. The
most recent executed contracts for the executive directors were
dated 10 June 2002. In the event of termination the executive
directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pensionable
service for the notice periods. The contracts of non-executive
directors of the Company are fixed for two years and the most recent
executed contracts for W R Inglewood, A R Heygate and A G M
Wannop were 1 September 2005.
The Company’s policy is that a proportion of the remuneration of the
executive directors should be performance related. As described
below, executive directors may earn annual incentive payments
together with the benefits of participation in Share Option Schemes.
CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION PACKAGE
In applying the above principles to the determination of executive
director remuneration, the Remuneration Committee gives
consideration to several components which together comprise the
total remuneration package. These consist of the following:
• Basic Salary is determined by the Committee at the beginning
of each year. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee
considers the position in the Group, personal and Company
performance and relies on information on a comparable group 
of companies. Basic salaries were last reviewed in August
2005, with increases taking effect from 1 September 2005. The
next review will take place in August 2006. Executive directors’
contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will
be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
• Annual Bonus is paid up to a maximum of 50% of Basic Salary
on achievement of profit targets and is pensionable.
• Benefits in Kind comprise private healthcare which is
pensionable and critical illness/death in service cover. 
• Pension Contribution. The Company’s defined benefit pension
scheme aims at producing a pension of two-thirds final
pensionable salary at normal retirement age of 60. Due to the
Inland Revenue cap this provision cannot be met in full from the
scheme and supplementary arrangements are in place and are
commented on later. The two executive directors are members
of the pension scheme and can opt, after age 50, to retire early
without actuarial reduction to their pension. Non-executive
directors do not participate in the scheme. Pension entitlement
is calculated on the salary element of remuneration plus the
average of the last three years’ bonuses and taxable benefits in
kind. The executive directors’ pension information is given in the
section subject to audit. 17
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
The pension entitlement is that which would be paid annually on
retirement based on service to the end of the year. Members of the
scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions,
neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the
table on page 18.
The normal retirement age is 60 with a two-thirds surviving spouse’s
pension. On death in service a lump sum equal to four times
pensionable salary is payable together with a surviving spouse’s
pension of two-thirds of the director’s prospective pension. For
death after retirement a spouse’s pension of two-thirds of the
member’s pension is payable plus the balance of a five year
guarantee if applicable.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to be increased annually by
5% or the increase in the Index of Retail Prices (RPI) if less.
For the element of gross salary in excess of the Inland Revenue
limits the Group has established for C N C Holmes a funded
unapproved retirement benefit scheme (FURBS). This arrangement
attempts to provide for a pension of two-thirds of his final
pensionable salary at age 60, inclusive of benefits from his previous
employment, and a surviving spouse’s pension of two-thirds of his
pension. Pensions in payment are to be increased annually by the
increase in RPI. As a result of the previously announced changes to
the funding of pensions, to be effective from April 2006, the
Company ceased contributing to the FURBS from January 2004. No
contributions to the FURBS were made in the period (2004: £49,000).
Any transfer value calculations do not make allowance for discretionary
benefits including pension increases and early retirement.
• Share Options. The Group believes there is benefit to be 
gained from aligning executive directors’ interests (and other
employee interests) with those of shareholders by means of
share options. The award of options is wholly at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. There were no options granted
in the period.

SHARE OPTIONS GRANTED TO DIRECTORS
The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved and an
unapproved share option scheme to reward employees’ performance
and to incentivise at senior levels. Exercise is subject to performance
conditions. For all options granted the exercise criterion has been
that earnings should achieve growth which exceeds the percentage
growth in the Retail Price Index by 2% or more. The rules of the
schemes conform to institutional investor guidelines.
The performance criterion, which applies to the executive directors
to whom options have been granted under the Schemes, was
chosen as it requires significant improvement in financial
performance. No options have been granted at a discount to the
market price at the date of their grant. 20

Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the 53 week period ended 3 September 2005
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and applicable Accounting Standards in
the United Kingdom. A summary of the more important Group
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently
throughout the period and the preceding period, is set out below.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention modified for the revaluation of certain land and
buildings. 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include
the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary companies
prepared to the Saturday nearest to 31 August. The results of
subsidiary companies acquired and sold are included from and up 
to the respective dates of acquisition or sale. 
Subsidiary undertakings are accounted for using acquisition
accounting.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and
liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair
values reflecting their condition at that date. All changes to those
assets and liabilities, and the resulting gains and losses, that arise
after the Group has gained control of the subsidiary are included in
the post-acquisition profit and loss account.
ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS
Associated undertakings are those in which the Group has a
participating interest and over which it exerts significant influence.
The Group’s share of the results of associated undertakings is
included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest
in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated
balance sheet under the equity method of accounting.
JOINT VENTURE
A joint venture arrangement has been entered into during the period.  
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has a long-term interest
and shares control with one or more other venturers. The Group’s
interest in the joint venture’s net assets is included in investments in
the consolidated balance sheet under the equity method of accounting.
As the joint venture has not yet commenced trading there is no
impact on the consolidated profit and loss account for the period.
TURNOVER
Turnover represents the value of goods despatched or services
rendered to customers, excluding value added tax and inter-group
transactions. In respect of long-term contracts turnover is calculated
on the basis of the stage of completion and the total sales value of
each contract.
REVALUATION OF PROPERTIES
Prior to 1999, some freehold and leasehold properties were
revalued. On adoption of FRS 15 in 1999, the Group followed the
transitional rules to retain the book value of land and buildings.
Transfers are made to retained profits each year in order to amortise
surpluses over the remaining useful lives of the properties. On
disposal the profit or loss is calculated by reference to the net book
value and any unamortised revaluation surplus is transferred from
revaluation reserves to retained profits.
STOCKS
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes production overheads where appropriate.
LONG-TERM CONTRACTS
Turnover on long-term contracts is recognised according to the
stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work
done. A reliable estimate of the profit attributable to work completed
is recognised once the outcome of a contract can be assessed with
reasonable certainty. The amount by which the turnover exceeds
payments on account is shown under debtors as amounts
recoverable on contracts. The costs incurred on long-term contracts
not yet taken to the profit and loss account less related foreseeable
losses and payments on account are shown as work in progress.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost less any amounts written off in
respect of impairment.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES
The Group’s accounting policy for derivatives is to defer the
recognition in the Group profit and loss account of gains and losses
on hedges of revenues, operating payments and capital expenditure
until such time as the underlying transactions are recognised.
Forward foreign exchange contracts entered into as hedges of
future purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies are
recorded at cost. Gains and losses are deferred and matched to the
underlying transaction when it matures.
Interest rate collar agreements taken out are recorded at cost in the
balance sheet and amortised over the period of the agreements.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate collar
agreements are recognised in the net interest payable charge on an
accruals basis.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate
exposures. Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these
derivatives are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense
over the period of the agreements.
Finance costs associated with debt instruments are charged to the
profit and loss account at a constant rate of return. 26
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Statement of Accounting Policies
continued 
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an
obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to
pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they
crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Deferred tax is not
provided on timing differences arising from revaluation of fixed
assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset. Deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely
than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not discounted.
GOODWILL
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions since 31 August 1998 has been
capitalised on the balance sheet and is being amortised over periods
not exceeding 20 years in line with the directors’ view of their useful
economic lives.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions prior to 31 August 1998 remains
eliminated against reserves. This goodwill had been eliminated as a
matter of accounting policy and will be charged or credited in the
profit and loss account on any subsequent disposal.
Negative goodwill arose in the period on the acquisition of Carrs
Animal Feed Supplements Limited (formerly Meneba UK Holdings
Limited). This is being released to the profit and loss account on a
basis consistent with the useful economic life of the non-monetary
assets acquired.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets are capitalised on the balance sheet and
amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years in line with the
directors’ view of their useful economic lives.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation of
tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land and assets in the
course of construction which are not depreciated, in equal annual
instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:
Freehold and 
long leasehold properties 2%
Short leasehold property 10%
Plant and equipment 5% – 25%
GRANTS
Grants received on capital expenditure are recorded as deferred
income and taken to the profit and loss account in equal annual
instalments over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Revenue grants and contributions are credited to the profit and loss
account in the year to which they apply.
LEASED ASSETS
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights
approximating to ownership (“finance leases”), the assets are
treated as if they had been purchased outright. The amounts
capitalised are the present values of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding commitments are shown as obligations under
finance leases.
Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged to the profit and loss
account in equal annual instalments over the shorter of the lease
terms and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest
elements and the interest is charged using the actuarial method.
All other leases are “operating leases” and the annual rentals are
charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
PENSION COSTS
The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is
charged to the profit and loss account over the periods benefiting
from the employees’ services. The difference between the charge to
the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the scheme
is included as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries recorded in foreign currencies
are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of
the financial year and the results of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Differences
on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net
investment in subsidiary companies, and from the translation of the
results of those companies at average rate, are taken to reserves
and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and
losses. All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit
and loss account in the year in which they arise. 27
Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2005
1 The Company has taken advantage of the exemption, under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, from presenting its own profit and
loss account. The profit after tax for the period dealt with in the accounts of the Company was £5,326,000 (2004: £1,533,000).

Earnings per share are calculated by reference to a weighted average of 8,127,328 shares (2004: 8,073,599) in issue during the period.
Exceptional costs charged against the operating profit and non-operating exceptional gains do not relate to the profitability 
of the Group on an ongoing basis. Therefore an adjusted earnings per share is presented as follows:
2005 2004

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all
dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options granted to directors
and share options granted to senior management, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s
ordinary shares during the period.

The trade and certain assets of George Shackleton & Sons Limited were disposed of on 30 March 2005. There was no profit or loss
arising on disposal. 
Goodwill of £100,000 arose on the acquisition of the trade and certain assets of Angus Fertilizers Limited and is being amortised on a
straight line basis over five years. This is the period over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying business
acquired is expected to exceed the value of these underlying assets.
Negative goodwill of £639,000 arose on the acquisition of the entire ordinary share capital of Carrs Animal Feed Supplements Limited
(formerly Meneba UK Holdings Limited) (see note 25).
This negative goodwill has been allocated to the non-monetary assets of the Company at acquisition and is being released to the profit
and loss account on a basis consistent with the useful economic life of those assets.

19 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Set out below are the narrative and numerical disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 13 “Derivatives and other
financial instruments”.
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources, and various items
such as trade debtors, trade creditors etc., that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to
manage the finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group also enters into derivatives transactions (principally foreign currency contracts and interest rate caps). The purpose of such
transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risk from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. The Board reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These policies have remained unchanged
throughout the period.
Short-term debtors and creditors
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired
currencies at fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate collars and swaps to manage the Group’s exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. At the year end £6.569 million (2004: £1.225 million) of the Group’s borrowings were at a fixed rate of
interest. 
Liquidity rate risk
As regards liquidity, the Group’s policy throughout the period has been to maintain a mix of short and medium term borrowings. 
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. In addition it is the Group’s policy to maintain committed undrawn facilities in
order to provide flexibility in the management of the Group’s liquidity.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s subsidiary, Animal Feed Supplement Inc., operates in the USA and its revenues and expenses are denominated
exclusively in US dollars. The Group’s sterling balance sheet is not protected from movements in US dollar/sterling exchange rate. 
The foreign currency risk in relation to the Group’s other overseas subsidiary, George Shackleton & Sons Limited which operates in
Eire, is insignificant. 38

All the Group’s creditors falling due within one year (other than bank, other borrowings and finance leases) are excluded from the
above table either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax
balances. 
The effect of the Group’s interest rate swap is to classify £4.9 million of sterling floating rate borrowings in the above table as fixed rate.

19 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and
financial liabilities at 3 September 2005. Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length
transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest. Where
available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values have been
calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

Primary financial instruments held or issued
to finance the Group’s operations:
Short-term financial liabilities and current portion of
long-term borrowings (10,666) (10,666) (4,013) (4,013)
Long-term borrowings excluding current portion (7,399) (6,006) (2,836) (2,688)

Other debtors due after more than one year 23 23 55
Derivative financial instruments held to manage
the interest rate and currency profile:
Forward foreign currency contracts —— —5
Interest rate swaps — (106) ——
The fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts are based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet
date. The fair value of the short-term borrowings and cash at bank approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity 
of these instruments.
Gains and losses on hedges
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on purchases denominated 
in foreign currencies immediately those purchases are transacted. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not 
recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures. An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses has not 
been provided as the balances were under £50,000. This was also the case for the year ended 28 August 2004.

The elimination of goodwill arising on prior years’ acquisitions of £406,000 is in respect of deferred consideration on the acquisition of
James A Bendall (Property) Limited. This acquisition was made prior to 31 August 1998 and therefore the adjustment to the original
goodwill has been accounted for in accordance with the standards in force at that time.
Cumulative goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 31 August 1998, which has been eliminated against Group reserves, amounts 
to £5,448,000 (2004: £5,042,000).
Additional minority interest arose during the period on the increase in the shareholding of Northern Feeds Solutions Limited by Carrs
Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited. This represents the reduction of the minority interest in the negative net assets of Northern Feeds
Solutions Limited on the date that the additional shares were acquired.

34 PENSION COMMITMENTS 
The Group participates in two defined benefit pension schemes, Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and Carrs Billington
Agriculture Pension Scheme. The Company has accounted for the schemes under SSAP 24 and adopted the transitional rules of FRS 17.
Carr’s Milling Industries
The Company sponsors the Carr’s Milling Industries Pension Scheme 1993 and offers a defined contribution and a defined benefit section.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are invested with an independent investment manager.
The pension expense for the defined contribution section of the scheme for the period was £177,000 (2004: £143,000). Contributions
totalling £8,000 (2004: £nil) were payable to the fund at the year end and are included in creditors.
A Group Personal Pension plan was established on the acquisition of Carrs Animal Feed Supplements Limited (formerly Meneba UK
Holdings Limited). Since the acquisition date, the pension expense for the period in respect of this scheme was £173,000.
The defined benefit section of the scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities (including expected future earnings and pension
increases). It is subject to an independent valuation on a triennial basis by a qualified actuary who determines the rate of the employer’s
contribution. Pension scheme contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the
employees’ working lives within the Group. The most recent valuation of the scheme was at 1 January 2003 and adopted the Projected
Unit Method. It was assumed that the investment returns would be 7% per annum and that the salary increases would average 3.25%
per annum. It was also assumed that present and future pensions, in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMPs), would
increase once in payment at the lesser of 5% per annum and price inflation and that GMPs would increase at the rate of 3% per annum.  48

34 PENSION COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED) 
The actuarial valuation as at 1 January 2003 shows that the market value of assets relating to the defined benefit section of the scheme
was £18,997,000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 66% of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to
members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. At 1 January 2003, the scheme showed a deficit of £9,577,000.
An accrual of £781,000 (2004: £488,000) is included in the Group net assets representing the deficit of the amount funded over the
accumulated pension expense.
The pension contribution made by the Group over the period to the defined benefit section was £1,296,000 (2004: £1,303,000). The
deficit is being amortised, for SSAP 24 purposes, over 12 years being the average remaining service lives of the employees. The
contribution rates payable by employer and employee were increased in 2003 following the triennial valuation of the scheme and will
continue until reviewed at the next valuation due as at 1 January 2006.
The following disclosures, required by FRS 17, relate to the defined benefit section and exclude insured pension arrangements. The
last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 January 2003 and updated on an
approximate basis to 3 September 2005.

Carrs Billington Agriculture
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited, one of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings, is a participating employer of the Carrs Billington
Agriculture Pension Scheme, another funded defined benefit scheme.
The pension contribution made by Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited over the period to the Carrs Billington Agriculture Pension
Scheme was £295,000 (2004: £169,000). This corresponds to a rate of employer contribution of 35% or 30% from 1 January 2004 and
51% or 46% from 1 September 2004 following the triennial valuation of the scheme as at 31 December 2003.
The actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2003 shows that the market value of assets relating to the scheme was £14,600,000 and the
actuarial value of those assets represented 81% of the actuarial value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for
expected future increase in earnings. The assumptions used in arriving at the valuations were a real rate of return over salary increases
on funds invested of 2% and rate of increase in present and future pensions of 2.65%. At 31 December 2003, the scheme showed a
deficit of £3,500,000.
Carrs Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited also offer a Group Personal Pension Plan to its employees and the pension expense for this
plan in the period was £39,000 (2004: £36,000).
A defined contribution pension scheme was brought into the Group on the acquisition of Wallace Oils Holdings Limited by Carrs
Billington Agriculture (Sales) Limited. Contributions of £3,000 have been made to this scheme since acquisition.
The following disclosures relate to the defined benefit section and exclude insured pension arrangements. The last full actuarial valuation
of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 31 December 2003 and updated on an approximate basis to 
3 September 2005.
It is not possible to identify the underlying share of the pension scheme assets and liabilities that relate to Carr’s Milling Industries PLC.
Approximately 50% of the assets and liabilities of the pension scheme relate to Carr’s Milling Industries PLC and on adoption of FRS 17,
approximately 50% of the assets and liabilities will be included in the Group’s financial statements. 51

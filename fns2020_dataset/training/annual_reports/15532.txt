TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   8 13/06/2011   10:48 Chairman’s 
statement
David Holland
Our success in marketing 
developments in the Far East 
has continued with the launch 
of Avant-garde in April and 
May 2011
In the year to 31 March 2011 Telford Homes 
exchanged contracts for the sale of 368 open 
market properties, an increase of 45 per cent 
over last year. This performance has been 
driven by successful marketing campaigns  
in the Far East, selling properties before 
construction has commenced, together with 
a steady rate of demand from UK buyers.
During the recession the Group reduced  
its investment in new land opportunities 
and switched some of its developments  
to wholly affordable housing. As expected 
this has reduced both the output of finished 
open market homes and profit margins. 
Despite this the Group met market 
forecasts for the year to 31 March 2011 
achieving profit before tax and after 
exceptional items of £3.0 million.
Our success in marketing developments in 
the Far East has continued with the launch 
of Avant-garde in April and May 2011. 
Together with a strong performance at 
the UK launch we have achieved over 170 
sales out of the 257 open market homes on 
the development. These sales secure the 
recognition of profit for Telford Homes and 
our new joint venture partner, The William 
Pears Group, when the homes are handed 
over in 2013 and 2014.
Reduced output and margins will continue 
to keep profits at a lower level in the new 
financial year but these effects will have 
substantially been worked through the 
business by March 2012. Beyond this date 
the Board expects significant growth in the 
number of finished homes from the existing 
development pipeline and has secured 
pre-sales on some of those developments 
at normal margins. The signing of our new 
bank facility in March this year will improve 
our ability to add to the development 
pipeline for future years in a climate where 
many smaller developers are struggling to 
access finance.
As a result the Board is maintaining a 
progressive dividend policy in proposing a 
final dividend of 1.25 pence making a total 
of 2.5 pence for the year (2010: 2.0 pence).
Finally it gives me great pleasure to welcome 
Jon Di-Stefano as our new Chief Executive 
with effect from 1 July 2011. Jon replaces 
Andrew Wiseman and I am confident that 
Telford Homes will continue to prosper under 
his leadership. After ten years in our current 
roles Andrew will take over from me on his full 
time return to Telford Homes in January 2012, 
assuming the position of Executive Chairman, 
thus retaining his skills and knowledge within 
the business. I have been delighted to serve 
as Chairman over a successful decade and I 
look forward to continuing as a Non-Executive 
Director in the future.

Year in Review
www.telfordhomes.plc.uk 09
TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   9 13/06/2011   10:48 The Board is pleased to report that profit before tax for 
the year to 31 March 2011 is in line with expectations at 
£3.0 million after exceptional items (2010: £7.3 million). 
Although the number of open market properties 
completed in the year is lower at 281 (2010: 389) the  
Group has experienced strong demand for early sales 
of its future developments, particularly from purchasers 
in the Far East, such that the number of sales secured 
by contracts exchanged in the year has increased to 
368 (2010: 253). As a result of this and continued sales 
of affordable housing to our housing association partners, 
the Group has revenue secured by contracts exchanged 
of over £135 million to flow into the business over the  
next three years.
Sales and completions
Telford Homes is in the middle of a two year period 
during which the number of open market homes being 
finished is lower than capacity. The Group refrained from 
investing in new land during the recession and, given the 
average construction period for a development is two 
years, this is affecting the number of homes available  
for sale and legal completion up to the middle of 2012. 
Therefore the decline in the number of open market 
completions in the year to 31 March 2011 is caused more 
by the reduced supply of finished homes than by market 
demand or the ability to make sales. Overall sales 
performance has been better than expected due to the 
successful off-plan marketing of developments that are 
due to be finished between mid-2012 and mid-2014.
Profit margins in the year to 31 March 2011 have been 
affected by changes made during the recession to 
favour affordable housing and by impaired open market 
developments that were acquired by the Group in 2006 
and 2007. As expected this combination of reduced 
supply of finished open market homes and lower profit 
margins has brought total profits in the business down. 
The impact of both will continue into the year to 
31 March 2012 such that the Board expects profit 
before exceptional items to be similar year-on-year. 
Almost all of the developments that switched to 
affordable housing and those impaired by prices falling 
during the recession will have worked through the 
development pipeline by the end of the new financial year.
The rate of sales of finished homes to UK buyers  
has remained steady and visitor levels to the Group’s 
sales centres have been consistent during the year. 
Construction of the third and final phase of Queen 
Mary’s Gate in Woodford finished towards the end  
of 2010 and we now have fewer than 60 homes left  
to sell out of nearly 500 across the development. In 
September 2010 the Group acquired The Royal Bank  
of Scotland’s 50 per cent interest in Telford Homes 
(Creekside) Limited, the joint venture set up to develop 
Greenwich Creekside. This development is undergoing  
a period of phased handovers and over half of the  
121 open market homes in the first phase have now 
been handed over to their purchasers.
The availability of mortgage finance for new build 
properties remains the most significant restriction  
on demand in the UK and this is particularly true for first  
time buyers. Bank of England statistics show mortgage 
approvals have been continuing at a steady rate, albeit at 
just 40 per cent of the long term average. Whilst there 
have been some signs of improvement in the number 
of mortgages available, the Council of Mortgage 
Lenders expects gross lending for housing to be 
unchanged in 2011.

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   11 13/06/2011   10:48 Chief Executive's review continued
Alongside a steady UK market, overseas launches 
including Matchmakers Wharf, E9, the Hawksmoors, E1 
and, in April and May 2011, Avant-garde in Shoreditch 
have been very successful. Avant-garde is located just  
a few minutes from Liverpool Street station and over 
120 off-plan sales have been secured with buyers in 
the Far East, an unprecedented performance for this 
type of development. There has been equally strong 
off-plan demand in the recovering London market 
such that in total over 170 of the 257 open market 
homes have been sold in just two months of initial 
marketing. Construction is underway and handovers  
will take place from late 2013 onwards.
The majority of overseas sales are secured with a 20 
per cent deposit either all paid at contract exchange  
or paid in stages not later than one year before 
completion. This provides the Group with equity to be 
used for further site acquisitions and the repayment of 
debt. The Group will continue to market appropriate 
developments overseas to secure revenue that will  
be recognised on legal completions in future years.
Partnerships and affordable housing
Telford Homes remains a grant partner of the  
Homes and Communities Agency (“HCA”) and has now 
completed the first four developments under its 2008 
to 2011 grant agreement. The Group has received £55.1 
million out of a total grant allocation of £72.9 million and 
the vast majority of the remainder will be received 
by March 2012 as affordable homes are completed in 
accordance with their construction programmes.
The Group has a secured revenue stream contracted for 
the affordable housing on all of its current developments 
and is now developing a greater proportion of open 
market housing such that it is not reliant on future, 
uncertain, grant funding. New opportunities are 
appraised on a conditional basis until the value and 
amount of affordable housing required is clear.
The Spending Review has had a significant impact on 
the new four year affordable housing grant programme 
for 2011 to 2015. Central funding for new projects is 
expected to be around 25 per cent of the total grant 
allocation for 2008 to 2011 and housing associations 
have been invited to close the funding gap by charging 
higher rents to new tenants under the new ‘affordable 
rent’ model. This will only partially substitute for the 
reduction in government funding and therefore less 
affordable housing will be built. 
There remains a housing shortage in London and 
Telford Homes will continue to work with both the HCA 
and the local authorities to address the need for new 
housing developments to be brought forward and to 
provide affordable housing whilst ensuring that each 
new development remains financially viable.
l and acquisition
The developments in the Group’s ownership during 
2008 and 2009 were in good locations and were flexible 
in terms of housing mix such that write downs were 
less than three per cent of total assets and profitable 
development could proceed with increased levels of 
affordable housing. However the impact of not investing 
in new sites during the recession, albeit a necessity at 
the time, is now being felt in terms of reduced output.
In February 2010 Telford Homes raised £7.2 million  
of equity through a placing of new shares to bolster  
the Group’s ability to purchase land. In addition to this 
the Board was delighted to sign a three and a half year 
£70 million banking facility with The Royal Bank of 
Scotland, HSBC and Santander on 31 March 2011.  
The process to secure this finance involved a year of 
extensive investigation of every aspect of the business 
and its financial position. It is great credit to Telford 
Homes that at the end of this process these three major 
banks are prepared to support the Group to this extent.

for future investment but even without this finance 
the Group has been acquiring land. The successful 
partnership with Eastend Homes to develop new homes 
across several estates in Tower Hamlets continues and 
during the last twelve months the Group has exercised 
options to purchase eight sites to provide 141 new open 
market homes. The Group’s partnership with Poplar 
HARCA also resumed in the year with contracts in place 
for the development of four sites.
The Group’s development pipeline is the total number 
of properties not yet legally completed that are to be 
constructed on land in its ownership or held under 
option contracts. A significant number of affordable 
homes, 400, have been completed during the year 
with revenue and profit having been recognised over 
the entire construction period. The total number of 
properties in the pipeline was 1,904 at 31 March 2011 
(2010: 2,370) with finance in place to significantly add to 
this over the next few years. On 27 May 2011 the Group 
exchanged contracts with Eastend Homes to develop 
209 new homes on the Holland Estate on Commercial 
Street, E1, increasing the number of properties in the 
development pipeline to over 2,100.
All of the Group’s developments have planning permission 
and the Group is careful to limit its exposure to planning 
risk, especially given uncertainty over future planning 
policy and the impact of ‘localism’. The New Homes Bonus 
introduced by the coalition government is valuable to local 
authorities and it is hoped that this will encourage a more 
pragmatic approach to planning policy where appropriate. 
Telford Homes is working with several landowners to 
secure planning for developments that are not yet 
under the Group’s control. 
Operations
Few developers possess the expertise and experience 
of Telford Homes in East London. The quality of the 
Group’s developments both in design and construction 
has been recognised by many awards in the last year 
including two special commendations from the London 
Evening Standard 2010 Homes and Property Awards 
and two National House-Building Council awards.
An independent survey of the Group’s customers 
throughout 2010 resulted in a 97% customer 
recommendation rate, a record high. The reasons 
include the quality of the finished apartments, the lack  
of defects and the high level of customer service 
provided. Once again the Board extends its gratitude 
to each of the Group’s employees, without whom the 
excellent standards maintained across every part of 
the business would not be possible.
Board changes
I am standing down as Chief Executive with effect  
from 30 June 2011 and I look forward to returning as 
Executive Chairman in 2012. At that time I will take on 
special responsibility for land acquisition alongside the 
normal responsibilities of the Chairman. I look forward 
to remaining with Telford Homes for many years to 
come working alongside Jon Di-Stefano as he steps into 
the role of Chief Executive. I would like to thank David 
Holland for his significant contribution to the business  
in his ten years as Non-Executive Chairman and I am 
pleased that he will also remain on the Board as the 
Senior Non-Executive Director. 
I am also delighted to announce the appointment of 
Katie Rogers as our new Financial Director with effect 
from the Annual General Meeting on 14 July 2011. Katie 
has been with Telford Homes for three and a half years 
and is currently the Group’s Financial Controller. She has 
been instrumental in securing the new banking facility 
and is well known to the Group’s bankers.

A high level of sales has been maintained throughout  
the last year due primarily to overseas pre-sales. Since 
1 April 2011 this trend has continued and, with the 
successful launch of Avant-garde, the Group has already 
sold 200 open market homes in the new financial  
year of which over 130 have been secured by  
exchanging contracts.
Profits are expected to remain at a similarly reduced 
level in the year to 31 March 2012 but the developments 
that switched to affordable housing or were impaired 
during the recession will be finished by the middle of 
2012 and significant growth both in output and margin 
is expected in future years. The number of pre-sales 
being achieved on developments that will be completed 
from 2012 onwards gives the Board confidence in this 
expectation and as such the dividend being paid this 
year has been increased by 25 per cent to 2.5 pence.
The Group has finance in place to add to the development 
pipeline and the market in East London remains robust 
and the subject of significant and ongoing undersupply. 
The 2012 Olympics in London are just over a year away 
and East London can only benefit from the anticipation 
and excitement that this major event brings to the area, 
let alone the substantial investment already made. The 
longer term prospects for Telford Homes remain strong.

review
Jonathan Di-Stefano MA (Econ), ACA
On 31 March 2011 the Group 
signed a £70 million corporate 
banking facility, which extends 
to 30 September 2014, with The 
Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC 
and Santander
A new £70 million banking facility secured on 
31 March 2011 has ensured that Telford Homes is  
able to continue existing developments and invest in 
new sites to enhance the longer term development 
pipeline. In addition the Group has recently agreed 
terms with HSBC to finance the joint venture that is 
responsible for Avant-garde and as such will have 
finance in place for every one of its developments. 
Operating results
Revenue fell to £121.1 million (2010: £159.3 million)  
with gross profit before exceptional items of £15.4 
million (2010: £21.0 million). Gross profit is stated after 
expensing loan interest that has been capitalised within 
inventories of £2.9 million (2010: £5.3 million) and before 
charging this interest the gross margin in the year was 
15.1 per cent compared to 16.5 per cent last year. 
The reductions in revenue and margin are primarily 
due to lower output of finished homes and a higher 
than normal proportion of affordable housing under 
construction, both of which were as anticipated.
Profit margins will remain lower than usual next year 
but the impact of those sites that were impaired by 
the effects of the recession will have been almost fully 
accounted for in twelve months time and as such the 
Group will be back to more normal margins for the  
year to 31 March 2013.
The operational teams continue to monitor and  
control development costs with a focus on achieving 
cost savings wherever possible, while maintaining 
good relationships with all suppliers. Some savings 
have been made in the light of reduced development 
activity in London although raw material costs can  
be volatile and occasionally the Group holds stock  
of materials such as steel to maximise the benefit 
when prices are lower.
Administrative expenses have remained under  
close control and have fallen to £9.3 million (2010: 
£9.7 million) mainly due to lower employee bonus 
payments. Selling expenses have increased by 42  
per cent to £2.7 million (2010: £1.9 million) in line with 
the increase in the number of contracts exchanged  
in the year. Overseas selling events are a significant 
investment regardless of the level of success but 
where a large number of sales are secured this is 
reducing the marketing expenditure needed in  
the future. Unfortunately the required accounting 
treatment for selling expenses does not enable the 
Group to match revenues with costs in relation to 
overseas events. The costs must be expensed as 
incurred even though profit recognition from any  
sales made is two to three years in the future.
Exceptional items
On 17 September 2010 the Group acquired the other 50 per 
cent of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, the joint venture 
set up to develop Greenwich Creekside, from The Royal 
Bank of Scotland. Their interest was acquired for the sum  
of £500 with all existing equity injected by the bank being 
converted to debt. As a result the Group recognised a 
‘bargain gain’ of £511,000 on the acquisition representing 
the value of 50 per cent of the net assets of Telford Homes 
(Creekside) Limited on 17 September 2010 less the £500 
purchase price. This gain is shown as an exceptional item  
in the income statement to 31 March 2011. The exceptional 
items reported in the year to 31 March 2010 of £0.8 
million were primarily write downs to the value of  
land and work in progress.

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   19 13/06/2011   10:49 Financial review continued
interest
The total borrowings of the Group reduced from £70.8 
million to £64.9 million at 31 March 2011 and interest paid 
in the year reduced from £3.5 million to £2.7 million. The 
security of funding provided by the new longer term 
banking facility attracts a higher rate of interest at 3.5 
per cent over LIBOR and this will increase the average 
rate of interest paid on borrowings in the new financial 
year. The benefits of the new facility far outweigh this 
increased cost and the rate is competitive in the current 
market compared to other developers.
For the first time the Board has agreed to take  
out some protection against future interest rates. 
Although the Board does not believe significant rate 
rises are likely in the near future the cost of interest 
rate protection is currently quite low for the same 
reason and as such it is worth investing a small 
amount to protect the business and ensure that 
interest cover covenants remain achievable. The Group 
has purchased a cap on LIBOR of three per cent on 
£30 million of debt which expires in September 2014. 
The cost of this cap was £290,000 paid up front and 
this will be expensed over the term of the product.
Interest charged to the income statement includes 
£2.9 million in cost of sales (2010: £5.3 million) and a 
further £1.1 million of finance costs (2010: £1.7 million) 
mainly as a result of suspending the capitalisation of 
interest on certain sites that were not progressing in 
terms of design or construction for parts of the year.
dividend
The Board has decided to propose a final dividend of  
1.25 pence which, together with the 1.25 pence interim 
dividend paid on 14 January 2011, makes a total dividend 
for the year of 2.5 pence (2010: 2.0 pence). This increase  
is in line with the Board’s stated intention of paying a 
year-on-year progressive dividend in line with the business 
building the foundations for future profit growth.
The final dividend is expected to be paid on  
22 July 2011 to those shareholders on the register  
at the close of business on 24 June 2011.
Balance sheet
Net assets at 31 March 2011 were £64.7 million, increased 
from £63.1 million last year. Net assets per share were 
132.1 pence and the share price on 31 March 2011 
represented just 58 per cent of that value per share 
(31 March 2010: 71 per cent). The Group has remained 
profitable, increased its volume of sales due to pre-selling 
developments that will complete in future years and 
secured finance for the next three and a half years  
and hence the Board believes the current share price  
to be significantly undervalued.
Cash balances remain high at 31 March 2011  
at £18.8 million although down from £33.6 million  
last year. This balance includes operational balances  
of £12.7 million and grant monies held for future 
expenditure of £6.1 million. The cash balance was 
inflated on the final day of the year by the first 
drawdown under the new banking facility which 
generated funds over and above the repayment  
of previous facilities of £7.1 million.
Cash balances were expected to reduce over the  
year both through ongoing expenditure of grant 
monies held and also through investment of the 
placing funds received in March 2010. The cash flow 
statement shows that the Group has made a net 
investment in working capital this year as opposed to 
the significant reduction in work in progress last year.
On 30 September 2010 the Group announced that it 
had repaid all of the outstanding loan notes in relation 
to the acquisition of Clifford Contracting which took 
place in June 2009. This acquisition provided a form  
of finance against unsold properties and would have 
been available until 30 September 2011. The rate of 
sales being secured resulted in the Board concluding 
that the funding was no longer required. The early 
redemption of the loan notes saved £300,000 of 
interest and the Group repurchased and cancelled  
the 1,130,089 shares that formed part of the 
transaction for a total sum of £1.
Cash management and cash flow 
forecasting
Control of cash remains important and a detailed 
month-by-month cash flow forecast is maintained as 
part of the Group’s management information systems. 
This enables continuous monitoring of the forecast and 
actual cash flows over a five year period. The forecasts 
are necessarily subject to a number of assumptions and 
judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis 
by sensitivity analysis. These forecasts are reviewed by 
the Board in detail on a monthly basis.

Net debt at 31 March 2011 was £46.1 million (2010: 
£37.2 million) with gearing at 71.2 per cent (2010: 58.9 
per cent). The Board has determined that long term 
growth can be achieved at lower levels of gearing than 
those required in previous years and as such expects 
this to remain below 150 per cent consistent with debt 
being provided at 60 per cent of cost.
On 31 March 2011 the Group signed a £70 million 
corporate banking facility, which extends to 
30 September 2014, with a club of three banks 
being The Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and 
Santander. The debt is secured against a portfolio  
of land and development sites with only Greenwich 
Creekside, owned by a subsidiary, and Avant-garde, 
in a joint venture with The William Pears Group, 
remaining outside of the facility.
Interest will be charged on the new facility at 3.5 per 
cent over LIBOR with an arrangement fee of 1.25 per 
cent payable in two tranches. Funds will be advanced 
at 60 per cent of cost and site specific funding under 
the overall facility umbrella will be repaid from the first 
65 per cent of the open market residential proceeds 
on each site. The first ten per cent of any deposits 
received can be retained by the Group without any 
loan repayment.
There are a number of site specific loan to value 
covenants along with corporate covenants concerning 
net asset value, gearing and interest cover. The Board 
performed a detailed assessment of these covenants, 
including sensitivity analysis, to ensure that they were 
appropriate when compared to current forecasts 
before signing the new facility.
As part of the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent 
of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited the Group secured 
finance from The Royal Bank of Scotland to complete  
its Greenwich Creekside development. The facility 
totals £57.7 million including the equity replacement 
mezzanine debt and is repayable in phases on 
31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012. To date 
£18.3 million of the first phase debt has been repaid.
The William Pears Group (“William Pears”) has recently 
become the new joint venture partner to Telford Homes 
in Bishopsgate Apartments LLP which is developing 
Avant-garde. William Pears purchased a 50 per cent 
interest from Genesis Housing Group at cost. HSBC has a 
long relationship with William Pears and has just started 
a relationship with Telford Homes; as a result the joint 
venture has been able to secure credit approval for a 
land and development facility of £45.9 million. This facility 
will repay the existing Allied Irish Bank loan of £15 million 
and enable the development to proceed. The formal 
paperwork is expected to be signed later in June 2011 
and, with significant pre-sales secured, development  
of the open market tower is already underway.
These facilities combined ensure that the Group has 
sufficient bank finance available for the foreseeable 
future in an environment where this is not the case for 
all of our competitors. The initial drawdown under the 
£70 million facility was £31.9 million leaving headroom 
of £38.1 million and this will be utilised over the next 
three years to invest in new sites and support the 
future growth of Telford Homes.

The Group now has over 2,100 properties in the 
development pipeline and these properties need to be 
managed through the planning process, in design and 
ultimately during construction. In order to control this 
process Telford Homes is organised into two operating 
divisions being Alto and Metro. 
This structure is necessary in order to manage the 
delivery of several hundred homes per annum and 
ensures management control to yield excellent design, 
high standards of construction and delivery on programme. 
Each division predominantly specialises in certain sizes 
of development and styles of construction.
Mark Parker and John Fitzgerald jointly take on the 
roles and responsibilities of Group Managing Director. 
Mark Parker is responsible for Metro and John Fitzgerald is 
responsible for Alto and each division has a management 
team responsible for day-to-day operations.
Sales and Marketing, Land Acquisition, Partnerships, 
Customer Service, Finance and Buying are regarded as 
core central services that deliver economies of scale in  
a relatively small geographic region by remaining 
outside of the divisional structure.

knowledge
Telford Homes operates in an industry sector where 
up-to-date qualifications, standards and knowledge 
are vital to the safe and successful operation of the 
business. The Group has a supply-chain of partners 
that provide all the necessary design and building 
services to complete each development. The Group 
has established an ‘apprentice trainee’ strategy that  
is propagated through its supply-chain by delivering 
apprenticeships that provide a quality of training 
sufficient to give each apprentice the opportunity for 
long term employment. Over the last five years the 
Group, along with its partners, has assisted over 30 
local apprentices to gain a valuable qualification  
within the construction industry. 
The Group also operates a comprehensive Management 
Trainee programme under which trainees from school 
or college are employed annually. Trainees are taken 
on in each of the operational departments and are 
often based on site. They are enrolled on college 
courses, funded by Telford Homes, for a minimum  
of four years with encouragement to progress to 
complete a construction or surveying degree. A 
combination of college based training and on the  
job training alongside experienced staff allows the 
apprentices and trainees to develop technical as  
well as personal skills. 
With a constant flow of new apprentices and trainees 
developing their skills and being promoted, Telford 
Homes has developed a highly skilled workforce that  
is benefiting from updated industry knowledge 
combined with practical on the job training.
The Group puts training at the heart of its  
operations ensuring its employees maintain their 
industry knowledge. Training is seen as a necessity  
and it is important to continually assess training needs 
whilst anticipating changes in the external environment 
that will dictate new skills and knowledge that our 
employees may need. The focus on high quality 
industry specific training allows the Group to have  
a fresh approach and the Board views training, 
particularly through apprenticeships, as an essential 
investment in the future of the Group and the future  
of the construction industry.

The Group received a gold 
award for health and safety 
at the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents 
awards 2011
The health, safety and wellbeing of every person 
involved in, or affected by, our business is fundamental 
to our operations. We promote a positive safety culture 
and communicate this to all employees and everyone 
working on our sites ensuring that health and safety 
procedures are understood by recipients, identify all 
the relevant risks and dangers that are likely to be 
encountered in the course of their work and set out  
the appropriate precautionary measures. 
We invest in the training and development of our people 
with the continuation of our ‘Health and Safety Core’ 
training programme. This programme ensures that all 
employees and in particular those deemed as ‘safety 
critical’ have the appropriate skills and level of training. We 
demand that our suppliers employ competent people and 
encourage continual professional development of those 
holding safety critical posts. To support this process we 
have established and held subsidised onsite training 
specifically for their employees. 
Our accident frequency rate for the year to 
31 March 2011 was in line with the industry average.  
The majority of our accidents over the last few years 
have arisen as a result of the behavioural failings of 
those injured. In an attempt to improve this situation  
we have instigated a programme of simple solutions  
to make people consciously aware of themselves 
and their interaction with their workplace. 
Our health and safety management system,  
accredited to BS OHSAS 18001:2007, continues  
to be audited every six months by the British Standard 
Institution (BSI) in accordance with their stringent auditing 
processes. In addition the Company received a gold award 
for health and safety and a silver award for the management 
of occupational road risk at the ‘Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents’ (RoSPA) awards 2011. The RoSPA 
awards and the BSI certification recognise the maturity of 
our occupational health and safety management system 
and the culture of the Company.

Our ‘Executive Safety Committee’ and ‘Operational 
Safety Forum’ continue to meet regularly and to be 
instrumental in developing significant changes to 
the way health and safety is managed. 
Our ‘supply-chain’ procedure remains in place with all of our 
suppliers vetted by the health and safety department. In a 
climate where businesses are cautious and resources are 
under pressure several of our suppliers have struggled and 
some have ceased trading. As part of our vetting procedure 
the commercial viability of each supplier is scrutinised in an
attempt to ensure they are able to meet their obligations. 
Our operational teams expect the highest health and safety 
standards from each supplier and this is considered during 
the tender process for new work. We continually monitor 
our suppliers and take the necessary steps to ensure they 
meet our high expectations.
John Fitzgerald and Mark Parker remain responsible 
for health and safety in each of the operating divisions 
and John Fitzgerald is the board member with overall 
responsibility for health and safety.
Given market conditions and the cautious approach 
being observed by the industry, our overall health and 
safety performance has been excellent and stands us 
in good stead for the future.

Telford Homes is committed to designing and 
constructing developments that both minimise 
ecological impact and improve energy efficiency. The 
Group has an environmental policy and we ensure that 
this is communicated throughout our operations. Our 
environmental policy and environmental management 
system is regularly reviewed to ensure the prevention  
of pollution and compliance with relevant legislation.  
We have commenced the accreditation process  
with the British Standards Institute to certify our 
environmental management system to BS EN ISO 
14001:2004.
The materials used in our developments  
contribute to our environmental performance.  
We re-use, recycle and adopt renewable materials 
wherever viable and continually look for new ways  
to meet and exceed environmental expectations in all  
of our activities. For example, the use of aggregates 
and crushed concrete in filling excavations and 
procuring core materials such as timber from 
responsible organisations that have established 
processes to validate its environmental credentials.
We have adopted the Building Research Establishment 
SMARTER
©
 Waste programme which not only  
records waste but also energy & timber usage. 
The majority of our sites benefit from low energy 
lighting, methods of reducing internal water usage 
including flow restrictors and dual flushes, recycling 
facilities, cycle storage and local transport links. In 
addition we use both established and cutting edge 
technologies to improve the energy efficiency of our 
developments once they are occupied. 
Some of the technologies we currently operate 
include: 
Biomass
Boilers fuelled by recycled timber pellets or alternative 
fuels such as rapeseed oil and bio-diesel are used 
to complement gas fired boilers in order to feed an 
energy efficient communal heating system in some 
of our larger developments. 
Biomass plant is currently being used or will be  
used at Greenwich Creekside, OneStratford, SoBow, 
Avant-garde, Matchmakers Wharf, Bow Trinity,  
Vellum and Lanrick Road.
Combined heat and power plant (CHP)
A fuel source, typically gas, is burnt to provide heat to 
drive a turbine or Stirling engine in order to generate 
electricity to power lighting and appliances or for 
export to the national grid. The same heat passes 
through a heat exchanger to generate domestic 
heating and hot water for a communal system. 
Currently associated only with communal systems, 
this technology is the subject of rapid development 
and small plant for individual houses and apartments 
will soon be commercially available.
A CHP is being incorporated at Avant-garde and is 
being considered for future developments.

national grid.
PV panels are installed or will be installed at Stadthaus, 
Bow Trinity, St Anne’s, St George’s Estate, Trades Hall 
in Leyton and High Cedars in Wanstead.
Solar thermal
Solar thermal panel heaters use radiant energy  
from the sun to heat water. There are two types of 
collectors for solar heating - flat plate and evacuated 
tube. The collectors are connected to the plumbing 
system of individual apartments and complement a 
high efficiency boiler to deliver domestic hot water  
and heating.
This technology is in use at Stadia in Leyton  
and Icona in Stratford.
Air source heat pumps
Air from within the dwelling or from outside is put 
through a process of evaporation, compression, 
condensation and expansion via a small electric pump. 
This releases heat from the air that is used to raise 
the temperature of water for domestic use and for 
underfloor heating.
Air source heat pumps are used or will be used  
at Decorum in Leyton, St Anne’s, Avant-garde  
and the St George’s Estate.
Wind power
Wind turbines are the most visible of all renewable 
technologies. They are installed on the outside of  
a building and turn generators in order to produce 
electrical energy for use in the building or for export  
to the national grid.
A wind turbine has been installed at Kinetica and

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   29 13/06/2011   10:49 key risks and uncertainties
Economic environment
Demand for properties from both investors and  
owner occupiers is dependent on confidence in both 
the local housing market and the wider economy.  
This confidence is heavily influenced by factors such  
as interest rates, the availability of mortgage finance, 
rental incomes, unemployment and increasing 
consumer costs for other goods and services.  
All of these are outside of the Group’s control.
The Group’s policy has been to sell early in the 
development process, wherever possible, to 
minimise the risk in each site. This policy has been 
very successful to date and pre-sales are still being 
secured with both housing associations and overseas 
buyers. in addition the Sales and Marketing team 
have detailed knowledge of the local market and 
are able to formulate the best sales strategy for 
each development and to work with purchasers and 
prospective purchasers to ensure that all stages of 
the process from reservation to legal completion run 
as smoothly as possible.
l and acquisition
The Group needs new land to maintain a development 
pipeline and to enable the business to continue to 
operate at a certain capacity. This land needs to be 
sourced in appropriate locations and where optimum 
planning consents can be obtained. The appraisal 
process that determines the price paid for land is 
critical in maintaining margins and return on equity  
at acceptable levels. 
The l and Acquisition and Partnerships team  
are responsible for sourcing land and our strong 
relationships with various land owners including 
local authorities and affordable housing providers 
play a key role in our ability to acquire new sites.  
in particular our existing partnerships with housing 
transfer organisations are expected to continue  
to be a significant source of land in the next 
few years. The appraisal process for new sites 
includes due diligence by an experienced solicitor 
and authorisation of all prospective purchases at 
appropriate levels.
Planning process
The flow of properties through the development 
pipeline is dependent on achieving suitable planning 
permission on sites purchased without planning or 
subject to planning. The process is time consuming 
and involves an increasing number of supporting 
reports and detailed consultations with many 
different bodies. Delays in achieving suitable planning 
permissions affect the number of properties that 
can be brought to market and impact on the timing 
of future cash flows. Failure to achieve a suitable 
planning permission may lead to cost write offs or 
reduced margins on individual developments.
Telford Homes has extensive knowledge of local 
planning requirements, excellent relationships 
with planning authorities and takes care in the 
appointment of professional architects, planning 
consultants and engineers. Early consultations 
with the planning authorities are a key part of the 
land acquisition process. While this cannot remove 
planning risks it mitigates them as much as 
possible. All of the sites currently owned by  
the Group have the benefit of a full planning 
permission. The Board ensures that the Group 
is not overexposed to planning risks by limiting  
the total investment in sites without a planning 
permission at any one time.
Cash requirements and bank finance
Property development is a capital intensive business 
with significant initial outlays supported by bank 
finance and lengthy time periods before the majority 
of the cash inflows on each project. Forecasting 
of cash flows is critical to ensure the Group is not 
operating beyond its financial capacity. Part of this 
process involves the forecast of bank funding for 
each development and the availability of sufficient 
bank finance is therefore also of critical importance.
Telford Homes maintains a detailed cash flow 
forecast as part of its management information 
systems. This extends five years into the future 
and is subject to continual re-assessment and 
sensitivity analysis. The cash flow position is 
reviewed by the Board and by each of the Group’s 
banking partners on a monthly basis. Telford 
Homes has excellent relationships with the banks 
funding the business and has sufficient facilities 
available to ensure the continuing operation of 
the business.

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   30 13/06/2011   10:49 Construction
The construction process is critical to the efficient 
and timely delivery of properties to purchasers which 
affects both cash flow and customer satisfaction.  
The quality of the construction work and finish 
in each property affects the reputation of the 
Group and can impact on repeat purchase and 
recommendation rates. 
Standards of construction and control of the 
building process on site are of paramount 
importance to each operating division. Careful 
planning is required to assess a development 
programme before construction commences 
and this is monitored over the course of the 
building work. The construction teams work very 
closely with the Customer Service team and their 
interaction commences at an early stage in the 
development. The Customer Service team spend  
a substantial proportion of their time on site 
carrying out quality control before a purchaser 
sees the property for the first time.
Availability of materials and labour
The availability of materials and sub-contracted 
labour for each site can affect both the construction 
programme and the cost of construction. Build cost 
inflation will impact directly on the margin achieved  
on each site where this is in excess of forecasts.
Planning of the construction programme and  
timely management of the tender process for each 
sub-contracted trade reduces the risk of delays in 
the construction programme due to availability of 
materials and labour. The tender process ensures 
that competitive rates are achieved on every trade. 
Telford Homes works in partnership with all of its 
sub-contractors and makes timely payments to 
encourage an equal relationship that is beneficial  
to all parties.
 
Health and Safety
Construction sites are dangerous places and there 
are many different health and safety risks to consider. 
The health and safety of everyone associated with 
Telford Homes, both employees and sub-contractors, 
is the first priority of the Group.
investment in training, the promotion of health 
and safety to all employees and extensive policies 
and procedures all contribute to a comprehensive 
approach to health and safety management with 
the objective of minimising risk and providing  
a safe working environment. 
Political environment
Changes in laws and regulations can have a direct 
impact on the efficient running of the Group and  
the costs incurred on each development. Changes  
in both local and national government can have a  
direct bearing on the regulatory environment.
Telford Homes works closely with specialist

Corporate Governance
Policy on corporate governance
Application of principles
Although not formally required to do so, the directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the 
Combined Code (2003) (the Code) and its 2008 revised version applicable to fully listed companies, in formulating 
and applying the Group’s corporate governance policies. These policies are monitored to ensure that they are 
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given 
the size of the Group. 
Directors
The Company and Group are managed by a board of directors and they have the necessary skills and experience 
to effectively operate and control the business. There are nine directors in total of whom two are non-executive 
directors. David Holland and Robert Clarke, the non-executive directors, are considered independent and they 
comprise both the audit and remuneration committees. The Board meets once a month and the directors make 
every effort to attend all board meetings.
The Board is responsible for taking all major strategic decisions and also addressing any significant operational 
matters. In addition the Board reviews the risk profile of the Group and ensures that an adequate system of 
internal control is in place. Management information systems are in place to enable the directors to make 
informed decisions to properly discharge their duties.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. The Chairman is responsible for running the 
Board and he meets regularly and separately with the Chief Executive and the other non-executive director to 
discuss matters for the Board.
As the business has developed, the composition of the Board has been under constant review to ensure that it 
remains appropriate to the managerial requirements of the Group. One third of the directors retire annually in 
rotation in accordance with the Company’s articles of association. This enables the shareholders to decide on 
the election of the Company’s Board.
The Board takes decisions regarding the appointment of new directors as a whole and this is only done  
following a thorough assessment of a potential candidate’s skills and suitability for the role. New directors are 
given a full induction to the Group where required so as to ensure they can properly fulfil their role and meet 
their responsibilities.
All directors are offered appropriate coaching and training to develop their knowledge and ensure they remain 
up to date in relevant matters for which they have responsibility as a member of the Board.
The Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive’s review included in this annual report give the Board’s current 
assessment of the Group’s prospects. The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements as set 
out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. The responsibilities of the auditors are set out in their report.
r emuneration committee
Details concerning the composition and meetings of the remuneration committee are contained in the directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 36 to 37.
Audit committee
During the period the audit committee, which is chaired by Robert Clarke an independent non-executive director, 
has met twice with the external auditors being in attendance on both occasions. The non-executive directors 
meet separately with the auditors up to twice a year.
The committee has a responsibility for reviewing the financial statements provided to shareholders. In addition the 
committee reviews the business and financial risks and internal controls as described below.
The duties of the committee also include ensuring that the auditors provide a cost effective service to the Group 
and remain objective and independent and to consider from time to time the need for an internal audit function.
TEF2681 - AR11 Middle AW02.indd   34 13/06/2011   10:53 www.telfordhomes.plc.uk 35
Corporate Governance
r elations with shareholders
The Company has institutional shareholders and is, where practicable, willing to enter into a dialogue with them. 
The Chief Executive and the Financial Director meet regularly with institutional investors within the confines of 
relevant legislation and guidance.
The Board invites communication from its private investors and encourages participation by them at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). All Board members present at the AGM are available to answer questions 
from shareholders. Notice of the AGM in excess of 21 clear days is given and the business of the meeting is 
conducted with separate resolutions, voted on initially by a show of hands and with the result of the voting 
being clearly indicated.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system is designed to mitigate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s 
significant risks and that it has been in place for the period ended 31 March 2011 and up to the date of approval 
of the annual report and accounts, and that it is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The internal control procedures are delegated to executive directors and senior management in the Group 
operating within a clearly defined departmental structure. The Board regularly reviews the internal control 
procedures in the light of the ongoing assessment of the Group’s significant risks.
On a monthly basis management accounts, including a comprehensive cash flow forecast, are reviewed by 
the Board in order to provide effective monitoring of financial performance. At the same time the Board 
considers other significant strategic, organisational and compliance issues to ensure that the Group’s assets are 
safeguarded and financial information and accounting records can be relied upon. The Board formally monitors 
monthly progress on each development.

Directors’ remuneration report
The directors present the remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Composition of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises the independent non-executive directors, David Holland and Robert 
Clarke. The committee makes recommendations to the Board on executive directors’ service agreements and 
remuneration. In doing so it has undertaken relevant research to ensure that remuneration levels are competitive 
with the industry average. The committee met four times during the year.
r emuneration policy
It is the Group’s policy to provide remuneration packages sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of 
the quality required. To add further incentive the directors have adopted two bonus schemes, one applicable 
to all staff and a scheme for executive directors and senior management. Both schemes are dependent on the 
Group meeting certain financial performance targets. The maximum amount that can be earned under the 
executive bonus scheme is 100% of basic salary.
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in which all employees are entitled to participate. The SIP exists in 
order to increase employee ownership of shares and further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements.
During 2006 the Company set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) for the benefit of selected 
senior employees. Further details are given in note 17 to the financial statements. The remuneration committee 
is responsible for approving any offers of shares made under the DPSPP. 
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors after considering external 
market research. They do not participate in the bonus schemes or in the personal pension scheme. They are 
entitled to participate in the SIP. 
Service contracts
The executive directors have service contracts that can be terminated on twelve months notice. These provide 
for termination payments equivalent to twelve months basic salary and contractual benefits.
The non-executive directors have letters of appointment that can be terminated on three months notice.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
 y select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 y make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 y state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 y prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the  
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Statement of accounting policies
31 March 2011
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union 
and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Although these estimates are based on the 
directors best knowledge of the amounts, events or 
actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those 
estimates. The most significant estimates made by 
the directors in these financial statements are set out 
in 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty'.
The accounting policies set out below have been 
applied consistently for all periods presented in these 
financial statements. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the 
financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries 
and the Group's share of jointly controlled entities 
up to 31 March 2011. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the financial statements from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Exemptions
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption 
available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 
2006 and have not presented an income statement for 
the Company alone.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the 
Group holds an interest with one or more other parties 
where a contractual arrangement has established 
joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities 
are accounted for using proportional consolidation.
Segmental reporting
The Group has only one business segment being 
housebuilding and one geographical segment being 
the United Kingdom. Financial analysis is presented on 
this basis to the chief operating decision makers for 
the Group these being the board of directors. 
Revenue and profit recognition
Properties for open market sale
Revenue and profit is recognised at the point of legal 
completion of each property.
Commission received on property sales made on 
behalf of third parties is recorded within revenue, with 
all costs associated with the sale of those properties 
recognised within selling expenses.
Construction contracts
Contracts are treated as construction contracts 
when they have been specifically negotiated for 
the construction of a development or a number of 
properties. These contracts are primarily for the 
construction of affordable homes. Revenue is only 
recognised on a construction contract where the 
outcome can be estimated reliably. Revenue and 
costs are recognised by reference to the stage of 
completion of contract activity at the balance sheet 
date. This is normally measured by an assessment of 
work performed to date.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot 
be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised 
to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is 
probable will be recoverable. When it is probable that 
total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, 
the expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately.
Grant income
Grants received from the Homes and Communities 
Agency are recognised as revenue in the income 
statement to match with the related costs that they 
are intended to compensate.
Selling expenses
Selling expenses are charged to the income statement 
as incurred.

Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
recorded at the proceeds received.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
development of properties that take a substantial 
period of time to get ready for sale, are capitalised 
within inventories. Capitalisation of borrowing costs 
commences from the date of initial expenditure on a 
given development and continues until the properties 
are ready for sale. 
The capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended 
where land assets are being held for strategic 
purposes or where there are prolonged periods 
when development activity on a site is interrupted. 
Capitalisation is not normally suspended during a 
period when substantial technical and administrative 
work is being carried out.
All other borrowing costs are charged to the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which 
are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or 
incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's 
financial performance.
Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the 
terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase 
contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at 
their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, each determined at 
the inception of the lease and depreciated over the 
shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease 
term. The corresponding liability is included in the 
balance sheet as a finance lease or hire purchase 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligations 
so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are 
charged to the income statement.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the life of 
the lease.
Pension costs
Contributions paid to group personal pension schemes 
(defined contribution), in respect of employees, are 
charged to the income statement as incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on 
a straight line basis at rates calculated to write down 
the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset 
over its expected useful life as follows:
Leasehold improvements – shorter of term of lease  
 and 10 years
Plant and machinery – 2 to 5 years
Motor vehicles – 3 years
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings and jointly 
controlled entities are valued at cost less impairment. 
Inventories
Development properties are included in inventories 
and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises costs of acquisition and 
development, including directly attributable fees and 
expenses, direct labour costs and borrowing costs. 
Included within development properties are freehold 
interests held in completed developments. These are 
held for future sale. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised 
on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables and other receivables
Trade receivables on normal terms do not carry 
any interest and are stated at their nominal value 
reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
unrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash 
balances in hand and in the bank (including short-term 
cash deposits) which mature within three months or 
less from the date of acquisition.
Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
recorded at the proceeds received.

Statement of accounting policies
31 March 2011
Financial instruments continued
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest 
bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
l and creditors
When land is purchased on extended payment terms, 
the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land 
creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based 
on this fair value assessment. Fair value is determined 
by using the effective interest method. The difference 
between the nominal value and the initial fair value is 
amortised over the period of the extended credit term 
and charged to finance costs, increasing the value of 
the land creditor so that at the date of maturity, the 
land creditor equals the payment required.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are 
classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting  
all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the 
Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net  
of direct issue costs.
Current assets and liabilities
Assets that are expected to be realised in, or are 
intended for sale or consumption in, the Group's 
normal operating cycle are treated as current even 
to the extent these are expected to be realised after 
twelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities 
that are expected to be settled in the Group's normal 
operating cycle are treated as current even though 
these may be due for settlement after twelve months 
from the balance sheet date.
Contingent liabilities
Disclosures are made for each class of contingent 
liabilities at the balance sheet date detailing, where 
practicable, an estimate of its financial effect and an 
indication of uncertainties associated with the timing 
or amount of the outflow, unless the possibility of a 
financial outflow is remote.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax 
currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the profits for the 
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are tax deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary 
differences that have originated but not reversed at 
the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the 
future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable 
and therefore recognised only when, on the basis  
of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the  
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income 
statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Share-based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity 
settled share options granted is recognised as an 
employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value is measured as at the date the 
options are granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton 
pricing model and is charged equally over the vesting 
period. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted each reporting period to reflect the actual 
number of options that are expected to vest.
With respect to share-based payments, a deferred 
tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base. The 
tax base is then compared to the cumulative share-
based payment expense recognised in the income 
statement. Deferred tax arising on the excess of the 
tax base over the cumulative share-based payment 
expense recognised in the income statement has 
been recognised directly in equity.
Own shares
Shares held by employee benefit trusts in order  
to satisfy awards under the Group's share plans  
are included net within equity until such time as 
the shares are vested to the relevant employees.
Critical accounting judgements and 
key sources of estimation uncertainty
Construction contract revenue and  
profit recognition
Contract revenue is recognised from the date 
of exchange of construction contracts at a rate 
equivalent to the value of work undertaken in respect 
of land development. Contract profit on construction

contracts is recognised in proportion to revenue only 
to the extent that the total eventual profit on the 
contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Assessing the percentage complete on each contract 
involves estimation of total expected costs to be 
incurred until the end of the contract. Recognition of 
profit also involves estimation of the total expected 
revenues from each contract and therefore the expected 
profit margin that will be achieved. Judgement is 
required to assess whether the total eventual profit on 
each contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty.
Carrying value of land and work in progress
Inventories include land and work in progress in 
respect of development sites. On each development 
judgement is required to assess whether the cost of 
land and any associated work in progress is in excess 
of its net realisable value.
Recent accounting developments
During the year IAS 27 (revised), IFRS 3 (revised) 
and amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 32 have become 
effective and have been adopted by the Group. In 
addition IFRIC 17 and IFRIC 18 have become effective 
for the Group. Adoption of the new and revised 
standards and interpretations has not had any 
significant impact on the amounts reported in these 
financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 2, IAS 17 and IAS 39 were made 
as part of Annual improvements to IFRSs 2009. Their 
adoption has not had any significant impact on the 
amounts reported in these financial statements but 
may impact the accounting for future transactions 
and arrangements.
At the date of the authorisation of these financial 
statements, there are a number of standards, 
amendments and interpretations that have been 
published but are not yet effective.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that 
are expected to impact upon the Group are:
 y Annual improvements 2010 is a collection of 
amendments to a number of standards as part 
of the IASB programme of making non-urgent but 
necessary amendments to IFRSs. The Group is 
currently assessing the applicability of these annual 
improvements although at present it does not 
believe that they will have a material effect on the

During the year, as a result of the change in the United Kingdom corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% that was 
substantively enacted and will be effective from 1 April 2011, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-
measured. Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 March 2012 has been measured using the effective 
rate that will apply in the United Kingdom for the period (26%).
Further reductions to the United Kingdom corporation tax rate have been announced and are expected to be 
included in future finance bills to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. The changes had 
not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial 
statements. The impact of the proposed changes are not expected to be material to the Group.

6 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding those held in the Share 
Incentive Plan. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is 
adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.    
Earnings per share have been calculated using the following figures:

All inventories are considered to be current in nature. The operating cycle is such that a proportion of inventories 
will not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will 
be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
Included within development properties for the Group are freehold interests held for future sale of £5,916,000 
(2010: £5,012,000). Included within development properties for the Company are freehold interests held for 
future sale of £5,688,000 (2010: £5,012,000).

The value of inventories expensed in cost of sales in 2011 was £104,243,000 (2010: £136,906,000). Costs 
capitalised during the year include interest of £1,554,000 (2010: £1,671,000), which is capitalised based on the

17 Employee Share Schemes
Telford homes Plc Employee Share Option Scheme
The Group operates both an approved share option scheme and an unapproved share option scheme. Awards 
under each scheme are made periodically to new employees. All schemes are equity-settled and options can 
normally be exercised three years after the grant date.
A charge is made to the income statement to reflect the calculated fair value of employee share options over and 
above the exercise price paid by employees. This charge is calculated at the date of grant of the options and is 
charged equally over the vesting period. The corresponding adjustment to equity is made directly to the profit 
and loss reserve. In accordance with IFRS 2 (Share-based payments), only costs relating to options issued after 
7 November 2002 have been charged to the income statement.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the fair value of outstanding options. 
Individual calculations have been performed for groups of share options with differing exercise prices and dates. 
The assumptions applied to the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for share options issued and the fair value per 
option are set out below. There were no share options granted in the year ending 31 March 2011.
2011 2010
Expected life of options based on options exercised to date – 4 years
Volatility of share price based on three year share price history – 105%
Dividend yield – 2%
Risk free interest rate – 1%
Weighted average share price at date of grant – 64p
Weighted average exercise price – 64p
Weighted average fair value per option – £0.41
Expected volatility was determined by considering the volatility levels historically for the Group. Volatility in more 
recent years is considered to have more relevance than earlier years for the period reviewed.
The charge calculated for the year ended 31 March 2011 is £264,000 (2010: £283,000).

Telford homes Plc Share Incentive Plan
During the year ended 31 March 2004 Telford Homes Plc set up a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for the benefit of 
all of the employees of the Group. This SIP has been approved by the Inland Revenue and confers certain tax 
advantages for participating employees.
The SIP provides for employees to purchase shares up to a value of £1,500 in each tax year. These shares are 
known as ‘Partnership shares’. Partnership shares are matched on a one for one basis by ‘Matching shares’ 
provided by the Group subject to the shares remaining in the SIP for a period not less than three years. Dividends 
are paid on both Partnership and Matching shares and these are allocated to employees as ‘Dividend shares’.
The Group has set up a trust to administer the SIP and to hold shares on behalf of individual employees. This trust 
is an entirely separate entity to the Group and is managed by a corporate trustee, Telford Homes Trustees Limited. 
The costs associated with the trust are paid for by the Group and the Group finances all share purchases.
The trust has distributed shares as Partnership shares and Dividend shares to employees participating in the 
scheme. These shares remain in the trust until such time as an employee withdraws from the SIP. Further shares 
have been allocated to employees as Matching shares and the cost of these shares is being written off over the 
three year holding period. The charge in the year ended 31 March 2011 is £138,000 (2010: £126,000).
During the year ended 31 March 2011 the trust acquired 355,089 shares at 77p in March 2011. At 31 March 2011 the 
trust remains interested in 52,176 shares (2010: 110,450) which have not been allocated to employees and a further 
967,861 (2010: 867,533) that have been allocated to employees as Matching shares but have not yet vested. Shares 
in which the trust remains interested do not rank for dividends and all shares that have not yet vested do not count 
in the calculation of the weighted average numbers of shares used to calculate earnings per share. 
Shares held by the SIP are recognised as a deduction from shareholders’ funds. The value of these shares at 
31 March 2011 was £680,758 (2010: £737,223). Movements in the profit and loss reserve relating to the SIP are 
shown in the statement of changes in equity.

Telford homes Plc 2006 Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan
During the year ended 31 March 2007 Telford Homes Plc set up a Deferred Payment Share Purchase Plan (DPSPP) 
for the benefit of selected senior employees. An employee benefit trust (the Telford Homes Plc 2006 Employee 
Benefit Trust) was set up with Abacus Corporate Trustee Limited acting as trustee.
Participants in the DPSPP are offered a loan by the trustee to enable them to subscribe for a specified number of 
shares in the Group at market value. This loan is interest free repayable on or before the repayment date which 
is normally 20 years from the date of the loan or on disposing of the shares. The loan has a limited recourse 
such that repayment is limited to the value of the shares on the repayment date. The Group will lend the trustee 
sufficient funds to enable the trustee to provide the loans to individual participants. All shares acquired under 
the DPSPP will be subject to a three year vesting period and are held by the trustee for the benefit of the 
participants. Offers to participants will be made periodically at the discretion of the directors of Telford Homes 
Plc.
In September 2006 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 550,000 shares at the market 
value of 260p. These shares were issued on 9 November 2006. On this date the Group provided a loan to the 
trustee of £1,430,000 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable 
at the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and November 2026 and has been recognised as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds in the statement of changes in equity.
In December 2007 selected employees were offered, and subscribed for, a total of 160,000 shares at the market 
value of 244p. These shares were issued on 14 December 2007. On this date the Group provided a loan to the 
trustee of £390,400 to enable the trustee to provide a loan to each of the participants. This loan is repayable at 
the earlier of the sale of the vested shares and December 2027 and has been recognised as a deduction from 
shareholders’ funds in the statement of changes in equity.

The Group does not enter into any derivative transactions and has no direct exposure to exchange rate 
movements as its trade takes place entirely within the United Kingdom.
Trade and other receivables, trade payables and hire purchase liabilities
The fair value of trade and other receivables, trade payables and hire purchase liabilities at 31 March 2011 is 
equal to the carrying value stated in the balance sheet at that date. There are no amounts included within trade 
and other receivables currently overdue (2010: £23,000). Hire purchase liabilities include £19,000 (2010: £nil) due 
after more than one year. All other trade and other receivables and trade payables are due within one year.
l and creditors
Land purchases made on deferred payment terms are recorded at fair value using the effective interest method 
in accordance with IAS 39 (Financial instruments - recognition and measurement). The difference between the 
fair value and nominal value is amortised over the deferment period as financing costs, increasing the land 
creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date. The interest rate used in the year to 31 March 2011 
was 3% (2010: 3%). 
Borrowings
The Group uses loan finance, all of which is denominated in sterling, to acquire development land and undertake 
site construction. On 31 March 2011 the Group signed a £70 million loan facility which extends to 30 September 
2014 with a club of three banks being The Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Santander. The debt drawn under 
this facility is secured against a portfolio of land and development sites owned by the Group. At 31 March 2011 
the Group had utilised £31.9 million of this facility leaving an unutilised balance of £38.1 million. Interest is being 
charged on this facility at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.5%.

The Group’s subsidiary, Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, has loan facilities with The Royal Bank of Scotland 
totalling £57.7 million in respect of the purchase of development land and construction in Greenwich. At 
31 March 2011 Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited had utilised £34.0 million of this facility leaving an unutilised 
balance of £23.7 million. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.25% on the majority of the facility. 
Included within the £57.7 million is a mezzanine loan facility of £8.0 million and interest on this loan is charged at 
LIBOR plus a margin of 5%.
In addition the Group’s jointly controlled entity, Bishopsgate Apartments LLP, has a loan facility with Allied Irish 
Bank of £15.0 million in respect of the purchase of development land in Bethnal Green Road. At 31 March 2011 
Bishopsgate Apartments LLP had utilised all £15.0 million of this facility. The Group has recorded its 50% share of 
the loan in its balance sheet at 31 March 2011. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5%. This facility is due 
for repayment on 14 December 2011.
Market risk     
The Group is exposed to the financial risk of changes in interest rates both in terms of changes in the base rate 
and LIBOR and in terms of individual banks attitude to market risk and their application of either base rate or 
LIBOR to new facilities and the margin applied to each new facility.
In order to assess the risk interest costs are forecast on a monthly basis over a five year period using estimates 
of likely changes in rates and actual costs are compared to this forecast. Volatility of interest costs remained at 
an acceptable level in the year ended 31 March 2011 as LIBOR remains at a historically low level. Interest on all 
facilities currently held is charged at floating interest rates and the Group assesses the requirement for fixing 
interest rates on a regular basis. 
The effect on the income statement of a 1% rise and a 1% fall in interest rates has been calculated to assess interest 
rate sensitivity. Based on average monthly borrowings in the year, a 1% rise in interest rates would have a negative 
effect of £504,000 before tax (2010: £845,000), a 1% fall in interest rates gives the same but opposite effect.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining 
an appropriate capital structure to reduce the costs of capital. The Group considers its capital to be all of the 
components of net assets.
The Group ensures that there are appropriate controls over the purchase of land and levels of work in progress in 
the business in order to appropriately manage its capital. In addition, the other methods by which the Group can 
manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to 
shareholders, issuing new share capital and arranging debt.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Trade and other receivables includes amounts recoverable on contracts which are due from housing associations 
and balances due from other Group undertakings. The Group considers the credit quality of the various debtors 
to be good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low. 
Surplus cash is held in secure bank deposit accounts with Allied Irish Bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, 
HSBC, Barclays Bank and Investec Bank plc.

l iquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they 
fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows over a five year 
period and performing sensitivity analysis on these forecasts. The forecasts are necessarily subject to a number 
of assumptions and judgements and these are tested on a reasonable basis by the sensitivity analysis. These 
forecasts and the related sensitivity analysis are reviewed by the directors in detail on a monthly basis. In addition 
all of the forecasts and supporting calculations are made available to each bank funding the Group on a monthly 
basis. The current forecasts show positive cash balances beyond the next twelve months even where this is 
subjected to sensitivity testing. 
The Group utilises bank facilities to ensure that adequate funding is available to cover working capital 
requirements and the directors consider that existing facilities are sufficient to cover funding requirements in the 
foreseeable future both where these have already been utilised and where they are currently unutilised. Where 
facilities are due to expire within one year this is due to the timing of the relevant developments and therefore 
the expected repayment dates. In all of these cases the directors are satisfied that the loans are expected to be 
repaid by the date the facility expires.
The Group’s bank facilities are subject to a number of general and financial covenants which are tested 
periodically by each bank. In all cases the directors have assessed whether the Group will remain in compliance 
with the covenants for at least twelve months after signing the financial statements and are satisfied that there 
will be no breach of the covenants. 
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows based on the earliest date on which the Group can be 
required to pay financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis (including future interest payments using the latest 
applicable rates) is as follows:

21 Business combination
On 17 September 2010, the Group acquired 50% of the issued share capital of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited, 
a property development company currently developing land in Greenwich, London. Following the acquisition, the 
Group owns 100% of the ordinary shares of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited and has sole control of the company. 
The book value and fair value of the assets and liabilities of Telford Homes (Creekside) Limited at the date of 
acquisition are set out below:
Book and
 fair value
£000
50%

Trade and other payables (28,102) (14,051)
Borrowings (32,006) (16,003)
Net assets 1,022 511
The total consideration paid for 50% of the ordinary shares in issue was £500 in cash. As a result, the Group 
recognised a ‘bargain gain’ of £510,500 representing 50% of the fair value of the net assets of Telford Homes 
(Creekside) Limited on 17 September 2010 less the £500 purchase price. This gain is included in exceptional items 
in the results to 31 March 2011. The assets and liabilities acquired all relate to the company’s site in Greenwich and 
will be realised as the development is completed over the next two years.
There was no difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets and liabilities of Telford Homes 
(Creekside) Limited at the date of acquisition and therefore no gain or loss arose on the existing shareholding.
This acquisition contributed additional revenue of £9.7 million and profit before tax of £0.9 million to the Group  
for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. Had the acquisition occurred on  
1 April 2010, the consolidated income statement would have included additional revenue of £11.1 million and 
profit before tax of £0.8 million. 
Acquisition related costs amounting to £2,000 are included in administrative costs in the Group income statement.
22 Repurchase and cancellation of shares
On 30 September 2010 the Company repaid all outstanding loan notes in relation to the acquisition of Clifford 
Contracting Limited which took place on 23 June 2009. This final repayment amounted to £4.3 million.
As a result of the loan notes being repaid the Company immediately exercised its option to repurchase  
1,130,089 ordinary shares from the vendors of Clifford Contracting Limited for a total sum of £1. These 
repurchased shares were cancelled on 30 September 2010.

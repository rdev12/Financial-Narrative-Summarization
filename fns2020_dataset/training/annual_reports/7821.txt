deemed that this development work is
unlikely to generate future cash flows.
We remain convinced of the future
of Icon and in December 2003 we
completed a 5% placing of shares
with institutional investors to complete
the development of the Icon technology
ahead of schedule. This technology
will help to deliver the sales growth
planned in Imagelinx and will be a key
differentiator over our competitors.
The Board has changed substantially
over the year. In January 2003, Michael
Williamson joined the Board as Finance
Director replacing Nick Hunter. In March
2003, Gregor Wedell joined the Board as
a Non-executive Director. In December
2003 and January 2004 Dr Thomas
Fischer and Byron Ousey resigned as
Non-executive Directors. In January 2004
Udo Bange resigned as Chief Executive
of the Imagelinx division. On behalf of
the Board I would like to thank all the
Directors, who have left the Group or
have changed their responsibilities, for
their tremendous efforts and welcome
to the Board the new Directors.
In September 2003 the Company moved
from a full listing on the London Stock
Exchange to a listing on the Alternative
Investment Market (“AIM”). The Board
see this listing as being more appropriate
for a Group of this size and believe
it will reduce costs for the Group. 
It remains for me to express my
personal gratitude to my colleagues
and to the shareholders for their help
and support in 2003. The continued
support of all involved is vital for the
Group’s success for 2004 and beyond.

David Straker-Smith Chairman
2003 has been a year of progress for
LTG Technologies PLC with the Group
making key advances in consolidating
its competitive position, despite a
background of global uncertainty.
Imagelinx has continued to grow sales
and has reduced its cost base, following
expansion during the previous two
years. LTG Mailänder has returned
to profitability, helped by the
restructuring of the previous years,
while further operational improvements
continue to be made.
Group losses in 2003 were lower at the
pre-tax level at £10.6m against £18.6m
in 2002. Importantly, the operating
losses before operating exceptional items
and goodwill were reduced to £2.9m
versus £8.4m in 2002. The improvement
is due to the sales growth in both
divisions and substantial cost reductions
in the Imagelinx division, whilst retaining
the infrastructure to support growth
and unlock the potential value. 
Group sales were £58.8m in 2003
versus £57.9m for 2002. In March 2003,
we completed the disposal of our
Crabtree business to its management
for £2.2m, to focus on the Imagelinx
and LTG Mailänder businesses.
Adjusted for the sales of Crabtree, sales
of continuing operations were £57.3m
compared with £48.2m; an impressive
growth rate of 19%. In part, this was
due to the effect of changes in exchange
rates, with Imagelinx’s Sterling sales
being negatively affected by the weak
Dollar and the reverse being the case
for LTG Mailänder due to the strong
Euro. Adjusted for exchange rate
changes, sales growth was still very
creditable at 10%.
LTG Mailänder performed well in
2003 with a return to clear profitability,
experiencing continued strong demand
for its conventional equipment and
completing large orders for the new
technology. Sales grew 19% to £49m
(9% at constant exchange rates). This
division is now focussing on further
efficiency improvements and product
launches to generate greater profitability.
Imagelinx continued to capture
prestigious new clients – many are
household names – and reduced its
cost base for the first time in three years.
The years of high expansion costs are
now over – costs and sales are being
aligned. Sales were at £8.1m, a rise
of 10%. However, approximately 50%
of Imagelinx’s sales are in US Dollars.
Excluding the effect of the Dollar
weakness, underlying growth was
a strong 16%. This growth was despite
reduced volumes from its existing
customers, mainly due to the general
caution consumer goods companies
were displaying in incurring
marketing expenses. 
Icon, Imagelinx’s integrated IT system,
is a key part of the future for its services.
We believe we have created exciting
IT systems for Imagelinx and intend to
make them operational during this year.
As part of Imagelinx’s cost reduction
efforts and to bring it to profit more
quickly, we have chosen more cost
effective methods of completing the Icon
system. As we have also taken a cautious
view of IT investments, we have written
down the book value of these systems
by £5.6m. This is in accordance with
2003 has been a year of progress with the
Group making key advances in consolidating
its competitive position. Chief Executive’s review LTG Technologies PLC

Albert Klein Chief Executive
Despite these difficulties our Group
companies have done relatively well. 
The LTG Mailänder division has
delivered underlying sales growth
of 9% and returned to profitability with
an operating margin of 4%. Costs have
been controlled: Gross margins are
up to 28.6% versus 25.2% in 2002,
overheads have been contained
at £11.0m versus £10.3m during the
prior year (at constant exchange rates),
resulting in operating profits of £1.8m
(at constant exchange rates) (versus
£Nil in 2002). This was due to a strong
performance in our conventional
equipment business where demand
converted into orders and sales orders
for Sprint technology obtained in 2002
were completed.
Imagelinx has achieved sales growth
of 16% at constant exchange rates
despite some existing clients spending
less, due in large to the economic
downturn. This demonstrates Imagelinx’s
ability to gain new clients and expand
its business. We are proud to have
started working with Procter & Gamble
Haircare, Uniq, Sara Lee, DuPont,
Lactalis, Boots Retail and Arla. 
Imagelinx is now involved in the
marketing of a range of products
spanning from baby milk to Paul Bocuse
ready-to-eat meals and from Nice‘n’Easy
hair colorants to Mach3 shaving blades.
There is plenty of scope to sell our
services for products in the spectrum
between these. 
We have reduced costs at Imagelinx
to be more in line with sales. We
Chief Executive’s
review
no longer have to incur the high
expansion costs of the last two years
and we have curtailed projects which
did not offer the prospects of profits
within a reasonable time frame.
We may return to them in time.
By reviewing our sales network and
by working with suppliers who offer
better value for money to Icon, overall
operating costs have been reduced by
25% at constant exchange rates. As
a result Imagelinx has seen its operating
losses before operating exceptional
items and goodwill substantially reduced
to £3.1m (at constant exchange rates)
from £6.3m in 2002. We have also
written off £5.6m of prior year’s
expenditure for Icon to reflect our
cautious view of these IT investments
and terminations of contracts
with suppliers. 
Significant achievements, operational
changes and corporate developments
At the operating level, several key
developments have taken place
in our Group during 2003. 
In LTG Mailänder major Sprint
equipment contracts have been
completed and delivered to customers
in Europe, the Far East and Central
America, such as the Dae Sung
in Korea, Kian Joo in Malaysia, and
Grupo Zapata in Mexico. Typically
these systems cost between €3m
and €5m. Some of these installations
are now the most productive
metal printing operations in the
world with astounding operating
performance. These installations
are showcases for the efficiency
of Sprint printing technology and
will allow us to further push the sale
of this technology. 
LTG Mailänder has launched a new
coating system under the Sprint brand
name. This reduces set-up times by up
to 50% and offers significantly higher
speeds and reduced coating material
usage. The system can be used both

Overview
In 2003, the business environment
has been anything but easy. In Asia,
a key market for LTG Mailänder’s Sprint
high technology printing machines,
we experienced the effects of the SARS
crisis through to September 2003.
This disrupted business activity and
confidence in the Far East quite severely,
restricting the flow of new orders for
Sprint machines. Overall the strong
Euro made customers outside the EU
think twice before signing on the
dotted line. 
In the US, Imagelinx’s clients, due to
the uncertain economic environment,
reduced expenditure wherever possible.
Sales of Imagelinx to existing clients
were down significantly. On top of this,
half of Imagelinx’s sales were affected
by the declining US Dollar.

of what we have to deal with as a result
of unstable currencies:  LTG Technologies PLC

with UV and with conventional drying
technology, so supporting Sprint and
conventional sales. We believe this
product will make a substantial
contribution to sales in the near future. 
LTG Mailänder has also largely
completed the introduction of
an integrated manufacturing planning
and inventory management system
allowing major efficiency gains in the
future. The system has already led
to much more accurate cost control
and improved timely and cost effective
manufacturing. Further improvements
are expected to flow from this system.
Imagelinx has introduced a Print
Certification Database (“PSD”) – an
advanced print quality data management
system. The system allows the capture
and administration of information on
printing presses around the world on-line
and replaces Imagelinx’s current system
for that purpose. It is the first of a series
of modules to be launched under the
name Icon. It is the basis of Imagelinx’s
capability to deliver top quality digital
packaging graphics information
globally, for large organisations. 
Major global brand managers have
expressed strong interest in the Icon
technology. As a result, £1.5m of capital
was raised in January 2004 in order
to complete the technology ahead
of schedule and make it available
to clients earlier.
This focus of Imagelinx upon the major
consumer product groups in the USA
and Europe, servicing clients out of key
operations in the USA and UK, has
allowed the closure of sales operations
in Germany, Japan and Italy.
We have also reviewed all major areas
of activity and expenditure in the
holding Company, LTG Technologies
PLC. An example of this review resulted
in the move of the listing to AIM. 
Funding and cash flow of the Group
On 26 February 2003 the Company
discounted a receivable due on
24 August 2003 from International
Thermo Systems LLC with a nominal
value of $3.141m (£1.995m at that
date) for the sum of $2.909m (£1.811m)
of which $1.884m (£1.197m) was used
to repay bank debt. This receivable
related to deferred consideration from
the sale of the Industrial Ovens division
in 2000.
On 18 March 2003 the Company
disposed of its interest in the business
activities of LTG Gateshead Limited
(formerly Crabtree of Gateshead
Limited) for a cash consideration
of £2.2m (£2.051m after expenses).
The Group experienced a net cash
outflow in 2003 of £4.2m resulting
in a net indebtedness position at the
31 December 2003 of £6.1m (2002:
£1.7m). This net outflow of £4.2m
represents total outflows from operations
of £8.1m, before the receipt of funds
from the disposal of Crabtree and early
receipt on the ITS loan note totalling
£3.9m. The early discount of the
ITS loan note was also used to reduce
the facility with LBBW from €10m
to €8.25m.

The cash outflow from operating
activities (operating loss before
tax adding back depreciation,
goodwill amortisation and the write
down of capitalised assets) in 2003
was £1.4m. Capital expenditure,
principally Icon development was
£2.2m, interest, tax and financing
was £0.5m and the adverse
movement in working capital was
£4.0m. The large adverse movement
in working capital, arose due to
the high level of cash held at the end
of 2002, resulting from large down
payments received on contracts
awarded in December 2002. 
In December 2003 we announced the
placing of 11.5m shares, providing the
Group with £1.5m of capital for the
completion of the Icon technology. These
proceeds were received in January 2004. 
Looking ahead
For the current year we are optimistic.
LTG Mailänder can contain costs
by focussing on efficiency improvements
rather than on headcount reductions
as in the past. When exchange rates
stabilise Asian demand for Sprint
technology should transpire into orders.
In the meantime, our conventional
business underpins sales. 
Imagelinx should see further sales
growth on the basis of its business with
existing and new clients. Its cost base
has been reduced. The Icon project
is approaching completion and will soon
offer large clients significant benefits
not available from other suppliers
in our markets.
There are four key strategic objectives,
which the Group will continue to focus
upon, all of which confirm our
competitive advantage.
● Deliver the Icon technology
– the recent placing of shares
providing £1.5m of capital will
enable the early completion of
this technology. This integrated
system will offer clients significant
advantages, allowing them to
monitor and influence the progress
of their projects. A new product
launch can then be monitored
and amended on line as it is being
finalised, without the need to
maintain costly in house brand
management functions. Future
investments in this system will be
made in line with the requirements
of our clients and their willingness
to fund tailored developments.
● Grow the Imagelinx client base
– new client acquisition remains
strong. It is our intention to continue
to provide high levels of client service
and to provide clients with the
leading edge technology that they
are demanding. The Icon technology
will provide this. 
● Continue to provide Imagelinx
clients with high levels of service
– increasing sales and adding value
to our existing clients. In 2003 we
experienced variations in demand
for our services over the year, with
high and low levels of activity. It is
very important we maintain high
levels of customer support and be able
to respond to our client’s demands.
The development and completion of Icon
will provide us with a platform to expand
our business.

Chief Executive’s review
Hence it is necessary to carry capacity
during low periods of activity. We
have scaled back infrastructure, but
retained capacity to meet customer
demand. There are signs that this
bold customer focus will pay off
as activity begins to rise again. 
● Maintain leading market position in
Sprint and conventional equipment
– LTG Mailänder is the market
leader in the supply of metal sheet
decorating equipment. It delivers
high specification equipment
worldwide, resulting from high
quality manufacturing capability.
This provides LTG Mailänder with
a strong competitive advantage
in this market place. 
The sales prospects for both divisions
are strong. The development and
completion of Icon will provide us with
a platform to expand our business in
the changing world of print technology.
Imagelinx is continually increasing its
client base and attracting new customers,
with its service offering and unique
technology platform. We anticipate
that this will lead to the accelerated
acquisition of new clients and eventually
expansion of existing business with
Imagelinx. An increase in sales for
Imagelinx together with effective
management of the cost base will 
lead to a continued improvement of
Imagelinx’s operating result.
For LTG Mailänder we are seeing
returns on our investment in the new
Sprint technology, despite the difficult
external market. Interest in SprintSystem
equipment is strong with a very high
number of enquiries being handled. We
are in a good position to maintain and
in time increase our market leadership.
Management and staff
In response to the move to AIM and
the relative size of the Group, the main
Board of LTG Technologies PLC has
been restructured. We will adhere
to best practice in terms of corporate
governance. The Board now has four
full time Executive Directors and four
Non-executive Directors. 
This year enormous efforts and
commitment have been required from
employees across the Group, in order
to make the LTG Mailänder division
profitable, and to consolidate a platform
for growth in the Imagelinx division.
We therefore thank everyone in the
Group for their efforts in the year.

Financial review
Financial review
Michael Williamson Finance Director
Results from continuing operations
The Group delivered improved results
over 2002 at the operating level, but
incurred operating exceptional items
in terms of restructuring and the write
down of costs capitalised from prior
years. LTG Mailänder made a profit
of £1.9m in 2003 against £Nil in 2002,
with growth of 9% at constant exchange
rates in sales in a very competitive and
difficult market environment. Imagelinx
did not deliver its sales potential, but
substantially reduced its operating
losses from £6.3m to £3m. This was
principally due to cost reductions which
gave rise to significant one off charges
for restructuring of £0.5m. Operating
exceptional items also included a write
down of £5.6m for capitalised costs. 
Trading results
Table 1 opposite highlights the effect
of movements in exchange rates on the
performance of the Group. The LTG
Mailänder division is based in Germany
and invoices customers globally in
Euros. It takes out forward currency
contracts for major customers, where
the invoicing currency is not in Euros.
In 2003 the increase in the value of the
Euro resulted in a favourable impact
upon LTG Mailänder sales by £4.3m
and profits by £0.1m. In Imagelinx
in 2003 the weakness in the value of
the US Dollar resulted in an adverse
impact upon Imagelinx sales by £0.5m
and profit and loss £0.1m.
Imagelinx operational performance
Imagelinx delivered underlying growth
of 16%. It was adversely affected by
the weakness of the Dollar over 2003,
with sales growth on translation of
10%. New client sales (customers less
than one year old) were £1.2m. This
growth was offset by a decline in sales
from existing customers. Gross margins
increased to 47% from 42% in 2002
through higher volumes and reductions
in direct labour costs. Operating costs
were reduced by 27% (at constant
exchange rates this reduction was 25%).
These reductions were necessary due
to reduced demand from existing
customers and a lack of revenue in
operations in Japan, Italy and Germany.
Loss making and inefficient operations
were closed or scaled back. Headcount
was reduced to 112 (2002: 162).
LTG Mailänder (continuing operations)
operational performance
LTG Mailänder has reported growth
of 19%. At constant exchange rates this
growth is 9%. This has been achieved
in an uncertain and competitive market
place. Gross margin as a percentage
of sales has improved to 28.6% from
25.2%, due to greater manufacturing
utilisation. The other operating expenses
removing the effect of exchange have
increased by 6%. 
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds have decreased
as a result of the loss for the year
and a further increase in the pension
provision required under FRS 17. This
decrease can be summarised as shown
in the table on page 10.
FRS 17 was adopted in the 2002
reported accounts in respect of the
Crabtree of Gateshead pension fund
and the unfunded defined benefit
scheme in LTG Mailänder GmbH.
Following this standard brings any
deficit or surplus arising in the fund
onto the Group’s balance sheet.
The net assets of the Group would
be £3.1m, prior to the accrual for
the pension provision as shown
in the table on page 10.
Pensions
The Group adopted FRS 17 early
in 2002, being the most appropriate
method to treat this aspect of the
Group’s responsibilities. The financial
position of the Group is sensitive to
the position of the Crabtree defined
benefit scheme, which had £10.1m
of assets at 31 December 2003. The
present value of the scheme’s liabilities
has been calculated at £16.4m at
31 December 2003. The resulting
deficit in the pension scheme is £6.3m.
This deficit, plus the £1.1m liability
on the LTG Mailänder GmbH scheme
represents the total £7.4m pension
fund deficit.
The size of the calculated deficit in the
Crabtree defined benefit scheme is
highly sensitive to changes in financial
conditions in the equity and bond
markets, inflation rates and assumed
mortality rates. In the valuation at
31 December 2003 a 0.5% increase
in the inflation assumption and rate
of increase in pensions payment
increased the present value of scheme
liabilities by £0.7m over the value at
31 December 2002. An increase in
the mortality rate assumption increased
the present value of scheme liabilities
at 31 December 2003 by £0.4m over
the value at 31 December 2002.
The Crabtree scheme has 99 existing
pensioners and 280 deferred pensioners
according to the latest information
from the Trustees. Payments to
pensioners in 2003 were £342,000.
There were no changes in the assumptions
on the LTG Mailänder GmbH scheme,
and as such, the only movement during
the year arose on exchange, due to the
retranslation of the Euro liability.
The Group delivered improved results
over 2002 at the operating level. Financial review LTG Technologies PLC

The Mailänder scheme has 24 existing
pensioners and 52 deferred pensioners
according to the latest information
from the Trustees. Payments to
pensioners in 2003 were £12,000.
Impairment review of Imagelinx assets
In accordance with FRS 11 the Board
has undertaken reviews at the half
year and full year for impairment
of the carrying value of the investment
and goodwill associated with Imagelinx.
As a result of the most recent review,
no impairment has been taken on the
goodwill, but the carrying value of the
investment in the Company balance
sheet has been written down by £12.5m.
The goodwill held in the Group balance
sheet for Imagelinx is £6.9m and the
carrying value of the investment in the
Company balance sheet is £12.6m.
Fixed asset capitalisation
In accordance with FRS 15 and FRS 11
the Board has undertaken a review
to determine whether acquired or
self-constructed, the tangible fixed
assets relating to IT development
should continue to be capitalised.
As a result of the review £5.6m (2002:
£1.5m) of capitalised costs have been
written down. IT development costs,
which continue to be capitalised
at 31 December 2003 are £1.0m.
Derivatives and other
financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial
instruments throughout the year
comprised bank loans, bank overdrafts,
finance leases and hire purchase
contracts. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to raise finance
for the Group’s operations. The Group
has various other financial instruments
such as trade debtors and trade
creditors that arise directly from
its operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative
transactions (principally forward
currency contracts). The purpose

is to manage the interest rate and
currency risks arising from the Group’s
operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period
under review, the Group’s policy that
no speculation or trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken (save
for the ITS loan note described on the
following page).
The main risks arising from the Group’s
financial instruments are interest rate
risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency
risk. The Board reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these
risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained broadly
unchanged since the beginning of
2000. The magnitude of this risk that
has arisen over the period is detailed
in note 20.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows funds in desired
currencies at fixed and floating rates
of interest. Policy in respect of interest-
bearing liabilities arising is to achieve
the most efficient outcome for the
Group, regardless of the nature of
credit taken. At 31 December 2003,
cash balances and overdrafts were
generally held in the operating
currencies of the companies holding
these balances.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy is to have adequate
access to bank facilities in the Group’s
main trading currencies. Current
facilities all mature within one year,
while cash deposits when arising are
held in short-term accounts. At the
year-end the Group had been successful
in applying this policy, with facilities
and short-term cash held in the
desired forms.
Foreign currency risk
As a result of the significant investment
in operations in Germany and the USA,
the Group’s balance sheet can be
significantly affected by movements in
the US Dollar/Sterling, and Euro/Sterling
rates. The Group minimises its exposure
to investments in foreign currencies
where possible by aligning the currencies
of liabilities and assets.
The Group also has transactional
currency exposures. Such exposures
arise from sales or purchases by
an operating unit in currencies other
than the unit’s functional currency. 
The Group requires all its operating
units to use forward currency contracts
to eliminate the currency exposures
on foreign currency receivables when
the size of the receivable is sufficient
to warrant this. At the year-end, the
Group has hedged 89% of the foreign
currency receivables. 
Where an exchange risk arises, the
Group requires all its operating units
to use forward currency contracts
to eliminate the currency exposures
on foreign currency payables when
the size of the payable is sufficient
to warrant this. At the year-end none
of these payables had been hedged.
LTG Mailänder has reported growth of
19%. At constant exchange rates this
growth is 9%. Financial review LTG Technologies PLC

Taxation
An analysis of the taxation charge
is set out in note 8 to the accounts.
The taxation charge as a percentage
of loss before taxation was 0.3% in
the current year compared to a credit
of 0.4% in the previous year. 
Liquidity
On 19 December 2003 the Company
announced the successful placing
of 11.5 million shares, providing
the Group with £1.475m of funds for
the completion of the Icon technology.
The proceeds were received in January
2004. The number of shares in issue
following the placing of new shares
is 242,338,635.
On 26 February 2003 the Company
discounted a receivable due on
24 August 2003 from International
Thermo Systems LLC (“ITS loan note”)
with a nominal value of $3.141m
(£1.995m at that date) for the sum
of $2.909m (£1.811m) of which
$1.884m (£1.197m) was used to repay
bank debt. The Company received the
following payments €1,751m and
$850,880. The Euro receipt of €1,751m
was used to reduce the facility with
LBBW from €10m to €8.25m. The
$850,880 (£542,962) was retained
in the Company. 
On 18 March 2003 the Company
disposed of its interest in the business
activities of LTG Gateshead Limited
(formerly Crabtree of Gateshead
Limited) for a cash consideration
of £2.2m (£2.051m after expenses).
The Group experienced a net cash
outflow in 2003 of £4.2m resulting
in a net indebtedness position at
31 December 2003 of £6.1m (2002:
£1.7m) This net outflow of £4.2m
represented total outflows from
operations of £8.1m, before the receipt
of funds from the disposal of Crabtree
and early receipt on the ITS loan note
totalling £3.9m. The cash outflow prior
to capital expenditure, working capital
movement and financing (losses before
tax adding back depreciation, goodwill
amortisation and the write down of
capitalised assets) in 2003 was £1.4m.
Capital expenditure, principally Icon
development was £2.2m, interest, tax
and financing was £0.5m and the
adverse movement in working capital
was £4.0m. The adverse movement in
working capital reflected a high level
of cash held at the end of 2002 of
£6.2m, resulting from large down
payments received on contracts
awarded in December 2002. 
The Group has committed facilities
available of €8.25m, which are
renewable on 31 December 2004.
Going concern
At 31 December 2003, the Group had
net current liabilities of £9,538,000,
net liabilities of £4,311,000 and had
incurred a loss for the year ended
31 December 2003 of £10,680,000.
The Directors continually monitor the
financial position of the Group, taking
into account the latest forecasts of
future cash flows and analyses of these
forecasts, sensitised in respect of the key
uncertainties facing the Group’s ability
to generate cash. The Directors consider
that a key uncertainty is the timing
of actual versus targeted sales in the
Imagelinx division while it is building
up the client base for its pioneering
services. Another key uncertainty which
the Board is monitoring closely is the
strength of the underlying recovery of
the LTG Mailänder division, particularly
given the current geopolitical risk
and its possible effect on the business
environment. The Board has identified
savings which can be realised in the
short-term in both divisions, if necessary,
while minimising the effect on the
Group’s global operating capability. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors
have a reasonable expectation that
the Group has adequate resources
to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing
the accounts.

Directors’ report LTG Technologies PLC
Report and Accounts 2003
15 Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the Directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
accounts; and
● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position
of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Corporate governance
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate
governance. This statement describes how the principles of corporate governance are applied to the Company and the degree of the Company’s
compliance with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code prepared by the Committee on Corporate Governance.
Following publication of the Higgs Review – The Role and Effectiveness of Non-executive Directors and the Smith Report – Combined Code
Guidance for Audit Committees in January 2003, the Financial Reporting Council issued the new Combined Code on 23 July 2003, which
comes into effect for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003. The principles and provisions of the new Code have been
considered by the Board. The Board will continue to review its practices in the light of the new Code. 
The Company moved from a full listing on the Stock Exchange to a listing on AIM on 26 September 2003, and as such the Company is not
covered by the Listing Rules. Nevertheless, in the interests of providing maximum transparency to shareholders, the Board complies with
those provisions of the Combined Code it deems relevant, ensuring that embedded risk controls are in place.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees will be available to answer questions at this year’s AGM to be held
on 19 April 2004.
The Board 
The Board currently comprises the independent Non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive, three other Executive Directors and three
other independent Non-executive Directors. Short biographies of each of the Directors, which illustrate their range of experience, are set
out on pages 12 and 13. There is a clear division of responsibility at the head of the Company, the Chairman being responsible for running
the Board and the Chief Executive for implementing Group strategy. John Holmes has been nominated as the Senior Independent Director.
The Board structure ensures that no individual or group dominates the decision-making process. The Board is responsible to shareholders
for the proper management of the Group. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out above and
a statement on going concern is given on page 11.
The Board considers that, although Gregor Wedell is deemed not to be independent under the definition of independence in the new Code,
as there are no relationships or circumstances that might affect his judgement; he is independent not withstanding the fact that he represents
LTG Holding GmbH, a significant shareholder and has close family ties with the Company’s Directors.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The need for Director training is regularly assessed by the Company.
The Chairman ensures that the Directors take independent professional advice as required.
The Board meets formally every month, reviewing trading performance, ensuring adequate funding, setting and monitoring strategy, examining
major acquisition possibilities and reporting to shareholders. The Non-executive Directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the
strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are fully considered. The Board receives appropriate and timely information, Board papers
being sent out several days prior to the meeting. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. These include the approval of financial statements,
acquisitions and disposals, material agreements, non-recurring projects, major capital expenditures, and strategic plans. It delegates
responsibility to the Board Committees detailed below.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by David Straker-Smith and its other member is John Holmes. It is responsible for proposing
candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard to the balance and structure of the Board. In appropriate cases, recruitment
consultants will be used to assist the process. All Directors are subject to re-election at least every three years.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect
of the accounts Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by David Straker-Smith and its other members are John Holmes and Alistair Rae. It is responsible
for making recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of Executive remuneration and
its cost. The Remuneration Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for each of the Executive Directors,
including performance related bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation payments. The Board itself determines the remuneration
of the Non-executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee will be advised as necessary by a firm of remuneration consultants.
Further details of the Company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Remuneration
Report on pages 18 to 20. The report has been prepared by the Board following the provisions in Schedule B to the Combined Code.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by David Straker-Smith and its other member is John Holmes. It meets not less than two times annually.
The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors. Meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the
Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the half year and annual accounts on or before their
submission to the Board and monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to the shareholders.
The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration both for audit and non-audit
work, and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with external auditors. The Audit Committee keeps under review the cost
effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of communications with shareholders. The Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review provide
a detailed review of the business and future developments. There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders including presentations
after the Group’s preliminary announcement of the year-end results and at the half year.
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. Details of resolutions
to be proposed at the AGM on 19 April 2004 can be found in the Notice of the Meeting on page 47.
Risk and internal controls
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal control. Internal control systems are designed
to meet the particular needs of the Group and the risks to which it is exposed, and by their nature can provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key procedures which the Directors have established with a view to providing effective
internal controls are as follows:
● Management structure – The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved
for decision by the Board. Each Executive Director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs;
● Quality and integrity of personnel – The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and
subsequent training courses. High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of internal control;
● Identification of business risks – The Board is responsible for identifying the major business risks faced by the Group and for determining
the appropriate course of action to manage those risks;
● Budgetary processes – The Board is responsible for Group strategy, approving budgets and plans, approving acquisitions or disposals and
determining treasury and dividend policy. Each year the Board approves the annual budget and strategic plan. Key risk areas are identified;
● Monitoring and reporting performance – Monthly results, including variances from plans and prior year, together with updated forecasts
for current performance for up to 24 months are reported to the Board. These reports cover sales, profits and losses, cash flows, capital
expenditure and balance sheets. Key risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action taken throughout the year
through the monthly reporting process to the Board;
● Investment appraisal – Capital expenditure is regulated by a budgetary process and authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond specified
levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board. Reviews are carried out after the capital expenditure or acquisition
is complete, and for some projects, during the project or acquisition period, to monitor expenditure; major overruns are investigated.
Proposals for research and development programmes beyond specified limits are considered by the Board. Due diligence work is carried
out if a business is to be acquired; and
● Audit Committee – The Audit Committee monitors the controls which are in force and any perceived gaps in the control environment.
It considers and determines relevant action in respect of any control issues raised by the external auditors. It reviews the effectiveness
of the system of internal financial control as it operates during the year and reports conclusions to the Board.
Retirement and appointment of Directors
Gregor Wedell, appointed Director on 17 March 2003, retires from the Board at the AGM and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
Dr Franz Wimpffen and John Holmes retire by rotation and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
Corporate governance LTG Technologies PLC
Report and Accounts 2003

Corporate governance The Remuneration Committee is chaired by David Straker-Smith and its other members are John Holmes and Alistair Rae. It makes
recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on an overall remuneration package for Executive Directors and other senior
Executives in order to attract, retain and motivate high quality Executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. The package consists
of basic salary, benefits, share options, performance related bonuses and pensions, with a significant proportion based on performance and
dependent upon the achievement of targets. Consideration is given to pay and employment policies elsewhere in the Group, especially when
determining annual salary increases. In addition, the Remuneration Committee will be advised when necessary by a firm of Executive remuneration
consultants to maximise comparability within the marketplace and pays particular attention to the remuneration levels of the Company’s
closest competitors. 
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are discussed below. 
Salary and benefits: The salary and benefits of Executive Directors are reviewed annually. The Remuneration Committee takes into account
prevailing market rates for similar positions in comparable companies, responsibilities, individual and corporate performance, and the
experience which each Director brings to the Group. Following the review, Executive Directors received basic pay increases of approximately
14%. Benefits principally comprise private healthcare, life assurance and pension contributions.
Annual performance bonuses: Each Executive Director has the opportunity to receive an annual bonus, if Group business and individual
targets are met. The Group business plan targets for 2003 were not achieved principally due to the sales shortfall to plan of Imagelinx.
The individual performance and contribution of key Executives in 2003 was recognised by the Remuneration Committee and bonuses were
awarded, as set out on page 19.
Share options: Share options are granted in accordance with the LTG Technologies PLC Employee Share Incentive Plan, which was approved
by the Remuneration Committee on 23 December 1999. The first options were granted under this scheme to Executive Directors and certain
other employees effective 1 January 2000. 
The share options are awarded by the Remuneration Committee based on the movement in the Company’s share price. The exercise price
of options granted is normally the higher of the nominal value of the shares and the market price at the date of grant, although this can be
adjusted at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
On 13 February 2003 the Remuneration Committee agreed to the issue of new options to Executive Directors subject to performance conditions
relating to Group and individual business plan targets or objectives. Share options issued effective 14 April 2003 are exercisable, at a price
of £0.03 per share, between 14 April 2006 and 13 April 2013. Share options issued effective 30 April 2003 are exercisable, at a price of £0.04
per share, between 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2013. The awards were made to Directors as set out on page 20.
Share options issued effective 1 January 2000 are exercisable, at a price of £0.40 per share, between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2009.
This initial grant was made as a single block following the listing of the Company on AIM enabling incentivised remuneration of this type.
No performance criteria apply to this award, as this was made on the basis of past performance rather than future performance.
Share options issued effective 1 January 2001 are exercisable, at a price of £0.85 per share, between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2010. 
A reversionary interest in shares was granted on 26 January 2001; the vestment date is 26 February 2004 with the amount being determined
as the share value above £0.85 per share. This block grant with performance targets was made to incentivise key Executives over a key phase
in the development of the Group. The awards were made to Directors as set out on page 20.
Performance related bonuses: These are calculated based on internal targets, which are determined in advance of each year by the
Remuneration Committee. 
Pensions: The Executive Directors, with the exception of Dr Ing Peter Heizmann and Dr Franz Wimpffen, are members of the LTG Technologies
PLC Executive Pension Plan (see note 27) which is a defined contribution scheme. The Company’s contributions are 12% of basic salary.
Dr Ing Peter Heizmann’s pension entitlement is a final salary scheme with an entitlement in the year of £43,309 (€61,356) per annum.
Dr Franz Wimpffen has no pension entitlement above the German state scheme. 
Fees: The fees for Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stipulated in the Articles of Association. The Non-executive
Directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
Service contracts: The service contracts of all the Executive Directors except for Dr Ing Peter Heizmann have unlimited terms up to retirement,
but a notice period of one year. None of the Non-executive Directors have service contracts. There are no special provisions for compensation
in the event of loss of office. The Remuneration Committee considers the circumstances of individual cases of early termination and determines
compensation payments accordingly.
The market price of the Company’s shares on 31 December 2003 was £0.135. The highest market price in 2003 was £0.145, and the lowest
was £0.03.

Pension entitlements
The Executive Directors, with the exception of Dr Ing Peter Heizmann and Dr Franz Wimpffen, are members of the LTG Technologies PLC
Executive Pension Plan (see note 27), which is a defined contribution scheme. The Company’s contributions are 12% of basic salary,
and were as follows for the year:

Dr Ing Peter Heizmann’s pension entitlement is a final salary scheme with an accrued annual pension of £43,309 per annum, an increase of £3,231
over 2002. The expense charged in the accounts of the Group in respect of this scheme was £20,053 (2002: £38,296). This is an occupational
scheme subject to German law. The transfer value of Dr Ing Peter Heizmann’s accrued benefits at the end of 2003 was £581,071 (2002: £488,148).
The transfer value represents a liability of the Company, not a sum due to Dr Ing Peter Heizmann. Dr Franz Wimpffen has no pension
entitlement other than the German state scheme.

Directors’ remuneration report We have audited the financial statements of LTG Technologies PLC for the year ended 31 December 2003 on pages 22 to 46. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out on pages 27 to 29. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom
Auditing Standards. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Group has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group
is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
This other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review, the Corporate
Governance Statement, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for our report
if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. No person is entitled
to rely on this report unless such a person is a person entitled to rely upon this report by virtue of and for the purpose of the Companies
Act 1985 or has been expressly authorised to do so by our prior written consent. Save as above, we do not accept responsibility for this
report to any other person or for any other purpose and we hereby expressly disclaim any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused
by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements.
Going concern
In forming our opinion we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 1 to the financial statements, relating to the
financial requirements of the Group. Due to the significance of this matter, we draw it to your attention, but our opinion is not qualified
in this respect.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company as at 31 December
2003 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Report and Accounts 2003

Group cash flow statement
for the year ended 31 December 2003 1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The disclosure requirements of FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” have been adopted by the Group in the financial statements set out above.
The effect of FRS 17 is to include on the balance sheet at 31 December 2003 a net pension liability of £7.374m (2002: £6.175m). The Group
has restated the 2002 comparatives in respect of the Group’s liability for post-retirement benefits. The overseas post-retirement benefits have
been reclassified as pension liabilities.
Going Concern
At 31 December 2003, the Group had net current liabilities of £9,538,000, net liabilities of £4,311,000 and had incurred a loss for the year
ended 31 December 2003 of £10,680,000.
The Directors continually monitor the financial position of the Group, taking into account the latest forecasts of future cash flows and analyses
of these forecasts, sensitised in respect of the key uncertainties facing the Group’s ability to generate cash. The Directors consider that the major
such uncertainty is the timing of actual versus targeted sales in the Imagelinx division while it is building up the client base for its pioneering
services. Another key uncertainty which the Board is monitoring closely is the strength of the underlying recovery of the LTG Mailänder
division, particularly given the current geopolitical risk and its possible effect on the business environment. The Board has identified cash savings
which can be realised in the short-term in both divisions, if necessary, while minimising the effect on the Group’s global operating capability. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of LTG Technologies PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each
year. No profit and loss account is presented for LTG Technologies PLC as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. Results
of companies acquired in the course of the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition.
An entity is treated as an associate undertaking where the Group has a participating interest and exercises significant influence over its operating
and financial policy decisions.
In the Group accounts, interests in associated undertakings are accounted for by using the equity method of accounting. The consolidated
profit and loss account includes the Group’s share of the operating results, interest, pre-tax results and attributable taxation of such undertakings
based on audited financial statements. In the consolidated balance sheet, the interests in associated undertakings are shown as the Group’s
share of identifiable net assets, including any unamortised premium paid on acquisition.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts receivable from customers for goods sold and services provided, net of trade discounts and excluding value
added tax.
Government grants
Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to profit over the expected
useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to match them with
the expenditure to which they relate.
Goodwill
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over
its useful economic life of 15 years. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in
other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Concessions and rights
Amortisation is provided in equal annual instalments on the original costs of all concessions and rights, so as to write them down to
their residual value over their estimated useful lives, estimated to be three years. It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full
financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, except that development expenditure incurred on an individual project
is carried forward when its future recoverability can be reasonably regarded as assured. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised in line
with the lifetime of the related agreement.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided in equal annual instalments on the original costs of all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, so as to write
them down to their residual value over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings the lease term
Leasehold improvements the lease term
Plant and machinery three to ten years
Office equipment four to ten years
Motor vehicles four to five years
IT project costs three years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may
not be recoverable.
Stocks and work in progress
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location
and condition, as follows:
Raw materials and consumables – purchase cost, moving average
Work in progress and finished goods – cost of direct materials and labour plus attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Long-term contracts
Revenue and profit on long-term contracts, including substantial contracts which are in progress at a period end, are recognised when the
outcome of the contract can be measured with reasonable certainty, on the basis of percentage completion.
Foreign currencies
Group – The balance sheets of the overseas companies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The profit and
loss statements of the overseas companies are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. The exchange difference arising on the
retranslation of opening net assets and the difference between average and closing rate profit and loss account is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Company – Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the
transaction is covered by a forward rate exchange contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate. All differences are taken to the profit
and loss account.
Derivative instruments
The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates on operations. The Group considers its
derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met. 
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the
Group in line with the Group’s risk management policies.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments are recognised by adjusting the net interest charge. Premiums or discounts on derivative
instruments are amortised over the shorter of the life of the instrument or the underlying exposure.
Currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resulting gains
or losses, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Pensions
The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme, now closed, which requires contributions to be made to separately administered
funds. The cost of providing benefits under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains
and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised gains and losses. FRS 17, “Retirement Benefits”, has been adopted early
in accounting for this fund as the Group believes that this is the most appropriate way to treat this aspect of the Group’s responsibilities.
The Group also provides for defined benefit pensions under German law at its German operations, that are accounted for in accordance with
FRS 17 in these financial statements. These contributions are in part unfunded. See note 27. 
The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. Contributions are charged in the profit and loss account as they become
payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
The Group maintains an employee savings plan with employer participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the US
Internal Revenue code.

Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the
Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. The capital elements of
future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the rental
obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Warranty costs
Provision is made for the estimated cost of meeting future warranty claims relating to sales made up to the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax,
with the following exceptions:
● provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal
of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding
agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance
sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the
replacement assets are sold;
● provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
● deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Notes to the accounts
for the year ended 31 December 2003 18. Provisions for liabilities and charges (continued)
The provision for loss on disposal of £658,000 was made at 31 December 2002, due to the disposal of the business activities of Crabtree
of Gateshead to Ever 1919 Limited on 18 March 2003. The actual loss was subsequently calculated to be £552,000 and therefore the excess
provision not utilised has been released to the profit and loss account during the year.
The provision for maintenance warranties of £1,669,000 (2002: £1,983,000) is calculated based on expected warranty claims following past
experience. The guarantee period can range from one to two years, though expense incurred is normally within the first year. Actual costs
are therefore expected to be incurred mainly within one year.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is not provided in the accounts as the Group and Company have an overall deferred tax asset, the timing of the recovery of which
is not sufficiently certain to recognise the asset.

Interest rate risk profile of financial assets (continued)
During the year the Group held a promissory note in respect of US$3,141,000 discounted to US$ 2,909,000 translated at 2002 year-end
to the discounted value of £1,811,000 as deferred consideration in respect of the sale of the Industrial Ovens division. This was received
on 26 February 2003.
The assets on which no interest is received comprises bank current accounts.
Currency exposures
As explained on page 10, the Group’s objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas (in other
words, its structural currency exposures) are to maintain a low cost of borrowings while hedging against currency depreciation on
operational exposures. Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses.
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures; in other words, those transactional (or non-structural) exposures that give rise to the
net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities
of the Group that are not denominated in the operating (or ’functional’) currency of the operating unit involved.

The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of forward foreign currency contracts entered into to manage these currency
exposures. As at 31 December, the Group also held open various forward foreign currency contracts taken out to hedge expected future
foreign currency sales.
Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows:
2003 2002

43 27. Pension commitments
LTG Technologies PLC
Certain members of the Board and other employees of LTG Technologies PLC are members of a defined contribution scheme operated by the
Company. This scheme is described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 18 to 20. The expense charged to the profit and loss account
in 2003 was £78,000 (2002: £60,000). The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year-end, included in other creditors are £Nil (2002: £Nil).
LTG Gateshead Limited (formerly Crabtree of Gateshead Limited)
The Company operated a defined contribution pension scheme for all employees during the year. The assets of the scheme were held separately
from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account for the year
was £18,000 (2002: £84,000). The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year-end, included in other creditors are £Nil (2002: £37,480).
This pension scheme was transferred with other assets and trade to Ever 1919 Limited as part of the disposal.
The Group also operates a closed funded pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for all eligible employees. The assets
of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. Contributions to the scheme are determined
on the advice of a qualified actuary. With effect from 30 April 2000 the Crabtree Pension Scheme ceased to accept new members and operated
as a closed scheme. The ongoing responsibility to protect the funding of pension liabilities accrued to 30 April 2000 remains with the Group. 
LTG Mailänder GmbH
The Company operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme which is now closed to new entrants. Contributions to this scheme are made
on the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method. The aim is for the benefits to be fully funded during
the scheme members’ working lives. The regular pension cost is also assessed under the Projected Unit Credit method. The pension cost for
this scheme for the year was £15,000 (2002: £51,000).
The Group has restated the 2002 comparatives in respect of the Group liability for post-retirement benefits. The overseas post-retirement
benefits have been reclassified as pension liabilities.
FRS 17, “Retirement Benefits”, has been adopted early in accounting for these defined benefit funds as the Company believes that this is the
most appropriate way to treat this aspect of the Company’s obligations. On the balance sheet as at 31 December 2003 is a net pension liability
of £7,374,000 (2002: £6,175,000). The statement of recognised gains and losses is impacted by a charge of £1,221,000 (2002: £3,046,000).
The profit and loss account was charged with £Nil in 2003 (2002: £Nil) in respect of employers’ contributions, while being charged with
£142,000, (2002: credited with £40,000) in respect of other finance income. The valuation used for FRS 17 purposes has been based on the
most recent actuarial valuation at 5 April 2003 updated to 31 December 2003 by Hazel Carr Pensions Consulting plc and by M&L Gesellschaft
für Versicherungsmathematik mbH in respect of LTG Mailänder GmbH. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective
balance sheet dates.

LTG Technologies Inc. and Imagelinx USA Inc.
These companies maintain an employee savings plan with employer participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the
US Internal Revenue code. All employees of age 21 or over and who have more than one year of service are eligible to participate. The plan
allows participants to make pre-tax contributions with the Company matching certain percentages as determined by the Board of Directors.
The percentage may change due to profitability of the Company. 
This savings scheme is therefore similar to a defined contribution scheme in the manner of employer contributions. The expense charged
to the accounts in 2003 was £84,000 (2002: £95,000). The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year-end, included in other creditors
are £Nil (2002: £3,000).
Imagelinx UK Limited
Eligible employees are entitled to membership of a defined contribution Group plan. The expense charged to the profit and loss account
in 2003 was £96,000 (2002: £174,000). The unpaid contributions outstanding at the year-end, included in other creditors are £14,000
(2002: £12,000).

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Introduction
Ultra’s increasingly wide portfolio of
specialist capabilities allows it to offer
highly-differentiated solutions into the
defence & aerospace, security & cyber and
transport and energy market sectors. This
broad diversity gives signiﬁcant resilience to
Ultra’s ﬁnancial performance and provides 
a solid platform for growth. Over the last 
12 months the Group has weathered the
uncertainty in the US government-funded
market, where the lack of clarity has
resulted in delays to expected orders,
approvals and payments. The continued
ﬁscal pressures in the broader government-
funded markets, and changing market
dynamics, have tested the Group’s business
model. However, the Group’s sustained
investment and constant focus on
improving operational efﬁciencies, together
with Ultra’s inherent agility has shown the
model is robust and is positioning the
Group for growth when normality returns.
Operational highlights
Features of the Group’s accomplishments
in the year which will underpin future
performance included:
• the award of an exclusive long-term supply
agreement with Pratt & Whitney for the
electronic control unit which manages
the Electrical Ice Protection System (EIPS)
on the US Joint Strike Fighter’s F-135
engine. The agreement is effective for the
life of the engine programme, valued at
over $500m
• a £16.1m contract for the supply of
specialist instrumentation to EDF Energy.
Under this contract, Ultra will
manufacture and support safety-critical
nuclear reactor instrumentation for use in
EDF Energy’s current UK nuclear power
stations. This is the ﬁrst contract to
beneﬁt from Ultra’s recent investment in
a state-of-the-art nuclear instrumentation
manufacturing facility
• an increase in anti-submarine warfare
(ASW) spend which reﬂects the US ‘Pivot
to the Paciﬁc’ policy. The US Navy has
recently changed from issuing an annual
sonobuoy tender and issued a ﬁve-year
IDIQ competitive tender for which Ultra,
through its JV, was the only bidder.
Contract award is expected in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2014
Ultra’s business model
Ultra’s prime objective continues to be to
outperform the market in terms of annual
increases in shareholder value, by delivering
above-average increases in earnings and by
communicating effectively with shareholders
and the ﬁnancial community. The strategic
framework, page 1, is focused on ensuring
that Ultra meets its prime objective. This is
achieved through the strategies for growth
which are described on pages 14 and 15,
allied with the business model described on
pages 6 to 11. Underpinning these are
Ultra’s strategic tenets described on pages
12 and 13, which help to shape and deﬁne
the values and behaviours embedded
within Ultra’s culture, which is further
detailed on pages 40 to 43.
Positioning for growth
In response to the changing market
dynamics, Ultra continues to adapt its
behaviours to maintain its agility and focus
on customer needs. To support this, the
Group has successfully developed and
rolled out a number of internal initiatives
and tools which help it gain a better
understanding of customers’ real needs.
These improve its ability to offer
differentiated and comprehensive solutions
in areas of preferential spend across all its
market sectors. These key initiatives
include: LEAP, LAUNCH and
Collaborative Autonomy (more
information on these initiatives can be
found on pages 7, 9 and 10).

In response to the changing market dynamics, Ultra continues to adapt 
its behaviours to maintain its agility and focus on customer need. Investment for growth – 
new capabilities
To increase the breadth of the Group’s
capabilities, Ultra continues to invest over
5% of revenue on internal development to
generate new differentiated offerings.
These offerings are aimed at niche market
sectors where customers preferentially
focus their expenditure. These investment
activities are led by the businesses and are
robustly reviewed by the Executive Team
and the Board.
In parallel, Ultra continues to invest in
acquisitions, which bring complementary
world-leading niche capabilities and
market access to the Group’s portfolio. In
June 2013, the Group acquired Varisys, a
UK business which develops products for
high-performance embedded computing
applications. Its product portfolio includes
bespoke solutions for customers
operating in the aerospace, defence,
telecommunications and industrial sectors.
Varisys is now a part of Ultra’s Aircraft &
Vehicle Systems division.
In October 2013, Ultra acquired Wood &
Douglas Limited (W&D). W&D provides
bespoke wireless products, radio networks,
video monitoring and wireless data
platform capabilities. These are supplied to
the defence, homeland security,
transportation, emergency services,
exploration, healthcare and utilities sectors
in the UK and to over 30 countries
worldwide. W&D has been integrated into
Ultra’s Tactical & Sonar Systems division to
form a centre of excellence for
communication products and services.
Investment for growth – 
new geographic markets
The Group constantly strives to broaden its
customer base and widen its geographic
footprint. This not only provides growth,
but increases the robustness of the
business model. Ultra has made the
strategic decision to prioritise on a number
of regions and sectors with higher growth.
The Group recognises that new markets
and geographic sectors take time to enter
and so these activities are carried out in a
measured and controlled manner, with due
consideration of risk. Ultra, as an
independent, non-threatening partner, is
able to support all of the main prime
contractors and local industry partners. The
Group is therefore well positioned to bring
its specialised equipment, systems and
services to new long-term platforms and
programmes in new markets and regions.
Further details on Ultra’s robust business
model can be found on pages 6 to 11.
Behaviours for growth
The Group will continue to differentiate
itself from its competitors through its
technical innovation and high standards of
ethical business conduct. Underpinning
this cultural drive is a strong ethical policy
which is mandatory for all employees
across the entire Group. Ultra educates its
employees on anti-bribery and corruption
policies, including gifts and hospitality
practices. In the period, Ultra decided not
to pursue business in areas where it was
not satisﬁed that its ethical standards
would be maintained.
Executing against the growth strategies,
shown above, requires consistency of
management focus and drive. The
continuity of Ultra’s management team
ensures that expertise and experience is
retained to maintain growth momentum in
the Group. Ultra’s management team has to
balance dealing with the particularly
challenging short-term market conditions,
whilst also ensuring that it is fully
addressing the need to continue positioning
for medium- and long-term growth. The
members of the Executive Team understand
through experience, what makes Ultra
different and how to focus the Group’s
businesses on maintaining competitive
advantage in the various specialist market
sectors in which Ultra operates.
Summary
I am pleased to say that early recognition 
of current changes in market dynamics,
allied with Ultra’s robust business model
and inherent agility, has enabled the Group
to position for future growth in these
challenging times.
I would like to ﬁnish by thanking all of
Ultra’s employees for their continued hard
work, dedication and enthusiasm. Ultra’s
reputation as a global leader in electronics
and software for defence, security,
transport and energy applications is built
on the endeavours of its exceptional
employees and their ability to develop
long-term value-adding relationships with
customers. The ability to execute these
strategies successfully is entirely reliant
upon the engagement, commitment and
passion of the Group’s employees. I am
conﬁdent that Ultra is well placed to
successfully execute the strategies and
plans to meet its prime objective.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
The Group will continue 
to differentiate itself from 
its competitors by:
•
technical innovation 
across its broad portfolio 
of capabilities
•
the endeavours of its
exceptional employees
•
the ability to develop 
long-term value-adding 
relationships with customers  Ultra’s customer reach
Ultra focuses on developing innovative,
highly-differentiated solutions which are
delivered in close collaboration with
customers, partners and suppliers. 
Ultra is continually evolving its approach to
match the markets in which the Group
operates. This evolution is in response to:
• changing customer demands
• anticipating the direction of travel of 
the markets
• the Group striving to be the first to bring
new solutions to market 
In its specialist capability areas, Ultra’s
understanding of:
• the customers’ domains
• the demanding operational environments
• the projected capability gaps which
customers would like addressed
Is a key differentiator for the Group. In
short, Ultra’s understanding of the
customer’s ‘problem statement’ allows it to
get to the heart of the customer’s
requirements and develop effective and
innovative solutions.
Putting the customer first
Ultra’s businesses constantly innovate to
create solutions to customer requirements
which are different from, and better than,
those of the Group’s competitors in a way
which the customer values. In identifying
differentiated solutions, prime consideration
is given to what the customer needs, not to
what Ultra would like to sell. This flexibility
covers the technical attributes of the
product or system and the commercial
package, including the training and support
in which the customer is interested. 
See Partnering on pages 9.
Strategic supplier
All Ultra businesses are expected to
maximise their relationships with customers
for the long-term, through:
• developing a close understanding of
customer needs
• sustained on-time delivery of high-quality
products and services
• encouraging a long-term strategic
relationship
As a result, Ultra’s businesses can become
part of the customers’ extended enterprises
to mutual benefit.
Ultra’s independence
Ultra’s independence, together with its
autonomous businesses and its position in
the supply chain (see page 9) mean that it
is able to work with all prime contractors.
This allows the Group to sell its wide
portfolio of specialist capabilities to a broad
range of customers around the world. 
Engaging with customers
Ultra’s LAUNCH is a behaviour which the
Group has developed to facilitate customer
engagement and relationship building. 
L Listen to customers
A Ask the right questions
U Understand what their ‘pain’ is
N identify the customers’ Needs; 
and get their agreement
C Create a relationship, opportunity
and solution
H Holistic. Examine the bigger picture;
how can Ultra maximise the scope
and value of the opportunity?
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate long-term customer relationships
which leads to a better pipeline of
opportunities and so ultimately, enable
growth. LAUNCH is aligned with the
Group’s approach to systems engineering
and project management. 
This approach ensures Ultra understands
the real needs of its customers.
Ultra’s strategic framework

LAUNCH case study
One of Ultra’s businesses began the
process to encourage an existing
customer to replace the competitor for
the hand controllers for a helicopter
weapon system. Using LAUNCH, it
succeeded in winning the business by
solving several problems experienced
by the existing supplier. As a result, the
business was able to move from
supplying just the high-end electronic
components, to supplying the entire
fire control system and the helicopter
flight control handles.
Ultra strives to get to the heart of a customer’s requirements – 
it is this that helps Ultra build lasting customer relationships

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Ultra’s capabilities…
Ultra has a broad portfolio of specialist capabilities which can 
be combined ﬂexibly to generate highly-differentiated solutions for
the customer
Capabilities
The Group has a broad portfolio of
specialist capabilities which deliver highly-
differentiated solutions to the following
market sectors:
Defence & Aerospace
Security & Cyber
Transport and Energy
The Group is constantly seeking to
increase the number of specialist
capabilities in its market niches and to
increase the number of long-term
platforms and programmes on which
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are specified.
The expansive spread of specialist
capability areas mapped onto so many
platforms and programmes:
• provide resilience to Ultra’s financial
performance 
• reduce the Group’s risk profile; and
• drive the Group’s growth
Investment
The Group has a strategy to invest
continuously to strengthen its capabilities
across its specialist niche markets. Ultra’s
deep understanding of the users’ domain,
its enduring customer relationships and its
outward-facing nature (encapsulated in
LAUNCH and LEAP behaviours) inform
the Group’s investment decisions.
Ultra invests consistently over 5% of its
revenue in new product and business
development. In addition, over 10% of
Group revenue is customer-funded
product development. In total therefore,
over 15% of revenue spend is focused on
augmenting the portfolio of capabilities
and programme positions which underpin
further growth.
Corporate agility
A key differentiator for Ultra is the agility
which businesses in the Group exhibit in
their dealings with customers.
The Board provides effective leadership
and direction in delivering the key
corporate objective of reliable and
consistent growth in shareholder value. At
the operational level, the Executive Team
has responsibility for running the Group
and for delivery of strategy, financial
performance and team development.
Ultra’s individual businesses have a high
degree of operational autonomy, so that
they provide the exceptionally agile and
responsive support to customers and
partners, normally associated with a smaller
business. These benefits of customer focus
and agility are augmented by the access to
wider and complementary technologies and
expertise which lie elsewhere in the Group
(collaborative autonomy) or with partners
and by Ultra’s strong financial position.
Ultra’s core management processes address
four main areas. These are:
Compliance
• ensuring that the businesses comply 
fully with all laws and regulations of the
countries in which they operate
• maintaining high standards of integrity
and ethical behaviour
Strategy
• agreeing and delivering five-year plans,
focused on positioning for growth in
target markets
• development of innovative and highly-
differentiated solutions to meet
customer needs
Financial performance
• managing the key financial and business
processes, so that the businesses meet
or exceed the agreed financial budgets
Developing people
• for each business, developing the team
and its individuals so that they grow
with the business and do not limit the
development of the Group

WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP Ultra focuses on developing innovative solutions which are delivered
in close collaboration with partners, suppliers and customers
Partnerships
Ultra has an established ability to externally
partner and team to offer the proven
technology which best meets customers’
requirements. The Group is agnostic as to
the source of technology which is required to
deliver solutions. Where proven technology
that meets customers’ requirements exists
outside the Group, Ultra is happy to form
teaming partnerships to access it. Ultra sees
these teaming arrangements as a source of
competitive advantage, allowing Ultra to
deliver differentiated solutions which meet
customer needs efficiently, with lower
development risk. It is important that these
teaming arrangements are of benefit to all
parties – by working together, the team
members are able to win opportunities
which would not be possible in isolation.
Supply chain
Ultra has no strategic aim to be a tier 1, 
top-level platform provider. The Group is
therefore, non-threatening to the tier 1
prime contractors such as BAE Systems or
Rolls-Royce and counts them amongst its
largest customers. They can rely on Ultra to
provide the specialist capabilities at which
the Group is expert. Concentrating on tiers
2, 3 and 4, rather than aiming to be a tier 1
platform provider, means that, with the
exception of the Oman Airport IT
programme, no single platform or
programme typically accounts for more than
5% of Group revenue for the year. This
means that the cancellation or curtailment
of any single programme is unlikely to have
a significant adverse impact on the Group.
Typical tier offerings
Tier 1 (Platform provider)
Responsible for being the prime contractor
of the platform in question, examples being
a naval vessel or a terminal at an airport.
Tier 2 (System integrator)
Responsible for integrating equipment or
components which will make up a
functional element of the platform.
Examples of system integration which Ultra
has completed include integrated sonar
systems and wing ice protection systems.
Tier 3 (Equipment supplier)
Ultra has a large presence at this level of the
supply chain, supplying equipment such as
data links, cryptographic equipment and
large electrical transformers. 
Tier 4 (Component supplier)
Ultra also provides a broad range of smaller
components onto many programmes
worldwide, including sensors for measuring
the performance of a nuclear reactor and
joysticks to control UAVs.
Position in the supply chain
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are mainly at
tiers 3 and 4, supplying equipment and
components to support tier 1 and 2 
systems and programmes. The Group does
undertake tier 2 system integration, but
does this mainly when integrating its own
tier 3 offerings. Ultra therefore,
understands the tier 3 detailed interfaces
and so is able to manage the risk inherent
in system integration activities.
Collaborative autonomy
One of Ultra’s eight strategic tenets is
teaming. See page 13. Working
collaboratively increases business
opportunities, by allowing Ultra to offer
capability from its wide portfolio to best
meet the customers’ needs. It creates
competitive advantage by accessing 
off-the-shelf technology at lower cost,
enabling timely delivery, while avoiding
expensive development costs and high
project risk.

Collaborative 
autonomy in action
Fighting vehicle systems…
In early 2013 Ultra’s PALS, MSI, AMI and
EMS businesses formed a collaborative
team to address jointly the armoured
fighting vehicle (AFV) market. An initial
review of the market identified a
significant number of large programmes
which might benefit from a joint
approach, including upgrades to
Warrior and Challenger in the UK and
also new-buy programmes in India and
Australia. It was clear at an early stage
that Ultra’s combined AFV capability is
wide-ranging and complementary.
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Ultra’s people
Ultra would not be able to deliver value to customers without 
the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of its staff
The right people
The success which Ultra achieves in
innovating to meet customer needs is
based on the broad range of skills and
capabilities of the Group’s employees.
The Board understands this and recognises
that the Group’s ‘right’ people are its most
important asset (see page 13, Ultra’s
strategic enablers). Ultra strives for an
efficient organisation with engaged and
competent people. More detail on Ultra’s
people and their development can be
found on pages 40 to 43.
Domain expertise
Ultra’s deep understanding of its specialist
capability areas, combined with knowledge
of the users’ environment, are key factors
in delivering innovative solutions to meet
customers’ needs. Ultra is continuously
developing its domain expertise to ensure
that it has the right people available who
are best able to support customers in
understanding and creating solutions which
fulfil their needs.
Culture and LEAP
Ultra has identified four cultural behaviours
of its people which are highly valued and
encouraged. These are leadership,
entrepreneurship, audacity and paranoia.
Together they are known as LEAP…
Leadership: Good leadership is extremely
important to Ultra and a number of models
of leadership are incorporated in the
development and training programmes
which are delivered around the Group.
Entrepreneurship: Being entrepreneurial is
a behaviour which underpins the Group’s
strategy. All Ultra businesses seek to provide
customers with solutions which are different
from, and better than, those of competitors.
Ultra’s entrepreneurial culture seeks to
maximise the capability to generate excellent
ideas and the business skills needed to bring
them successfully to market.
Audacity: Audacious thinking is the
difference between incremental
improvement and business transformation.
It takes the idea of innovation, one of
Ultra’s core values, and invites employees to
think about issues in ways which are
unconstrained by existing norms, making
use of creative approaches in every aspect
of the Group’s business.
Paranoia: Paranoia, in the business sense,
is a concern and fear about competitors
and what they may do. It also relates to
concerns and fears about things which can
go wrong internally. For Ultra, paranoia is
important in focusing its staff on
maximising their knowledge of the
competitive landscape, by constantly asking
questions of the Group’s individual
businesses, customers’, teaming partners
and suppliers.
How Ultra manages its people
Ultra focuses on delivering agile and
responsive support to customers through a
high degree of operational autonomy.
As much authority and responsibility as
possible is devolved to the Managing
Directors and Presidents of Ultra’s individual
businesses and their management teams.
The Group wants these teams to maintain
the agility and sharp focus, that are typical
of owner-managed businesses, on
customers’ requirements.
Developing people
Ultra is committed to developing people
and securing the talent pipeline to ensure
the continued growth and success of the
Group. Each business is responsible for
continuously developing the team and its
individuals, so that they grow with the
business and do not become a constraint
on the development of the Group. Great
focus is placed on ensuring that the right
people are in the right roles. More detail
can be found on pages 40 to 43.

People in action
With a renewed focus on innovation,
Ultra‘s MSI business ran the second
year of its Innovation Initiative and has
named its first ever Technology
Achievement winner. The winner was a
Lead Systems Engineer in MSI’s Human
Systems Integration business unit. The
award is for the work he did developing
the new weapon management systems
for MSI, in the form of a gun control
unit and an armament control panel. 
Through collaboration with the
customer, diligent collection of
requirements and implementation of
innovative design methods, he not only
significantly improved product
functionality, assembly and reliability,
but he also paved the way for MSI to
enter the weapon systems
management market. As a result of
these newly-developed capabilities, MSI
can now extend its solution offering
from the human-machine interface into
the wider weapon systems control and
management domain.  Ultra’s value generation
Ultra’s three strengths of customer reach, people and capabilities
combine to enable Ultra to generate and sustain value
Ultra value for the customers
Ultra generates value by applying electronic
and software technologies in demanding
and critical environments to provide 
highly-differentiated solutions to meet
customers’ needs.
Ultra businesses constantly innovate to
create solutions to customer requirements
which are different from, and better than,
those of the Group’s competitors.
Solutions
By applying these differentiated solutions
to a wide range of international platforms
and programmes, Ultra has built an
exceptionally broad portfolio of specialist
capability areas. Where the Group has a
number of complementary capabilities, it
can also combine these to offer broader
solutions. In other words, Ultra’s products,
capabilities and the associated domain
expertise uniquely position the Group to be
able to meet more complex sub-system and
system requirements. 
Support
Ultra offers support to customers of its
products and systems through the design,
delivery and support phases of a
programme. Ultra’s deep understanding of
its specialist capability areas and the users’
environment is a key factor in supplying
innovative solutions to ensure the capabilities
are delivered and sustained in-service and
meet the customers’ through-life needs.
Sustaining value
In order for Ultra’s business model to
deliver success over the long-term, it must
be sustainable and it must manage any
inherent risk well.
Economic
Ultra ensures that all of its businesses are
well-managed, control costs and are 
cash-generative. This allows the Group to 
self-fund acquisitions which deliver
positions in new markets or additional
niche capabilities. Since the Group’s
formation, Ultra has maintained a balance
between organic and acquisition growth,
having integrated 51 acquisitions since
1993. The Group pursues four parallel
strategies for growth which are explained
more fully on pages 14 and 15. 
Social
Ultra understands that the long-term
success of the Group will be enhanced
through continuous focus on value
creation for all its stakeholders. The Group
encourages its businesses to support their
local communities and environment, as
well as discharging their responsibilities to
contribute to the broader social well-being.
To read how Ultra is making a difference,
see pages 38 and 39.
Environmental
Ultra recognises that it is important, both
for its employees and the communities in
which it operates, that effective measures
are in place to minimise the environmental
impact of its activities, as this will help to
secure the long-term future of the Group.
Ultra has committed to substantial
investments in manufacturing facilities
which will, in addition to improving
productivity, offer increased efficiencies 
and reduce energy consumption.
Reducing risk to maintain value
Ultra’s business model supports a stable
and well-balanced business, with the aim
of reducing risk and maintaining the
generation of value.
Ultra’s strategy is to constantly broaden its
portfolio of products and services which are
positioned on a large number of international
platforms and programmes in the defence,
security, transport and energy markets.
The Group remains committed to its strategy
of continued investment in its portfolio of
differentiated specialist capabilities, to
ensure that the business is well-positioned
to meet future market demand.
Ultra has an increasingly broad customer
base worldwide, with sales outside the UK
now representing over 65% of Group
revenue. Ultra is constantly repositioning
itself in growth sectors within its main
defence, security, transport and energy
markets.
The above factors, together with Ultra’s
market agility and organisational flexibility,
generate further robustness and resilience
in the Group’s financial profile and
mitigates risk.
More detail on Ultra’s approach to risk
management and specific risks can be
found on pages 34 to 37.

Ultra’s enablers
Ultra’s growth momentum has been sustained by successfully pursuing its strategies for growth. See
pages 14 and 15. Underpinning these strategies, are eight core strategic tenets. They have been used
consistently by the Group over many years. They help shape the culture, defined as values and
behaviours which drive results, which is encouraged in Ultra.
12 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Focus on defence, security,
transport and energy 
The Group’s core competencies, domain
knowledge and market positions give it
particular credibility in these four sectors
worldwide. Core competencies include:
market positioning through an
understanding of customer needs, enabling
responses to complex invitations to tender
or requests for proposals; managing
complex development programmes, where
risks need careful identiﬁcation and control;
manufacturing and aftermarket support
over long timescales and the discipline to
meet the Group’s commitments. The
strategy is to enhance the capability of the
Group such that adjacent market sectors,
which exhibit growth, can be served. 
Through-life product and
services portfolio
The Group values any position within the
supply chain which is held by any particular
niche. Frequently, more attractive margins
can be generated by providing
components, than by supplying entire
systems. Where the Group has a number
of complementary niches, it does combine
these to offer sub-systems, systems and
through-life management solutions to
satisfy customer requirements. Generally,
however, Ultra prefers to retain a leading
niche position, rather than pursue the
supply of systems for its own end. The
scope of Ultra’s offering is determined
after a rigorous strategic review.
Ultra’s analysis of the defence, security,
transport and energy markets can be found
on pages 20 to 22.
Further information on Ultra’s place in the
supply chain and its approach to through-
life support can be found on pages 9 to 11.
Further information on Ultra’s strategy 
for developing specialist capabilities can be
found on page 8 and 9.
Further information on Ultra’s Strategies for
Growth can be found on pages 14 and 15.
Niche player
Within the Group’s businesses, there is a
broad portfolio of specialist capabilities,
where the aim is to sustain competitive
advantage. These niche capabilities
enable Ultra to achieve world-leading
positions and result in the potential for
superior financial performance. This broad
spread gives the Group low dependency
on any single contract and provides
resilience in the face of technological
changes or funding cut-backs.
Growth
Ultra businesses are expected to contribute
to the organic growth of the Group, as well
as identifying well-matched acquisition
targets. To ensure that an appropriate rate
of organic growth is maintained,
businesses produce annual ﬁve-year
strategic plans which target speciﬁc
opportunities. The focus on cash
generation is a key driver to the
affordability of suitable acquisitions to
augment the Group’s growth rate. The
Group’s acquisition strategy is summarised
as being the pursuit of ‘bolt-on’ and 
‘bolt-in’ acquisitions which enable Ultra to
successfully pursue its four main strategies
for growth. The normal size of
acquisitions, as measured by annual
revenue, is currently about £30m to
£150m for ‘bolt-ons’ and up to £30m for
‘bolt-ins’. Larger acquisitions will be
considered where the case is compelling. Ultra’s strategic framework
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 13
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Efﬁciency and competence 
Ultra seeks to maximise efﬁciency
throughout its organisation. The levels of
commitment and competency of business
management teams is continuously
assessed through strategic, budget,
organisation, succession and regular
business performance reviews. The Group
places a high degree of trust in, and has
high expectations of, its senior staff and
supports their development and
improvement activities. Ultra empowers
management teams to run their respective
businesses to deliver agreed strategies,
meet budgets and continuously develop
their people. The Group constantly
develops its people and structure through
a rigorous annual organisation, succession
and development planning process.
Teaming
Teaming, internally within the Group or
externally with other companies, broadens
offerings by combining niche products or
linking domain knowledge. Teaming
attains competitive advantage by accessing 
off-the-shelf technology at lower cost,
allowing timely delivery, while avoiding
expensive development costs and high
project risk. Increasingly, Ultra teams with
international, world-class partners to
access ‘best of breed’ technology and
undertakes specialist system and 
sub-system design and integration,
ensuring customers’ sovereign operational
independence where required.

having an efﬁcient and competent
workforce can be found on pages 38 to 41.

partnering and teaming can be found

Further details on how Ultra drives long-
term relationships can be found on pages
6 to 11.
More information on Ultra’s commitment
to developing sustainable and long-term
business can be found on page 44.
Strategic supplier 
Ultra businesses are expected to maximise
their relationships with customers for the
long term, through a close understanding
of customer needs, leading to sustained 
on-time delivery of high-quality products
and services. Many of the Group’s niche
offerings involve the design and supply of
complex products and services, which are
typically safety- or performance-critical in
their application. This creates a shared
dependency from the customers’
perspectives and encourages a long-term
strategic relationship where Ultra’s
businesses become part of the customers’
extended enterprises, to mutual beneﬁt.
Meeting commitments
Ultra has built a reputation for meeting its
commitments. This reputation is not only
based on businesses meeting their
obligations, but also by establishing a
culture within the Group, which is based
on this principle. Ultra believes that this
reputation is one of its deﬁning and 
most valuable characteristics. Behaving in
this way fosters long-term relationships.
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Increase the Group’s portfolio 
of specialist capability areas
Ultra concentrates on providing its customers with capabilities and
systems, using the Group’s electronic and software solutions for
niche markets in defence & aerospace, security & cyber, transport
and energy. Within these market sectors, Ultra focuses on
developing specialist capabilities which provide differentiated
solutions to customers’ requirements, often in demanding and
critical environments.
Increase the number of long-term 
platforms and programmes on which 
Ultra’s specialist capabilities are speciﬁed
Ultra positions these specialist capabilities on a long list of
international platforms and programmes. This breadth of platform
and programme coverage creates a ﬂywheel effect which drives
Ultra’s performance year after year, despite market ﬂuctuations.
Ultra is positioned on very many such platforms and programmes.
In 2013…
Ultra added 12 new specialist capability
areas to its portfolio.
In 2013…
the Group’s specialist capabilities were speciﬁed
on 9 new platforms and programmes.
Ultra must add long-term shareholder value, as measured by market capitalisation and the Group’s
ranking in the FTSE index, more rapidly than other companies to outperform the market. This is
facilitated by an above-average rate of revenue growth. Ultra constantly strives to increase its share of
the high-growth sectors of the markets in which it has positioned itself. The four main strategic
objectives which support this target growth are:

supplies to a wide range of different project ofﬁces, integrated
project teams and platform teams within its customers, the largest
of which include; US DoD, UK MoD, MOTC Oman, Rolls-Royce,
BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing. 
Widen Ultra’s geographic footprint
Ultra has pursued a strategy of gaining access to the two largest
addressable defence budgets in the world. Despite the recent
budget reductions, the US still spends more on defence each year
than the rest of the nations combined. The majority of Ultra’s
acquisitions have been in North America and the point has now
been reached where the Group has a transatlantic capability and
derives more of its revenue from the US and Canada than it does
from the UK. Ultra’s revenue from the Middle East and Asia
Paciﬁc regions is capable of expansion. The Group’s growing
presence in Australia and the Middle East regions indicates Ultra’s
intent in this regard.

Comment
Revenue declined by 2% to £745.2m. 
The positive effects of both foreign
exchange on translation of overseas
revenues and the incremental beneﬁt of
self-funded acquisitions were outweighed
by a decline in underlying constant
currency revenues of 4.4%.
Comment
Underlying proﬁt before tax increased
slightly to £116.8m and the underlying
operating margin increased slightly to
16.3%. The additional contribution from
acquisitions and favourable foreign currency
translation was partly offset by an adverse
organic performance, mainly owing to a
challenging defence market in 2013.
Comment
Underlying earnings per share in the year
were 127.1p (2012: 125.5p), an increase
of 1.3%. A ﬁnal dividend of 29.5p (2012:
27.8p) is proposed. If this is approved at
the Annual General Meeting, this will give
a full-year dividend of 42.2p (2012: 40.0p)
and will be covered 3.0 times by proﬁts.

completed every 1 to 2 years. Answers 
to various questions are combined to give
the overall employee engagement scores.
In 2012 and prior years, Ultra used a KPI relating to interest cover. This is not included in 2013 as it is becoming less useful measure for
the Group. Instead recognising the Group’s ‘right people’ are its most important asset, a non ﬁnancial KPI relating to the engagement of
employees was considered to be a more valuable measure.
Other performance indicators
Ultra’s four strategies for growth are described on pages 14 and 15 of this report. Performance indicators, relating to the Group’s success
in these four dimensions, are shown on those pages. Performance indicators which relate to the recruitment, retention and development

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Ultra focuses on constantly and
continuously positioning itself in
areas of preferential customer
spend within its main markets
Markets – where we operate
Ultra is always evolving within its main
Defence & Aerospace, Security & Cyber,
Transport and Energy markets to sustain
growth. Through its proven strategic
review process, the Group has
demonstrated a long track record of
identifying future growth sectors within its
core markets. Ultra then invests to create
differentiated positions in these sectors.
Ultra continues to focus on maximising
revenue from the largest addressable
defence budgets in the world. The Group
has a significant transatlantic capability and
derives around half its revenue from North
America, where the Group continues to
follow a strategy of identifying and
pursuing areas of preferential funding. The
Middle East and Asia Pacific regions are
capable of being larger markets for Ultra. 
A full analysis of the Group’s markets is on
the following pages.
Ultra’s customers
Ultra’s independence allows it to work with
the world’s major prime contractors in its
markets and to sell its wide portfolio of
specialist capabilities to a broad range of
customers around the world. The graphic
to the right shows the major customers for
the Group’s 2013 revenue. Within Ultra’s
top customers, such as the US Department
of Defense (DoD), the UK Ministry of
Defence (MoD) and BAE Systems, the
Group actually supplies to a wide range of
different project offices, integrated project
teams and platform teams. Therefore, Ultra
deals with a larger number of different
partners and customers than the graphic
might, at first, suggest.
Geographic reach
A key strategic objective is to broaden the
Group’s geographic footprint, see page 15
for more detail. This is carried out in a
measured and controlled manner as Ultra
continues to focus its resources on a
limited number of regions and sectors,
where it is seeing growth. Over the last
two decades, Ultra has expanded and
developed its international footprint and
now has significant business in Europe,
North America, the Middle East and the
Asia Pacific.
Ultra has operations based in the countries

Market analysis
Ultra’s place in the market
Ultra presents the market with a very wide portfolio of highly-differentiated, specialist capabilities and
innovative technologies, applicable across the Defence & Aerospace, Security & Cyber, Transport
and Energy domains. In often challenging markets, as government customers wrestle with ﬁscal
uncertainties, Ultra works across the Group and with partners, to offer cost-effective, mature, proven
and comprehensive solutions which can best match customer needs and budgets, rather than
presenting a standard product. Through this approach, the Group is increasing market access and
pursuing areas of customers’ preferential spend.  
18 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Within the Group’s established
markets, defence priorities are
shifting from prolonged, 
land-focused “hold and build”
operations back toward the
focused intervention and forward
presence capabilities which
favour maritime, air and special
forces. Defence budgets remain
under pressure, yet the demand
for military readiness or response
remains high, in the face of
threats from terrorism, piracy,
insurgency and regional tensions. 
Emerging doctrine places a signiﬁcant
emphasis on intelligence and surveillance
assets, together with the secure, wideband
connectivity to move data globally and
within theatre, down to individual units for
improved situational awareness. Cyber
protection of this critical data stream, at all
levels, remains a high priority. Forward
operations in high-risk areas continues to
place an emphasis on perimeter surveillance,
defensive and counter-measure systems in 
all war ﬁghting domains. Budget constraints 
are leading to more life extension projects,
phased contract awards and greater
reliance upon established, proven solutions,
tailored to speciﬁc needs. These demands
are well matched by the strengths of Ultra’s
defence portfolio.
USA
The US Government’s Bipartisan Budget
Act of December 2013 moderated
threatened sequester cuts to the total
defence budget in FY14 and FY15.
Nevertheless an 8% and 2% reduction in
the defence investment budget over these
two years will need to be found. The
subsequent appropriations bills saw policy
reﬂected in sustained, or even increased
budgets for intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR), maritime and air
programmes and cuts in land forces (for
example, the Virginia class submarine
programme saw a 20% increase in
funding, while the US Army’s ground
combat vehicle project was reduced to a
demonstration programme). ISR capabilities
will be prioritised, along with capabilities
which counter anti-access and area denial
systems, designed to counter US maritime
and air presence. After a year of budget
uncertainty, including the impacts of
furloughed staff, threatened staff reductions
and even government shutdown, this
greater clarity is welcome. Nevertheless, it
will take several months for budgets to ﬂow
down into contract action and for detailed
areas of reduction to become clear. Ultra
remains well positioned in the areas of
evident programme spend, including
increased investment in anti-submarine
warfare, intelligence data analysis and
secure, high data rate communications.

UK
The UK defence budget remains anchored
upon a core programme with substantial
ﬁnancial contingency, as reiterated in the
Defence Equipment Plan, published in
January 2014, – a process which has won
some much needed headroom. In 2015
the MoD will undertake a Strategic
Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in the
aftermath of a General Election. Fiscal
pressures will undoubtedly remain while
other cost pressures, such as the rising
cost of manpower, will squeeze the
equipment programme, making the
choices made in the 2015 SDSR capability
debate even more critical. Changes to the
MoD equipment customer roles and in the
DE&S structure are still hampering some
programmes. Ultra has beneﬁted from the
improved stability in procurement, most
evident in the nuclear submarine
programme and is well positioned to
deliver capability in priority areas, such as
ISTAR, data links, force protection and
crypto management.
Rest of the world
Australia remains an exciting market for
Ultra. Following the election in Australia,
the government committed to lift defence
spending back to 2% of GDP within a
decade. A new defence white paper is
expected in mid-2015, which will provide
much-needed clarity, but Ultra remains well
positioned in likely areas of spend including
ASW and secure communications. India’s
comprehensive and ambitious defence
modernisation programme provides
opportunity, but progress is hampered by a
taut procurement regime and the impact
of GDP ﬂuctuations on defence funding.
Ultra has built strong partnerships with
major Indian primes in areas of technological
strength, such as high-capacity radios and
ASW, that will facilitate access to this
growing market. Turkey remains a strong
market, despite increasing pressures to
favour its growing indigenous defence
industry. Ultra continues to partner with
Turkish industry to develop the next
generation of torpedo defence in a
programme which demonstrates its long-
term commitment to the region and its
willingness to transfer technology. This
approach has opened up discussions across
the remainder of Ultra’s capability
portfolio. The Middle East remains a
valuable market, primarily through US
foreign military sales and through primes,
yet Ultra is also seeing emerging, direct
opportunities in ASW, vehicle electronics
and communications.

12 3 4 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 21
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
At 23% of Group revenue,
security & cyber is an important
and exciting market for Ultra.
Strong investment in the Group’s
capability portfolio in this area
positions Ultra well to access this
area of strong budget growth
and protected spend.
Budgets for security remain ring-fenced,
or are growing substantially, in the face of
terrorism, organised crime, drug
trafﬁcking and cyber threats. Border
security and critical national infrastructure
protection opportunities are increasing.
Solutions need to be tailored to customer
need, comprehensive and fully integrated,
drawing upon “best of breed”, established
and clearly differentiated technologies.
Ultra’s portfolio approach and access to
well-established partners makes the Group
highly attractive in this space, both in
established markets and other areas of
signiﬁcant interest, such as the Middle
East and Central America. Opportunities
continue to emerge in this rapidly
developing market. For example, an
increasing understanding of the
vulnerability of internet protocol
controlled industrial systems in critical
infrastructure is bringing the Group’s cyber
protection products into new commercial
markets, with access through established
original equipment manufacturers.
Government, commercial and internet
communications and data are increasingly
vulnerable to cyber-attack, leading to a
developing and diverse marketplace with
strong funding. Ultra’s investment in this
area, strong relationships with national
agencies and ability to team with trusted
partners, positions it well for opportunities
in a number of allied countries. While the
commercial market continues to develop,
Ultra is investing substantially in its own
protection, providing a well-regarded
reference capability which can be applied
to third parties. While the Snowden leaks
have suppressed some opportunities, the
demand for intelligence surveillance in
sensitive areas (e.g. borders, global event
sites, critical infrastructures) remains high.

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Growing populations, shifts in
global financial strength,
proliferation of low-cost airlines
and a demand for fuel efficiency
are driving investment in civil
aviation. Increased global air
traffic and shifting financial
power is driving investment in
airport infrastructure. Rail
infrastructure, globally, is growing
even more rapidly as a key
commercial and national enabler
in both established and emerging
economies. Nuclear energy
remains an important part of a
low-carbon energy mix in the
face of growing energy demand.
Commercial aerospace remains a growing
market, with predictions of 6% year-on-
year growth in global air trafﬁc in 2014.
Growth is very strong in emerging markets
(China and the Middle East), but much
weaker in the mature markets of US and
Europe. Drivers for this sustained demand
include air trafﬁc growth and aircraft
replacement to introduce improved fuel
efﬁciency, supported by low interest rates.
Both Boeing and Airbus secured
unprecedented deliveries in 2013, exceeding
2,000 aircraft for the ﬁfth year and they
enjoy record back-logs which, combined,
exceed 10,000 large aircraft orders. Across
the sector, demands for innovative
technologies to improve efﬁciency and
increase safety, play well to Ultra’s
established strengths in control systems and
niche aviation technologies, allowing
inclusion in a growing number of positions
on long-term aerospace programmes.
Airport systems and rail remain areas of
strong investment in response to the
continuing growth in global air trafﬁc. In
established economies, infrastructure
investment is focused on upgrading
existing capabilities and driving economic
recovery. In emerging economies, such
investment is being used to secure growth,
build national capacity and deliver
prestigious projects. With an established
master systems integrator capability and
regional support hub in the Middle East,
Ultra is looking for further opportunities in
the region over the next ﬁve years.
The nuclear energy market continues with
steady growth, despite the setbacks
following the Fukushima disaster. As
national programmes are delayed, there are
increased opportunities in life extension and
safety system improvements. Meanwhile,
the energy debate is driven by growing
capacity demands and low-carbon footprint,
which makes nuclear an important part of
the mix for many countries. Ultra’s
established position in specialist nuclear
sensors, qualiﬁed for most major platform
designs and the Group’s wide-based safety
justiﬁcation and system experience, makes
this a growing market for the Group. Smart
energy is a potential new market for Ultra,
applying its secure communications and
database-handling to government and
commercial energy management.

power stations.
12 3 4 Ultra’s 2013 results
The order book at the end of 2013 was
£781.2m compared with £905.0m
(£895.6m at constant currencies) at the end
of 2012. Within the order book total,
opening ﬁrm order cover for 2014,
compared with analysts’ consensus revenue
forecasts, was 57% (2013: 58%).
Revenue
The revenue of £745.2m represented a
decline of 2.1%, or £15.6m from the prior
year (2012: £760.8m). The positive effects
of foreign exchange on translation of
overseas revenues and the incremental
beneﬁt of acquisitions were outweighed by
a decline in underlying constant currency
revenues of 4.4%.
With approximately 50% of revenues sold
in US dollars, Ultra beneﬁted from a slight
decline in the US dollar rate to 1.56 (2012:
1.59) which increased revenues by 0.6%.
Acquisitions contributed a further 1.7% to
revenue, reﬂecting the full-year effects of
GigaSat, Barron McCann and RFI, which
were acquired in 2012, as well as Varisys
and Wood & Douglas, which were
purchased in 2013.
The organic revenue decline of 4.4%
comprised reductions in two divisions,
Information & Power Systems and Tactical
& Sonar Systems and an increase in
Aircraft & Vehicle Systems.
Reductions in Information & Power Systems
reﬂected primarily the impact on the Group’s
US businesses of the unexpected federal
Government shutdown in October, which
impacted the US procurement process,
delaying expected orders and approvals. In
addition, the reduction in placement of
federal service contracts particularly
impacted ProLogic’s business. Sales from the
Indonesian Fatahillah corvette upgrade and
strong demand for specialist electrical power
management equipment for submarine
programmes, in both the UK and US, helped
offset revenue reductions in the division.
Tactical & Sonar Systems was a mixed
picture. Sales into the UK crypto programme,
in ASW and surveillance systems in the US
were robust. However, this was
overshadowed by a signiﬁcant reduction in
sales of tactical radios, both to the export
and particularly, the domestic US market.
This division was also impacted by the US
federal shutdown in October, together with
US budget cuts and contract delays. Aircraft
& Vehicle Systems sales increased due to the
component design and manufacture of an
Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) radio
contract for the British Army, together with
an increase in sales of Ultra’s specialist
aircraft ice protection systems.
Operating proﬁt and margins*
Underlying operating proﬁt reduced slightly
to £121.7m, with the margin increasing
slightly by 0.3pts to 16.3%. The additional
contribution from acquisitions and
favourable foreign currency translation was
offset by an adverse organic performance.
Aircraft & Vehicle Systems saw continuing
strong margins, in line with the previous
year, reﬂecting lower engineering costs in
the commercial aircraft business and
improved business mix. Tactical & Sonar
Systems saw margins increase from the
previous year, as the decline in the radios
business was offset by signiﬁcant cost
reductions in this area, together with the
strong performance in US ASW and also the
contribution from Litening pods and cryptos
in the UK. Information & Power Systems
margins reduced as a result of the revenue
pressures with, in particular, the sharp
decline in software services at ProLogic
leading to an under-recovery of overheads.
In addition, the Oman IT contract continued
to trade at a lower margin than the division
as a whole. Ultra continues to invest in
research and development to support future
opportunities; this investment, at £43.3m,
represented 5.8% of group turnover.
Acquisitions contributed an additional
£3.5m, primarily reﬂecting the acquisition
of Varisys in June 2013.

Interest and proﬁt before tax*
Net ﬁnancing charges*, excluding the
unwinding of discounts on provisions, fair
value movement on derivatives and the net
interest charge on deﬁned beneﬁt
pensions, were £4.9m (2012: £5.3m). The
reduction reﬂected lower rates following
the renewal of the revolving credit facility in
early 2013. The interest on bank debt was
covered 25 times (2012: 23 times) by
underlying operating proﬁt*.
Underlying proﬁt before tax was £116.8m
(2012: £116.5m).
IFRS proﬁt before tax
Ultra’s IFRS proﬁt before tax fell from
£79.8m (2012) to £49.3m. The principal
reason for the reduction was the £44.2m
impairment of the acquired goodwill
relating to ProLogic. 
A severely constrained budget
environment and reduction in placement
of US service contracts, exacerbated by the
federal shutdown in October, has impacted
ProLogic’s software services business. The
services element of the ProLogic business
has now been restructured and ProLogic’s
products remain a critical element of
Ultra’s crypto capabilities.
The £9m of acquisition related adjustments
included the release of a £9.4m provision
relating to the GigaSat earn out agreement
for which the 2013 target was not met.
Tax, EPS and dividends
The underlying tax rate* reduced to 24.3%
(2012: 25.3%) due to a combination of
lower UK rates and the release of
provisions, following the close of certain
tax enquiries around the world.
Underlying earnings per share* were
127.1p (2012: 125.5p), an increase of
1.3%. A ﬁnal dividend of 29.5p (2012:
27.8p) is proposed. If this is approved at
the Annual General Meeting, this will give
a full-year dividend of 42.2p (2012: 40.0p)
and will be covered 3.0 times.
Operating cash ﬂow
Underlying operating cash ﬂow* was £79.0m
and the ratio of cash to underlying operating
proﬁt was 65%. This represented a reduction
from the £89.6m (74% conversion) recorded
in 2012, due predominantly to the phasing
of working capital movements. The cash to
operating proﬁt ratio over a rolling ﬁve-year
period is 91%, despite sustained investment
in facilities and R&D.
Capital expenditure on property, plant and
equipment was £13.9m, down from
£20.5m in the previous year. The major
expenditure in the year related to: the
acquisition of new facilities for the Precision
Air & Land Systems (PALS) business in
Cheltenham; the development of a Neutron
Flux Detector facility to support long-term
programmes at the Nuclear Controls
Systems (NCS) business in Wimborne and
the creation of Cyber Protection Facilities in

Capital expenditure on intangible assets
(not acquired through acquisitions) was
£7.7m (2012: £4.7m), with the increase
predominantly due to investment to
support the next generation multi-mission
radio, the Remote Crypto Monitoring
System (RCMS) and development of
proximity sensing systems for the Controls
business. Amortisation of the same asset
class was £2.9m (2012: £3.2m).
There was a net outﬂow of working capital
of £32.4m, compared to an outﬂow of
£10.7m in 2012. There was an outﬂow of
inventories of £4.2m (2012: £2.7m) across
a range of businesses, notably in the
Group’s PALS business, to support customer
inspections following the site move, and in
its other aerospace businesses also to
support customer requirements. The
outﬂow for receivables of £43.1m (2012:
£6.0m) and an inﬂow of payables of
£14.9m (2012: £2.0m outﬂow) includes
the impact of an increased debt in Oman,
relating to the prolongation of the Airport
IT project, which was partially offset by an
increase in payables on the project.
Receivables were also impacted by a delay
in payment approvals following the US
shutdown and changes in customer cash
management behaviours.
Non-operating cash ﬂow
From the underlying operating cash ﬂow*
of £79.0m (2012: £89.6m), the Group
funded various non-operating items with
net debt reducing slightly to £42.2m 
(2012: £43.0m). The main non-operating
items were:
• cash tax of £25.6m in line with the
previous year (2012: £25.6m)  
• acquisition spend of £24.7m (2012:
£37.0m) including acquisition fees and

The two acquisitions made in the year
(Varisys and Wood & Douglas) were made
at a total purchase consideration of £26.7m,
including acquisition fees of £0.3m. The
purchase consideration includes cash
acquired of £4.6m.
Banking facilities
Ultra’s current banking facilities amount to
£190m in total, together with a £15m
overdraft. They are provided by a small
club of banks, led by the Royal Bank of
Scotland, and comprise two tranches. The
ﬁrst tranche is a £90m revolving credit
facility, which can be drawn down in any
major currency and is due to expire in
January 2016. The second tranche provides
a further £100m of revolving credit, was
signed in December 2012 and is due to
expire in December 2017. This second
tranche is effectively the renewal of the
£120m facility which was due to expire in
September 2013, but was reﬁnanced early
to ensure continuity of funding. Both
facilities have the same covenants.
The Group also has a ‘shelf’ facility with
Prudential Investment Management Inc
(‘Pricoa’). This agreement effectively gives
the Group access to the US private
placement market on a bilateral basis. The
facility is non-committed, but is for up to
$195m. At 31 December 2013, $70m of
loan notes had been issued, which will
mature in 2018 and 2019. By using the
Pricoa facility, Ultra has been able to extend
the term proﬁle of its debt at a competitive
rate and reduce its current liabilities.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions,
the ﬁnancing facilities are also used for
other balance sheet and operational 
needs, including funding day-to-day
working capital requirements. The US
dollar borrowings also represent natural
hedges against assets denominated in 
that currency.  
At the year-end, the total borrowings drawn
from the revolving facilities were £27.0m
(2012: £29.2m), giving headroom of
£163.0m (2012: £180.8m) in addition to
the £15m overdraft. £42.4m (2012: £43.3m)
of Pricoa loan notes had been issued. The
Group also held £30.6m of cash, which
was held for working capital purposes and
to fund acquisitions.
Interest rate management
Much of the Group’s current ﬁnancing has
been taken on to fund acquisitions in 
North America. To reduce the risks
associated with interest rate ﬂuctuations
and the associated volatility in reported
earnings, Ultra has issued a total of $70m
of ﬁxed-rate, seven-year, notes to Pricoa.
Consequently, the Group has extended the
term proﬁle of its debt and has also ﬁxed a
substantial proportion of its interest for the
same seven-year period. The amount of
ﬁxed-term debt and the associated interest
rate policy is kept under regular review.
91%
The cash to operating proﬁt
ratio over a rolling ﬁve-year 
period is 91% (2012: 98%)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Pensions
Ultra offers company-funded retirement
beneﬁts to all employees in its major
countries of operation. Many UK staff with
longer service still participate in the Ultra
Electronics Limited deﬁned beneﬁt scheme,
which was closed to new entrants in 2003.
This is a contributory scheme in which the
company makes the largest element of the
payments, which are topped up by
employee contributions. The scheme was
actuarially assessed, using the projected unit
method at 31 December 2013, when the
net scheme deﬁcit, calculated in accordance
with IAS19, was £68.2m, compared to
£63.2m in 2012. The present value of the
liabilities rose by £34.8m in 2013, mainly
because of the lower discount rate, driven
by the lower yield on corporate bonds. The
increase in the scheme liabilities was
partially offset by a £31.6m increase in the
value of the scheme assets.
There was a full actuarial assessment
carried out as of April 2013, the result of
which was a funding deﬁcit relating to past
service of £99.8m before tax, representing
an increase of £36.2m from the previous
funding deﬁcit. Following the completion
of the assessment, Ultra reached
agreement with the pension scheme
trustee board to eliminate the deﬁcit
through additional deﬁcit payments over a
10.5 year period; £8.0m in 2014, rising to
£8.5m in 2015 and £9.0m for the following
8.5 years. The next valuation will take place
as of April 2016.
The scheme has a statement of investment
principles which includes a speciﬁc
declaration on socially responsible
investment. This is delegated to the
investment managers. Pension
management and governance is
undertaken by the pension trustees on
behalf of the members. The trustees
include both company-nominated and
employee-elected representatives.
All staff who have joined Ultra in the UK
since the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was
closed in 2003, have been invited to
become members of the Ultra Electronics
Group Personal Pension Plan and since
April 2011, the Ultra Electronics Group
Flexible Retirement Plan. Under the terms
of this deﬁned contribution scheme,
company payments are supplemented by
contributions from employees.
Certain employees at TCS in Canada
participate in a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. This
scheme is closed to new employees and had
an IAS19 net deﬁcit of £0.6m at the end of
the year (2012: £0.7m). Regular payments
continue to be made, with both company
and employees making contributions, so as
to maintain a satisfactory funding position.
The Group’s remaining Canadian employees
participate in a number of deﬁned
contribution pension plans. In the US, Ultra
offers a deﬁned contribution 401(k)
retirement beneﬁt plan to all full-time
employees. Under this plan, Ultra provides
participating and contributing employees
with matching contributions, subject to plan
and US Internal Revenue Service limitations.
Foreign exchange risks
Ultra’s results are affected by both the
translation and transaction effects of
foreign currency movements. By their
nature, currency translation risks cannot be
mitigated, but the transaction position is
actively managed. 
The majority of sales made by Ultra’s
businesses are made in local currency, thus
avoiding any transaction risk. However, this
risk does arise when businesses make sales
and purchases which are denominated in
foreign currencies, most often in US dollars.
To reduce the potential volatility, Ultra
attempts to source, in US dollars, a high
proportion of the product sold in US dollars.
For the remaining net expense, the Group’s
policy is to hedge forward the foreign
currency trading exposure in order to
increase certainty. The expected ﬂows are
reviewed on a regular basis and additional
layers of cover are taken out so that, for
2014, 100% of the expected exposure is
covered, reducing to 30% of the exposure
for 2016. Exposure to other currencies is
hedged as it arises on speciﬁc contracts.

Aircraft & Vehicle Systems
In September 2013, Ultra’s Precision Air & Land Systems business was awarded a study contract to
propose a ﬂammability reduction system for the fuel system of a new passenger aircraft in
development. The study helps the client address the changing FAA regulations to meet the stricter
new ﬂeet-wide ﬂammability design requirements, as part of a continual drive to improve ﬂight safety.
Ultra’s solution addresses regulatory and safety requirements and at the same time, satisﬁes
manufacturers’ and airlines’ needs for lighter, fuel-efﬁcient and cost-effective aircraft sub-systems.

The division specialises in high integrity,
safety-critical, real-time control systems for
aircraft and vehicle applications. These
include airframe and engine ice
protection, power distribution and control
equipment and noise and vibration
cancellation systems. The Group also
supplies advanced human-machine
interfaces and systems, including those 
to control unmanned ground and air
vehicles. Ultra provides innovative small
power sources, including miniature
pneumatic systems, propane-powered fuel
cells and multi-fuel UAV engines.
Revenue in the period was lifted by
increased sales in Ultra’s specialist ice
protection systems business and by a short-
term UOR radio contract for the British
Army, as a well as a positive contribution
from the Varisys acquisition.
Underlying operating proﬁt reﬂected a good
contribution from the UOR, ice protection
sales and the Airbus A400M cargo handling
system, as well as operational efﬁciencies
from the site move by Ultra’s Precision Air 
& Land Systems business. These factors
more than offset the negative impacts of
the under-recovery of overheads and labour
from the fuel cell business as a result of
delayed UAV orders. These factors,
together with lower R&D costs at this point
in the division’s development cycle, enabled
the operating margin to be sustained at
20.8% (2012: 20.8%*). 
The increase in the order book reﬂected
the receipt of the delayed Lockheed 
Martin Warrior contract in the second half
of the year.
Highlights of activities in the year 
which will underpin the division’s
future performance included:  
• a £26.3m contract awarded by Lockheed
Martin UK under the Warrior Capability
Sustainment Programme for the
development of a new power
distribution system for the British Army’s
Warrior armoured ﬁghting vehicle
• Ultra’s teaming partner Raytheon
winning the US Joint Miniature
Munitions Bomb Release Unit. Ultra’s
work share will include the provision of
the complete stored energy system.
Contract award is expected in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2014
• the award of an exclusive long-term
supply agreement with Pratt & Whitney
for the electronic control unit which
manages the Electrical Ice Protection
System on the Joint Strike Fighter’s 
F-135 engine. The agreement is effective
for the life of the engine programme
Strategy in action…
Ultra’s AMI business is working with partners across the United States to develop
innovative power solutions which provide critical power backup to traffic intersections.
First responders are often trapped in the traffic jams, caused by the power outages,
and the signal crews are often left trapped themselves, unable to reach the signal to
restore power or reset the signal. In 2013 during trials in Houston, the city
experienced a major storm, which resulted in power outages across the city. Those
traffic intersections fitted with Ultra’s fuel cell as a backup power source, remained
operational throughout this period, minimising the time first responders were delayed
in traffic jams and maintaining the safety and integrity of the transportation system.

Information & Power Systems
In June 2013, Ultra’s Nuclear Control Systems business was awarded a £16.1m contract for the
supply of specialist instrumentation by EDF Energy. Under this contract, Ultra will manufacture and
support safety-critical nuclear reactor instrumentation for use in EDF Energy’s current UK nuclear power
stations. This is the ﬁrst contract to beneﬁt from Ultra’s recent investment in a new state-of-the-art
nuclear instrumentation manufacturing facility. Ultra is a supplier of nuclear-qualiﬁed instrumentation
and control systems to key nuclear plant manufacturers and operators around the world. It currently
supplies safety-based equipment to 186 reactors in 16 countries.

The division supplies advanced command
and control systems for battlespace
visualisation, surveillance systems, air
defence and naval combat management.
The Group provides: perimeter security
solutions for critical infrastructure; crisis
response planning and management
software and secure networks. Ultra’s high-
integrity sensors and control systems are
used for civil and military nuclear reactors
and a range of specialist, solid-state
electrical power systems which are used for
naval vessels and mass transit. Ultra is a
world-leading integrator of airport and
airline management & information systems.
Revenue in this division was reduced by
delays in the federal procurement process,
impacting expected orders, milestone
approvals and payments and further
exacerbated by the unexpected US
Government shutdown. The reduction in the
placement of US service contracts particularly
impacted ProLogic’s business. Sales from the
Indonesian Fatahillah corvette upgrade and
strong demand for specialist electrical power
management equipment for submarine
programmes in both the UK and US helped
offset revenue reductions in the division.
The underlying operating proﬁt reduction
largely reﬂects revenue pressures. In
particular the sharp decline in software
services at ProLogic led to an under-recovery
of overheads. The divisional margin reduced
to 13.5% (2012: 14.2%*) with the Oman
airport IT contract continuing to trade at a
lower margin than the division as a whole.
The order book reduced at the end of the
period reﬂecting the trading of the Oman
Airport IT contract, US order intake delays
and foreign exchange translation.
Highlights of activities in the year 
which will underpin the division’s
future performance included:  
• a £16.1m contract for the supply of
specialist instrumentation to EDF Energy.
Under this contract Ultra will manufacture
and support safety-critical nuclear reactor
instrumentation for use in EDF Energy’s
current UK nuclear power stations
• a contract to supply specialist electrical
power management systems and

Strategy in action…
Ultra’s Airport Systems business, following a five-year contract renewal in 2013, 
has upgraded its successful UltraTrak Baggage Management System, hosted in
Johannesburg, South Africa. The renewal until 2018 guarantees enhanced airline
security and improved business performance through UltraTrak’s powerful
reconciliation, tracking and reporting capabilities. UltraTrak has been used in South
Africa since 2008, having originally been deployed in Johannesburg, with hosted
operations via WAN at Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth airports. The operational
efficiency benefits it delivered drove expansion of the system into 3 further airports:
Bloemfontein, George and East London. UltraTrak results in improvement to the 
service offered to customers by the airlines and reduced delays for the airlines.

Tactical & Sonar Systems
In September 2013, Ultra’s Maritime Systems business announced the award of funding from
Industry Canada’s Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative (SADI). This long-term funding allowed
Maritime Systems to kick off a six-year $27.4m internal R&D project which will enable it to leapfrog its
international competitors in the fast-growing military towed low-frequency active-passive sonar market.
The products developed under this project will introduce next-generation acoustic sensing, data
transport, and acoustic projector technologies, culminating with an in-ﬁeld demonstration capability
which Ultra can use to showcase this Canadian technology to its international customers.

The period saw good sales in the US for
ASW, a strong performance on a UK crypto
programme and further sales of surveillance
systems in both the UK and US, which
partially offset the continued lower sales of
tactical radios and the impact of US budget
cuts and contract delays.
The increase in underlying operating proﬁt
was driven by the performance of the UK
cryptographic programme with
development and production risks being
retired as the programme is delivered. This,
together with good contributions from the
sales of Litening pods in the UK and ASW
sales in the US, resulted in the division’s
underlying operating margin increasing to
16.9% (2012: 15.5%*). 
The order book reduction reﬂected the
trading of the End Cryptographic Unit
Replacement Programme (ECU RP)
contract and US order intake delays, with
the balance largely due to foreign
exchange translation. This division also saw
increased use by customers of IDIQs and
annual ‘call-off’ contract awards which are
not reﬂected in the order book.

• a £14m contract extension to its End
Cryptographic Unit Replacement
Programme (ECU RP) for the integration

• a A$15m contract for the upgrade of
the ANZAC Class Electronic Support
System for the Royal Australian Navy
• an increase in ASW spend reﬂecting the
US ‘Pivot to the Paciﬁc’ policy. The US
Navy has recently issued a ﬁve-year IDIQ
competitive tender, for which Ultra,
through its JV, was the only bidder.
Contract award is expected in the ﬁrst

Strategy in action…
Ultra’s Tactical Communications Systems business has won an order to supply a
number of next generation high-capacity radios, for “proof of concept” trials with the
US Army, as a precursor to additional WIN-T contracts. This new multi-mission radio
(MMR) is the culmination of Ultra’s considerable investment and delivers a radio which
combines high-bandwidth throughput, performance and operational flexibility within
a small form-factor and provides multi-channel high-capacity connectivity across
networks. In addition to trials with the US Army, the radio has also been successfully
down-selected to compete in trials for a number of major overseas customers.

Risk is identiﬁed, collated, assessed and managed at the most appropriate level of the business (Board,
Executive or Business level) as part of the annual strategic planning round. Resulting risks are reviewed
regularly to ensure that appropriate mitigations are in place.
Ultra encourages its businesses to challenge the market through innovation and to
exhibit audacity. Proﬁtable growth is not achieved without considered risk, so review
of business activity and the management of resultant risk has become an integral
part of Ultra’s processes. Risks are considered and managed as business decisions
are made, so that the Group’s collective exposure is well understood and controlled.

Description
There is now substantial evidence
that active efforts are being made to
penetrate Ultra’s secure networks, in
order to gain access to classiﬁed
information, steal intellectual
property or disrupt business activity.
There is a security and business risk if
Ultra fails to secure its systems.
Potential impact
• Reputational damage to Ultra as a highly-
regarded provider of secure data systems
• Loss of business opportunity with
removal of government approval to
work on classiﬁed equipment
development and manufacture
• Reduced product differentiation with
loss of intellectual property
• Disruption to business activity as
systems are cleansed and restored
Mitigation 
• Implementation of a comprehensive
Group Information Security Policy and
signiﬁcant further investment in the
hardening of all Ultra’s IT systems,
enforced through internal audit 
• Development of the Group’s ability to
monitor systems and detect intrusion
attempts will continue through 2014
Risk 1. Cyber-attack (Probability – High)
Description
Ultra’s core markets are changing as
government budgets come under
ﬁscal pressures, placing signiﬁcant
pressure on sales and orders. Contract
awards are more heavily scrutinised
and are more dependent on a close
understanding of the customer need. 
Potential impact
• Reduced business opportunity through
an inability to respond quickly enough to
changes in the market environment, by
adapting our offerings and approach
• Inability to match the full range of a
customer’s requirements
• Inability to maintain growth in declining
defence markets
Mitigation 
• Introduction of LAUNCH behaviours (see
page 7) to improve understanding of
customer need
• Present a capability portfolio which can
be applied to meet customer need,
complemented by a structure and culture
which promotes agility, innovation and
speed of response
• Develop and strengthen the marketing
teams within each business
• Collaborate across the full Ultra capability
portfolio and/or partner, to present
comprehensive solutions which match
customer needs
Risk 2. Changing market environment (Probability – High)
Description
Ultra’s product development and
innovation does not sustain sufﬁcient
differentiation in the market place,
compared with commercial-off-the-
shelf (COTS) products, or as a result
of a disruptive technology, or
because of a signiﬁcant change in
customer preference. 
Potential impact
• Research and development (R&D) 
activity does not keep pace with
technological development, losing
product differentiation compared 
with competitors
• Ultra’s portfolio of specialist capabilities 
is eroded through commoditisation
• Business is lost through increasing
competition
Mitigation 
• Maintain Ultra’s cultural focus on
understanding customer need and
delivering innovation
• Based upon comprehensive market and
competitor analysis, generate technology
and product roadmaps which bring
differentiated products to market to
meet sales opportunities
• Better co-ordinate R&D investment
across the Group to avoid duplication
and maximise advantage
• Employ strategy reviews and game-
planning to ensure R&D tracks plans
and budgets

enhance market position in key
markets. Changes in local regulation,
or other cause, leads to an adverse
impact on the Group.
Potential impact
• Inability to exercise management
control could lead to an adverse impact
on the Group
Mitigation 
• Ultra works hard to ensure that its joint
venture partners and the members of
the Group’s security and proxy boards
accord with the Group’s corporate
culture and way of doing business
• Ultra beneﬁts from the expertise which
the members of its JVs and boards
bring to the Group
• Ensure relationships continue to be

Risk 5. Business control (Probability – Low)
Description
The Group’s UK-deﬁned beneﬁt
pension scheme deﬁcit becomes a
serious liability for the Group.
Potential impact
• Increasing pension liabilities make a
material impact on shareholder value
Mitigation 
• The Board will remain focused on this
key issue and holds formal reviews of
the Group’s pension strategy annually
• Manage the issue through annual
accounting and triennial valuation
processes, in order to highlight issues 
to the Board as they emerge
• Retain an external pension strategy
advisor and hold regular, formal Board
strategy reviews
Risk 6: Pensions (Probability – Medium)
Description
Ultra is bidding for and delivering 
an increasing number of large and 
complex contracts. 
Potential Impact
• Ultra could underestimate the required
resource or project complexity and so,
make a loss
• Ultra could fail to apply the appropriate
programme management skills to 
such large products, impacting on
proﬁtability and reputation
Mitigation 
• The Group Operating Manual has been
updated to enhance the rigour and
oversight of major bids 
• Ultra has conducted rigorous ‘lessons
learned’ processes across recent large
programmes
• Where the complexity of the programme
demands, Ultra will recruit or team to
bring in the specialist skills required to
manage large projects
• Introduction of speciﬁc project team-
based system engineering and project
management training
• Review of win strategies and bids by
experienced executives independent of

empower individual businesses to remain
autonomous and agile, while encouraging
collaboration where appropriate
• Develop the organisation structure in a
way which preserves the autonomy and
agility of the businesses
• Reinforce the LEAP and LAUNCH
behaviours which embody the Group’s
culture and select by Lominger criteria
• Integrate acquisitions in order to
embed Ultra culture and practices
• Use surveys (YOURviews and 
Best Companies) to measure culture
and improve
Risk 8. Ultra culture (Probability – Medium)
Description
Entry into new markets is necessary
to maintain growth, but they often
have very different, unfamiliar
procurement processes and
constraints. These are also more
likely to require mature products,
delivered as packaged capabilities
rather than individual products.
Potential impact
• Ultra fails to fully understand the
commercial practices and market
dynamics of the new regions it is
entering, so loses business opportunities
while expending resource on presence
Mitigation 
• Engage closely with UKTI and
Embassies to improve local knowledge 
• Access consultants, local legal expertise
and research to better understand
target regions 
• Use of Regional Marketing Managers 
• Develop sound regional partnerships in
developing markets to meet offset
needs, while maintaining product
differentiation and proﬁtability
• Develop lessons learnt from Turkey,
Oman, Australia and brief to the 
wider Group
Risk 9. New markets (Probability – Medium)
Description
The Group’s businesses are 
capital-light, but specialist
knowledge-intensive. Ultra fails 
to attract, develop and retain 
people with the required specialist
competences.
For more information on Ultra’s human
resources initiatives, see pages 40 to 43.
Potential impact
• Ultra could lose key staff or
capabilities, so that the Group cannot
fulfill its contractual obligations, or is
forced to outsource work, thereby
reducing margins
Mitigation 
• Continue the Group’s strong emphasis
on recruiting, retaining and developing
high-quality individuals to work in Ultra
teams. This is delivered through the
annual OSDP (Organisation, Succession
and Development Planning) process
• Fast-track high-potential candidates and
exploit opportunities for secondments
and inter-business transfers
• Ensure all key staff have a nominated
successor 
• Ensure poor performance is addressed
• Monitor and review salary and beneﬁts
surveys
• Engage with potential recruits at an
early stage, through links with schools
and universities and offer
apprenticeships, work placements and
graduate training

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Making a difference
Ultra recognises that the long-term success of the Group will be enhanced through continuous 
focus on value creation for ALL its stakeholders: shareholders, customers, employees, local communities,
the environment and suppliers. 
Making a difference…
to Shareholders:
Ultra aims to extend its long track record
of delivering above-average shareholder
returns. The Group’s primary objective is
to continue to outperform the market by
delivering above-average increases in
earnings and by communicating
effectively with shareholders and the
financial community. 
to Customers:
Ultra aims to be an excellent strategic
supplier to its customers. To do so, Ultra’s
businesses are focused on helping
customers identify their true needs whilst,
developing long-term relationships, based
on performance excellence and meeting its
commitments. As evidence of this
approach, today, Ultra’s businesses have
built long-term, mutually beneﬁcial
relationships with their customers and
have become part of the customers’
extended enterprises. Examples from 2013
highlight Ultra’s commitments to its broad
customer base:
• Engineers from Ultra’s Sonar Systems
business supported three major Royal
Navy exercises in the Gulf in 2013. Sonar
Systems received letters of commendation
from the Royal Navy for its support of
these exercises, as well as other initiatives
during the year
• Ultra’s GigaSat business, a global provider
of mobile and ﬂy-away satellite stations,
has customers in 70 countries. To support
these customers, GigaSat has instituted a
“follow the sun” policy, offering global
customers 24/7 access to technical
support, with calls being routed to
support teams in the US, UK, Australia
and the Phillippines. The backstop for the
system is GigaSat’s Technical Director, to
whom calls are routed to ensure that
customer questions are answered.
GigaSat received the Queen’s Award for
Enterprise for creating local employment
• Ultra’s Airport Systems and Ithra
businesses, between them, support more
than 180 airports around the globe.
Airport Systems’ and Ithra’s customers
include private companies, as well as
governments, which have vested
interests in generating local employment.
In 2013, Airport Systems hired local team
members in Brazil, Oman and China,
facilitating local skills transfer
to Employees:
Ultra’s ability to innovate to meet customer
needs is based on the skills and capabilities
of its employees. Ultra believes that the
right people are its most important asset.
Ultra is committed to developing people
and securing the talent pipeline to ensure
the Group’s continuing growth and success.
Group initiatives for talent development
and retention are detailed in the section on
Developing Ultra’s People on pages 40 to
43. However, ultimate responsibility for
individual talent development resides
within Ultra’s businesses, a number of
which have launched unique initiatives to
ensure continuing employee development. 
A few examples include:
• Ultra’s 3eTI business held an Engineering
Challenge in 2013 to identify new
product opportunities. Structured as a
competitive challenge, the initiative
enabled employees to creatively develop
new technology concepts. One product
was identiﬁed to be taken to market. The
employee received a commendation for
his efforts. This same business runs “3eTI
University”, which provides consistent
training to its employees on subjects
ranging from project management to
ﬁnance and accounting
• Ultra’s Advanced Tactical Systems (ATS)
business is known throughout the Ultra
Group for its purpose-driven leadership.
ATS has the following to say about its
unique operational model: “We believe
that employee engagement is driven
largely by a sense of purpose. As such, our
most important value is to ‘Put the
warﬁghter ﬁrst’. Our employees
understand that what we do really matters
to our customers. Along with a sense of
purpose, we strive to give the employees
as much autonomy as possible.”
• Ultra’s PMES business periodically
presents its “Above & Beyond Awards”
to employees who have exceeded
expectations. This employee recognition
has served to create a cohesive
community within the business  *STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths)
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 39
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
in the Community:
Ultra’s businesses are active and engaged
corporate stewards in their local
communities. In 2013, Ultra’s businesses
collectively raised in excess of £100,000 for
non-proﬁt organisations around the globe.
Many of the businesses have formed
special relationships with education
institutes in their surrounding communities:
hosting company visits, offering graduate
training programmes, helping with school
science fairs and taking part in the broader
dialogue on STEM* education. Each
operating business has its own locally-
managed charitable budget, which it
directs to maintain and grow connections
with its local community. The Group
encourages and supports employees who
undertake voluntary work in the local
community or at national levels. Some
noteworthy examples in 2013 include:
• Ultra’s Maritime Systems business, based
in Nova Scotia, Canada focuses its
charitable efforts on the “Feeding Others
Of Dartmouth” non-proﬁt organisation.
Maritime Systems conducted numerous
fund-raising activities throughout the
year to support this charity and
contributed approximately C$5,000 in
2013. The business also fund-raises for
prostate and breast cancer, Salvation
Army Christmas and Military Families
Fund, which yielded another C$5,000 in
charitable donations
• Ultra’s PMES business raised over
£17,000 in 2013 for charitable causes.
Local causes include St Giles Hospice, 
St Joseph’s & Etheldreda Church in
Rugeley and Birmingham Children’s
Hospital. National causes include Whizz
Kids, Cancer Research, Marie Curie
Cancer Care, Help for Heroes, Children
in Need and The Princes Trust. Events
have included: Climbing Mt Everest, the
Palace to Palace Cycle Ride, the 
London Marathon, Keswick to Barrow
Walk, as well as various rafﬂes, sales,
quizzes and events
• Ultra’s AMI business, located in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, is well known in that
University town for its contributions to
the local entrepreneurial community. AMI
supports the University of Michigan
Center for Entrepreneurships and
participates in AA Spark, an organisation
dedicated to the economic prosperity of
the greater Ann Arbor region
to the Environment:
Ultra recognises that effective measures
need to be taken to minimise the
environmental impact of its activities. In
2013, Ultra launched a pilot programme
with the Carbon Trust, to assess the
environmental impact of its Loudwater, UK
operating businesses. The study identiﬁed
opportunities for reducing the
environmental performance of the
Loudwater site, while identifying material
cost-savings which will beneﬁt
shareholders. On the back of this pilot
programme, Ultra will survey additional
sites in 2014. 
Ultra has committed to substantial
investments in manufacturing facilities
which will offer increased efﬁciencies and
reduce energy consumption, while
improving productivity across the business. 
to Suppliers:
Ultra considers its suppliers to be part of
the extended Ultra enterprise. Ultra’s
businesses are reliant on their suppliers to
help to deliver the complex products and
services, many of which are safety- or
performance-critical in their end markets.
Ultra is focused on delivering innovative
and differentiated solutions which can only
be generated through working in
partnership with suppliers and customers.

Developing Ultra’s people 
The success Ultra achieves in innovating to meet customer needs, is based on the broad range of skills
and capabilities of the Group’s employees. Ultra recognises this and is committed to having an efﬁcient
organisation, with engaged and competent people.
Culture
Ultra deﬁnes its culture as the values, role
models, processes, procedures and
behaviours of its employees which drive
the Group’s success. Many individuals join
the Ultra team each year, through organic
growth, natural staff turnover and
acquisitions. Ultra is committed to ensuring
that its culture is not diluted as the Group
grows. The Group’s culture, values and
behaviours are shaped by the strategic
tenets, described on pages 12 and 13,
with the ﬁfth tenet calling for “an 
efﬁcient organisation with engaged and
competent people”. To achieve this, Ultra
has identiﬁed four cultural behaviours of
its people which are highly valued and
encouraged. These are leadership,
entrepreneurship, audacity and paranoia.
Together, they are known within the 
Group as LEAP. 
Further information on LEAP can be found
on page 10.
What people mean to Ultra
The success Ultra achieves in innovating to
meet customer needs, is based on the
broad range of skills and capabilities of its
employees. All managers in Ultra work
towards the aim of delivering an efﬁcient
organisation, with engaged and committed
people to meet the Group’s business
commitments. It is vital to the continuing
growth and success of Ultra that the quality
of the leadership teams is constantly
improved. Many companies state that their
people are the company’s most important
asset. Ultra varies this slightly: the Group’s
‘right people’ are its most important asset.
Growth through engagement 
An additional complementary set of
behaviours, called LAUNCH, was
introduced. These behaviours are designed
speciﬁcally to support improved customer
relationship building. 
LAUNCH is a way for Ultra’s businesses to
generate more opportunities and
ultimately, to deliver increased growth
through enhanced customer engagement.
Further information on LAUNCH can be
found on page 7.
Continuing to ensure that Ultra has positively
engaged people, is a key factor in driving the
performance of the Group forward and Ultra
businesses provide a diverse range of
opportunities for their employees to become
involved with the local community. See
page 39 (in the community).

ensuring that its culture 
is not diluted as the 
Group grows
Continuing to ensure that Ultra has positively engaged
people, is a key factor in driving forward the performance
of the Group… Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 41
Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Succession planning and retention
To ensure that Ultra has the right people in
the right place in the organisation, each of
Ultra’s businesses prepares an annual
‘organisation, succession and development
plan’. In this, individuals are assessed
against their performance in their current
role and their potential to perform a larger
role in the short or longer term. This
assessment is recorded in Ultra’s Talent &
Succession system and gives a ‘performance
versus potential’ rating for each employee.
It recognises that any role within Ultra may
become more challenging as the business
grows and so, the business needs to
ensure a supply of suitable talent is
available when required. Equal attention is
given to enhancing the performance and
retention of those individuals throughout
the organisation, who meet and exceed
standard performance levels and to
addressing the challenges of the people
who fall into the ‘partially meet’ or ‘does
not meet’ categories for performance. This
does not always mean that those
individuals must leave Ultra; it often means
that they need to be placed in a role, more
suited to their talents and in which they
can start to perform to the expected
standards of the business. Ultra has
achieved high retention rates of those
individuals on the business senior
management teams, who are continually
meeting or exceeding expectations in
terms of their performance, or who are
high-potential and still developing in their
new role. By developing and retaining the
identiﬁed high potential individuals, the
Group is creating its next generation of
business leaders, who will be able to take
up the challenge of continuing the growth
and expansion of Ultra.
The succession planning element of the
process aims to ensure that there are
suitable successors for all the management
team roles across each business and for
other senior level roles. Ultra has, as a result,
been able to appoint a high proportion of its
leaders at Board, divisional and business
levels, through internal promotion.
Businesses must also make sure that the
talent pool is deep enough to cope with
these internal appointments. Therefore, as
well as the people listed as successors, each
business also identiﬁes people with high
potential. The combined list represents
Ultra’s ‘high-ﬂyer’ talent pool and is used
regularly to ﬁnd the right people to ﬁll
internal vacancies, via the Group’s online
Talent & Succession system. In a typical
year, Ultra recruits over 600 new
employees. Over and above this,
acquisitions bring new people into the
Ultra team. Ultra businesses attend a large
number of graduate and undergraduate
fairs, utilising current graduates as the
Group’s ambassadors. Attendance has
seen applications for graduate schemes
increase and this in turn, helps to ensure
that there is a future supply of engineers
for the Group.

Training and development
Ultra actively supports and invests 
in training and development, linked to
business needs. Each business is
responsible for identifying the training
needs of its employees and managing its
own training budget. This typically takes
place through individual employee
performance and development reviews,
which are held at least annually. Ultra has
its Learning Academy, an online portal,
available to all of the Group’s businesses,
which enables the scheduling of training,
hosts online courses and retains the
training records of Ultra’s employees. 
Speciﬁc training programmes are provided
for individuals as necessary. In 2013, over
25 different in-house training courses were
run in the UK and in North America. Many
of these are courses tailored to the speciﬁc
requirements of Ultra and the trainers have
an intimate knowledge of how the Group
operates across all its businesses. These
training events include programmes on
leadership and management, along with
workshops on Ultra’s successful competitive
strategy, strategic selling, programme
management and systems engineering. The
Group’s employees in Oman partnered with
Oman Sail, to take part in a three-day
leadership and development course.
Although based around sailing, the course
focused on the strategic, physical and
mental activities, critical to the development
of leadership and proved extremely valuable
to both the employees and the business.
Ultra’s businesses have developed corporate
partnerships with engineering institutions,
including the Institution of Engineering
and Technology, in order to support and
encourage employees to pursue professional
recognition (in the form of CEng, IEng, or
EngTech status) for both their current and
previous work and academic achievements.
Opportunity to participate in national
schemes, such as the Engineering
Education Scheme (run by the Engineering
Development Trust) and competitions
promoting STEM* careers, gives students
access to real-life current work challenges
and enables Ultra employees to develop
their management and leadership skills.
Securing the talent pipeline
Ultra has been committed to developing
people ever since it was formed in 1993
and has a number of programmes which
help the Group to attract the best people,
as well as encouraging students to develop
careers in engineering or business. Examples
of how Ultra businesses do this are:
• Ultra businesses have formed special
relationships with schools in their
surrounding communities, hosting
company visits, helping with school
science fairs and providing work
experience opportunities. Success stories
have seen school work experience
students return to Ultra for paid vacation
work, be sponsored through their
university degree, complete their
undergraduate placement year and then
begin work as a graduate for the Group 
• Ultra has sponsored students through
their last years at school. This provides
students with support and mentoring
during their studies and has led to
students electing to undertake STEM
degree courses
• Many Ultra businesses have well
established and successful
apprenticeship programmes, which 
have gone on to provide the Group 
with engineering leaders
Engineering Education
Schemes case study
A four-strong student team, with the
support of Ultra’s staff, was set the task
of making and testing a dynamic
pneumatic hinge. The students were
challenged to design a joint which
could be dynamic at -40˚C and achieve
250,000 cycles, extending and
contracting through an angular motion
of 90 degrees, while containing dry air
at a pressure of 350bar. 
The students completed a design for
the joint, which included looking at
electrical and hydraulic connections
across the hinge. They then used
Computer Aided Design tools to model
its components and to create
animation of the joint moving
dynamically. The design was then
partially prototyped, through use of 3D
printing. With the support of Ultra’s
recent graduate engineers, a bespoke
rig was developed and built, allowing
the students to complete the testing
of the design ahead of issuing their
final report.

Sustainability 
Ultra believes that a successful and sustainable business is built on more than just ﬁnancial results. Ultra
has a long, consistent track record of development and growth and has built a reputation for meeting
its commitments. This reputation is based on Ultra’s businesses meeting their obligations and on the
manner in which they do so.
Ultra is committed to maintaining high
standards of business ethics. The Group’s
corporate responsibility initiatives are
focused in the following key areas:
• Human rights
• Diversity and inclusion
• Ethical business conduct
• Health and safety
• Environment
Human rights
Ultra acknowledges the UN Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights
and adheres to all relevant government
guidelines, designed to ensure that its
products are not incorporated into weapons
or other equipment used for the purposes of
terrorism, internal repression or the abuse of
human rights. Ultra’s Board requires that the
Group should, at all times, be a responsible
corporate citizen and, as such, the Group
complies with all applicable legislation in
the countries in which it operates.
Diversity and inclusion
Ultra is committed to maintaining a work
environment which provides equal
opportunities for all employees, regardless
of nationality, gender, ethnic background,
sexual orientation, religious beliefs, marital
status, disability or age. The Group
complies with all applicable employment
rights and legislation in the countries in
which it operates.
Ultra uses rigorous recruiting practices to
ensure the best candidate is selected, based
on objective requirements and assessments.
Ultra monitors gender and age diversity.  
Ethical business conduct
Ultra is committed to ethical business
conduct. In this regard, the Group: 
• complies with legal and ethical standards
in all countries in which it operates
• provides guidance and training to
employees
• has the beneﬁt of an independent Ethics
Overview Committee which offers advice
and guidance 
Meeting legal and ethical standards
Ultra requires all employees, businesses and
third parties, who act on Ultra’s behalf, to
comply fully with the Group’s standards of
business ethics and with the applicable laws
and regulations of the countries in which it
does business. 
Ultra is committed to operating in
accordance with all legislative requirements,
including those pertaining to anti-bribery and
corruption practices, relevant national export
control regulations and competition and
anti-trust laws.
Ultra has a corporate ethics policy, which
encompasses a gifts and hospitality policy.

Providing guidance and training 
to employees
The Group has continued to strengthen
its policies, processes and training to
ensure employees have the clear guidance
they need in identifying and managing
ethical matters.
A Group-wide independent, conﬁdential
web- and telephone-based hotline
anonymously enables all employees to
report concerns about possible
improprieties and other compliance issues.  
Reports made to the hotline are compiled
by the independent operator and
forwarded to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee (or for US businesses,
forwarded to the Directors of the Special
Security Arrangement Board or Proxy
Board as appropriate) for action. Any
employee found to be in breach of the
ethics policy is subject to appropriate
disciplinary action.
Independent Ethics Overview Committee
An independent Ethics Overview
Committee provides independent guidance,
advice to, and scrutiny of Ultra’s businesses.
The Committee provides assurance that
Ultra’s business is being conducted in line
with the Group’s policies, processes and in
accordance with relevant legislation. It does
this through discussions with senior
managers, receiving reports and visits to
Ultra businesses.
The Committee comprises six permanent
members, three of whom, including the
Chairman, are independent. To maintain
the highest degree of impartiality, the
independent members of the Committee
are self-selecting. The appointment of the
Chairman is also exclusively within the
remit of the independent members.
Health and safety
Ultra’s commitment to the safety and 
well-being of the Group’s employees and
visitors is a key priority. A healthy,
committed workforce, working in a safe
environment, is necessary to achieve
superior business results. Across the
Group, the businesses manage a wide
range of safety risks. These range from
ofﬁce employees, manufacturing
employees and employees providing
services at customer sites, including
military bases and platforms.
The safety of the products and services
provided to users and customers is also of
key importance to Ultra. The individual
operating businesses ensure that the
appropriate legal and ethical levels of safety
are met across a product’s life cycle, with
particular emphasis on the manufacturing,
in-service and disposal phases. 
The Chief Executive is the Board member
with overall health and safety responsibility.
All Ultra operating businesses are required
to have a written health and safety policy.
Each Managing Director or President is
responsible for the management of health
and safety within their business and for
providing adequate resource to meet the
requirements of the health and safety
policy. Compliance is assessed through
independent external audits which take
place bi-annually.
Each operating business is required to
submit a separate annual report on health
and safety performance which, along with
the result of the audits, is reviewed by the
Board. The reportable/recordable accident
rate has been maintained over recent years
and is shown in ﬁgure 1. Lost time
accident data per 200,000 hours has been
recorded for the whole Group since 2010
and is shown in ﬁgure 2.
The reportable/recordable accident rate per
employee for 2013, fell from 1.06% to
0.77%.
Ultra’s continuous safety improvement
activities are focused on ensuring that the
Group’s facilities, infrastructure, processes,
products and services are as safe as
reasonably practical for Ultra’s employees,
visitors, customers and users.

Sustainability (continued)
Environment
Ultra recognises that it is important, both
for its employees and the communities, 
in which it operates, that effective
measures are in place to minimise the
environmental impact of its activities, 
as this will help to secure the long-term
future of the Group. These measures
include both the operational business
environment and the products and
services which the Group provides.
Products
The processes and practices in the
individual operating businesses ensure 
that environmental considerations are
taken into account throughout a product’s
life cycle, from concept through to
disposal. The individual operating
businesses work with their suppliers to
reduce the impact of their products and to
maximise the use of environmentally-
acceptable components. Ultra ensures the
full co-operation of all employees to
minimise environmental impact and
maximise the conservation of materials.
Operational
The Chief Executive is the main Board
member with overall environmental
responsibility. The Managing Directors and
Presidents of the operating businesses are
responsible for the implementation of the
policy. Where appropriate, individual
businesses have ISO14001 accreditation. 
Ultra has a formal environmental policy
which addresses compliance with
environmental legislation, conformity with
standards for air, waste disposal and noise,
the economical use of materials and the
establishment of appropriate
environmental performance standards.
Progress is monitored through annual
reporting and a bi-annual external audit
process, the most recent of which took
place in 2013.
Compliance with environmental
requirements is planned and managed by
each site and the processes for the storage,
handling and disposal of hazardous or
pollutant materials are reviewed on a
continuous basis. Ultra has caused no
contamination of land in 2013, continuing
the excellent track record of the previous
four years. 
In the UK, Ultra measures and reports on
its packaging waste annually and this is
shown in the chart below. Businesses are
encouraged and incentivised to reduce the
net amount of waste they produce.
Energy consumption is measured annually
and the data compared with previous
years. The Group is increasing its efforts to
address energy conservation and emissions. 
Ultra in the UK, is registered with the
Environment Agency as part of the Carbon
Reduction Commitment programme. The
Group’s compliance emissions grew from
6,511 tonnes (2011/12) to 8,912 tonnes
(2012/13) of CO
2
, an increase of 37%.
Analysis shows that this rise is due to the
increased number of operating sites
(following several recent acquisitions) and a
colder winter when compared to 2011/12.

Performance League Table (PLT) is available

Greenhouse gas emissions
Ultra is committed to the systematic
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
and to becoming a good steward for the
environment. In compliance with the 2013
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulations,
Ultra has collected and consolidated
information on carbon dioxide (CO
2
)
emissions from across its portfolio of 28
businesses; 2013 will serve as a baseline
year, from which progress against
reduction targets will be tracked. 
Methodology
In 2013, each business reported on the
appropriate greenhouse gas metrics. These
metrics were aggregated to produce the
ﬁgures reported below to which standard
DEFRA conversion factors were applied. 
Additional environmental initiatives
In 2013, in addition to tracking its carbon
emissions, Ultra partnered with the Carbon
Trust to conduct a holistic Energy Review of
Ultra’s Command & Control Systems (CCS)
business, headquartered in Loudwater, UK.
The CCS survey captured the facility’s grid-
imported electricity, natural gas and speciﬁc
annual energy performance. The study
identiﬁed savings opportunities of
approximately £50,000 per annum, which
could be realised with £175,000 of upfront
investment in energy-saving technologies.
In 2014, the Carbon Trust survey will be
conducted at several other Ultra businesses.

Corporate Governance Report
Ultra is committed to effective corporate
governance. Having the right people, doing
the right things and in the right way, is at
the core of Ultra’s compliance framework.
The Board sets the tone for ethical standards
across the Group. High standards of
integrity and ethical behaviour are expected
from every employee. Ultra’s values of
responsibility, authority and accountability
and an established commitment of
‘delivering on our promises’, promote and
endorse this behaviour.
During the year, the Board has been
engaged in ensuring the Group’s
governance framework meets the changes
introduced by the September 2012 edition
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the
Code) and the Large and Medium-sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013
(the Regulations). The strength of our
embedded governance framework and our
underlying processes mean, in the main,
only changes in how we report the Board’s
activities within the Annual Report and
Accounts, are required. These changes can
been seen in our Audit Committee Report
on page 60, our Directors’ Remuneration
Report on page 63 and the Strategic
Report on pages 4 to 47. Our additional
reporting includes the statement, made by
the Directors on pages 58 and 59, that
they consider the Annual Report and
Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair,
balanced and understandable and
providing the information necessary for
shareholders to assess the Group’s
performance, business model and strategy.
The processes which underpin and support
the Directors’ conﬁdence in making this
statement (which are explained in this
Corporate Governance Report) are 
long-established and fully embedded in
Ultra’s governance framework.
Having the right people in the right roles
extends to Ultra’s Board, which is
composed of individuals from a wide range
of professional and sector experience. This
ensures that we have a truly balanced
Board, with the right skills and experience
to contribute to, and challenge, decision-
making. During the year, Mary Waldner
joined the Board as the Group Finance
Director. Mary has a broad range of
experience in a number of sectors and an
excellent track record of achievement. 
Last year, I wrote to Ultra’s major
shareholders advising them that, in view of
the change of Financial Director and
internal auditors in the year, the Board had
decided to extend Mr Chris Bailey’s tenure,
as Non-Executive Director, into a tenth
year. He will continue as Chair of the
Remuneration, Audit and Nominations
Committees. Chris is a highly-experienced,
former large plc Finance Director, who
brings vital specialist and general
management expertise to Ultra’s Board. He
will provide continuity and risk reduction
of the ﬁnance function during this period.
The Board expects to appoint a replacement
ﬁnance specialist Non-Executive Director to
seek election at the Annual General
Meeting in the spring of 2015.

Corporate Governance Report
Compliance statement
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December
2013, the Board considers that it and the Group
have complied with the provisions set out in the
September 2012 edition of the UK Corporate
Governance Code (the Code). The Code is
issued by the Financial Reporting Council and is
publicly available on their website
(www.frc.org.uk). This corporate governance
section of the Annual Report & Accounts
describes how the Board has applied the main
principles of the Code.
Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide effective
leadership and direction in delivering the key
corporate objective of adding long-term
shareholder value, as measured by market
capitalisation and the Group’s ranking in the
FTSE index, more rapidly than other companies
to outperform the market. The Executive
Directors set the Group strategy which is subject
to challenge before final agreement by the full
Board. The Board also ensures that adequate
controls are in place, including calibrating risk
appetite and maintaining oversight of Ultra’s risk
management processes. The Board receives
regular compliance reports from the Group’s
divisions and businesses. The Board requires the
Group’s businesses to behave ethically and
properly at all times and engenders a culture of
fairness to customers, suppliers and employees.
It is the function of the Group’s management,
through the Chief Executive Rakesh Sharma and
his Executive Team, to run the operations of the
Group. The members of the Executive Team are
listed on page 77.
The Board is responsible for major investment
decisions such as acquisitions of companies, the
allocation of the Group’s R&D expenditure,
major new projects and approval of large
customer contracts. To this end, in addition to
the ten scheduled Board meetings, the Board
held five unscheduled Board meetings in the
year. The Board conducts regular reviews of the
major projects being undertaken by the
operating businesses.
A summary of some of the Board’s key
responsibilities and activities is set out opposite
and the full range of Board responsibilities are
detailed in the document entitled ‘Matters
reserved for the Board’ which is available from
the Investors section of the Group website.
Board matters
At every Board meeting, standing agenda items include:
• The Chief Executive’s Report which covers the Group’s operational performance, particular
performance issues in each division, the overall outlook for the Group and health and safety
performance
• The Group Finance Director’s Report which covers financial forecasts for the half and full year,
review of cash performance to date and future forecasts, review of banking covenants, review
of analysts’ views of the Group, major shareholdings and major share buyers and sellers
• Major project reports
• Group Marketing Director’s report
• Human Resources report
• Review of current acquisition activity and approval of any offers for proposed acquisitions
• Business presentation by a Managing Director/President
Other important topics which are covered on a routine basis during the year are:
• Approval of annual and interim financial statements and accompanying regulatory announcements
• Review and approval of the annual budget
• Approval of the Group’s dividend policy, the payment of the interim dividend and the
recommendation of the final dividend
• Receiving reports from the Board’s Committees, including recommendations from the Audit
Committee in respect of: the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal
control statement; the adoption of the going concern statement; impairment and
reappointment of the Auditors and the subsequent agreement to such recommendations
• Review and approval of major capital investment projects and bids
• A full day Board meeting devoted wholly to the review of the five-year strategic plan, with
presentations given by the Executive Team and discussions held on significant matters identified
in the proposed plan
• Six-monthly review of compliance reports prepared by Divisional Managing Directors/Presidents
• Annual reviews of health & safety and environmental reports summarising the position across 
all Ultra businesses
• Approval of any changes to the rules of operation of the Group’s employee share plans

• Consideration and agreement of the Pension Scheme Revaluation and the Deficit Reduction
Plan for the Ultra Electronics Defined Benefit Pension Scheme
• Structure, policies and procedures to address cyber-security risk and cyber-security offerings
• Review of progress made across the Group on mandatory carbon reporting
• Consideration and update of the Group’s share dealing code
• Setting out clearly defined and written roles for the Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior
Independent Director Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 53
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Board meetings 
Comprehensive briefing papers are circulated to
the Directors in advance of each Board meeting
to enable an informed debate to take place.
Acquisition opportunities are presented to the
Board by the appropriate Divisional Managing
Director/President. This enables a full discussion
of the merits and risks of any acquisition
proposal to take place at an early stage. Other
significant matters that require formal Board
approval which are routinely presented by the
appropriate business include major bids,
updates on key strategic initiatives and major
capital and private venture development
expenditure proposals.
The scheduled Board meetings are rotated
around the sites of the operating businesses.
During 2013, the Board visited six operating
businesses in the UK. In addition, the Board held
one meeting at a North American business,
following a tour by the Non-Executive Directors
of some of the North American operations.
During Board meetings at Ultra’s operating
units, presentations detailing recent
performance, key opportunities and future
forecasts are given by the senior managers of
the host business. Product demonstrations and
site tours also take place. This gives the Non-
Executive Directors a good practical insight into
the operating businesses. The Non-Executive
Directors also conduct individual visits to
businesses. The Directors meet frequently with
the Executive Team members who make
presentations to the Board on any significant
investment proposals, including proposed
acquisitions, and to give progress reports on any
particular strategic initiatives which the Board
may have requested. The Executive Team as a
whole meets the Board annually to present the
proposed Strategic Plan for the next five years.
This is then debated with the Directors, changes
agreed and a final plan is approved. In addition,
in line with the areas of focus from the 2012
Board evaluation (see page 55), the 
Non-Executive Directors met with the Divisional
Managing Directors/Presidents on an additional 
two occasions in the year.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Board composition
In 2013, Paul Dean, the Group Finance Director
resigned and was replaced by Mary Waldner.
Throughout 2013, the Board structure was in
line with the Code.
Diversity
Ultra continues to follow its overriding policy 
of appointing the best person for a particular
role, regardless of sex, race, nationality, disability,
sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion 
or beliefs. The Board contends that a board
composed of the right balance of skills,
experience and diversity of views is best placed
to support a company in its strategic objectives.
The Board has considered in detail the
requirements of the Code regarding gender
diversity. In selecting the best person for a 
role, the Board gives active consideration to 
the benefits of diversity, including gender
diversity. However, setting diversity target
aspirations, especially by specific dates, can
distort the selection process and conflict with 
its preferred, diversity-aware ‘best person for 
the role’ approach.
Engineering is a sector of relatively low female
participation, especially in senior management
positions. This poses a challenge for the Group in
terms of achieving gender diversity with the
appropriate knowledge and understanding of the
risks associated with the Group’s technologies
and offerings. Nevertheless, Ultra will continue in
its diversity aware ‘best person for the role’
approach to recruiting. A summary of the gender
split across the Board, Executive Team and the
Group as a whole is set out on page 44.
Board skills and experience
The Board has a balance of skills, understanding,
perspectives and experience relevant to the
Group’s activities. The Board collectively
possesses a deep understanding of the Group’s
core defence, security, transport and energy
markets. This is complemented by its members’ 
experience and expertise in other industries and
other disciplines including procurement,
accountancy, financial management and
growing international businesses. There is
knowledge of best practice in other companies
and other industries, and the Board seeks to
adopt new methodologies when these are seen
to be in the best interests of the Group. This
range of skills and experience informs the
Board’s decision-making and enables it to
provide effective leadership.
The particular skills and experience that each
Director brings to the Board are described in
their biographical details on pages 50 and 51
and are summarised opposite.
The Group has a policy whereby Executive
Directors, but not the Chief Executive, may
accept one appointment as a non-executive
director in another listed company. Executive
Directors are permitted to retain any fees from
such external appointments.

Ensuring the Board receives accurate, timely and
clear information
Ensuring effective communication between the

Ensuring the performance of the Board, its
Committees and individual Directors is formally
and rigorously evaluated
Role of the Chief Executive
Rakesh Sharma is responsible for:
Running the Group’s business and operations
with the aid of the Executive Team
Proposing and developing the Group’s strategy
and overall commercial objectives
Ensuring, with the Executive Team, the
implementation of the decisions of the Board
and its Committees
Providing input to the Board’s agenda 
from himself and other members of the
Executive Team
Ensuring the Executive Team give appropriate
priority to providing reports to the Board which
contain accurate, timely and clear information
Leading the communication programme 
with shareholders
Ensuring that performance reviews are carried
out at least once a year for each of the
Executive Directors, providing input to the wider
Board evaluation process
Role of the Senior Independent Director
Chris Bailey is responsible for:
Being available to shareholders if they have
concerns which contact through the normal
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or other
Executive Directors has failed to resolve or for
which such contact is inappropriate
Attending meetings with major shareholders
and financial analysts to obtain a balanced
understanding of their issues and concerns
Meeting with the Non-Executive Directors at
least once a year to appraise the Chairman’s
performance and on such other occasions as
are deemed appropriate
Chairing the Nominations Committee and, 
in that role, initiating change and succession
planning in Board appointments to retain 
and build an effective and complementary
Board, and to facilitate the appointment of
effective and suitable members and Chairmen 
of Board Committees. The Board as a whole
determines the chairmanship and membership
of Board Committees
Board roles
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Senior Independent Director, such that no one individual has
unfettered powers of decision making. This division of responsibilities, which is in writing, has been agreed by the Board and is summarized in the table below. 
Non-Executive Directors
Chris Bailey, Sir Robert Walmsley and Martin
Broadhurst are the Group’s independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Board considers them to
be independent. In assessing independence, the
Board considers that they are independent of
management and free from business and other
relationships which could interfere with the
exercise of independent judgment now and in
the future. The Board believes that any
shareholdings of the Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors serve to align their interests
with those of all shareholders. The Non-Executive
Directors have wide experience of working in a
variety of different government and industry
roles with exposure to international business.
The key role of the Non-Executive Directors,
along with the Chairman, is to provide an
appropriate level of challenge and constructive
criticism to the plans of the Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors met without the
Chairman or Executive Directors being present
on several occasions during the year to discuss
aspects relating to the Board and the Group and
appropriate feedback was given.
On behalf of the Group, the Non-Executive
Directors are active in developing relationships at
a senior level with Ultra’s key suppliers, customers
and business partners.
Insurance
The Group maintains an appropriate level of
Directors and Officers Liability insurance cover in
respect of legal action against its Directors.
Board appointments – the process
In making appointments to the Board, the
Board, through the Nominations Committee, is
careful to identify the skills, knowledge and
experience needed for each role and to
complement the existing skills mix provided by
other Board members. To ensure selection from
the widest possible talent pool, it is Ultra’s
normal practice to engage the services of
independent, external search consultants in
recruiting new Directors.
The recruitment process for the appointment of
Mary Waldner as Group Finance Director was
set out in the 2012 Annual Report.
Directors’ induction and training
All new appointments to the Board receive a
comprehensive induction to the Group. This
covers its corporate structure, the products and
services of the Group’s businesses, the key
markets in which the businesses operate and the
key risks which the Group faces, together with
the actions and plans which are in place to
mitigate against these. On appointment, each
Director receives a full induction pack explaining
Ultra’s governance framework, policies and
procedures and a briefing from the Company
Secretary & General Counsel on the legal,
governance and control framework.
Programmes of visits to Group businesses are
arranged. It is important for these to encompass
as many businesses as possible, since no two
Ultra businesses are alike. New Directors are
encouraged to meet business and divisional
management teams to gain a feel for the Group’s
style and culture. Mary Waldner joined Ultra as
Group Finance Director on 1 July 2013. In addition
to receiving a full induction pack, she undertook
an induction program consisting of visits to various
businesses across the Group and meeting with the
management teams of these businesses.
The Company Secretary & General Counsel
annually presents to the Board on corporate
governance. The Board is briefed on significant
changes in the law or governance codes
affecting their duties as Directors. Experts
present to the Board on specialist areas, such as
pensions and tax. Specific training is arranged for
Directors as and when appropriate. The Directors
are able to call on independent professional
advice at anytime should this be necessary in
order for them to carry out their duties.
Board evaluation
The Chairman commissions externally-facilitated
annual Board evaluations. Board evaluations run
on a two year cycle. One year, the effectiveness
of the Board and its Committees is evaluated.
The next year, individual Director’s performance
is evaluated.
Following an evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the Board and its Committees in 2012, the
2012 Annual Report and Accounts set out the
areas of focus going forward. An update on
progress made on these actions is set out in the
table on the next page. 56 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Board evaluation (continued)
In 2013, Mr Jack Telfer facilitated a review of
individual Director’s performance. All Directors
completed a detailed questionnaire requiring
them to give feedback on their fellow Board
members’ contribution. The objective of this
process was to encourage the improved
performance and effectiveness of the Board. A
report of the results was given to the Chairman
of the Board, detailing any significant points
pertaining to individual Directors and broader
issues regarding the combined strengths and
weaknesses of the Board. Mr Telfer reviewed the
report with the Chairman to discuss possible
actions arising and the feedback to be provided
to individual Directors. The review concluded
that each Director contributes effectively and
demonstrates commitment to the role. There is
an appropriate balance of skills, experience,
independence, diversity and knowledge of the
Company to enable the Directors to discharge
their respective duties and responsibilities
effectively. Commitment of time by all Directors
for Board and Committee meetings and other
duties was also considered sufficient for the
effective discharge of their responsibilities.
Mr. Telfer has considerable experience of
working at board level. He was the Human
Resources Director of the Group up until June
2004 (when he left Ultra to set up his own
consultancy) and so was able to facilitate the
evaluation from a position of having a good
understanding of the Group and its culture. He
provides a valuable insight into the Group’s
challenges and needs and is able to assess the
Board and its Committees in the context of the
Group’s development.
Annual re-election of Directors
All the Directors will stand for re-election at the
Annual General Meeting on 30 April 2014.
Under normal circumstances, the Board would
have sought to replace Chris Bailey as he has
served for a period of nine years. However in
view of the significant changes in the year to
the Group’s financial function referred to on
page 49, the Board will seek to extend Chris
Bailey’s appointment for a further year. The
Board expects to appoint a new finance
specialist non-executive director to seek election
at the Annual General Meeting in the spring of
2015. The Board considers that Chris Bailey will
continue to exercise his independence.
Conflicts of interest
The Group has in place procedures for
managing conflicts of interest. Ultra’s Articles of
Association also contain provisions to allow the
Directors to authorise potential conflicts of
interest so that a Director is not in breach of his
or her duty under company law. If Directors
become aware that they have an interest,
directly or indirectly, in an existing or proposed
transaction with Ultra, they should notify the
Board in line with the Articles of Association.
Directors have a continuing duty to update any
changes to their conflicts of interest.
Internal controls
The Directors carry out an annual review of the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
systems. This covers the ways in which
identified strategic, operational and financial
risks are managed. Particular attention in the
year was paid to the security of the Group’s IT
systems and cyber security, and generally on
improving information security management.
Cyber security has been identified as the
Company’s number 1 risk (see page 35). During
the year under review, an Information Security
Policy was put in place for the Group and all
businesses were required to sign up to this
policy. This policy highlights the guiding
principles necessary to safeguard the security of
the Group’s information systems. It provides
guidance on the management of information,
documented or otherwise, and the processes to
be followed should there be an incident which
occurs, such as breakdown of communication
or network failure.
Ultra’s internal controls are designed, and have
evolved over time, to meet the Group’s particular
needs and the risks to which it is exposed.
However, no controls can provide absolute
assurance against material errors, losses or fraud.
The key features of the internal control system
that operated during the year are described in
the Audit Committee Report on page 61.
Risk management
Risk assessment and management is not treated
as a separate function within Ultra. It is assessed
and managed as an integral part of all of the
Group’s management and control processes.
The key features of the risk management system
are described in the Audit Committee Report on
page 61.
Financial reporting systems
The Group has a well-established process for
collecting financial information from operating
businesses and for consolidating this at
divisional and Group level.
Financial results for operating businesses, each
division and the whole Group are provided to
the Board monthly and presented at every
scheduled Board meeting. Ten scheduled Board
meetings are held each year. When a scheduled

The level of Board interaction with the
Divisional Managing Directors/Presidents would
be increased
Risk management reporting would continue 
to be developed
Actions
The Board agreed that when appointing a new
non-executive director this requirement would
be taken into account
In addition to presenting the Strategic Plan
annually, the Divisional Managing Directors/
Presidents would meet with the Board part way
through the year to give an update on actions
arising from the Strategic Plan. The Non-
Executive Directors would aim to meet with the
Divisional Managing Directors/ Presidents three
times a year
It was agreed that:
• The strategic risks as set out in the 2012
Annual Report would be reviewed by the
Board twice annually
• An enhanced unified reporting format for
major project risks would be implemented
• An issue tracking tool would be used to
record control issues identified by internal
audit along with agreed actions and
timeframes for their remediation

are reviewed by the Board twice annually
• A review of the reporting format for major

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Board Meeting is not held in the month, the
Directors receive the following information: a
summary financial report for the Group
comprising consolidated financial information
and business financial information; summary
financial reports from each of the businesses;
and a shareholder analysis summary report on
Ultra. The Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director explain the significance of any major
impacts on the financial performance and draw
the Board’s attention to any significant trends or
deviations from budget revealed by forecasts of
future performance.
Shareholder communication
The Group is committed to ensuring effective
communication with its shareholders and
encourages an open dialogue with shareholders
to promote a mutual understanding of
objectives and expectations. Throughout the
year, Ultra initiates tailored events and responds
to meeting requests with current and
prospective investors and financial analysts. In
line with Ultra’s commitment to clear and open
communication with shareholders, in September
2013, the Chairman on behalf of the Board
wrote to Ultra’s major shareholders advising
them of the Board’s intention to extend Chris
Bailey’s appointment by a further one year (see
explanation on page 49). No major issues were
raised by those shareholders.
Meetings are held with institutional investors
and financial analysts after the release of the
interim and full year financial results, at which
detailed briefings are given. These briefings can
also be found on the Investors section of the
Group’s website, together with copies of all
regulatory announcements, press releases and
copies of the published full year and interim
accounts and reports.
The Chief Executive, Chairman, Group Finance
Director and Marketing Director regularly meet
institutional shareholders or potential
shareholders either individually or as part of
group meetings. 
The Board is regularly updated by Ultra’s stock
broker on analysts’ and major shareholders’
views on the Group. The Chairman and Non-
Executive Directors are always available to meet
with shareholders should they have any
concerns or questions that they wish to raise.
Each year, Ultra organises focused events and/or
site visits to provide greater insight into the
strengths and potential of its extensive portfolio
of specialist capabilities. These range from
introductory briefings on the Group as a whole
to presentations on specific areas of capability.
Visits and presentations in the year included a
visit to Ultra’s Wimborne site which comprised a
review of Ultra’s nuclear sensors and
instrumentation capability, and discussion on
how this applies to the current and future
nuclear energy market. The briefing also
covered overviews of Ultra’s technology relating
to cryptography, aerospace controls, radios,
vehicle electronic architectures and rail power
management. Ultra invites investors and members
of the financial community to exhibitions, such as
the Farnborough Airshow and the Defence &
Security Equipment International exhibition.
Members of the Executive Team also take part in
investor briefings organised by third parties.
All shareholders are invited to attend the Annual
General Meeting where they have the
opportunity to meet with Directors and to ask
questions. Voting at the Annual General
Meeting is conducted by way of a show of
hands. Proxy votes lodged for each Annual
General Meeting are announced at the meeting
and published on Ultra’s website. Electronic
communication with shareholders is preferred
wherever possible since this is both more
efficient and environmentally friendly. However,
shareholders may opt to receive hard copy
communication if they wish.
Shareholder analysis
The majority of Ultra’s shares are held by
institutional shareholders. The Chairman, 
Chief Executive and other members of Ultra’s
Executive Team have holdings in Ultra, many of
whom have retained shares awarded via share
option or long term incentive schemes.

Board Committees
Ultra has established three Committees of the
Board being: the Audit; Remuneration; and
Nominations Committees, to which certain key
responsibilities have been delegated. The
detailed terms of reference of each Committee
are available from the Investors section of the
Group website. The responsibilities of each
Committee are in line with the recommendations
of the Code. The membership of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees comprises the three
independent Non-Executive Directors – Chris
Bailey, Sir Robert Walmsley and Martin
Broadhurst, with Chris Bailey, Senior Independent
Director, as Chairman of both Committees. The
membership of the Nominations Committee
comprises the three independent Non-Executive
Directors and Douglas Caster, with Chris Bailey as
Chairman of the Committee. Summaries of the
key activities of each Committee are given below.
Audit Committee
The Committee met four times during the year.
It is responsible for overseeing the Group’s
internal financial controls and risk management;
recommending the half and full year financial
results to the Board; and monitoring the integrity
of all formal reports and announcements relating
to the Group’s financial performance. Full details
of the activities of the Audit Committee during
2013 are given on page 60.
Remuneration Committee
Role
The Committee met seven times during the year.
It is responsible for formulating and
recommending to the Board the remuneration
policy for Executive Directors and Chairman of
the Board. Full details of the activities of the
Remuneration Committee during 2013 are
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on
page 63, comprising the Directors’
Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual
Report on Remuneration. Both sections of the
report will be presented for approval by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Nominations Committee
Role
The function of the Nominations Committee is
to keep under review the structure, size and
composition of the Board, and to make
proposals to the Board regarding the
appointment of new directors and Board
Committee chairmen. The terms of reference
are available on Ultra’s website 
(www.ultra-electronics.com).
During 2013 the Committee met once. 
The purpose of this meeting was threefold:
• To review and endorse the Group’s diversity
policy (see page 54)
• To recommend to the Board that Douglas
Caster be appointed as a member of the
Committee
• To consider the tenure of Chris Bailey, the
Senior Independent Director. Chris Bailey left
the meeting when this item was under
consideration 
Ultra operates a well-established succession
planning process. This is described in detail on
page 41.
Statement of going concern*
Ultra’s banking facilities amount to £190m in
total, plus a £15m overdraft. They were
established in two tranches.
The first tranche comprises £90m of revolving
credit, denominated in Sterling, US dollars,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars or Euros.
This facility was signed in January 2011 and
expires in January 2016. The facility is provided
by a group of six banks.
The second tranche provides a further £100m of
revolving credit in the same currencies. This was
signed in December 2012 with five banks and
expires in December 2017. Both facilities have
the same covenants.
The Group has a ‘shelf’ facility with Prudential
Investment Management Inc. This agreement
gives the Group access to the US private
placement market on a bilateral basis. The facility
is non-committed but is for up to $195m. At the
year-end, $70m of loan notes had been issued,
which will mature in 2018 and 2019.
As well as being used to fund acquisitions, the
financing facilities are also used for other
balance sheet and operational needs, including
the funding of day-to-day working capital
requirements. The US dollar borrowings also
represent natural hedges against assets
denominated in that currency. The Group’s
banking covenants have all been met during the
past year with a comfortable margin. The
approved Group budget for 2014 and strategic
plan for later years give confidence that the
Group will continue to meet these covenants.
Details of how Ultra manages its liquidity risk
can be found in note 23 – Financial Instruments
and Financial Risk Management.
Though global macro-economic conditions
remain uncertain, the long-term nature of
Ultra’s business and its positioning in attractive
sectors of its markets, taken together with the
Group’s forward order book, provide a
satisfactory level of confidence in respect of
trading in the year to come.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that
Ultra has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus, they continue to adopt a going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the annual
financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities statement*
The Directors are responsible for preparing the
Annual Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors are required to
prepare the Group financial statements in
accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union and Article 4 of the
International Accounting Standards Regulation
(“IAS”) and have elected to prepare the Parent
Company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law the Directors must not
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied
that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss
of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently
• Make judgments and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent
• State whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements,
International Accounting Standard 1 requires
that Directors:
• Properly select and apply accounting policies
• Present information, including accounting
policies, in a manner that provides relevant,
reliable, comparable and understandable
information
• Provide additional disclosures when compliance
with the specific requirements in IFRSs are
insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position
and financial performance
• Make an assessment of the Company’s ability
to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are sufficient
to show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
*All references in these sections to ‘Company’ mean Ultra Electronics Holdings plc The Directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and
financial information included on Ultra’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that to the best of their
knowledge, taken as a whole:
• the financial statements, prepared in
accordance with the relevant financial
reporting framework, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
profit or loss of Ultra and the undertakings
included in the consolidation;
• the Annual Report and Accounts is fair,
balanced and understandable and provides
the information necessary for shareholders to
assess the Ultra’s performance, business model
and strategy; and
• the management report, which is incorporated
into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review
of the development and performance of the
business and the position of Ultra and the
undertakings included in the consolidation,
together with a description of the principal risks
and uncertainties that they face.
In accordance with Section 418 of the
Companies Act 2006, each Director in office at
the date the Directors’ Report is approved,
confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no
relevant audit information of which Ultra’s
auditors are unaware; and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought
to have taken as a Director in order to make
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that Ultra’s
auditors are aware of that information.

Ultra’s strategic framework
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review Ultra is committed to ensuring that it has robust
and effective risk management and financial
control processes. As Chairman of the Audit
Committee, I am pleased to present our report
detailing the role and responsibilities of the
Committee in this regard. The Board’s report on
the systems of internal control and their
effectiveness, together with the going concern
statement, can be found in the Corporate
Governance Report on pages 52 to 59.
During the year, the Committee continued to
review the appropriateness of the Group’s
system of risk management and internal
controls, the robustness and integrity of the
Group’s financial reporting, along with both the
internal and external audit processes. 
The Group outsources its internal audit function
and at the beginning of the year, the Group
changed its internal auditors to
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”). In producing
the 2013 internal audit plan, PwC adopted a risk
based approach, ensuring the plan is clearly
linked to the Group’s strategy and flexible
enough to highlight and address emerging risks. 
Composition
The composition of the Committee is set out on
page 58. The members of the Committee have
the relevant financial and accounting experience
required by the Code. The Chairman of the
Committee is supported in his role by the other
members of the Committee who have a wide
range of business experience and expertise, as
evidenced in their biographies on pages 50 to 51.
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met four times during the year
under review. In addition to the Committee
members, regular attendees are: the Chairman
of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Group
Finance Director and the Marketing Director.
The Company Secretary & General Counsel acts
as Secretary to the Committee. Deloitte LLP are
the Group’s external auditor. To ensure full and
open communication, the Deloitte Audit Partner
attended all Committee meetings, and the lead
partner from PwC attended those meetings at
which summary Internal Audit Reports were
reviewed by the Committee.
During 2013, the Committee Chairman met
with Deloitte and PwC in the absence of
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. In
addition, the Committee met with Deloitte
without Executive Directors present, at which
Deloitte satisfactorily reported on the findings of
their audit work and any matters that they
thought should be brought to the Committee.
Role
The Committee’s main responsibilities include
the following: 
• Scrutinising the Group’s annual and interim
financial statements and accounts and
reporting to the Board on the significant
financial reporting issues and judgements made 
• Reviewing the content of the Annual Report 
and Accounts and advising the Board whether,
taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information
necessary for shareholders to assess the
Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy
• Reviewing the scope and effectiveness of the
external audit process, including the external
auditors’ appointment, fees and independence
• Reviewing the effectiveness of the internal
audit function and the Group’s system of
internal control, including financial reporting
and the processes for monitoring and
evaluating the risks facing the Group.
The Committee has written terms of reference
which includes all matters indicated by the
Code. These terms of reference are reviewed
and approved by the Board annually. The terms
of reference are available on Ultra’s website
(www.ultra-electronics.com).
The Board is kept fully informed of the
Committee’s work and the minutes of each
Committee meeting are circulated to Board
members.

Activities of the Committee during the year
...as Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present our report detailing 
the role and responsibilities of the Committee and its activities during the year. Internal controls and risk management
The Committee reviews: the Group’s systems of
internal controls and risk management; their
effectiveness; improvements to these systems;
and resolution of any control issues identified.
Clear terms of reference set out the duties of the
Board and the Board Committees, with
delegation of operating responsibility to
management clearly described in the Group
Operating Manual. Financial reporting systems
are comprehensive and include monthly
reporting cycles. Monthly finance reports are
prepared by all businesses containing actual
financial performance measures for the most
recent month and year to date. These are
compared with budget, forecasts and the prior
year. These monthly reports are reviewed by the
relevant Divisional Finance Director, Group
Finance Director and the Board. Financial
information is uploaded monthly by all
businesses to BPC, the Group’s consolidation and
reporting system, which is collated by the Head
Office finance team and reconciled to the
businesses’ monthly report. When preparing and
reviewing financial information, the businesses
do not work to a materiality threshold. All
variances judged to be significant in relation to a
specific balance are investigated and explained.
Every 6 months, each Divisional Finance Director
meets with the Group Finance Director and
discusses the internal controls processes and issues
for each business in their division. This includes:
• Results from the Senior Accounting Officer
review and any tax audits
• Self-assessment against the Group 
Operating Manual
• Outstanding internal and external audits
• Segregation of duties and IT access audits
• Compliance with the Group’s Information
Security Policy
Summary results from these reviews are included in
the Internal Controls Improvement Status Report,
which is presented to the Committee twice a year.
The Board maintains an internal audit process,
carried out by PwC, to review financial and
information systems control procedures
throughout the Group. All significant business
units are audited by the outsourced internal
audit function at least once every 2 years, while
other businesses are audited on a 3 year cycle.
In addition, all newly acquired free-standing
businesses are audited within a year of their
acquisition date. The lead partner of PwC
reports directly to the Chairman of the
Committee and presents the findings of his
team twice annually to the Committee. Progress
reports on follow-up remedial actions are
reported regularly to the Committee. PwC
confirms whether appropriate action has been
taken to address the risks when they next visit
the business concerned.
The Managing Directors/Presidents, Finance
Directors and Vice Presidents of Finance of each
business are required to give a formal written
representation to the Board each year
confirming that they accept responsibility for
maintaining effective internal controls and that
they have disclosed full details of any fraud or
suspected fraud within their business.
The Board accepts overall responsibility for
reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the
Group’s internal controls at least annually and
has performed a specific assessment for the
purposes of this Annual Report. With the
assistance of the Committee, all significant
aspects of internal control for 2013 have been
reviewed and internal procedures amended
where necessary.
External auditors
The performance, effectiveness and
independence of Ultra’s auditors, Deloitte, is
reviewed annually by the Committee. The
Committee considered the questions contained
in a questionnaire issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland in October
2007 to assess performance, effectiveness and
independence and concluded that Deloitte had
been sufficiently transparent and incisive and
the audits had been effective. The Committee
concluded that Deloitte was both independent
and objective and that the reappointment of
Deloitte as external auditor should be
recommended to the shareholders. Accordingly,
a resolution to reappoint Deloitte will be put to
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The senior audit partner employed by Deloitte
on the Ultra audit is subject to a strict policy of
regular rotation such that there is a change in
this role at least once every five years. This is in
accordance with professional practice
guidelines. The current senior audit partner’s
tenure commenced in 2011. Deloitte were
appointed in 2002. The Committee considered
the audit tendering provisions in the Code
which provide that FTSE 350 companies should
put the external audit contract out to tender at
least every ten years. The Committee considers
that for an organisation of the size and
complexity of Ultra, the tendering of external
audit must be well planned to ensure that the
Group complies with best practice corporate
governance as well as ensuring the Group
receives a high quality, efficient and effective
external audit service. On this basis, the
Committee considers it would be appropriate to
retender the external auditors at the end of the
current senior audit partner’s tenure. There are
no contractual obligations that restrict the
Committee’s choice of external auditors.
The auditor’s engagement letter and the scope
of the year’s annual audit cycle is discussed in
advance by the Committee, ensuring that any
changes in circumstances arising since the
previous year are taken into account. With
respect to non-audit assignments undertaken by
Deloitte, Ultra has a policy to ensure that the
provision of such services do not impair
Deloitte’s independence or objectivity. The policy
is that:
• Non-audit services are restricted to regulatory
reporting, consultancy services associated with
financial restructuring, responding to new
reporting requirements, due diligence
assessments of potential acquisitions and minor
consultancy work. In connection with
acquisition due diligence work and certain
consultancy work, it is the Board’s view that the
auditor’s familiarity with the Group’s accounting
practices and the techniques that are involved
in Ultra’s long-term contracting activities serves
them well in carrying out such work
• When considering the use of the external
auditors to undertake non-audit work,
consideration must be given to the provisions
of the Financial Reporting Council Guidance
on Audit Committees with regard to the
preservation of independence and objectivity
• The external auditors must certify to Ultra that
they are acting independently

external auditors
After discussions with both management and the external auditor, the Committee determined 
that the key risk of misstatement to the Group’s financial statements relate to: External auditors (continued)
• In providing a non-audit service, the external
auditors should not:
– audit their own work
– make management decisions for the Group
– create a mutuality of interest
– find themselves in the role of advocate for 
the Group
• The Group Finance Director has authority to
commission the external auditors to undertake
non-audit work where there is a specific project
with a cost that is not expected to exceed
£50,000. Any individual assignments with an
estimated fee in excess of £50,000 must be
referred in advance to the Chairman of the
Committee for his approval. The non-audit
work has to be reported to the Committee at
its next meeting.
• Before commissioning non-audit services, the
Group Finance Director or the Chairman of
the Committee, as appropriate, must ensure
that the external auditors are satisfied that
there is no issue as regards independence and
objectivity and other potential providers are
adequately considered.
The fees paid to Deloitte in respect of audit and
approved non-audit services are shown in note 6
to the Financial Statements.
The Group has a policy on employment of
former employees of external auditors. This
requires that any such employment is considered
on a case by case basis and takes into account
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
on such appointments. Such appointment
requires approval by a combination of the Group
Finance Director, Audit Committee and the Board,
depending on the seniority of the appointment.
Fraud
The internal audit process carried out by PwC,
described on page 61, and the Group’s internal
control framework help to protect the Group
against fraud. Regular business reviews take
place at all businesses, in which detailed balance
sheet and cash flow reviews are carried out by
the relevant Divisional Managing and Financial
Directors. In addition, the Chief Executive and
Group Finance Director review the performance
of the businesses with the Divisional team
monthly and directly with the businesses at least
twice a year. Significant differences between
forecast and reported financial results are
highlighted and require explanation by the
business unit concerned. The internal control
framework that is in place is supplemented by
the external audit process which represents a
second independent review of controls and
procedures, with selective transaction testing of
high risk areas. There is a fraud reporting
process in place. Any reports of fraud would
immediately be investigated and the situation
reported at the next Board meeting. 
Whistleblowing
An independently hosted Employee Hotline is
used to provide a process for reporting ethical
concerns. Employees are informed of this
process through posters (which are translated
into local languages) and through the Group
intranet (which is accessible by all employees).
Employees can report ethical dilemmas or other
similar concerns they may have via this external
Employee Hotline and can remain anonymous if
they wish. Employee concerns are forwarded
directly to the Chairman of the Audit
Committee or, in the case of issues covered by
US security legislation, to the Chairman of the
Security Committee of either Ultra’s Special
Security Agreement company or Ultra’s Proxy
Board company, as appropriate. During 2013,
no reports were submitted (two in 2012). 
Anti-bribery
Ultra has robust anti-bribery policies and
procedures in place. All Directors and employees
are required to sign Ultra’s code of conduct on
anti-bribery and commit to act in accordance with
the code. Within 1 week of joining Ultra, Directors
and employees undertake anti-bribery training.
Further anti-bribery training is given to targeted
groups throughout the year. The Group intranet
contains a statement from the Chief Executive
regarding compliance with Ultra’s anti-bribery
policies. Compliance with the code of conduct on
anti-bribery is closely monitored by a requirement
for Ultra businesses to submit monthly business
performance reports confirming compliance with
the code and reporting any breaches.

ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
This report, prepared by the Remuneration
Committee (the “Committee”) and approved 
by the Board for the financial year ended 
31 December 2013, sets out the remuneration
policy for the Executive and Non-Executive
Directors of Ultra Electronics Holdings plc. It has
been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and
Group (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008
as amended in August 2013.
In response to the UK Government’s new
legislation regarding the reporting of directors’
pay, this report has been divided into the
following two sections:
• A Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report,
which sets out Ultra’s policy on the
remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors; and
• An Annual Report on Remuneration, which
discloses how the remuneration policy will be
implemented in the year ending 31 December
2014 and how it was implemented in the year
ended 31 December 2013.
A binding vote on the Directors’ Remuneration
Policy Report and an advisory vote on the
Annual Report on Remuneration will be tabled
at the forthcoming 2014 AGM. The Committee
intends to put the Directors’ Remuneration
Policy Report to a binding vote every three
years, while shareholders will be asked to vote
on the Annual Report on Remuneration in an
advisory capacity annually.
Remuneration policy for 2014
The Committee considers the Group’s policy on
the remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive
Directors to: be closely aligned with the Group’s
strategy; support and drive the achievement of
Ultra’s business objectives and therefore is
aligned with shareholders’ interests; and be
appropriately stretching. The EPS underpin on
long-term incentive awards remains amongst the
toughest in the FTSE 250.
Performance and reward during 2013
2013 was a challenging year: revenue and
underlying profit were £745.2m (2012: £760.8m)
and £121.7m (2012, as restated: £121.8m)
respectively; underlying earnings per share were
127.1p (2012, as restated: 125.5p); operating
cash flow was £79.0m (2012, as restated:
£89.6m); and total shareholder return was 14%
(2012: 6%). Reflecting on this, no annual bonus
was payable for 2013 (no bonus was paid for
2012) and the 2011 LTIP awards which were
due to crystallise in 2014 based on three year
TSR and EPS performance to 31 December 2013
will not vest as a result of performance targets
not being met.
In respect of the 2013 grant of LTIP awards, Paul
Dean (who left the Company in March 2013)
was not included in the awards. Mary Waldner
(who joined the Company on 1 July 2013)
received a pro-rated LTIP award representing 
2.5 years of the 3 year LTIP award. In line with
the LTIP rules (see table on page 73) the
Committee decided to treat Paul Dean’s LTIP
awards from 2011 and 2012 as lapsed.
The Committee considered the shareholding
requirements of the Chief Executive and 
agreed it should be increased from 100% to
125% of salary in line with the increase in
percentage grant of annual LTIP awards that
was approved by shareholders at the last 
AGM held on 26 April 2013.
Shareholder engagement
The Committee continues to take an active
interest in shareholder views on our Executive
remuneration policy and is mindful of the
concerns of shareholders and other
stakeholders. Our voting result at the 2013
AGM was 99.7% in favour of the Directors’
Remuneration Report. 
In conclusion, the Board firmly considers that
the remuneration policy continues to be aligned
with the strategic goal of the Group in adding
to shareholder value and supporting the long
term success of the Company.

Chris Bailey, Chairman, Remuneration Committee
28 February 2014 The policy described in this section is intended to apply for the three years beginning on the date of the 2014 AGM, subject to shareholder approval. 
The Group’s forward-looking policy is the same policy that was applied for the 2013 financial year. 
Policy overview
The Group’s remuneration policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling Ultra to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre,
whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments. The remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers is aligned with corporate objectives
and the interests of shareholders. The linkages between each element of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages with the Group’s objectives and the
interests of shareholders are set out in the following information.

Maximum potential
While there is no defined
maximum salary, it is the
Committee’s policy to set pay for
Executive Directors at industry
competitive levels taking market
capitalisation and annual sales
into account. Annual salary
increases take into account: 
(i) underlying performance of the
individual; (ii) underlying
performance of the business; 
(iii) underlying annual salary
increases within the overall
Group; (iv) any changes to the
scope of the role in terms of size
or complexity; and (v) underlying
salary increases for similar
industry roles
It is recognised that annual salary
increases may also include a
‘catch up’ element over and
above the factors listed above to
increase the salary towards or to
a competitive industry level
where the Executive Director was
appointed with a salary
significantly below the
competitive level
Annual salary increases for
Executive Directors will not
normally exceed the average
increase awarded to other Group
UK based employees although
increases may be above this if
there is an increase in: (i) the

Notes to future policy table:
(1) A description of how the Company
intends to implement the policy in
2014 is set out in the Annual Report
on Remuneration on page 69.
(2) The remuneration policy described
above provides an overview of the
structure that operates for the most
senior executives in the Group. Lower
levels of incentive operates for
employees below executive level, with
remuneration driven by market
comparators and the impact of the
role. Long-term incentives are reserved
for those anticipated as having the
greatest potential to influence the
Group’s earnings growth and share
price performance, although as the
Committee is aware of the benefits
which wider employee share
ownership can generate, all employees
are encouraged to participate in the
AESOP and Savings Related Share
Option Scheme in the countries in
which they are offered. 
(3) The choice of the performance metrics
applicable to the annual bonus scheme
reflect the Committee’s view that any
incentive compensation should be
appropriately challenging and tied to
financial performance. The TSR and
EPS performance conditions applicable
to the LTIP (further details of which are
provided on page 69) were selected
by the Committee on the basis that:
• TSR aligns the performance objectives
of the Executive Directors (TSR is one
of the Group’s Key Performance
Indicators) more closely with the
interests of the shareholders;
• TSR is an entirely objective measure
of relative performance;
• The use of TSR and EPS reflects the
metrics most commonly used by
other quoted companies;
• TSR reduces the complexity and cost
of calculating the vesting result; and
• The EPS underpin ensures an
appropriate level of profit growth is
maintained by the Group.
(4) All employee share plans do not
operate performance conditions.
(5) As highlighted above, Ultra has a
share ownership policy which 
requires the Executive Directors to
build up and maintain a target 
holding equal to 100% of base salary
(125% for the Chief Executive).
Details of the extent to which the
Executive Directors had complied with
this policy as at 31 December 2013
are set out on page 72.
(6) For the avoidance of doubt, in
approving this Directors’ Remuneration
Policy, authority is given to Ultra to
honour any commitments entered into
with current or former Directors (such
as, but not limited to, the payment of
a pension or the vesting/exercise of
past share awards) that have been
disclosed to and approved by
shareholders in previous remuneration
reports. Details of any payments to
former Directors will be set out in the
Annual Report on Remuneration as
they arise. Remuneration scenarios for 
Executive Directors for 2014
The charts opposite show how the composition
of the Executive Directors’ remuneration
packages varies at three performance levels,
namely, at minimum (i.e. fixed pay including
pensions and taxable benefits), target and
maximum levels, under the policy set out in the
table overleaf. The charts show the proportion
of the total package comprised of each element.
Notes to remuneration scenarios 
(1) Base salary levels are based on those applying from 
1 January 2014. 
(2) Benefit and pension value for 2014 has been
estimated.
(3) Annual Bonus outturn is assumed to be 50% of
salary at target level. For maximum, outturn assumes
a maximum bonus award level of 100% of salary.
(4) Long-Term Incentive Share Awards assume a grant
policy of 125% of salary for the CEO and 100% of
salary for the other Executive Directors which vests 
in full at maximum performance, while 20% is
assumed to vest at target level of performance. 
No share price appreciation has been included.
Director recruitment policy
The Nominations Committee normally considers
both internal and external candidates before any
new appointment is made. New executive
directors are provided with remuneration
consisting of base salary, short-term incentive,
long-term incentive and other benefits.
Salary
Ultra’s policy is to set pay for executive directors
at industry competitive levels taking market
capitalisation and annual sales into account. It is
recognised that a new appointee may not have
as much experience as someone at a
competitive level and may therefore be offered a
salary below competitive levels but at a level
that is sufficient to attract the person. (See base
salary policy on page 64). In exceptional
circumstances, the Committee may exercise its
discretion to offer an above industry competitive
level salary in order to attract the best person.
Short-term incentive
Short-term incentives are offered in line with
those paid to other Executive Directors described
on page 64. Maximum opportunities will be in
line with current plan maximums for existing
Directors (i.e. 100% of salary p.a.).
Long-term incentive
Long-term incentives are offered in line with
those paid to other Executive Directors described
on page 65. Maximum opportunities will be in
line with current plan maximum for existing
Directors (i.e. up to 125% of salary p.a. or 150%
of salary p.a. in exceptional circumstances). 
Other benefits
Other benefits are offered in line with those paid
to other Executive Directors which are described
on page 65.
Buy outs
To facilitate recruitment, the Committee may make
an award to buy-out incentive arrangements
forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing
so, the Committee will take account of all relevant
factors including any performance conditions
attached to these awards and the time over which
they would have vested or been paid. Ultra may
make use of the flexibility provided in the Listing
Rules (LR 9.4.2) to make awards if appropriate.
Where possible, incentives will be bought out on a
like-for-like basis with respect to vesting/payment
dates, currency (i.e. cash versus shares) and the
use of performance targets.
Non-Executive Directors
The approach to the recruitment of non-executive
directors is to pay an annual fixed fee.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy (continued)
Executive Director service contracts
The Group’s policy is to ensure that the
Executive Directors’ service contracts have a
notice period of one year, which the Committee
considers appropriately reflects both current
market practice and the balance between the
interests of the Group and each Executive
Director. The following table provides more
information on each Director’s service contract:
Date of Notice 
Name contract period
M. Anderson 1  Apr 2012 12 months
R. Sharma 21 Apr 2011 12 months
M. Waldner 1 Jul 2013 12 months
No Executive Directors have provisions in their
contracts for compensation on early termination
other than for the notice period.
External appointments of Executive Directors
The Chief Executive is not permitted to accept
any external appointment as a non-executive
director. Other Executive Directors may accept
not more than one external appointment as a
non-executive director. Up to 50% of any time
spent undertaking such external duties can be
taken as additional unpaid leave with the
remainder being treated as annual holiday.
Executive Director exit policy
Ultra may terminate an Executive Director’s
contract early with contractual notice or by way
of a payment in lieu of notice, at its discretion.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice
will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
Payments in lieu of notice will equate to the
basic salary and benefits payable during the
notice period or, if notice has already been
given, the remainder of the notice period.
Payment in lieu of notice will be made by way of
a lump sum or by phased instalments over the
notice period. Where payments are phased, if an
employee gains employment during the notice
period, payments would be reduced. There is no
contractual entitlement to annual incentive
payments in respect of the notice period. An
annual bonus may be payable with respect to
the period of the financial year served although
it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the
normal payment date as defined by the bonus
scheme rules. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an
Executive Director under the Group’s share plans
will be determined based on the relevant plan
rules. The default treatment under the 2007 LTIP
is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation
of employment. However, if a participant ceases
to hold office or employment because of death
or for any other circumstance, at the discretion
of the Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be
applied. For good leavers, the Committee can
decide that awards will vest on the date they
would normally have vested had the participant
not ceased to hold office or employment. 
Alternatively, the Committee can decide that
awards will vest on cessation. In both cases, the
award will vest subject to the satisfaction of the
relevant performance conditions at that time
and a pro rata reduction to reflect the period of
time from the date of grant of the award to the
date of cessation relative to the normal three
year vesting period. However, the Committee
can decide not to apply a pro rata reduction if it
regards it as inappropriate to do so in any
particular case.
Non-Executive Director service contracts
The Non-Executive Directors have fixed twelve-
month contracts with no notice period. Details
of their service contracts are in the table below:
Date of Notice 
Name contract period
C. Bailey 31 Jan 2014 Nil
M. Broadhurst 2 Jul 2013 Nil
D. Caster 21 Apr 2013 Nil
Sir Robert Walmsley 31 Jan 2014 Nil
There are no provisions in their contracts for
compensation on early termination.
How employment conditions elsewhere in
the Group are considered
Base salary increases take into account a
number of factors including the underlying base
salary increases within the overall Group. Pay is
only set centrally for Executive Directors,
Executive Team members, Divisional staff,
Business Managing Directors/Presidents, UK
Directors and Head Office staff. All other salaries
are set within the individual operating
businesses. In all cases there are two levels of
approval. The Remuneration Committee does
not consult with employees when setting the
remuneration of Executive Directors. It uses
independent comparison metrics to benchmark
remuneration with other companies. 
How shareholders’ views are taken 
into account
The Committee considers shareholder feedback
received in relation to the AGM each year. This,
and any other feedback received during the
year, is then considered as part of the Group’s
annual review of remuneration policy. At the
2013 AGM, 99.76% of our shareholders who
voted, voted in favour of the Directors'
Remuneration Report. 
Claw back policy
A bonus claw back policy has been adopted. 
If a bonus had been paid and the Group
subsequently has to restate its audited accounts,
the bonus may be clawed back from future bonus,
LTIP and Executive Share Option Scheme awards. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 69

The Executive Directors’ salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect
from 1st January 2014:
2014 2013 %
Salary Salary Increase
2
£’000 £’000 %
Chief Executive 474 460 3.0
Group Finance Director
2
302 275
1
9.8
Group Marketing Director
2
225 205 10.0
1
This amount relates to the annual salary of the incumbent Group Finance Director, Mary Waldner, who joined Ultra on 1 July 2013. Her predecessor, 
Paul Dean, was the Group Finance Director up until his resignation on 31 March 2013. Paul Dean’s annual salary until his resignation was £305,000.
2
The Group Finance Director’s salary was brought in line with median salary levels for that role. The Group Marketing Director’s salary was increased to
bring it towards median levels, although the Committee recognises that the Group Marketing Director’s salary is still below median levels and will
address this going forward in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Directors’ pension entitlements
The Group will continue to operate a defined benefit pension scheme for Rakesh Sharma. As Mary Waldner and Mark Anderson joined Ultra after the
defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants, they will participate in a defined contribution scheme and receive annual company contributions of
18% of their salary. 
Annual bonus for 2014
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2014 will continue to be 100% of base salary with a maximum of 25% of salary payable for the
achievement of an agreed profit target and a maximum of 75% payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target. While the Committee
believes that commercial sensitivities restrict the disclosure of forward looking annual bonus targets, full retrospective disclosure of the financial targets
will be made in the 2014 Annual Report on Remuneration.
Long term awards to be granted in 2014
Consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the Committee intends to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth
125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other Executive Directors during 2014. For this grant, 20% of awards will vest at median
TSR ranking, increasing to 100% vesting for an upper quartile TSR ranking, measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding investment
trusts). In addition to the TSR target, there is an underpin requiring an average annual growth of EPS (after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on
financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition) of 5% p.a. over the three year performance period.

Annual bonus for year under review
Annual bonuses in relation to 2013 were based upon the achievement of a sliding scale of underlying profit before tax and operating cash flow targets.
These targets were derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board. They were adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of
“stretch” challenge and incentive to outperform. Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured. Please refer
to pages 16 and 17 for details. The bonus targets set by the Committee for 2013 were a maximum of 25% of salary (subject to the achievement of
£120.8m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles on acquisition), and a maximum of 75% of
salary (subject to achieving an operating cash flow of £138.1m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive
plan shares and taking account of movements in working capital).
The Committee assessed the achievement of performance against each target as follows:
Actual Bonus
Threshold Maximum Achieved Payable
1
£’000 £’000 £’000 %
Underlying profit before tax 108,720 120,800 116,806 0
Operating cash flow 73,125 138,125 79,040 0
1
No bonus was payable in 2013 because in accordance with the bonus scheme rules, the operating cash flow was negatively adjusted to reflect working
capital performance throughout the year. In order for a bonus to be payable both profit and cash bonus criteria are required to be met. 
LTIP vesting for year under review
The LTIP award granted on 14 March 2011 was based on performance to the year ended 31 December 2013. As disclosed in previous annual reports, the
performance condition for this award was as follows:
*The comparator group comprised the following companies: Arm Holdings; Oxford Instruments; Babcock Intnl; Dialight; Senior; Spectris; Rolls-Royce
Holdings; Atkins (WS); QinetiQ Group; Laird; Halma; Rotork; Spirax-Sarco; Meggitt; Renishaw; BAE Systems; Cobham; Domino Printing Sciences; 
Vitec Group; Smiths Group; TT Electronics; Serco Group; Spirent Communications; and Chemring Group. The following companies were also part of 
the comparator group but were delisted during the performance period for the 2011 awards: Chloride Group; Umeco; VT Group; Charter International;
Psion; Logica; and Hampson Industries.

Total defined benefit pension entitlements – Audited
Under the defined benefit scheme, a pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years. Where
pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service. With the Group’s
consent, Executive Directors may retire from age 55. After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required. The pension is reduced in the event
of early retirement. In the event of death-in-service, a spouse’s pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for
dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant. On the death of a retired Executive Director, a spouse’s pension of 72 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

Remuneration Report (continued)
The role and composition of the Remuneration Committee
Role 
The role of the Committee is to: determine and agree with the Board the framework and broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors,
Chairman of the Board, and senior management reporting to the Executive Directors (the “Executive Team”); ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly
rewarded for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall performance with due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the financial and
commercial health of the Group; and ensure that contractual arrangements, including the termination of Executive Directors, are fair both to the
individuals concerned and to the Group. The Committee’s terms of reference include all matters indicated by the Code and are approved and reviewed by
the Board annually. The terms of reference are available on Ultra’s website (www.ultra-electronics.com).
Composition 
Chris Bailey continued as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and Sir Robert Walmsley and Martin Broadhurst, both independent Non-Executive
Directors, continued as the other Committee members during 2013. Sharon Harris continued to act as Secretary to the Committee. The Chairman, Chief
Executive and Group HR Director also normally attend Committee meetings by invitation, except where matters directly relating to their own remuneration
are discussed, although they are not Committee members.
Advice 
Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from New Bridge Street, an Aon plc company. New Bridge Street was
appointed by the Committee after a tender process and, during the year, provided to the Group with advice on the operation of Ultra’s LTIP and other share
schemes, remuneration benchmarking services and an annual update on market and best practice. During 2013, insurance broking services were also provided
to the Group by other subsidiaries of Aon plc which the Committee considers in no way prejudices New Bridge Street’s position as the Committee’s
independent advisers. Pension advisory services were provided to the Committee and the Group by Towers Watson. Fees charged by New Bridge Street for
advice provided to the Committee for 2013 amounted to £81,926 (excluding VAT). Fees charged by Towers Watson for advice provided to the Committee for
2013 amounted to £100,565 (excluding VAT). In addition, the Committee consults the Chief Executive with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages
offered to Executive Directors (other than in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package) and members of the Executive Team.
We strongly encourage shareholders to vote in favour of our policies which underpin our alignment between business strategy and remuneration and are
designed to be fair and balanced as between employees and shareholders.

this report, and the financial risk management objectives and policies can be found in note 23.
Strategic Report
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 Ultra is required to set out information which helps the shareholders assess how the Directors have
performed their duty to promote the success of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The
information that satisfies these requirements can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 47.

was paid on 27 September 2013, making a total of 42.2p (2012: 40.0p) per share paid in the year.
Future developments 
A review of the activities and future developments of the Group is contained in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 and 5.
Research and development
The Directors are committed to maintaining a significant level of research and development expenditure in order to expand the Group’s range of proprietary
products. During the year a total of £130.4 million (2012: £147.1 million) was spent on engineering and business development of which £87.1 million
(2012: £97.9 million) was funded by customers and £43.3 million (2012: £49.2 million) by the Group.
Purchase of own shares
During the year Ultra purchased no (2012: nil) ordinary shares and no (2012: nil) ordinary shares were distributed following vesting of awards under the
Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive Plan. At 31 December 2013, the Group held 235,245 ordinary shares under the Ultra Electronics Long-Term
Incentive Plan (representing 0.3% of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 December 2013).
Supplier payment policy
Individual operating businesses are responsible for agreeing the terms and conditions under which they conduct business transactions with their suppliers.
It is Group policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms, provided that the supplier is also complying with all relevant terms

Independent auditor’s report
Independent auditor’s report
To the members of Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the Parent
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 49. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that
has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Risk
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition has been deemed a risk
area, specifically in relation to:
• Significant long-term contracts, due to the
financial effects of judgements, including
future milestone success, associated with
determining the percentage of contract
completion at the balance sheet date and risks
associated with completing the contract; and
• Delivery of goods, due to the complex
contractual terms with regards to the transfer
of risk and reward that arise within the
Aerospace and Defence industry and therefore
the appropriate point at which revenue should
be recognised.
How the scope of our audit responded to
the risk
Our audit work assessed the adequacy of the
design and implementation of controls over
long-term contract accounting. We reviewed
the contract risk registers and evidence for the
progress made against the contract such as
milestone completion, to confirm that revenue
and profit recognised to date are based on the
current best estimate of the degree of contract
completion. We understood and challenged
management’s assumptions by referring to
evidence including signed contract terms and
latest project status reports, and discussed
contract progress and future risks with contract
engineers. We also assessed the reliability of
management estimates through consideration
of the historical accuracy of prior period
management estimates. For each contract
selected for testing, we made enquiries as to
any unusual contract terms or side agreements
separate to the original contract.
In response to the risk of inappropriate revenue
recognition arising from complex contractual
terms, we reviewed contractual evidence to
understand how the specific terms in respect of
the transfer or risk and reward had been met. We
then performed a sample test of sales recognised
either side of the year end to assess whether the
appropriate terms of the relevant contracts had
been satisfied and that the risks and rewards
associated with the contract had passed to the
customer. We used external evidence, such as
shipping documentation or evidence of client
acceptance, to confirm that revenue had been
recognised in the appropriate period.
Opinion on financial statements of 
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the
Directors’ Report on page 58 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect
on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the
engagement team: Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 79
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement (continued)
Risk
Goodwill and other intangible assets
There is a risk regarding potential impairment
over the valuation of goodwill and intangible
assets arising on historical acquisitions.
In management’s impairment assessment there
are a number of key judgements in determining
the recoverable amount, including identification
of cash generating units, growth rates in future
cashflow forecasts and discount rates applied to
these forecasts.
How the scope of our audit responded to
the risk
We challenged the assumptions used by
management within their annual impairment
assessment through benchmarking the short and
long term growth rates to independently available
data, peer group analysis, our understanding of
the secured orders underpinning the Group’s
cashflow forecasts, and historical performance of
the business. In addition, valuation specialists
within the audit team provided additional
challenge over the discount rate applied to these
cashflows through the use of external
confirmation and benchmarking.
We independently identified the cash
generating units within the Group based on a
review of the cashflows internally reported by
management, and our understanding of the
Group structure.
Having audited the assumptions within
management’s annual impairment assessment,
we checked the arithmetical accuracy of the
impairment model using these assumptions.
Provisions
There is judgement required in respect of
potential provisions required on long-term
support arrangements and warranties, and
complex mission critical product manufacturing.
Consequently we have deemed the
appropriateness and completeness of provisions
made by management in respect of product
warranties and other provisions to be a risk.
We recalculated and assessed management’s
estimates for the provisions in conjunction with
our understanding of the potential liability as
set out in contract terms.
In respect of warranties, we assessed the level
of provisioning by verifying the actual failure
costs incurred to date and the products in
circulation subject to a warranty. We used
external evidence to evaluate this further,
including sales data and contract terms together
with any correspondence with third parties in
respect of product failures and claims.
In response to other provisions, we circularised
the Group’s external legal advisors and reviewed
legal costs incurred in the year to confirm the
completeness of legal cases to which the Group
is party. Through external evidence including
submitted legal advice and discussion with
management, we sought to corroborate the
basis for the Group’s expections over likely
outcomes and their subsequent quantification
of the related provisions.

Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Our application of materiality
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on pages 60 to 62.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures.
Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described
above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £8 million, which represents 7% of underlying 
pre-tax profit, and 2% of equity.
Underlying pre-tax profit was identified as being the main indicator of trading business performance,
and represents statutory pre-tax profit adding back impairment of goodwill, amortisation of
acquired intangible assets, adjustments to deferred consideration net of acquisition costs, defined
benefit pension interest charges, unwinding of discounts on provisions and the revaluation of
financial instruments based on their fair values.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences
in excess of £160,000 as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that
we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment,
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit at fifteen of the
Group’s twenty principal business units, all of which were subject to full audit. In addition the
remaining five business units were subject to an audit of specific account transactions and account
balances where the extent of our testing was focused on our Group audit risks and our assessment
of the risk of material misstatement.
The twenty locations represent the principal business units within the Group’s reportable segments
and account for 87% of the Group’s net assets, 91% of the Group’s revenue and 93% of the
Group’s underlying operating profit. They also provided an appropriate basis for undertaking audit
work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the twenty
units was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity, all of which were
lower than Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical
procedures to confirm that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the
aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of
specified account balances.
The Group audit team follows a programme of planned visits that has been designed so that the
Senior Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the
significant overseas components locations at least once every three years. Every year, regardless of
whether we have visited or not, we include the component audit partner and other senior members
of the component audit team in our team briefing, direct the scope of their work for the purposes
of our Group audit, discuss their risk assessment and review documentation of the findings from
their work.
Our assessment of risks of material
misstatement (continued)
Risk
Pensions
The Group operates four defined benefit pension
schemes, for which there is judgement in
determining the IAS 19 valuation as recorded at
the balance sheet date.
The valuation is based on a number of assumptions
on both a micro and a macro-economic level as
disclosed in the notes to the accounts.
How the scope of our audit responded to
the risk
We included pension specialists within our audit
team to assess the appropriateness of the
assumptions and methodology used to value
the defined benefit pension schemes at the
balance sheet date.
In addition, we circularised the independent
actuary and investment managers responsible for
managing the pension fund to confirm the source
inputs into the pension valuation. This confirmed
the completeness of the pension assets and the
valuation for which we further agreed a sample
to publically available asset valuations.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for
which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 81
Independent auditor’s report (continued)
Matters on which we are required to report
by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures
of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report
arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance
Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in
our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual
report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses
those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

2 Additional non-statutory performance measures
To present the underlying trading of the Group on a consistent basis year-on-year, additional non-statutory performance indicators have been
used. These are calculated as follows:
2013 2012
£’000 £’000
As restated*
Operating profit 57,398 88,271
Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 29,083 32,079
Impairment of goodwill (see note 13) 44,239 -
Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs (9,003) 1,494
Underlying operating profit 121,717 121,844
Profit before tax 49,281 79,818
Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 29,083 32,079
Impairment of goodwill (see note 13) 44,239 -
Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs (9,003) 1,494
Unwinding of discount on provisions (see note 26) 1,268 577
Profit on fair value movements of derivatives (1,470) (1,390)
Net interest charge on defined benefit pensions 3,408 3,924
Underlying profit before tax 116,806 116,502
Cash generated by operations (see note 29) 93,476 112,387
Purchase of property, plant and equipment (13,857) (20,470)
Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 1,280 67
Expenditure on product development and other intangibles (7,657) (4,659)
Dividend from equity accounted investment 2,825 765
Acquisition related payments 2,973 1,494
Underlying operating cash flow 79,040 89,584
Underlying operating profit has been shown before adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition related costs, the amortisation of
intangible assets arising on acquisitions and impairment of goodwill. To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer
term, these charges have been excluded from underlying operating profit. Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share (see note 12)
are also presented before these adjustments.
IAS 37 requires the Group to discount provisions using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability. In the case of the provision relating to the acquisition contingent consideration, to maintain a consistent presentation of financial
performance over the longer term, underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share (see note 12) are stated before the unwinding of discount
on the provision.
IAS 39 requires the Group to ‘fair value’ the derivative instruments used to manage Ultra’s foreign exchange exposures. This creates volatility in the
valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time. This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments,
but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates. Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share (see note 12) are
stated before changes in the valuation of foreign currency derivative instruments.
Following the adoption of IAS 19 (revised 2011), the Group has decided to present underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share
(see note 12) before the net interest charge on defined benefit pensions in order that the underlying operating performance of the Group can be
seen more clearly. The comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been restated as set out in note 36.
The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business. It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate
measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth. For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by
operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments. The Group
believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for
capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares
cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance. These plans,
which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU
over the next five years. The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum. Cash flows
beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross
margins. Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks
specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2013 varied between 12.3% and 13.8% (2012: 12.3% to 16.0%). Future revenues are based on orders already
received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates. Budget and
strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historical experience, available government spending data and management and industry
expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates. Longer-term growth rates, applied for
the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%. Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the
sectors in which it operates. Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also
reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development
and available markets. A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultra’s products and expertise from a number of US government
agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to:
(i) reduce the post-2018 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
(ii) apply a 10% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
(iii) consider specific market factors as noted above.
Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to potential impairments at GigaSat, Adaptive Materials Inc and Tactical Communications Systems.
Headroom for these businesses, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows:
GigaSat £1.6m, Adaptive Materials Inc £5.1m and Tactical Communication Systems £23.2m. Sensitivity assumptions (i) and (ii) would result in a
headroom shortfall at GigaSat of £0.3m and £1.3m respectively. Sensitivity (iii) is particularly relevant for Adaptive Materials Inc and accordingly if
assumption (ii) was extended further, a 28% reduction to forecast operating profits, representing a key programme, would indicate impairment.
Similarly, the Tactical Communication Systems CGU is also sensitive to specific market factors: a material delay in bringing a key programme to
market, combined with failure to secure sufficient business with new and existing customers would result in impairment.
The reduction in placement of US service contracts has particularly impacted the ProLogic business during 2013. The value-in-use of the ProLogic
CGU was lower than the carrying value of the CGU’s net operating assets and consequently an impairment charge of £44.2m has been recorded in
the year. The pre-tax discount rate used during this assessment was 13.8%. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of goodwill for the
ProLogic CGU as at 31 December 2013 is £nil. As set out in note 2, the £44.2m impairment charge has been included as part of the non-underlying
operating results of the Group. ProLogic is within the Information & Power Systems operating segment.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations comfortably exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.

Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group
mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned
by international credit rating agencies. 
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of large counter parties and customers, the customers are
mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships. The Group has a small
number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding. These customers are considered to have low credit risk. Ongoing credit
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Group’s credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements (see note 23) net of any allowances for losses represents the Group’s
maximum exposure to credit risk. 20 Trade and other payables

23 Financial instruments and financial risk management
Derivative financial instruments
Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Group’s business. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge
exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels
1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted (unadjusted) active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of Ultra’s financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk
The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Group’s banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland. During the year there were two facilities in
place; one provides £90 million of revolving credit and expires in January 2016 and a second, which was put in place in January 2013 to replace the
previous £120 million facility, provides £100 million of revolving credit which expires in December 2017. Both facilities are denominated in Sterling,
US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs. A further £15 million overdraft is
available for short-term working capital funding. 
All bank loans are unsecured. Interest was predominantly charged at 1.45% (2012: 1.50%) over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had available £163,000,000 (2012: £180,815,000) of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working
capital requirements. Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Group’s committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS), participates in two Canadian programmes
that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products. Further disclosure is provided in note 24. 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued)
Liquidity risk (continued)
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allowed the Group to issue loan
notes up to a value of USD150 million and with a maturity date of up to 10 years. USD10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity
date of July 2018 and a further USD60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019. Consequently as at 
31 December 2013 USD80 million remained available under the shelf agreement. On 2 January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend
the private shelf agreement for a three year period. Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 2 January 2017. The amendment also
increased the size of the shelf agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue.
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities:

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the
borrowings disclosed in note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk
The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk. The currencies giving
rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2013, the net fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately £6,487,000 (2012: £5,017,000),
comprising £7,533,000 assets (2012: £5,606,000) and £1,046,000 liabilities (2012: £589,000). The gain on derivative financial instruments included in
the Group’s consolidated income statement for the period was £1,470,000 (2012: £1,390,000).
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

Net investment hedges
At the year end the Group had net investments in US companies where the associated foreign currency translation risk is hedged by external
borrowings in US dollars. The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as
effective hedges.
Interest rate risk
The Group has USD70 million of long term fixed rate debt with an interest rate of 3.60%. This was entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of
fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Group’s policy. 
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities were as follows:

Market risk sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk
During 2013 the Group’s net borrowings were predominantly at fixed interest rates, consequently the income statement is not particularly sensitive
to a small change in interest rates. The Group has estimated the impact on the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from
the average rates applicable during 2013. There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in
the year.

exchange derivative instruments.

The Group through its Canadian subsidiaries Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems (UETCS) and Ultra Electronics Maritime Systems
(UEMS) participates in three Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative (SADI), the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect
of certain eligible research and development project costs. Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided to UETCS and reimbursed at
favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 to 2030. Up to $8m will be provided to UEMS and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over
the period 2020 to 2033. The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and
the fair value of the loans and has been credited to profit in the year. The fair value of the loans have been calculated using a market interest rate
for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreements were signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec (IQ) research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and
development of certain specified new products. Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified
projects. This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 to 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made. As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ
programme has been included in the income statement.

Relates to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £3.47 million (2012: £3.40 million) relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their
recoverability. There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015. The rate of 20% has been
used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2013 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.

Warranty provisions are based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience. Such costs are generally incurred within two
years after delivery. Contract related provisions will be utilised over the period as stated in the contract to which the specific provision relates.
Contract related provisions also include contingent consideration and dilapidation costs. Dilapidations will be payable at the end of the contracted
life which is up to fifteen years. Contingent consideration is payable when earnings targets are met: £9,363,000 of the provision was released in the
year when the 2013 GigaSat earn-out target was not met. As at 31 December 2013 the remaining contingent consideration provision is £7,679,000
(2012: £15,774,000), payment of which is contingent on a GigaSat results target for the period ending 30 June 2014.

The Group recognised total expenses of £1,859,000 (2012: £1,974,000) in relation to equity-settled, share-based payment transactions. Expected
volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The weighted average share price during the year was £17.65. The fair value of
options granted during the year was £1,869,986 (2012: £1,912,376).
The Group’s equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value for all
schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

For the 2011, 2012 and 2013 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the

*See note 36 31 Retirement benefit schemes
Some UK employees of the Group are members of the Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme which was established on 1 March 1994.
The scheme is a final salary scheme with the majority of members accruing 1/60th of their final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable
service. The scheme was closed to new members in 2003. A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in
the UK. The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2013. The Group also operates two defined
contribution schemes for overseas employees. In addition to these schemes, the Group’s Tactical Communication Systems business based in
Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes
The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was £4,916,000 (2012: £5,889,000).
Defined benefit schemes
The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2013 using the ‘projected unit’ method. The Canadian defined
benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2013 using the ‘projected unit’ method.
In the UK, Ultra Electronics Limited sponsors the Ultra Electronics Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is
administered within a trust which is legally separate from the Company. Trustees are appointed by both the Company and the scheme’s
membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the Company. The Trustees are also
responsible for the investment of the scheme’s assets.
This scheme provides pensions and lump sums to members on retirement and to their dependants on death. Members who leave service before
retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.
Active members of the scheme pay contributions via salary sacrifice and the Company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular
actuarial valuations. The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions to value the liabilities and costs of the scheme whereas the
accounting assumptions must be best estimates.
Responsibility for making good any deficit within the scheme lies with the Company and this introduces a number of risks for the Company.
The major risks are: interest rate risk; inflation risk; investment risk; longevity risk. The Company and Trustees are aware of these risks and
manage them through appropriate investment and funding strategies. The Trustees manage governance and operational risks through a
number of internal controls policies, including a risk register.
The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years. The actuarial valuation as at 6 April 2013
has been finalised and will result in an increase in the additional deficit payment required from £7.2m in 2013 to £8.0m in 2014, £8.5m in
2015 and £9.0m for the following 8.5 years. The next actuarial valuation is due to be carried out with an effective date of 6 April 2016. These
actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include deliberate margins for
prudence. This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.
The results of the 6 April 2013 valuation have been projected to 31 December 2013 by a qualified independent actuary. The figures in the
following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows:
UK Canada UK Canada
2013 2013 2012 2012
Discount rate 4.45% 4.45% 4.70% 4.70%
Inflation rate – RPI 3.40% 3.40% 2.85% 2.85%
Inflation rate – CPI 2.40% n/a 2.05% n/a
Expected rate of salary increases 3.90% 3.90% 3.35% 3.35%
Future pension increases (pre 6/4/08) 3.10% 3.40% 2.75% 2.85%
Future pension increases (post 6/4/08) 2.00% n/a 1.85% n/a
For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on
the level of the total obligation. For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 3.3% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to
4.55% would decrease the scheme’s liabilities by 1.8% and 1.9% respectively. If the members’ life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme
liabilities would increase by 2.9%. The average duration of the scheme liabilities is 19 years (2012: 22 years).
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners. Due to the size of the scheme the
mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely:
Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA/105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set
out below:
2013 2012
Current pensioners (at 65) – males 22 years 22 years
Current pensioners (at 65) – females 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – males 24 years 24 years
Future pensioners (at 65) – females 26 years 25 years

32 Acquisitions
Acquisitions during the year
In aggregate, consideration of £21.8m was paid in respect of acquisitions, all of which was discharged by means of cash and cash equivalents
and was made up as follows.
£’000
Cash outflow on subsidiaries acquired 26,374
Cash acquired with subsidiaries (4,623)
Net cash outflow 21,751

32 Acquisitions (continued)
Varisys
On 6 June 2013, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Varisys Limited for cash consideration of £20.4m. Additional amounts of up to £2m
will be payable to the vendors subject to performance and retention of the business founders over the next two years, and will be expensed to the
profit and loss account as incurred.
Varisys designs and manufactures products for high performance embedded computing applications. Its products and services portfolio include
bespoke solutions for customers operating in the aerospace, defence, telecommunications, and industrial sectors. The acquisition gives Ultra an
organic capability in this specialist, niche area, allowing Group businesses to meet customer requirements more quickly and cost-effectively. 
The provisional fair values of the net assets acquired are stated below:
Book value Revaluations Provisional fair value
£’000 £’000 £’000
Intangible assets - 9,741 9,741

Net assets acquired 5,001 7,497 12,498
Goodwill arising on acquisition 7,876
Purchase consideration 20,374
The net revenue and profit contributions from Varisys were approximately £1.9m and £2.9m respectively in the period from the date of acquisition
to 31 December 2013. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the strategic premium to gain access to Varisys’ market relative to an organic entry and to
the acquiree’s technology. 
Acquisition costs of £0.2m were charged to the income statement during the year.
The total goodwill on this acquisition expected to be deductible for tax is £nil. 
Wood & Douglas
On 28 October 2013, the Group acquired the entire share capital of Wood & Douglas Holdings Limited (W&D) for initial cash consideration of
£6.0m. A further £0.2m was paid in February 2014 following the net asset valuation exercise. Additional payments of up to £1m will be made
subject to earnings growth and retention of certain individuals over the next year, and will be expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
W&D delivers OEM and bespoke wireless products and services, such as radio networks, video monitoring and wireless data platforms, to industry
and governments. W&D customers are predominately active in the defence, homeland security, transportation, energy, emergency services,
exploration, healthcare, and utilities sectors.
The provisional fair values of the net assets acquired are stated below:

The net revenue and profit contributions from W&D were approximately £1.4m and £0.2m respectively in the period from the date of acquisition
to 31 December 2013. 
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is attributable to the value of synergies arising from the acquisition, the acquiree’s technology and future
profits arising from access to new markets.
Acquisition costs of £0.1m were charged to the income statement during the year.
The total goodwill on this acquisition expected to be deductible for tax is £nil.
Both Varisys Limited and Wood & Douglas Holdings Limited are UK companies. 33 Related party transactions
Remuneration of key management personnel
The remuneration of key management personnel, which includes the Directors of the Group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories
specified in IAS 24: Related Party Disclosures. Further information about the remuneration of individual Directors is provided in the audited part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 69, 70 and 72:
2013 2012

Transactions with associate
At 31 December 2013, a loan of £643,200 (2012: £657,000) was due from Al Shaheen Adventure LLC (ASA), the Group’s 49% equity-accounted
investment.
A small amount of trading also occurs with ASA, in the normal course of business and on an arm’s length basis. Balances are settled on normal
trade terms and the amounts outstanding at year end were insignificant.
34 Post balance sheet events
On 2 January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend the existing Prudential Investment Management, Inc (Pricoa) private shelf agreement
for a three year period. Consequently loan notes can now be issued up until 2 January 2017. The amendment also increased the size of the shelf
agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue.
Acquisition of 3 Phoenix Inc
On 18 February 2014, the Group acquired the entire share capital of 3 Phoenix Inc (“3Pi”) headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, for an initial cash
consideration of USD70.0m. Additional payments of up to USD17.0m will be due subject to earnings growth over the next three years. 
3Pi is a leading supplier of specialist sonar, radar, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance products and solutions. The company has a 10 year
track record of delivering critical real-time sensor and processing systems, primarily to the US Navy, but also to commercial customers. 3Pi is a bolt-on
acquisition to Ultra’s existing Tactical & Sonar Systems division, with which there are a significant number of internal and external synergies. 
The fair values of the net assets are currently being calculated and have not been finalised due to the proximity of the acquisition to the publication
of the 2013 financial statements. The proximity to the financial statements publication also makes it impractical to disclose any further information
with respect to this acquisition. Full disclosure will be made in the next published financial statements.
35 Contingent liabilities
The Group has entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business totalling £62.6m 
(2012: £57.4m). Provision is made for any amounts that the Directors consider may become payable under such arrangements, the provision as at
31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012 was £nil.
The nature of much of the contracting work performed by the Group means that there are occasional contractual issues, variations and renegotiations
that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course
of business. The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect upon the Group’s financial position.
36 Prior period restatement
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has impacted the accounting for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme by (i) replacing the interest cost and expected
return on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability, and (ii) reclassifying administration costs of the defined benefit
scheme from finance costs to administration expenses. There is no change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the change. The
comparative profit and loss account has been restated for the year ended 31 December 2012; the effect of adopting IAS 19 (revised 2011) is to
reduce previously reported profit before tax by £3.0m. Subsequent to the adoption of IAS19 (revised 2011), the Group has also elected to disclose
the finance expense on the net defined benefit pension liability as a specific adjusting item within the calculation of underlying profit before tax as
set out in note 2. Consequently, the comparative figure has been restated for the year ended 31 December 2012 and previously reported underlying

Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements
Statement of accounting policies
In respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently across the Group throughout the current and
preceding year, are set out below:
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). The financial statements have also
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
The following IFRIC interpretations, amendments to existing standards and new standards have been adopted in the current year but have not impacted
the reported results or the financial position:
• IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” 
The following standards were also adopted in the current year and have had the impact as set out below:
• IAS 1 “Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income”
• IAS 19 (revised 2011) “Employee Benefits”
The amendments to IAS 1 require items of other comprehensive income to be grouped by those items that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or
loss and those that will never be reclassified, together with their associated income tax. The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence
the presentation of items of comprehensive income has been restated to reflect the change. The amendment affected presentation only and had no
impact on the Group’s financial position or performance.
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has impacted the accounting for the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme by (i) replacing the interest cost and expected return
on plan assets with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability, and (ii) reclassifying administration costs of the defined benefit scheme from
finance costs to administration expenses. There is no change to the net pension liability or to net assets as a result of the change. The comparative profit
and loss accounts have been restated. Further detail is set out in note 36.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial
statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First Time Adopters
• Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: enhancing disclosures about the Transfers of Financial Assets, enhancing disclosures about
offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities and disclosures about the initial application of IFRS 9
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
• IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
• IAS 27 (Revised) Separate Financial Statements
• IAS 28 (Revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
• Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation – Amendments to application guidance on the offsetting of financial assets and 
financial liabilities
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group, except for:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – This will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments.
• IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 (Revised) Separate
Financial Statements and IAS 28 (Revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures – This will introduce additional disclosures within the notes to
the accounts.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivatives and assets held for sale which are measured
at fair value.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the statement on Corporate
Governance on page 58. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of Ultra Electronics Holdings plc (“the Company”) and its
subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from
its activities.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are measured at their
fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the income statement in the
period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 115
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and
liabilities of a subsidiary. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the
combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy
decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in
associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Sales of goods are normally recognised when
goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contracts in the same way as for long-term
contracts. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract
costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Revenue from long-term contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy on long-term contracts (see accounting policy
‘Long-term contracts’). 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Long-term contracts
Where the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the
contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to
the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and
incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer, or when it is considered probable that the customer will
approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation.
Where the outcome of a long-term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it
is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that
date. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the
income statement.
The trading results and cash flows of overseas undertakings are translated into sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, using the
average rates of exchange during the relevant financial period. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the
rates ruling at the year-end. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening balance sheets and results are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on the acquisition of foreign entities are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the
closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs as sterling
denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred, except where they relate to qualifying assets, in which case they
are capitalised. 116 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the expenditure towards which they are intended to contribute,
to the extent that the conditions for receipt have been met and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received.
Government assistance provided in the form of below market rate of interest loans are treated as government grants. The benefit of the below market
rate of interest is calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan and is matched against the related
expenditure. The fair value of the loan is calculated using prevailing market interest rates.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group provides pensions to its employees and Directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are
funded and their assets are held independently of the Group by trustees.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations
being carried out at each balance sheet date. The actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised
outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Any internally generated intangible asset arising from development activities is recognised only if an asset is created that can be identified, it is probable
that the asset created will generate future economic benefit and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be
recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Other intangible assets
Costs associated with producing or maintaining computer software programmes for sale are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are
directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, that will generate economic benefits
exceeding costs beyond one year and that can be measured reliably, are recognised as intangible assets. Capitalised software development expenditure
is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of
the related asset.
Acquired computer software licences for use within the Group are capitalised as intangible assets on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring
to use the specific software.
Patents and trademarks are stated initially at historical cost. Patents and trademarks have definite useful lives and are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination whose fair value can be reliably measured are separated from goodwill and amortised over their
remaining estimated useful lives.
Impairment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine
the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are
discounted to their present value. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so
that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for
the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, except for goodwill.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected
useful life as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years
Short leasehold improvements over remaining period of lease
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of
the relevant lease. Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 117
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals under operating leases, where the Group acts as either lessee or lessor, are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the
payments are not made on such a basis. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of
the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis and including an appropriate proportion of overheads incurred in bringing
the inventories to their present location and condition) and net realisable value. Provision is made for any obsolete, slow moving or defective items.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is
objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in-hand, call deposits and bank overdrafts, where there is right of set off. Bank overdrafts are presented as
current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Assets held for sale
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must
be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their fair value.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility
commitment, issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an
accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they
are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date
of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market related conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the share option plans and a stochastic model for awards made under the 2007 Long-Term
Incentive Plan.
The credits in respect of equity-settled amounts are included in equity.
Provisions
Provisions, including property related provisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, and where it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of repair and rectification of products under warranty, based on known exposures and historical occurrences.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to
affected parties. 
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 118 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies in respect of the Group’s consolidated financial statements (continued)
Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial instruments
Ultra uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate
and interest rate movements. Ultra does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities and measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. Changes in their fair
values are recognised in the income statement and this is likely to cause volatility in situations where the carrying value of the hedged item is not
adjusted to reflect fair value changes arising from the hedged risk. Provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met, hedge accounting may be used
to mitigate this income statement volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting will not generally be applied to transactional hedging relationships, such as hedges of forecast or committed transactions. However,
hedge accounting will be applied to translational hedging relationships where it is permissible under IAS 39. When hedge accounting is used, the
relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or
decrease in the fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent
that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the
fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement. Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. For cash flow hedges of forecasted future transactions, when the hedged item is recognised
in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged
items result in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. 
Income statement
Additional line items are disclosed in the consolidated income statement when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Non-statutory performance measures
In the analysis of the Group’s operating results, earnings per share and cash flows, information is presented to provide readers with additional performance
indicators that are prepared on a non-statutory basis. This presentation is regularly reviewed by management to identify items that are relevant to an
understanding of the Group’s performance with reference to their materiality and nature. This additional information is not uniformly defined by all
Companies and may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other organisations. The non-statutory disclosures should not be
viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent statutory measure.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
When applying the Group’s accounting policies, management must make a number of key judgements involving estimates and assumptions concerning
the future. These estimates and judgements are based on factors considered to be relevant, including historical experience, that may differ significantly
from the actual outcome. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include:
CONTRACT REVENUE AND PROFIT RECOGNITION
A significant proportion of the Group’s activities are conducted under long term contract arrangements and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11
Construction Contracts.
Revenue and profit on such contracts are recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date of the
particular contract and are calculated by reference to reliable estimates of contract revenue and expected costs. Expected costs are calculated after
taking account of the perceived contract risks related to performance not yet proven.  Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 119

1. Introduction 2. Strategic report 3. Governance 4. Group ﬁnancials 5. Company ﬁnancials 6. Five-year review
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
CONTRACT REVENUE AND PROFIT RECOGNITION (CONTINUED)
Owing to the complexity of some of the contracts undertaken by the Group the cost estimation process requires significant judgement and is carried out
using the experience of the Group’s engineers, project managers and finance and commercial professionals. Because of the level of judgement required,
cost estimates are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the Group’s established project management processes. Some of the factors that will
impact upon cost estimates include the availability of suitably qualified labour, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of
materials, the impact of change orders and the performance of sub-contractors.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where services are rendered, sales are recognised when the stage of completion of the services and the related revenue and costs can be measured reliably. 
Where goods are delivered under arrangements not considered to fall under the scope of IAS 11 Construction Contracts, revenue is recognised when
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Group accounts for its post-retirement pension plans in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined periodically by independent actuaries and charged to the income
statement in the period in which those benefits have been earned by the employees. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in
which they arise and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the scheme liabilities as reduced by the fair value of
the scheme assets.
The main assumptions used in determining the defined benefit post retirement obligation include the discount rate used in discounting scheme
liabilities, the inflation rate, the expected rate of salary inflation, the expected rate of future pension increases, expected returns on scheme assets and
future mortality assumptions. For each of these assumptions, there is a range of possible values. Relatively small changes in some of these variables can
have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
The valuation of pension scheme assets and liabilities at a specific point of time rather than over a period of time can lead to significant annual
movements in the pension scheme deficit as calculated under IAS 19, but has no impact on short-term cash contributions since these are based upon
separate independent actuarial valuations.
Details of the pension scheme assumptions and obligation at 31 December 2013 are provided in note 31.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in intangible assets.
IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in valuing these intangible assets
requires the use of estimates and judgements, that may differ from the actual outcome. These estimates and judgements cover future growth rates,
expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
GOODWILL
Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating
units (CGU’s). These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGU’s. Further details
on these estimates are provided in note 13.
INCOME TAXES
In determining the Group’s provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions
for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will
be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.  120 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc

On 2 January 2014 the Group agreed an amendment to extend the existing Prudential Investment Management, Inc (Pricoa) private shelf agreement

agreement so USD125 million of notes remain available for issue. 124 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc
Statement of accounting policies for the Company accounts
A summary of the Company’s principal accounting policies, which has continued to apply United Kingdom accounting standards, all of which have been
applied consistently throughout the year and preceding year in the separate financial information presented for the Company, are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The Company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. No
profit and loss account is presented for the Company, as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s retained profit for the
year is disclosed in note 47.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are shown at original historical cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:
Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years
Taxation
UK Corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. These arise from
including gains and losses in tax assessments in different periods from those recognised in the financial statements. A net deferred tax asset is regarded
as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Retirement benefit costs
The Company provides pensions to its employees and Directors through defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are
funded and their assets are held independently of the Group by trustees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account for defined benefit schemes is the estimated regular cost of providing the benefits accrued in the
period adjusted to reflect variations from the cost. The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and
future pensionable payroll. Any difference between the amount charged to the profit and loss account and contributions paid to the pension scheme is
shown as a separately identifiable liability or asset in the balance sheet.
Certain employees and Directors participated in the UK defined benefit scheme operated by Ultra Electronics Limited. Paragraph 9(b) of FRS 17 allows
for a defined benefit scheme to be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme where there are multi-employers and one employer is unable to
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis. The Ultra Electronics Limited defined benefit scheme has
been accounted for on this basis. The deficit in the scheme at 31 December 2013 was £85.2 million (2012: £82.0 million). Further disclosures in relation
to this pension scheme are given in note 31 to the Group financial statements. Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an
expense as they fall due.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the statement on Corporate
Governance on page 58.
Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at the actual exchange rates at the date of the transactions (or, where
appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the
balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date (or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward
exchange contract). Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain
or loss in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of an option pricing model, using the assumptions disclosed within the Group accounts
in note 27.
Related parties
The Company has taken the FRS 8 (revised) exemption from disclosure of transactions between wholly-owned subsidiaries. Remuneration of the
Directors is provided in the audited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 69, 70 and 72.
Loans and overdrafts
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs where there is a facility commitment. In these
circumstances issue costs are deducted from the value of the loan and amortised over the life of the commitment. Where there is no facility commitment,
issue costs are written-off as incurred. Finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an accruals basis
in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.

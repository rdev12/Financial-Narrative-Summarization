Chairman’s statement
*See Financial highlights.
The last financial year has again seen good progress for 
Halma. Revenue from continuing operations increased 14% to
£354.6 million (£310.8 million in 2006) with underlying organic
growth* of 8.1% despite adverse currency effects of 2.3% i.e.
10.4% at constant currency . Profit before tax and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles on continuing operations was £66.1 million
(2006: £58.1 million) an increase of 14%, organic growth* at
constant currency was 10.1%. This organic profit growth*
compares with an equivalent figure of 14% in 2006 where we
benefited from the rebound in the Water business, so in the year
under review we faced slightly tougher comparables. Statutory
profit before tax increased by 11% to £62.6 million. The Board is
recommending a final dividend of 4.33p per share, an increase 
of 5% for the year and our 28th consecutive year of dividend
increases of 5% or more. Our dividend cover has increased to
1.74 times (2006: 1.61 times). Return on total invested capital*
was 14.0% (2006: 12.8%).
We have also made a number of acquisitions during the year:
Mikropack, Baldwin Environmental and Labsphere in the Health
and Analysis sector and T ritech and System T echnologies in 
the Industrial Safety sector . In total we invested £27 million in
acquisitions with a maximum potential of a further £5 million in
deferred consideration. After the positive action taken in the
previous year , no disposals were made during the period under
review . At the end of the year our net debt was £7.7 million.
During the year we have seen a continuous flow of new
products, some of which are detailed in this report. We are 
also beginning to see results from our investments in China.
During the year seven additional companies within the Group
established a local presence there and during the coming year
we expect several more to commence.
Our investment in people continues apace with enthusiastic
attendance at our management training programmes and it is
pleasing to see the energy with which attendees return to their
companies, refreshed, invigorated, having learnt much, but more
importantly , with a network of colleagues who actively support
each other on all aspects of our business such as selling,
innovation, technology and quality .
All of these investments, together with our investments in
strengthening our selling and distribution resources, feed 
and support our strategy for healthy organic growth, so it is
encouraging to see that this focus continues to bear fruit. 
This also gives us even more confidence that we can deliver
significant value for shareholders from acquisitions that fit our
strategic framework and meet our strict acquisition criteria.
Furthermore we have significant financial resource at our
disposal to do more.
In March, Andrew Walker stepped down from the Board and 
I should like to record our thanks for all his contribution during 
his four-year tenure as a non-executive Director of the Group 
and wish him well for the future.
On behalf of the Board, I should also like to thank all our
employees for producing such a good performance.
In summary , another good year with continuing investment 
in people, innovation, market development and acquisitions. 
This, together with strong and effective leadership from our
management team, gives us confidence for the future.
Geoff Unwin Chairman
Another good year with continuing
investment in people, innovation,
market development and acquisitions. 04 Halma p.l.c. 2007
Chief Executive’s strategic review
Record revenues and profits once
again demonstrating our ability to
deliver organic growth.
Record results with 8% organic profit growth*
We have achieved record revenues and profits once again,
demonstrating our ability to deliver organic growth which is the
primary measure of our success. For continuing operations, total
revenues increased by 14%, including 8% organic growth*, with
total profits before amortisation of acquired intangibles also
increasing by 14%, including 8% organic*. Impressively , these
significant increases were achieved despite a 2% to 3% adverse
currency impact during the year .
Strong returns and cash flow supports record dividend 
and investment
Return on sales* (2007: 18.6%; 2006: 18.7%), Return on 
capital employed* (2007: 60.1%; 2006: 56.9%) and Return on 
total invested capital* (2007: 14.0%; 2006: 12.8%) all remained
strong or increased in accordance with our objective of
generating growth without diluting the quality of our returns.
Cash flow was good and we ended the year with £7.7 million net
debt having funded five acquisitions, significant organic growth
and a further dividend increase of 5%.
Acquisitions completed in targeted markets
The Group completed five acquisitions during the year . 
Two of these acquisitions, Mikropack (April 2006) and Baldwin
Environmental (September 2006) added new products to 
two of our leading Health and Analysis businesses and 
were merged with these existing businesses immediately 
on completion. Of greater significance were T ritech/System
T echnologies (November 2006) and Labsphere (February 2007)
who are world leaders in subsea asset monitoring (Industrial
Safety) and light measurement (Health and Analysis) respectively .
All five businesses have performed well since joining the Group.
We have allocated more resources to our acquisition search
activity as acquisitions continue to be an important element 
of our long-term growth plans.
Growth in all business sectors and all global regions
Each of Halma’s three business sectors achieved record
revenues and profits.
> Infrastructure Sensors grew strongly with profits up 16% from
17% revenue growth following the increased investment in
sales and product development made last year .
> Health and Analysis performed well generating a 7% increase
in profits from revenue up 9%. This sector makes just under
half of all the Group’s sales into markets where the currency is
US$ (or US$-related) and bore the brunt of adverse currency
movements during the year .  Halma p.l.c. 2007   05
Strategic achievements
> 8% organic revenue and profit growth drives record results
> Five acquisitions add technology and a new 
sub-sector business
> Seven Group companies newly represented in Halma hubs 
in Shanghai and Beijing
> 60 senior managers completed Halma Executive 
Development Programme
> More than 70 new products launched during 2006/07
Strategic directions
> Organic growth to exceed 5% p.a.
> T argeted acquisitions
> Build on Chinese hubs and grow revenues in Asia
> Continued management development
> Maintain strong new product introduction
*See Financial highlights.
> Industrial Safety proved once again to be a strong and
consistent performer with revenue growth of 15% driving
profits up by 19%.
Geographically , revenues and profits increased in each major
territory . The UK and mainland Europe proved to be particularly
strong and our Industrial Safety businesses benefited from
continuing high investment in the oil, gas and petrochemical
industries – especially in the Middle East.
Many of our products are used to protect or improve the
environment which offers us exciting opportunities for growth. 
In addition, we recognise that we can do more to minimise the
impact that our business activities have on the environment and
believe we can do this by increasing efficiencies thereby creating
further value for shareholders. Examples of the actions we are
taking are included in the Business and financial review .
Greater activity in Asia
Revenues to Asia Pacific and Australasia grew by 7% and
continue to represent around 10% of Group sales. Over the
medium term, this region offers growth rates in excess of the
Group average and, as announced previously , we created Halma
“hubs” in Shanghai and Beijing in August 2006 to accelerate
business development by our subsidiaries in the region. 
This is a good example of how the Group can help our
businesses to develop more quickly without compromising 
their autonomy and freedom. We regularly review the
opportunities for similar Group initiatives in other regions, 
markets or functional areas.
Product and process innovation driving organic growth
We maintained a healthy level of investment in Research &
Development (R&D) (4.3% of revenues) and capital expenditure.
These investments are critical factors in our ability to sustain
growth through increasing innovation in products and processes.
Over 70 new products were launched by Halma companies
during the year , providing encouragement for our future growth
prospects. Some of these products resulted from collaboration
amongst Group companies.
Increasing investment in talented people
Developing and growing businesses already performing at a
high level is a challenging task and I would like to thank each
employee in every Halma company for their contribution to
another successful year for the Group.
We have worked hard in recent years to change our culture 
from being too inwardly focussed on managing returns. This has
included major people changes with over 65% of our subsidiary
managers having joined the Group in the past four years. 
Increased investment in training and development, including the
flagship Halma Executive Development Programme (HEDP)
launched 18 months ago, is translating into improved financial
performance and greater strategic clarity throughout the Group.
By the end of 2007, over 80 of our senior managers will have
benefited from the HEDP . 
This commitment to improving our people resources means that
internal promotions are now a more realistic and frequent option.
Accordingly , it was pleasing for me to promote Mark Lavelle to
the Executive Board in April 2007 following five successful 
years as Managing Director of Keeler , one of our Health and
Analysis businesses. This coincided with a change of divisional
responsibilities in the Executive Board to ensure we continue to
provide fresh insights and new approaches for our businesses.
Halma’s long-term growth record continues
Since 1970, Halma has increased revenue every year bar 
two. T oday we have very modest net debt of £7.7 million having 
self-funded organic growth, acquisitions and paid dividends to
shareholders over the years totalling £235 million, excluding the
final dividend proposed for this year .
So what has changed over the past two years to give us a new
confidence that we can attain even higher levels of success?
Simply that our proven ability to choose sustainable growth
markets is being boosted with greater ambition, customer focus,
more innovation, new technologies and stronger management
resources all driven with a clear strategy for each part of our
business. These results demonstrate that we are making good
progress and we remain positive about our prospects for the
year and the longer term.

hub offices in Shanghai and Beijing. From these hubs we offer subsidiaries fully-serviced offices. 
They are supported by experienced local managers providing administrative, marketing, human
resources and legal services.  
When Ocean Optics set up a new direct sales operation in China in 2006, they quickly established 
a sales and support network based on the Halma hub office in Shanghai. Now well established with
growing sales, they have moved into their own premises. 10 Halma p.l.c. 2007 People in action

Investment in innovation
We invest heavily in R&D to maintain competitive advantage via technological innovation. 
Continuous innovation is critical to our growth strategy . 
We know that successful innovation in business processes and products needs more than
imaginative ideas. It demands enthusiasm, resources and perseverance to drive a new concept 
to completion. Successful innovators continue to develop their ideas, use failures to trigger even 
better ideas and never give up. These employees are vital to our success and we have strategies 
to support and encourage them. T o give innovation a high profile we award annual and monthly
innovation prizes, we run innovation and creativity training courses and organise Group-wide

Acquiring entrepreneurs
Acquiring a business is not purely a financial exercise. We are interested in intellectual assets more
than physical assets and search for successful companies in, or adjacent to, the markets we already
operate in. We are always keen to 'acquire' the dynamic entrepreneurs who built the business through
leadership, determination, single-minded pursuit of opportunities and calculated risk-taking. We have
a highly decentralised, entrepreneurial culture. As a result, owners of acquired companies feel
comfortable within the Group and often remain in position after selling their businesses. Over the

Key performance indicators
Financial key performance indicators (KPIs) used by the Board 
to monitor progress are listed in the table on the left. Similar
indicators are used to review performance in our three sectors.
KPIs are calculated on results from continuing operations.
We have delivered an impressive performance against our 
KPI targets. The prior year comparatives for 2006/07 were
demanding as, unlike that year , there were no “recovery”
situations in the current year to benefit from. Underlying 
organic profit growth remained healthy and was again 
driven by top line growth rather than cost reduction.
Strong Return on sales, ROCE and ROTIC metrics confirm
Halma’s ability to deliver growth without diluting the quality of its
returns. Indeed, the increase in ROTIC indicates enhanced value
creation for shareholders.
R&D investment remained high relative to many of our peers
reflecting both increased innovation activity and an overall uplift
in the technology level of Group companies due to M&A actions
in the past two years. Further discussion of the Group’s financial
performance is given in the Financial review later in this 
Annual report. Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   21

Strategy and business objectives
Our strategy for driving growth and creating shareholder value
centres on five key principles:
> Operate in specialised global markets offering long-term
growth underpinned by robust growth drivers;
> Build businesses which lead specialised global markets
through innovative products differentiated on performance
and quality rather than price alone;
> Recruit and develop top quality boards to lead our businesses
and nurture an entrepreneurial culture within a framework of
rigorous financial discipline;
> Acquire companies and intellectual assets that extend 
our existing activities, enhance our entrepreneurial culture, 
fit into our decentralised operating structure and meet our
demanding financial performance expectations;
> Achieve a high Return on capital employed to generate 
cash efficiently and to fund organic growth, closely targeted
acquisitions and sustained dividend growth.
Organic growth is the key to our value creation strategy . 
The “blended” long-term growth rate of our markets is around
5% per year and our aim is to grow faster than our markets.
Following a strong year in 2005/06, achieving 8% organic growth
in 2006/07 was an excellent result and represents a second year
of good progress following low organic growth in the preceding
years 2000 to 2005.
R&D and innovation play an important role. Strategically , we aim
to provide technical resources within each business as close 
as possible to the customer . Whilst respecting the autonomy 
of subsidiary companies, we encourage collaboration between
Halma companies and see this as a potential competitive
advantage that has been under-utilised in the past. During
2006/07, the increased collaboration started to bear fruit with
new products launched incorporating technology and know-how
from two or more Halma companies. These included fire
products, which combined visual and audible alarm modules
together with our market leading smoke detectors.
Our businesses build competitive advantage and strengthen
barriers to entry in many ways including patents, product
approvals, technical innovation, product quality , customer service
levels and branding. We look for these qualities in the businesses
we seek to acquire. We like regulated markets which require
suppliers to achieve compliance with demanding product
standards but also look for other robust long-term growth 
drivers such as demographic change.
How we operate
We cultivate a highly decentralised operating culture which
encourages our businesses to focus on establishing market
leadership in their selected niche within a global market. 
Each subsidiary is led by a management team who enjoy
genuine autonomy and the freedom to grow in an 
entrepreneurial environment.
These management teams are chaired by Halma’s Divisional
Chief Executives (DCEs) who understand the market needs 
and can contribute broadly to the individual company’s strategy
in technical, operational and commercial areas. These DCEs
meet with the Group Chief Executive regularly to review 
progress against their operating division’s strategic objectives.
Through the regular interaction between the Group’s Executive
Board members, common challenges and opportunities for 
Group businesses are identified which sometimes leads to a
central initiative. Examples of initiatives underway are sales
process improvement, innovation, people development and
increasing activity in China via our Halma hubs in Shanghai 
and Beijing.
DCEs are responsible for finding, negotiating, completing and
managing acquisitions in their own business sectors. Acquisition
costs, including goodwill, are incorporated in the incentive plans
of all Executive Board members.
When new acquisitions join Halma they invariably retain their
name and identity , and vendors often continue to work with 
us. Elsewhere entrepreneurs who typically find working in a large
international organisation too constraining welcome our
autonomous culture and decentralised structure which allows
them to develop further .
Outlook
2006/07 marked another year of good progress for the Group
with record revenues and profits. Significant investment continues
in R&D , capital expenditure and strengthening channels to
market. This combination of delivering strong results whilst
increasing investment provides a solid platform from which 
it is possible for the Group to sustain organic growth above
market rates.
Good quality prospects for further acquisitions in our target
markets exist and acquisitions will continue to play an important
role in the Group’s long-term growth.
We have clear growth strategies for our markets and we continue
to work hard to improve the quality of our execution through
active resource allocation and people development. We are 
well placed to deliver sustained growth and enter the new year 
in good shape. 22 Halma p.l.c. 2007 Business and financial review

Sector overview
Infrastructure Sensors, our largest business, contributes 
44% of Group revenue (£155 million) and 41% (£28 million) 
of Group profit
†
. Our principal products are sensors for fire, 
security , automatic doors and elevator controls. There are four
sub-sectors:
Fire detection We make fire and smoke detectors and
audible/visual warning devices. We are the second largest
manufacturer of point smoke detectors in the world. We make fire
products in the UK and US, with sales offices in the US, Europe,
Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
Security sensors We have a strong presence in this strategically
important and fast growing market. We are the market leaders 
in the UK and South Africa for security sensors used in public
and commercial property*. These products are made in the UK.
Automatic door sensors We are one of the world’s largest
manufacturers of sensors used on automatic doors in public 
and commercial buildings*. These products are made in China,
Belgium and the US.
Elevator safety We are the world’s largest manufacturer of
elevator/lift door safety sensors*. We also make emergency
communication devices, display modules and control panels 
for elevators. These products are made in the UK, the Czech
Republic, New Zealand, the US, China and Singapore.
Sector strategy
Our strategy in this sector is to become the leading supplier 
of safety-critical sensor components used in non-residential
building monitoring and control systems. We focus on specialist
components, not complete installed systems. The global
manufacturers of complete building infrastructure systems 
see us as a strategic partner or specialist supplier of advanced
technology components rather than a direct competitor .
T o support our Elevator safety sales growth, during the past 
year we organised our companies into three regional businesses
covering Asia, Europe and North America. Our strategy is to
boost competitiveness by presenting customers with a single,
seamless source for our complete range of elevator safety
products in each region. As part of a strategy of getting closer 
to elevator customers than our competitors, we opened new
regional sales offices in Delhi, Houston and T oronto adding 
to the new offices opened in Asia and the Middle East last year .
Continuous manufacturing cost reduction remains a key 
strategic activity within this sector balanced by the need to
remain close to our customers. Consequently , we will continue 
to invest significantly in our Czech and Chinese factories.
† See note 1 to the accounts Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   23
Market trends
A significant trend in the Infrastructure Sensors market sector is
rising demand for integrated fire, security , evacuation and access
systems. T o accommodate this need, we have developed a new
technology platform which will be licensed to our fire alarm
system partners so that our fire detectors can be specified 
in buildings with integrated fire and security monitoring.
Worldwide demand for fire detectors remains strong. With an
estimated growth rate of 18%, China continues to offer the
highest revenue growth potential. Europe, where our fire product
revenues grew by over 15%, reversed the downward trend of 
last year due to recovery in the German market.
Downward pricing pressure continues in the fire detector market,
particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Further investment in our
sales channels, coupled with increased spending on R&D and
the supply chain, delivered continued growth in these markets
and gross margins remained solid.
Our ability to innovate and respond rapidly to frequent regulatory
changes maintains competitive advantage. In addition to new
technical standards, during the past year we accommodated
new regulations covering: safe disposal and recycling of waste
electrical products (WEEE Directive); restrictions on the use of 
hazardous substances in electrical products (RoHs Directive);
and enhanced electromagnetic compatibility standards 
(CPD Directive).
Our Security sensors sell into a global market worth over 
£2 billion annually , which continues to grow at 6% per year .
Following our acquisition of T execom in November 2005, 
we established a strong presence in the UK and South African
markets and are making good progress towards gaining the
necessary product approvals to sell our products into China 
and the US. These markets offer us significant growth potential
and we will be using expertise in our other Infrastructure 
Sensors businesses to develop our presence more rapidly .
Our internal estimate is a 3% to 4% global growth rate for the
automatic door safety market. We have high market shares in
Europe and the US where many of our competitors have chosen
low prices as their main competitive strategy . Our strategy to
maintain our margins and market share by reducing production
costs and introducing new market leading products tailored for
each region, continued to be successful.
We believe that the global market growth rate for new 
elevators (and elevator services) is in the region of 5% to 6%.** 
We calculate the annual value of the elevator markets that 
we serve at £180 million. The Middle East, India and China 
offer the highest growth rates for elevator safety sensors. 
Price competition is prevalent; severe in China, but moderate 
in Europe and the US.
New European legislation called “Safety Norm EN-81”, designed
to improve elevator safety and accessibility for people with
disabilities, boosted European demand for our products in the
building modernisation market.
Sector performance
Our Fire detector businesses produced record revenues and
profits. In 2006/07, organic revenue and profit growth was more
than double market growth rates thereby increasing market
share while improving profitability . More than 10 significant new
fire products were introduced and we obtained 450 new product
approvals for global markets.
Despite strong revenue growth, profit growth from security
sensor products suffered from currency volatility as well as high
investment in new markets and product development. 
Even with strong price competition in the automatic door sensor
market, both revenues and profits grew significantly . We
maintained our high market shares in Europe and the US and
defended our good profit margins partly by cutting production
costs through increased investment in our Chinese
manufacturing capacity . However , we also benefited from
launching innovative, market leading products, such as the 4Safe
sensor which prevents people from being trapped or injured in
automatic, revolving or swing doors. New legislation boosted
sales of 4Safe in Germany .
Last year we began to increase our direct presence in key
developing elevator markets and this year both revenue and
profit moved ahead.  We countered a slight dip in margins in 
the past year with new , lower cost products and by cutting
production costs. Revenues from offices set up in Dubai and
Mumbai have grown very successfully , whilst progress in new
regional offices in China has been more varied.
ROCE for the sector as a whole continues to be excellent.
Sector outlook
With our Fire detector and Automatic door sensor businesses
achieving solid organic profit growth on increased revenues, 
a flow of new products aimed at diversification and market
expansion is planned to drive growth. Continued strengthening of
senior management and IT investment in our Security sensor and
Elevator safety businesses is well underway to improve the
potential for profit growth in these businesses in the future.

. There are four
principal sub-sectors:
Water We estimate that we are the world leaders in monitoring
and finding leaks in underground water pipelines and among 
the world leaders in UV technology for disinfecting and treating
water . We manufacture our water products in the UK, 
The Netherlands, France and the US.
Fluid technology We make critical components such as pumps,
probes, valves, connectors and tubing used by scientific,
environmental and medical diagnostic instrument manufacturers
for demanding fluid handling applications. These products are
made in the US and UK.
Photonics We have market leading technologies and products
which generate, measure and condition light and analyse the
interaction of light with substances. We have manufacturing sites
in the US, Germany and The Netherlands.
Health optics We make handheld devices used to assess 
eye health, diagnose disease and assist with eye surgery . 
Our ophthalmic products are made in the UK and the US.
Sector strategy
In Water management we aim to be the technology leaders and
offer water utilities worldwide new solutions to their water supply
problems. Our Water UV treatment growth strategy is to unlock
new regulated markets via further product validations, and to
adapt existing product lines for new applications.
We aim to grow our Fluid technology business by broadening 
our product range and our presence outside of our traditional 
US stronghold both via organic growth and acquisitions.
Geographic expansion and innovative product development are
our twin organic growth strategies for Photonics. The Mikropack
and Labsphere acquisitions completed this year added
complementary light generation and measurement technologies.
We will seek further photonics acquisitions which we can grow
rapidly using our well-established sales channels.
In Health optics, higher R&D investment is resulting in an
increased rate of new product introduction. This will enable 
us to grow market share in developed countries whilst we build
sales channels in the developing world for the longer term.
† See note 1 to the accounts Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   25
Market trends
Confidential market research values the US market for UV water
treatment plant at £120 million annually which our internal
estimates suggest equates to the rest of the world’s combined
markets. Market growth is estimated to be over 15%, driven by
increasing health regulation and an expanding industrial
customer base including semiconductors, aquaculture and
leisure pools.
Regulation plays an increasingly important role in developing
regional water markets. The US Environmental Protection Agency
recently issued guidance* that will accelerate adoption of UV
treatment for controlling water-borne diseases in drinking water .
EU expansion is driving demand; new member states must adopt
EU health and safety regulations. 
Using internal data, we estimate that the global market for water
pipework monitoring and leak location equipment is worth over
£45 million annually . We estimate the market has grown by 7% 
per year for the past four years and we anticipate similar growth
as a minimum for the next five years.
In Fluid technology , there has been greater consolidation within
the clinical diagnostic instrumentation market than in previous
years due to M&A activity . We are broadening our product
offering into the medical and environmental instrumentation
segments which are also growing fast. For example, China plans
to invest £87 billion between 2006 and 2010 on environmental
protection projects**.
Photonics continues to offer us exciting organic and acquisition
growth prospects. We are global leaders in the miniature
spectrometer market niche which we estimate to be worth 
£70 million annually and growing at 15% per year .
The use of photonic methods is increasing rapidly in a vast 
range of end markets. The advantages of optical sensors over
traditional methods can include lower cost, greater sensitivity , 
in-situ measurement capability (particularly in hazardous
environments), immunity from electromagnetic interference,
repeatability and stability . Over 60% of Halma companies use 
optical technologies.
Growth drivers for our Health optics products include rising
demand for eye care due to demographic changes in the
developed world plus increasing access to health services 
in developing countries. We estimate*** that the health optics
market is growing in developing countries by 5% annually and
2% to 3% worldwide.
New ophthalmic products undergo lengthy clinical trials and
rigorous medical product regulation which is a disincentive 
to market entrants. Digital and video imaging technology 
for examining the eye continues to evolve and a disruptive
technology could emerge to change the market dynamics in 
the medium term. We continue to monitor this closely and have
established relationships with some of the leading digital 
imaging companies where our products can be complementary
to their technology .
Sector performance
In our Water businesses we consolidated the strong recovery
achieved in 2005/06. Although progress in the US market
remained patchy , revenues in European markets rose sharply .
Fluid technology revenues increased although profits were flat
due to increased investment in new products as well as in sales
and distribution. 
Revenues and profits from Photonics products grew to record
levels. A new photonics sales and technical support office was
opened in Shanghai and European activities were strengthened
by the Mikropack acquisition.
In Health optics our strong brand positioning and a healthy
stream of new and enhanced products delivered record
revenues and profit.
The increased rate of investment in R&D (now 5.3% of revenue)
is an important element in maintaining the excellent operating
returns in this sector .
Sector outlook
New product innovation and technical collaboration are
increasingly important organic growth drivers. 
Geographic expansion into developed and developing regions
offers further organic growth opportunities and we hope to
benefit from the higher investment in 2006/07 in the coming year .
Increased acquisition search resources are identifying
opportunities which can strengthen our technology and 
market presence.
This combination of organic and acquisitive growth prospects
should lead to further progress during 2007/08.

Sector overview
Industrial Safety contributed 22% of Group revenue (£80 million)
and 23% of Group profit
†
(£16 million). Following recent
acquisitions, we created a new Asset monitoring sub-sector .
Gas detection We make portable instruments and fixed systems
which detect flammable and hazardous gases. We make our gas
detectors in the UK where we have a market leading position.
Bursting discs We make “one time use” pressure relief devices to
protect large vessels and pipework in process industries. We are
UK market leaders and, based on our own estimates, number
four in the world market. Our bursting discs are made in the UK
and the US.
Safety interlocks We make specialised mechanical, electrical 
and electromechanical locks which ensure that critical processes
operate safely and prevent accidents. We have significant 
market strength in petrochemicals, oil and gas, and significant
geographic market share in Western Europe and Australasia. 
We manufacture interlocks in the UK, The Netherlands, France,
T unisia and Australia.
Asset monitoring We make products which monitor the condition
of physical assets above ground, below ground and underwater
using innovative sensor and communications technologies. 
This sub-sector was created following the acquisitions of Radio-
T ech in 2005 and, most recently T ritech/System T echnologies in
November 2006. Underwater applications include monitoring of
oil pipelines and telecommunications cables as well as vessel
and harbour security . Applications on dry land include systems
for monitoring railway tracks and structures such as bridges. 
Our asset monitoring products are made in the UK.
Sector strategy
We choose to operate in global industrial safety market niches
which demand innovative, robust technologies to protect against
critical safety hazards where the cost of the protecting product 
is relatively small compared with the cost of an accident.
Competitive advantage can be gained through technical
innovation and superior customer service and technical support.
Strong global competition in gas detectors means that we must
have a dual strategy of constant cost reduction and a regular
stream of new products. In the next year we plan to start
manufacturing in China and are already using R&D resources 
in India to accelerate the rate of product development.
† See note 1 to the accounts Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   27
Our Bursting disc companies continue to develop their
distribution network to improve market share. Capital investment
in plant, improved processes, product rationalisation and
outsourcing of component supplies have cut production costs
and increased competitiveness by reducing lead times.
Our strong position in the global market for Safety interlocks
dictates that we not only have to protect our position through
new products and market leading customer service but also find
ways to broaden our market opportunity . For example we are
adding safety interlock capability to adjacent product categories
like the new eGard product which marries safety interlocking with
machine control.
In Asset monitoring we see a significant opportunity in satisfying
the growing worldwide demand for remote monitoring of
expensive or safety critical physical assets – particularly those 
in hazardous or remote locations.
Market trends
Our internal assessment of the global market for gas detection
products is £500 million; we forecast an average annual growth
rate of 3% to 4%. The demand for gas detection products
remains robust in the developed industrial countries. The gradual
adoption of Western safety standards in the fast-growing Asian
economies will drive additional demand in these markets.
Our internal data suggest that the market for bursting discs is
growing at 3% to 4%. Substantial continued investment by our
customers in lower cost labour markets, and the transfer of US
and European safety standards is leading us to allocate more of
our resources into developing regions such as Eastern Europe
and Asia.
In addition to increasing safety awareness and regulation, the
safety interlock market continues to benefit from the trend of
increasing capital spending in the oil and gas sector driven 
by relatively high oil prices and global demand. High-profile
accidents at petrochemical processing plants during the past 
18 months have impacted on customer behaviour with some oil
companies now specifying safety interlocks earlier in the plant
design phase.
Customer feedback suggests that Chinese authorities are now
encouraging Western companies with manufacturing plants 
in China to adopt the same safety standards as in their home
territory . Over the medium term, this will help to improve industrial
safety expectations throughout China and drive demand for 
our products.
Rising global demand for closer monitoring of energy usage 
and for capturing data relating to high value infrastructure assets,
offers excellent growth prospects for our Asset monitoring
businesses. Our recent acquisition, T ritech, serves an exciting
niche in subsea sensors and communication products which
help service companies install, inspect and monitor underwater
assets. The trend towards deeper water activities in the oil and
gas sector will support demand for our underwater acoustic
surveillance sensors. Online research indicates that between
2001 and 2005 global deepwater capital investment was 
£16.5 billion and it is estimated to more than double to £44 billion
during 2006 to 2010.
Sector performance
2006/07 was a very successful year with organic revenue 
and profit growth significantly above the market growth rates 
and a major acquisition completed.
Geographically , revenue growth was particularly good in the
Middle East where we benefited from major oil and gas projects.
Regions such as the UK were also strong where our new 
Sprint V flue analyser product was adopted by BG Group with 
a £1.4 million supply contract.
We succeeded in integrating our wireless communications
technology used in asset monitoring with other sectors 
in the Group and can see other opportunities for technical
collaboration in the future.
Relative to our other sectors we invest a slightly lower percentage
of revenue in R&D . However , good growth opportunities continue
to exist and the Return on sales and ROCE remain at a high level.
Sector outlook
In the long term, increasing safety regulation, greater concern
over the consequences of accidents from company boards 
and higher safety expectations by workers will continue to drive
demand for our Industrial Safety products.
We will continue to seek bolt-on acquisitions which will enhance
our products and distribution strength in higher growth markets.
We have solid positions in each of our chosen markets and by
continuing to invest in new products, additional sales offices and
our activities in lower cost territories such as Eastern Europe and
Asia, we are well placed to continue our track record of healthy
organic growth.

Operating environment, risks and uncertainties
Macro-economic, regulatory and competitive environment
We anticipate that the 2007/08 macro-economic environment 
will be broadly favourable to our growth strategy . In global terms, 
we see the US, Europe and Asian economies offering good
opportunities with Asia having higher growth rates from a lower
base. Growth in the more mature economies is important to our
overall growth prospects albeit that our products are often used
in regulated markets and this affords some protection from the
extremes of economic cycles.
Safety and environmental legislation is constantly evolving,
worldwide, towards increased safeguards and protection. 
This favours us because it relentlessly drives demand growth in
our core markets. Legislative change challenges us to continually
refresh our product portfolio whilst regulatory compliance is also
a powerful barrier to entry for competitors. Our well developed
capacity to innovate, coupled with strong R&D resources,
positions our companies for leadership of markets dominated 
by regulatory control.
The markets we operate in are generally highly competitive. 
Our diversified product portfolio and wide geographic coverage
means that competitive product manufacturers are analysed 
at subsidiary company or operating sector level. We have
commented on the competitive environment in the 
sector reviews.
Employee, health and safety and environmental issues
Our core values are Innovation, Empowerment, Achievement 
and Customer Satisfaction. The core values have been selected
following extensive surveying of employees across the Group.
Our culture is one of openness, integrity and accountability . 
We encourage our employees to act fairly in their dealings with
fellow employees, customers, suppliers and business partners.
We recognise that our employees determine our success and
therefore have invested in and encouraged their development
more this year than ever before, not only with our intranet training
facilities and Halma Executive Development Programme, but also
through clearer leadership and decisive action. By ensuring that
our team has the approach and skills required to succeed we are
better placed to meet the challenges of the future.
We recognise the necessity of safeguarding the health and
safety of our own employees whilst at work and operate so 
as to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for
employees, visitors and the public. Our policy is to manage our
activities to avoid causing any unnecessary or unacceptable
risks to health and safety and the environment. We have an
excellent long-term record for addressing environmental issues
that affect our businesses and for developing products that
protect the environment and improve safety at work and in 
public places.
Many of our innovative products play a very positive role in
monitoring and improving the environment. Our brands lead 
the world in a number of technologies which help to minimise
environmental damage.
We support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, 
in common with all businesses, our activities have an
environmental impact. Our strategy is not to have capital-
intensive manufacturing processes, so the environmental impact
of our operations is relatively low compared to manufacturers 
in other sectors. We also recognise that we can improve our 
own environmental performance and so resources are now
being deployed to actively reduce our own carbon footprint. 
More information on these activities is given in the Corporate
responsibility section of this review .
Halma was designated a member of the FTSE4Good UK index
on its establishment in July 2001.
Resources, risks and uncertainties
The main intangible resources which deliver competitive
advantage and which support our strategic objectives are: 
the patents and trade marks which protect our products; our
employees, whose understanding of our technology , customers’
needs and the dynamics of the markets we operate in, enable 
us to maintain leadership in many markets; and the enviable
reputation enjoyed by our brands for superior product quality
and market leading customer support. Our businesses build
competitive advantage and strengthen barriers to entry in many
ways including patents, product approvals, technical innovation,
product quality , customer service levels and branding. We look
for these qualities in the businesses we seek to acquire.
We like regulated markets which require suppliers to achieve
compliance with demanding product standards but also look 
for other long-term growth drivers such as demographic change.
We seek to continuously grow our profits, generating a high
return for shareholders over the long term. We view risk within
the context of this objective as well as in absolute terms.
In any business there are inherent risks that are an integral
component of its business activities. Our strategy is to operate a
continuous process to identify the risks faced by our companies
and the Group, to assess each risk’s likelihood of occurring 
and impact were it to occur , and to ensure that a system of
controls is in place to manage or mitigate those risks assessed
as significant. Appropriate actions are taken to address any
weaknesses. Comprehensive insurance cover is maintained
where warranted and cost effective. 
Our key means of risk control is the choice of the markets in
which we operate and the people and methods we use to exploit
those market opportunities. We perceive our primary operational
risks to emanate from remoteness of operation and the actions
and quality of our people.
Our choice to operate in the safety products and health-related
technology markets, and the depth of market knowledge we
have built up within the Group, allows us to adequately evaluate
and assess the risks we encounter throughout our operations. Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   29
We do not place undue reliance on any one Group company 
nor does any one Group company rely heavily on one customer
or transaction. In managing the portfolio of companies within the
Group and in managing the transactions in any one company , 
we seek to spread our risks. We have processes in place to
ensure any major transactions are reviewed at the appropriate
level, including at Board level if necessary .
Another factor limiting risk is that our products are predominantly
critical components or instruments which are warranted as fit for
the purpose rather than systems or intangible products where
satisfactory performance is contingent upon third parties.
Our procedures to identify , manage and mitigate the risks within
the Group address the following major risk factors:
Organic growth and competition The Group is affected by
competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and
substitution. There is an ever present risk of losing market share
or failing to adapt to market changes. High quality alternative
products at low cost will always be a threat. Our focus on
improving our rate of innovation is a direct result of assessing
these risks and determining how best to concentrate our efforts.
Maintaining the high quality of our products is critical. In addition,
all businesses analyse revenue and margin by product line on a
monthly basis. Through continual innovation and by ensuring that
local management are well resourced and free to respond to
changing market needs, we feel that the adverse impact of
downward price pressure and competition can be mitigated.
Acquisitions The identification and purchase of businesses which
meet our demanding financial and growth criteria is an important
part of our strategy for developing the Group. Therefore we have
been increasing the resource allocated to this activity , focusing
on sectors where we see the greatest opportunity . There is
always a significant potential integration risk, particularly in the
purchase of private businesses, and this is an area which is
being continually improved.
R&D New products have always been critical to the growth of
the Group and have underpinned its ability to earn high margins
and high returns over the long term. R&D is of necessity a risky
activity but by devolving control of product development into the
autonomous operating businesses, the Group spreads the risk
and ensures that the resource is as close to the customer as
possible, giving the maximum chance of success. Protection of
our intellectual property is important to the Group’s continued
success. Whilst no single product or process is critical to the
Group as a whole, all appropriate actions are taken to protect 
the Group’s intellectual property rights.
Financial irregularities and increasing span of control We
recognise that the size and remoteness of some operations 
may not permit full segregation of duties and that Internal and
External Audit procedures may not always identify a financial
irregularity . This is increasingly the case as we pursue our
strategy of geographic expansion often into regions with different
accounting bases and cultures. Therefore the Group seeks 
to ensure there is adequate local management and financial
resource and regularly reiterates to the operating company
officers their fiduciary responsibilities, ensuring they are
adequately trained in financial matters whilst maintaining 
a culture of openness to promote disclosure. Group companies
operate a common set of reporting procedures and accounting
policies, disseminated via the Group intranet.
Pension deficit Monitoring the funding needs of the pension
obligations is essential to controlling the cash the pension plan
requires from Halma. Our UK defined benefit pension plans are
closed to new members. There is regular dialogue with pension
fund trustees and pension strategy is a regular Halma Board
agenda item. The Group’s strong cash flows and access to
adequate borrowing facilities mean that the pensions risk can 
be adequately managed. The Group is currently increasing
contributions with the overall objective of paying off the deficit 
in line with the Actuary’s recommendations.
Financial and treasury risks The Group does not use complex
derivative financial instruments and no speculative treasury
transactions are undertaken. Foreign currency risk is the 
most significant treasury related risk for the Group. Significant
currency denominated net assets are hedged but future
currency profits are not hedged. Therefore, the Sterling value of
overseas profit earned during the year is sensitive to the strength
of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and the Euro. 
The Group is exposed to a lesser extent to other treasury risks
such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. These financial risks
are discussed more fully in note 26 to the accounts.
Laws and regulations Group operations are subject to 
wide-ranging laws and regulations including employment,
environmental and health and safety legislation. There is also
exposure to litigation and contractual risk. All Group companies
have an employee handbook detailing employment practices 
and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Each operating company has a health and safety manager
responsible for compliance and our performance in this area 
is excellent. The Group’s emphasis on excellent financial control,
the deployment of high quality management resource and strong
focus on quality control over products and processes in each
operating business helps to protect us from adverse litigation
and contractual issues. 30 Halma p.l.c. 2007 Business and financial review
Corporate responsibility
A summary of our progress and performance for all areas of
corporate responsibility follows. Halma is developing meaningful
key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the importance 
the Group places on corporate responsibility and will enable the
Board to monitor the Group’s progress in meeting its objectives
and responsibilities in these areas. Halma will report against
these KPIs next year .
The biggest area of emphasis over the past year has been the
transformation of the Group’s environmental policy into a Carbon
Policy stating actual targeted reductions for the Group to achieve
over a set timescale. Halma has an excellent health and safety
record and a culture of safety is deeply embedded within the
Group. We want to recognise the effort behind this exemplary
record and will promote our safety culture more visibly over the
coming year . Finally , the increased investment in management
training continues to be valuable and we are exploring a number
of key metrics to better communicate this to stakeholders.
Socially responsible investment
Investing in Halma shares meets the criteria of many professional
and private investors who base their decisions on environmental,
ethical and social considerations. The Group is a world leader 
in several key environmental technologies and has a reputation
for honesty and integrity in its relationships with employees,
customers, business partners and shareholders.
Social conditions can be improved for all through the creation 
of wealth. Halma creates wealth responsibly allowing our
employees, customers, business partners and shareholders 
to determine where this wealth is best distributed.
Halma’s policies reflect the core requirements of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We do not tolerate
practices which contravene these international standards.
Regulatory demands upon us vary considerably around the
world, so in each of the following areas Halma establishes the
core structure to ensure that Group companies fully comply 
with regulatory requirements while permitting them to tailor 
the solutions to their particular needs.
The environment
Within Halma, we have an excellent long-term record and a clear
strategy for addressing environmental issues that affect our
businesses and for developing products that protect the
environment and improve safety at work and in public places.
Our products
Many of our innovative products play a very positive role in
monitoring and improving the environment. Halma brands lead
the world in a number of technologies which help to minimise
environmental damage.
Our principal environmental technologies are water leakage
detection, gas emissions monitoring, water and effluent analysis,
UV water treatment and optical sensing. We tirelessly promote
the use of UV water sterilisation which eliminates the need to use
dangerous chemicals, as well as products that minimise the
waste of clean water .
Our commitment to the development of equipment for measuring
environmental changes and controlling the damaging impact 
of industrial activities is long term.
We make safety equipment for use at work, in public places and
in transportation systems that contribute to increased personal
safety by ensuring safe practice at work, protecting people from
fire and making elevators and automatic doors safe and effective.
We are the major world supplier in several of these areas.
Carbon policy
The Group’s policy on carbon is published on our website and
has been distributed and explained to all Halma business units.
A senior executive in each of our higher-impact business units 
is responsible for implementing the carbon policy at local level.
The Group Finance Director , Kevin Thompson, has principal
responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the policy .
Keeler scholarship
Dr Srilakshmi Sharma from Bristol Eye Hospital is this year's
winner of the highly prestigious Keeler Scholarship for research
into ocular inflammatory disease. Worth £20,000, the scholarship
is funded by Keeler , Halma’s world leader in high precision
optical instruments. It allows the winner to spend up to two years
undertaking research into ophthalmology .  
“I’m very pleased to have won this Scholarship,” she said. 
“It will be a fantastic experience which will allow me to 
conduct research at an internationally acclaimed medical
ophthalmology clinic.”
The Keeler Scholarship is awarded every two years and is
designed to advance the science and practice of ophthalmology
by enabling the winner to study , research or acquire special skills,
knowledge or experience for a minimum period of six months.
The award is administered through the Royal College of
Ophthalmologists.
UV and wastewater
The development of new UV technologies is a perfect example 
of an industry investing to meet market demand for an effective,
low cost, and environmentally friendly way to disinfect
wastewater for reuse.
Potential applications for wastewater reuse are extremely 
wide-ranging and include any instance where water is needed
for non-potable use. The most popular and widespread use 
is for agricultural irrigation, with California and Florida leading the
way in the US and a number of Australian states also making
significant progress. Other irrigation uses include landscape and
recreational applications such as golf courses, parks, and lawns.
Founded less than ten years ago Anthem, a town just north of
Phoenix, Arizona, now has a population of over 40,000. As part 
of its rapid expansion the town recently installed three closed
chamber medium pressure UV systems from Berson UV-techniek
to disinfect its wastewater . This allows the town to not only meet
increased demands in its water and wastewater treatment
capacity , but also to exceed the output quality standards. Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   31
Environmental management system
We are committed to developing and implementing an
environmental management system (EMS) throughout the 
Group to measure, control and, where practical, reduce our
environmental impacts. We are developing performance
indicators that will assist local management in implementing the
policy and developing an EMS. The requirement for an EMS and
the related reporting has been rolled out to all UK business units,
which represent over 50% of Group production facilities in terms
of external turnover . All Group companies are encouraged to
undertake ISO 14001, the international environmental standard,
accreditation where warranted, and during the year , Radcom
(T echnologies) Limited and Palmer Environmental Limited both
obtained ISO 14001 approval. The requirement to implement 
an EMS will be extended to the rest of the Group in the 
medium term. 
Our impacts
We support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, 
in common with all businesses, our activities have an
environmental impact. Our strategy is not to have capital-
intensive manufacturing processes, so the environmental effect 
of our operations is relatively low compared to manufacturers 
in other sectors. FTSE4Good has assessed Halma as having 
a low impact on the environment.
Nevertheless, Group companies are encouraged to improve
energy efficiency , reduce waste and emissions and reduce the
use of materials in order to reduce their environmental impact.
The Group established baseline data in 2004/05 on emissions 
to air and water , water and energy consumption, and waste
production, the results of which are updated on the website 
each year . The data collected for the past three years has
enabled the Group to set comprehensive and quantifiable
objectives for reducing its environmental impacts in those 
areas and to set targets for reduction in key areas.
The collected data confirms that the main areas of impact on the
environment are energy consumption and solid waste disposal.
The Group does not operate a fleet of distribution vehicles
although we do own a number of company cars. From May 2007,
we are implementing a cap on permissible CO2 emissions of all
UK company vehicles and will extend this requirement to the rest
of the world in the short term. This limit will be reduced annually
so as to consistently reduce our vehicles’ environmental impact.
Having identified the main areas of impact, we are now
committed to their reduction and minimisation. Using the 
baseline data the total Group carbon emissions for 2006/07 was
calculated as being approximately 15,000 tonnes, an average of
less than 50 tonnes per £million of revenues. We plan to reduce
the Group’s total carbon emissions relative to revenues by 10% 
by 2010.
We are working with AEA, an international environment and
energy consultancy , to facilitate this reduction by providing each
subsidiary with the means to identify tailored initiatives for energy
efficiency . This will be complemented by internal programmes,
including the use of our own wireless communications
technology to monitor energy usage and use of the Group
intranet to allow for inter-company communication, reporting 
of data and feedback. We expect that this initiative will lead 
to cost savings for the Group as well as preparing us for
compliance with anticipated climate change legislation.
The new Carbon Policy can be found on the Halma website. 
The Group’s environmental performance will continue to be
reported in both the Annual report and on our website.
The Group is committed to examining the establishment 
of “green” procurement policies and increasing our use 
of recycled materials.
Green innovation
Fortress Interlocks has won the prestigious “Green” Innovation
Award at this year’s innovation & Design Excellence Awards
(iDEA) against strong competition. The award was for Fortress’
eGard, a unique new product which combines both machine
safety and control modules in one flexible unit.
The iDEAs, organised by Eureka, New Electronics and Cranfield
School of Management, recognised that the innovation behind
eGard opens up a new , large market sector for Fortress. 
The award also recognised that Fortress designed and
manufactured eGard along environmental principles taking 
into account the whole life-cycle of the product.
Fortress decided to make the housing from polymer using the
same material throughout to make recycling more efficient. 
Other parts are made of stainless steel. In addition, the housing
has no fixings or adhesive; parts are clipped together or
ultrasonically welded. This reduces component count and 
also makes recycling much easier . 32 Halma p.l.c. 2007 Business and financial review
Corporate responsibility continued
The workplace
Halma operates an employment policy with the objective of
ensuring equal opportunities and preventing harassment in 
the workplace. This gives us access to the widest labour market
and enables us to secure the best employees for our needs.
Halma demonstrated that it is one of the UK’s most admired
businesses again this year by another high ranking in
Management T oday magazine’s annual survey of corporate
reputation. The awards are a peer review , distilling the opinions 
of directors who run many of the UK’s largest companies. 
This is a revealing survey based on the key elements that make
companies succeed. Companies are, in effect, judged by their
competitors, and the survey is unique in the UK.
Halma was ranked the 55th most admired company out of 
a list of 239 businesses. The awards are based on a survey 
by Nottingham Business School of the ten largest UK-based
companies in each of 24 different sectors. Respondents 
rate companies in categories such as quality of management,
financial soundness, quality of products, ability to attract, 
develop and retain talented managers, value as a long-term
investment and capacity to innovate.
Training
2006/07 was another successful year for the Halma Executive
Development Programme (HEDP) which is based on our
recognition of the fundamental part our people play in the
success of the Group. HEDP is an integrated development 
plan for our senior people – including the next generation 
of Managing Directors and Divisional Chief Executives. 
Our objective is to provide these individuals with the tools and
training to achieve more in their existing role and potentially to
advance through the organisation if their achievements merit it.
HEDP is aimed squarely at employees already serving on
subsidiary boards but we also encourage applications from
senior managers who can demonstrate they already have
equivalent responsibilities and will benefit from the programme.
The programme has been developed from a proven course
structure and is specifically and continuously tailored to suit
Halma’s needs, aligning the content to the Group’s four core
values of Innovation, Achievement, Empowerment and Customer
Satisfaction. It focuses strongly on strategic and leadership
capabilities and developing personal attributes – commitment,
determination and resilience. There is an emphasis on
performance management and team development. It includes
skill-based elements such as sales and marketing, management,
project leadership, corporate governance, finance and
innovation, but all are presented in a strategic context.
The first four programmes have now been completed and the
success of the programme can be measured by the enthusiasm
of the participants upon their return to their businesses, the
achievements and promotion of a number of participants and
their eagerness to coordinate further sessions to explore topics
of particular interest to their programme group. The final week 
of the programme immerses the participants in an environment
related to an emerging market or a market of significant
opportunity . Participants have been to China, India, Argentina 
and Japan and had access to many local businesses and
officials as well as local community programmes aimed at
improving the quality of life of local children and young adults.
Eureka!
In April 2007, Halma held a prize draw for its monthly innovation
award, Eureka! The lucky winner , Steve Jansen of T execom 
was randomly picked from over 150 names who had submitted
innovation ideas during the year and won a car to the value 
of £9,000. Steve is Procurement Manager and entered two
innovation ideas over the year that he has put into practice at the
company , one for a small circuit board which reduced assembly
times of the company’s bell boxes by around 50% and another
for the company’s packaging which has also significantly
increased the production rate. Eureka! is simply looking for the
actual birth of the idea, the creative spark that heralds the start
of an original thought process which will bring new benefit to a
Group business. A prize is also awarded for the most creative
innovation idea submitted during any one month. Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   33
Health and safety
The Group recognises the necessity of safeguarding the health
and safety of our own employees whilst at work and operates 
so as to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for
employees, visitors and the public. The Group’s health and safety
policy , which is set out on our website, is to manage our activities
to avoid causing any unnecessary or unacceptable risks to
health and safety . The policy is understood by all Group
companies, and given the autonomous structure of the Group,
operational responsibility for compliance with relevant local
health and safety regulations is delegated to the board of
directors of each Group company . We believe health and safety
training is important and it is carried out within companies 
as appropriate. Adequate internal reporting exists in order 
that the Group Finance Director may monitor each company’s
compliance with this policy .
The Group has collected details of its worldwide reported 
health and safety incidents which are available on our website 
at www .halma.com. We are pleased to report that there were 
no fatalities during 2006/07 or 2005/06, and we achieved a
considerable decrease in both serious and minor injuries in
comparison with low levels in 2005/06.
Ethics
The Group culture is one of openness, integrity and
accountability . Halma encourages its employees to act fairly in
their dealings with fellow employees, customers, suppliers and
business partners. We aim to have suppliers of high quality and
operate to acceptable international standards. Halma operates 
a confidential “whistleblowing” policy , which enables all Group
employees to raise any concerns they may have.
Halma has a zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption
which extends to all business dealings and transactions in which
we are directly involved. This includes a prohibition on making
political donations, offering or receiving inappropriate gifts 
or making undue payments to influence the outcome of 
business dealings.
Innovation
Innovation is a critical ingredient for Halma’s growth. Continually
refreshing our intellectual property leads to new products and
processes and helps us to maintain the strong market positions
held by many of our companies. Innovation is not just the
responsibility of the R&D department but is integral to all
commercial activities within the business. Innovative ideas can
range from a novel way to enter a new or remote market to
administration process improvements speeding the delivery of
products to customers. All employees within the Group have the
opportunity to deliver innovative ideas to help their company and
the Group achieve the growth objectives.
The Group continued the successful Halma Annual Innovation
Awards, launched in 2004/05, which recognise the major product
and process innovations during the past year . The 2006/07 Gold
Award of £20,000 was presented at the annual CEO Conference
by Geoff Unwin to Brian Back and Inder Panesar of Radio-T ech
for their Rail T emperature Monitor system, a radio telemetry
system that enables rail temperatures to be monitored constantly ,
anywhere on the network, providing early warning of the risk 
of track buckling. The Silver Award of £10,000 was awarded 
to Jim Lane, Phil Buchsbaum, Cliff Batchelder , Greg Williamson
and Steve Mattessich of Ocean Optics Thin Films Division for 
the SeaChanger xG Color Engine, a revolutionary colour filter
system for spotlights. It can be used to produce dramatic 
lighting effects in theatres and large venues such as museums
and churches. The Bronze Award of £5,000 was awarded 
to Emmanuel Eubelen, Thierry Jongen, Marc Meyers and 
Jean-Michel Bechet of BEA for the 4Safe, a new type 
of safety sensor , specifically designed to prevent anyone from 
being trapped or injured in automatic revolving or swing doors.
Queen’s Award
In April 2007, following the year end, Fortress Interlocks, one 
of our UK-based Industrial Safety businesses was awarded a
prestigious Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation in
recognition of their mGard safety interlock product. This is the
10th Queen’s Award received by one of our companies since 
the inception of the Queen’s Award scheme. 34 Halma p.l.c. 2007 Business and financial review
Financial review
*See Financial highlights.
A strong performance with widespread growth
Record revenue and profit
We achieved our highest ever revenue from continuing
operations at £354.6 million (2006: £310.8 million), an increase 
of 14% over the prior year . Profit before tax and amortisation 
of acquired intangibles at £66.1 million (2006: £58.1 million) 
on our continuing operations, excluding the disposals made 
in the prior year , was 14% higher and was also a record.
Adjusting for the extra profit which came with acquisitions gives
organic growth* of 8.1% in revenue and 7.6% in terms of profit.
There was a notable currency headwind through the year and
without that organic revenue and profit growth would have been
2.3% and 2.5% higher respectively . See below for more detail 
on currency impacts. Earnings per share were up 11% on a
statutory basis and up 14% on our adjusted* basis. A year of
good further progress.
As noted above there were disposals last year but none this year
and so the comparative figures are for continuing operations 
only . We have made a minor reclassification within our sector
figures, moving our Asset monitoring business into the Industrial
Safety sector and details of the change are given in note 1 
to the accounts.
All sectors grew strongly
Infrastructure Sensors and Industrial Safety sectors both grew
revenue and profit by more than 15%. The strong performance 
of Infrastructure Sensors, our largest sector , was underpinned 
by the higher investment made last year . The Health and Analysis
sector grew revenue by 9% and 7% in terms of profit*, well above
our target of 5% growth and following on from very strong
growth in the previous year . Return on sales* for each sector
remained firmly in the 18% to 21% range. Sector performances
are discussed further on pages 22 to 27.
Revenue to all destinations grew
There was widespread geographic growth in revenue. 
The following table gives revenue from continuing operations 
by destination.
% 
£ million Revenue change
United States of America 98.9 5.1%
United Kingdom 96.5 16.4%
Mainland Europe 91.4 18.4%
Asia Pacific and Australasia 35.5 6.6%
Africa, Near and Middle East 22.3 51.5%
Other 10.0 16.5%
354.6 14.1%
In the US our Health and Analysis and Industrial Safety
businesses showed solid growth with Infrastructure Sensors 
not yet making as strong progress. In the UK, Africa, Near and
Middle East, Infrastructure Sensors performed very well, as it did
in Mainland Europe, with the majority of the European increase
coming organically . Industrial Safety grew strongly in the UK
assisted by the addition of the T ritech business. Growth in the
Asia Pacific region was more modest although sales to China
grew by 26% from a low base. We are putting far greater
resources into this region to capture the opportunity there.
Importantly , revenue outside of the US/UK/Mainland Europe 
grew by a further 20% as we expand our geographic coverage.

Finance Director Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   35
A continued trend of strong margins and returns
Resumption of strong growth
In the year we again achieved very good organic growth and 
at the same time maintained high returns. An important part of
our strategy , reflected in our KPIs (see page 20) is the delivery of
excellent returns and the strong cash flow which comes from
them. These high returns have been a feature of the Group over
many years, but significantly this has once again been coupled
with good organic growth in these past two years.
ROCE* of 60.1% and ROTIC* of 14.0%
Our returns are strong and stable. Return on capital employed
(ROCE) was 60.1% (2006: 56.9%) showing the high value we
generate from our tangible asset base. Return on total invested
capital (ROTIC) increased to 14.0% (2006: 12.8%), this is a post-
tax return on the total asset base including all historic goodwill
but excluding the pension deficit. See note 3 to the accounts for
the full calculation of ROCE and ROTIC. The pattern of ROTIC
over the past five years is as follows:
ROTIC has grown recently because we have grown earnings at
a faster rate than the underlying capital base. In each year ROTIC
has been well in excess of our Weighted average cost of capital
(WACC) which has been calculated as currently being 7.7%. 
A sustained high ROTIC well above our WACC is a central
element of our value creation strategy .
High Return on sales* at 18.6%
Once again we delivered a high Return on sales* figure at 
18.6% (2006: 18.7%). We disposed of some businesses last 
year which generated a slightly lower margin. The Group has
operated with a Return on sales* range of 16.2% to 19.8% for
more than 20 years. These sustained high margins demonstrate
the significant value placed on our products by our customers
throughout the economic cycle.
Maintaining a strong financial position
Good cash flow
The Group generated strong cash flow once again with cash
generated from operations of £70.3 million. The following table
sets out the main components of our cash flows and these are
discussed in the sections below .
The Group finances its operations from retained earnings and
has access to third party borrowings when needed. There are 
no material funds outside the UK where repatriation is restricted.
Our treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and ensure
sufficient liquidity . No speculative transactions are undertaken.
Foreign currency profits are not hedged but purchase and sale
transactions are hedged into the functional currency of the
relevant operating company and balance sheet net currency
assets are substantially hedged.
More earnings enhancing acquisitions
We continued to implement our strategy of acquiring successful
businesses and helping them grow . In particular , we offer
businesses an autonomous environment within which to continue
their record of success. We spent £27.5 million on acquisitions

T ax rate
The effective tax rate on profit from continuing operations (before
amortisation of acquired intangible assets) is very similar to last
year at 29.8% (2006: 30.1%). Future effective tax rates are more
likely to be higher although not significantly so.
Pension contributions increased, deficit reduced
As indicated last year we have increased the rate of
contributions into our defined benefit pension plans which were
closed to new entrants in 2003. An additional £3 million was paid
into the plans in the year and over the next couple of years we
expect the annual cash contributions to continue to increase by a
further £2 million so that we can meet our objective of paying off
the deficit, as measured on an IAS 19 basis, over a ten-year
period. These extra contributions are not insignificant but are not
expected to impair our growth opportunities. The pension deficit
on an IAS 19 basis reported in the accounts has reduced from
£46 million last year to £37 million at year end, before the related
deferred tax asset. This decrease arises from an increase in the
value of plan assets, helped by the additional contributions, offset
by proportionately less of an increase in the present value of
plan liabilities due to a higher discount rate being applied.
Modest net debt of £7.7 million
We finished the year with a modest level of gearing at £7.7 million
(2006: £3.5 million net cash). This begins to utilise the £60 million
five-year debt facility put in place last year with our well-
established banking partners. The Board would be willing to
utilise more of this facility if good acquisition and investment
opportunities are identified. The Group continues to be able to
borrow at competitive rates and therefore currently deems 
this to be the most effective method of funding our 
increasing investment.
A currency headwind continues
There was a currency headwind through the year , particularly in
the second half. Approximately one-third of Group revenue is
denominated in US Dollars and 15% in Euros with the US Dollar
recently showing significant adverse movement relative to
Sterling. We translated our US Dollar revenue and profit to
Sterling at an average rate of 1.78 in 2005/06 but in 2006/07 
this average was 1.89. As a guide, a 1% weakening of the 
US Dollar relative to Sterling is expected to reduce revenue by
approximately £1 million and profit by £0.2 million in a full year .
The adverse movement in the South African Rand relative to
Sterling in the year also reduced profitability in our Infrastructure
Sensors business which has a sizable operation in South Africa.
As previously indicated there has been an adverse impact 
in translating our results into Sterling which we estimate as
reducing revenue by 2.3% and profit by 2.5% and most of this
impact has fallen in the second half of the year . If current
exchange rates prevail, our results will continue to be adversely
impacted, particularly in the first half of the current financial year .
The largest acquisitions in the year were of T ritech/System
T echnologies and Labsphere. We acquired T ritech/System
T echnologies, who design and manufacture underwater asset
monitoring equipment, in November 2006. Their 2005 audited
accounts showed annual revenue of £5.4 million and profit of
£1.1 million on a combined basis, with further encouraging
growth since that time. We paid an initial consideration of 
£10 million, with a further potential payment of up to 
£4.5 million conditional on substantial future growth.
Labsphere, a world leader in light testing and measurement
products, was acquired in February 2007 for a cash
consideration of US$14.3 million (£7.2 million). There are 
no additional payments to make for this acquisition. Labsphere’s
unaudited accounts for 2006 show revenues of US$12.5 million
(£6.3 million) and operating profit of US$2.4 million (£1.2 million).
In the year we also acquired Mikropack, which makes light
sources and photonic accessories, for € 2.3 million (£1.5 million)
and Baldwin Environmental for US$1.1 million (£0.6 million) with a
potential further total of £1.9 million payable on the two
acquisitions if performance targets are met.
All of these acquisitions were immediately earnings enhancing
and were generating a rate of return in excess of our WACC 
at the time of acquisition. We continue to invest considerable
resources into identifying further acquisitions in our chosen
markets.
Capital expenditure at typical levels
We spent £10.9 million on property , plant and computer software
in the year , a lower figure than the high expenditure last year
representing 134% of depreciation/amortisation – a more typical
level for the Group. Two surplus properties sold during the year
increased disposal proceeds. In 2007/08 we expect to undertake
two specific property developments at separate subsidiaries
which should add to the underlying rate of capital investment
and also produce a small gain on a property disposal.
Further 5% dividend increase with cover raised
The Board has recommended a further 5% increase in the 
final dividend up to 4.33p which together with the interim
dividend (also 5% higher) will give a total dividend of 7.18p for
the year , assuming the final dividend is approved. This will mean
a total payout to the shareholders in dividends of £26.7 million 
in relation to the year ended 31 March 2007. This continues our
progressive dividend policy stretching back many years. It also
furthers our objective of increasing dividend cover (based on
profit from continuing operations before amortisation of acquired
intangible assets) towards a figure of around 2.0 over time, by
lifting the cover from 1.61 to 1.74 times. Business and financial review Halma p.l.c. 2007   37
The impact of currency movements on the Group’s net tangible
assets is largely offset by the currency hedging loans we have in
place.
Amongst the operating sectors it is the Health and Analysis
sector which has the biggest trading exposure to the US Dollar
both in terms of origin and destination of its business. The Health
and Analysis businesses generate 45% of their revenue from the 
US compared with 21% for Infrastructure Sensors and 16% 
for Industrial Safety . This gives an indication of the relative 
impact of US Dollar movement and it is the profitability of the
Health and Analysis sector which was hardest hit by the fall 
in the US Dollar relative to Sterling in 2006/07.
Active investment for the future
Growing R&D and extending innovation
We continue to invest heavily in Research & Development (R&D)
and are active in promoting an innovative culture across the
Group. Expenditure on R&D in the year was 4.3% of revenue
(2006: 4.3% of revenue) and amounted to £15.3 million, 14% 
up on last year for continuing operations. We do not specifically
capture the expenditure on all innovation as it permeates every
aspect of our activities but this is an increasing use of existing
and new resources. The Sector reviews on pages 22 to 27 show
the percentage of revenue spent in each sector on R&D as one 
of our KPIs. They show that relative to our growing revenue 
our spend this year is consistent with last year and that the
Health and Analysis sector continues to invest the highest
percentage at 5.3%.
Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) we are
required to capitalise certain development expenditure on the
Consolidated balance sheet and also to amortise that asset over
an appropriate period. In the year we capitalised £3.9 million of
such development expenditure and amortised £1.5 million, 
giving rise to an asset of £6.1 million in the March 2007 balance
sheet. The nature of R&D is that it involves risk and therefore 
we carefully monitor all costs carried on the balance sheet. 
The Consolidated income statement was charged with a cost 
4% higher than last year . This increasing rate of investment 
in new , innovative products underpins our future growth.
Developing in China
We have taken a big step forward in China this year in terms of
getting more high quality resource on the ground. The Asia
Pacific region contributes only 10% of our total revenue, with
China as a small part of this. We see substantial opportunity for
many of our products in this region and so the extra investment
in China, around £0.5 million more in 2006/07, is an important
part of the growth process. Our task in 2007/08 and beyond 
is accelerating the payback on this investment.
Developing our strong control culture and our people
We spread our risks in part by operating through a number 
of closely managed individual businesses. The main risks and
uncertainties facing Halma are discussed above in this Business
and financial review . We have high quality local teams guiding
each business within our overall reporting and control framework.
There is significant external review of these operations and one
element of that review process, our Internal Audit, has been
further enhanced this year by more in-depth visits. Each business
has a senior finance executive on site who plays an important
part in the control and growth of the business. We continue to
actively develop our people and we have now had 13 of our
senior finance staff graduate from the Halma Executive
Development Programme (HEDP) and are finding them able 
to make an even broader contribution to the progress of 
the business.
T aking our environmental responsibilities seriously
Our impact on the environment is low and we produce many
products which themselves have a positive impact. Carbon
emissions reduction seems to be important for the future and we
are putting in place a variety of actions to both monitor and
actively manage our carbon footprint. We are at the early stages
of formulating reliable measures and KPIs, but are making good
progress and this is discussed more fully on pages 30 and 31.
We take a broader view that our impact on the environment is 
not just in relation to carbon emissions but also water usage,
packaging and waste generally , all areas where we have a 
good record.
Not only should we be able to comply with regulations as they
develop but also we are focussing our efforts in this area on
increasing profitability and genuinely improving our business.
Improving further in these areas should deliver greater value 
for customers and shareholders.
Cautionary note
The Business and financial review has been prepared solely 
to assist shareholders to assess the Board’s strategies and their
potential to succeed. It should not be relied on by any other 
party , for other purposes. Forward-looking statements have been
made by the Directors in good faith using information available
up until the date that they approved the Report. Forward-looking
statements should be regarded with caution because of the
inherent uncertainties in economic trends and business risks.
In preparing this Business and financial review , the Directors
have aimed to comply with the Accounting Standards Board’s
2006 Reporting Statement guidance on Operating and Financial
Reviews. However , we are only at the early stages of developing
non-financial Key Performance Indicators and so these have not
been included in this Annual report. 38 Halma p.l.c. 2007

Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The accounts are prepared under International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the European
Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS
legislation and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 that
are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective at the time of
preparing these accounts.
The principal Group accounting policies are explained below 
and have been applied consistently throughout the years ended
1 April 2006 and 31 March 2007.
The Group accounts have been prepared under the historical
cost convention, except as described below under the heading
“Financial Instruments”.
The preparation of Group accounts in conformity with IFRS
requires the Directors to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experiences and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods. The key areas where estimates have been used and
assumptions applied are in impairment testing of goodwill and 
in assessing the defined benefit pension plan liabilities.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts include the accounts of Halma p.l.c. and 
its subsidiary companies made up to 31 March 2007, adjusted 
to eliminate intra-Group transactions, balances, income and
expenses. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or
discontinued are included from the month of their acquisition 
or to the month of their discontinuation.
Goodwill
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions after 4 April 2004 represents
the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair
value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, 
and is recognised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated
balance sheet. Goodwill therefore includes non-identified
intangible assets including business processes, know-how and
workforce-related industry-specific knowledge and technical
skills. Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be
recognised directly in the Consolidated income statement.
On closure or disposal of an acquired business, this goodwill
would be taken into account in determining the profit or loss 
on closure or disposal.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3
“Business Combinations” to acquisitions prior to 4 April 2004 
in its consolidated accounts. As a result, the net book value of
goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under UK GAAP 
at 3 April 2004 was brought forward unadjusted as the cost 
of goodwill recognised under IFRS at 4 April 2004 subject to
impairment testing on that date; and goodwill that was written 
off to reserves prior to 28 March 1998 under UK GAAP will 
not be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on
disposal or closure of previously acquired businesses from 
4 April 2004 onwards.
Other intangible assets
(a) Product development costs
Research expenditure is written off in the financial year in which 
it is incurred.
Development expenditure is written off in the financial year in
which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development of a new
or substantially improved product, is incurred after the technical
feasibility and economic viability of the product has been proven
and the decision to complete the development has been taken,
and can be measured reliably . Such expenditure is capitalised 
as an intangible asset in the Consolidated balance sheet at cost
and is amortised through the Consolidated income statement 
on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of 
three years after which time it is retired and written out of 
the accounts.
(b) Acquired intangible assets
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking 
is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the
acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is
expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value
can be measured reliably . An acquired intangible asset is
amortised through the Consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of between
three and ten years.
(c) Computer software
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property ,
plant or equipment is recognised separately as an intangible
asset, and is amortised through the Consolidated income
statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic 
life of between three and five years.
Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be
impaired. Additionally , goodwill and capitalised development
expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in full production
are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated income
statement to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds 
its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the
asset’s net realisable value and its value in use. An asset’s 
value in use represents the present value of the future cash 
flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash
generating unit to which it relates. The present value is calculated
using a post-tax discount rate that reflects the current market
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset concerned. Halma p.l.c. 2007   43
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset
other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in
the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount,
but only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does
not exceed its carrying amount had no impairment loss been
recognised in previous periods. Impairment losses in respect of
goodwill are not reversed.
Foreign currencies
The Group presents its accounts in Sterling. T ransactions in
foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. Any gain or 
loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is
included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated 
income statement.
Net assets of overseas subsidiary companies are expressed 
in Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the
financial year , and trading results and cash flows at the average
rates of exchange for the financial year . Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of a foreign business is treated as an asset of the
foreign entity and is translated at the rate of exchange ruling at
the end of the financial year . Exchange gains or losses arising on
these translations are taken to the T ranslation reserve within
Shareholders’ funds.
In the event that an overseas subsidiary is disposed or closed,
the profit or loss on disposal or closure will be determined after
taking into account the cumulative translation difference held
within the T ranslation reserve attributable to that subsidiary . 
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem the
T ranslation reserve to be £nil at 4 April 2004. Accordingly , the
profit or loss on disposal or closure of foreign subsidiaries will 
not include any currency translation differences which arose
before 4 April 2004.
Financial instruments
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or
trading purposes, but uses forward foreign currency contracts 
to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements. Forward
currency contracts are measured at cost (usually zero) and
subsequently remeasured at fair value. Where a forward
currency contract is designated as a hedge against variability 
in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain 
or loss on the forward contract is recognised in Shareholders’
funds. The cumulative gain or loss is removed from Shareholders’
funds and recognised in the Consolidated income statement at
the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of
any gain or loss, or gains or losses on forward currency contracts
that are not designated as hedges, are recognised immediately
in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings to hedge its
investment in foreign subsidiaries. The effective part of any gain
or loss on these currency borrowings is recognised directly in
the T ranslation reserve within Shareholders’ funds. The ineffective
portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income
statement.
Revenue
Revenue represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies
to external customers excluding value added tax and other 
sales related taxes. T ransactions are recorded as sales when 
the delivery of products or performance of services takes place 
in accordance with the contracted terms of sale.
Provisions
A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount, and is
recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation,
and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Property, plant and equipment
Property , plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less
provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the
exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided
on a straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated economic life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold properties:
more than 50 years unexpired 2%
less than 50 years unexpired Period of lease
Plant, machinery and equipment 8% to 20%
Motor vehicles 20%
Short-life tooling 33
1
⁄ 3%
Leases
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those 
that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property ,
plant and equipment and initially measured at their fair value 
or , if lower , the present value of the minimum lease payments,
and a corresponding liability is recognised within the
Consolidated balance sheet as obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent
with owned assets or over the term of the lease, if shorter . At the
inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between
an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability .
Subsequently , the interest element is recognised as a charge to
the Consolidated income statement and the capital element is
applied to reduce the outstanding liability .
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are
charged to the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. 44 Halma p.l.c. 2007
Accounting policies continued
Pensions
The Group makes contributions to various pension plans,
covering the majority of its employees.
For defined benefit plans, the asset or liability recorded in the
balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the
plans’ assets and the present value of the defined obligation at
that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately
for each plan on an annual basis by independent actuaries using
the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 3 April 2004 were recognised
in full in the Consolidated balance sheet at that date. All actuarial
gains and losses arising after 4 April 2004 are taken to
Shareholders’ funds.
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any
settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated
income statement. Interest on pension plans’ liabilities are
recognised within finance expense and the expected return on
the schemes’ assets are recognised within finance income in 
the Consolidated income statement.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to 
the Consolidated income statement when they fall due.
Employee share schemes
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the
Group’s share incentive plan, the share option plans and the
performance share plan.
(a) Share incentive plan
Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to
qualifying employees depending on salary and service criteria.
The shares awarded under this plan are purchased in the 
market by the plan’s trustees at the time of the award, and
are then held in trust for a minimum of three years. The costs 
of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated income statement
over the three-year vesting periods of the awards.
(b) Share option plans
All grants of options under the 1990 and 1996 share option plans
and the 1999 company share option plan (together , the “share
option plans”) are equity-settled, and so, as permitted by IFRS 1,
the provisions of IFRS 2 “Share-Based Payment” have been
applied only to options awarded on or after 7 November 2002
which had not vested at 3 April 2005.
The fair value of awards under these plans has been measured
at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and will not
be subsequently remeasured. The fair value is charged to the
Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
expected vesting period, with adjustments being made during
this period to reflect expected and actual forfeitures and changes
to the vesting period itself arising from non-market based
performance conditions. The corresponding credit is to
Shareholders’ funds.
No further awards will be made under the share option plans.
(c) Performance share plan
On 3 August 2005 the share option plans were replaced by the
performance share plan.
All awards under this plan are equity-settled and are subject 
to both market based and non-market based vesting criteria.
Their fair value at the date of grant is established by using 
an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of
market-based performance conditions being met. The fair 
value is charged to the Consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate
adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected
and actual forfeitures arising from the non-market based
performance conditions only . The corresponding credit is 
to Shareholders’ funds.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress of subsidiary companies are
included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
calculated either on a “first in, first out” or an average cost basis
and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of
production and other overheads considered by the Directors to
be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and
condition at the year end. Net realisable value represents the
estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Taxation
T axation comprises current and deferred tax. T ax is recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in Shareholders’ funds, in
which case it is recognised in Shareholders’ funds. Current tax 
is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year ,
using tax rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the balance
sheet date, along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years. T axable profit differs from net profits as reported
in the Consolidated income statement because it excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, apart
from the following differences which are not provided for:
goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable
profits; differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the
extent they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws which are
expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised 
to the extent that recovery is probable.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits
with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank
overdrafts that are repayable on demand. Bank overdrafts are
shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the Consolidated
balance sheet.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are
recognised as a liability in the period in which the distribution 
is approved by the Company’s shareholders. Halma p.l.c. 2007   45

2 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 371,221,629 shares in issue during the year 
(net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares) (2006: 369,053,181). Diluted earnings per ordinary share 
are calculated using the weighted average of 374,036,077 shares (2006: 370,435,138) which includes dilutive potential ordinary
shares of 2,814,448 (2006: 1,381,957). Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where
the exercise price is less than the average price of the Group’s ordinary shares during the year .
Earnings from continuing operations excludes the net profit from discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings is calculated as
earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax. The Directors consider that
adjusted earnings represents a more consistent measure of underlying performance. A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on
basic earnings per share figures is as follows:

Organic growth
Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations. The effect of acquisitions made
during the current or prior financial year has been equalised by subtracting from the current year results a pro-rated contribution
based on their revenue and profit at the date of acquisition, and has been calculated as follows:

No provision is made for taxation which might become payable if profits retained by overseas subsidiary companies are distributed
as dividends unless there is an intention to distribute such profits.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had unused capital tax losses of £1,793,000 (2006: £1,927,000) for which no deferred tax asset has
been recognised. None of these losses has an expiry date.
In accordance with International Accounting Standard 12 “Income T axes”, the accounts do not reflect the impact of the reduction in
the main rate of UK Corporation T ax announced in the Finance Bill 2007, as at the date of approval of the accounts it had not been
substantively enacted. The effect of adjusting for this change would be a reduction in the tax charge in the Consolidated profit and
loss account of £146,000, an increase in the tax charge taken to reserves through the Statement of recognised income and expense
of £745,000, and a reduction in the net deferred tax asset in the Consolidated balance sheet of £599,000.

T reasury shares are ordinary shares in Halma p.l.c. purchased by the Company and held to fulfil the Company’s obligations under the
performance share plan. At 31 March 2007 the number of treasury shares held was 805,635 (2006: 200,000) and their market value
was £1,774,441 (2006: £375,500).
The capital redemption reserve was created on repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares.
The translation reserve is used to record differences arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
The other reserve represents the provision being established in respect of the value of the equity-settled share option plans and
performance share plan. 58 Halma p.l.c. 2007

until their transfer to qualifying employees, which is conditional upon completion of three years’ service. The costs of providing this
scheme are recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the three-year vesting period.
Share option plans
The Group has issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under three share option plans, approved by shareholders
in 1990, 1997 and 2000. These share option plans provide for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to
performance criteria.
Section A options are exercisable after three years if the Group’s earnings per share growth exceeds, for the 1990 Plan, the growth 
in the Retail Price Index, for the 1997 Plan, the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 2% per annum and, for the 2000 Plan, the growth
in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum. Section B options are exercisable after five years if the Company’s earnings per share
growth exceeds the earnings per share of, for the 1990 and 1997 Plans, all but the top quarter of companies which were within the
FTSE 100 at the date of grant of any option and for the 2000 Plan, all but the top quarter of companies which were within a peer
group at the date of grant of any option.
All options lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant.
No further awards will be made under the Company share option plans.
Options in respect of 50,500 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 31 March 2007 under the 1990 Plan. Subject to the performance

Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 only the options awarded in 2004, 2005 and 2006 under the 1999 Plan have been recognised
under IFRS 2. The fair value of these options was calculated using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions:

Performance share plan
The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the share option plans from which no
further grants will be made.
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Group’s relative T otal Shareholder Return
against, for 2006/07, the FTSE 250 excluding financial companies and, for 2005/06, the Engineering and Machinery sector , combined
with an absolute Return on total invested capital measure. Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award lapse.

Labsphere, Inc. February 2007 USA Health and Analysis $14,300,000
T ogether these acquisitions contributed £6,307,000 of revenue and £1,731,000 of profit before tax and amortisation of acquired
intangible assets to the Group results for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Additional purchase consideration of up to D2,250,000, £4,500,000 and $700,000 is payable in respect of Mikropack, T ritech/System
T echnologies and Baldwin Environmental respectively , and has been provided at the estimated amount payable. The amount payable
is dependent upon the profit growth of the businesses as follows: Mikropack – over the financial year ending March 2007;
T ritech/System T echnologies – over each of the two years ending November 2008; Baldwin Environmental – over each of the three
years ending March 2009. The adjustments to goodwill relating to prior years’ acquisitions comprise revisions to the estimate of
deferred purchase consideration payable.
Adjustments were made to the book value of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair value to the
Group. Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with

26 Financial instruments
Policy
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments. No trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are
undertaken. Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations
and its financing. Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a lesser extent 
to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and
these policies are summarised below . Policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year .
Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other 
than the companies’ operating (or “functional”) currency . Significant sales are hedged at the date of invoicing by means of matched
borrowings and forward currency contracts. Significant purchases are hedged by means of forward currency contracts.
The Group which is based in the UK and reports in Sterling, has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and
Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, India and Africa. As a result, the Group’s
balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ exchange rates. Where significant and appropriate, currency
denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings. These currency exposures are reviewed regularly . The Group does not
hedge future currency profits, so the Sterling value of overseas profits earned during the year is sensitive to the strength of Sterling,
particularly against the US Dollar and the Euro.
Finance and interest rate risk
The Group does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations
they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates. Borrowings used to manage foreign currency risk are drawn on the Group’s
loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year .
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on 
geographic location. Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks. For short-term working capital purposes, 
most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of
funding, security and flexibility . Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically “on demand” and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually .
Currency exposures
The table below shows the Group’s net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. These are the assets and liabilities of Group
companies which are not denominated in the functional currency of the company involved. They comprise cash and overdrafts, 
and certain debtors and creditors. These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and
losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a result of movement in exchange rates. As at year end these exposures
were as follows:
Net foreign currency monetary assets/(liabilities)

currency exposures.
Interest rate risk profile
The Group’s financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which 
totalled £5,901,000 at 31 March 2007 (2006: £11,501,000). These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of £5,780,000 
(2006: £11,386,000), and Euro and other currency deposits of £121,000 (2006: £115,000) which are placed on local money 
markets and earn interest at market rates. Cash balances of £16,150,000 (2006: £24,325,000) earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations are bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans,
which totalled £29,762,000 at 31 March 2007 (2006: £32,308,000). All are subject to floating rates of interest. These comprise US
Dollar denominated bank loans of £16,327,000 (2006: £18,497,000) which bear interest with reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates,
and Euro denominated bank loans of £13,435,000 (2006: £13,811,000) which bear interest with reference to the Euro LIBOR rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities
With the exception of the deferred purchase consideration and other payables due after one year , all of the Group’s financial liabilities
mature in one year or less or on demand. The total of deferred purchase consideration due after one year includes £603,000 
(2006: £1,346,000) due between one and two years, with the balance of £89,000 (2006: £66,000) due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include £1,017,000 (2006: £1,220,000) due between one and two years, £1,296,000
(2006: £2,279,000) due between two and five years, with the balance of £nil (2006: £185,000) due after more than five years.
Borrowing facilities
The Group’s principal source of short-term liquidity is through “on demand” bank overdrafts which are, by definition, uncommitted.
These facilities are generally reviewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Group also has committed borrowing facilities which are used for the purpose of providing longer-term financing and for
managing foreign currency risk.
In September 2005 the Group entered into a £60 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a small syndicate of its
principal bankers.
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March 2007 were £43,503,000, of which £13,265,000 mature within one year
and £30,238,000 between three and four years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
As at 31 March 2007 there was no significant difference between the book value and fair value (as determined by market value) of
the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.
Hedging
As explained above, the Group’s policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward
currency contracts. The gains and losses on these instruments are recognised upon recognition of the underlying exposure. 
The amounts of unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging at 31 March 2007 and 1 April 2006 are not significant.
With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables. Halma p.l.c. 2007   65
27 Commitments
Capital commitments
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 31 March 2007 but not provided in these accounts amounts to £1,076,000 
(2006: £2,187,000).
Commitments under operating leases
Annual payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows:

28 Retirement benefits
Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The Halma Group Pension Plan and 
the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002/03 and a defined contribution section was established within the
Halma Group Pension Plan. Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit plans are carried out every three years. The Halma Group Pension Plan was last
assessed as at 1 December 2005, and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan as at 1 April 2006, using the projected unit
method. At those dates the market value of the plan assets were £71.5 million for the Halma Group Pension Plan and £13.8 million 
for the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan. The actuarial value of these assets represented 60% and 59% respectively of the
benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings. These shortfalls are being addressed
by increased company contributions.
Defined contribution schemes
The amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was £1,592,000 
(2006: £1,685,000). 66 Halma p.l.c. 2007

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Halma p.l.c.
We have audited the Group financial statements of Halma p.l.c.
for the 52 weeks to 31 March 2007 which comprise the
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated balance 
sheet, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Statement 
of recognised income and expense and the Reconciliation of
movements in shareholders’ funds together with the statement 
of Accounting policies and the related notes numbered 1 to 28.
These Group financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited 
the information in the part of the Directors’ Report on
remuneration that is described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial
statements of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 weeks to 31 March 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body ,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
T o the fullest extent permitted by law , we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report, 
the Directors’ Report on remuneration and the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Report on remuneration
described as having been audited in accordance with relevant
United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view whether the Group financial
statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and whether the part of the Directors’ Report on remuneration
described as having been audited has been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you whether , in our opinion, the information given in the Report 
of the Directors is consistent with the Group financial statements.
The information given in the Report of the Directors includes that
specific information presented in the Operating and Financial
review that is cross referred from the Business review section 
of the Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if in our opinion we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions with the Company and 
other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2004
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing
Rules of the Financial Services Authority , and we report if it 
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Report of the Directors and the other information
contained in the Annual report for the above period as described
in the contents section including the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Report on remuneration and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited Group financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the Group financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend
to any further information outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Group financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Report on remuneration to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the Group financial
statements and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Report on remuneration to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Report on
remuneration to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give a true and fair view , in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted for use in the European Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of its profit for the 
52 week period then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and article 4 
of the IAS Regulations; 
– the part of the Directors’ Report on remuneration described 
as having been audited has been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent

Notes to the Company accounts
C1 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate Company accounts are presented as required 
by the Companies Act 1985 and have been prepared on the
historical cost basis and comply with applicable United Kingdom
Accounting Standards. The principal Company accounting
policies have been applied consistently throughout the current
and preceding year and are described below .
Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of
exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance 
sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. 
Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate
movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the 
profit and loss account.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings which are
taken out for the purpose of hedging the Company’s investments
in overseas subsidiary companies are taken to reserves.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments are provided to employees
under the Company’s share incentive plan, share option plans
and performance share plan. The Company recognises a
compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based 
on the fair value of the awards. For equity-settled schemes, 
the fair value is determined at the date of the grant and is not
subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the
award was granted are modified. The fair value at the date of 
the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models
and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and
actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to 
satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 20 “Share-
based payment”, the Company applied FRS 20 retrospectively
only to equity-settled awards that were granted on or after 
7 November 2002 which had not vested at 3 April 2005.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment 
and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land
which is not depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on 
the straight-line method, each item being written off over 
its estimated life. The principal annual rates used for this 
purpose are:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold properties:
more than 50 years unexpired 2%
less than 50 years unexpired Period of lease
Plant and equipment 8% to 20%
Motor vehicles 20%
Leases
The costs of operating leases of property and other assets
are charged as incurred.
Pensions
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution
pension plans, which are charged against profits when they
become payable. The Company also participates in a 
Group-wide defined benefit pension plan. This plan is operated
on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify
their share of the underlying assets and liabilities, and in
accordance with FRS 17 the Company accounts for its
contributions to the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan.
Deferred taxation
The Company provides for taxation deferred because of timing
differences between profits as computed for taxation purposes 
and profits as stated in the accounts, on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are
expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is
reasonably certain. Halma p.l.c. 2007   71

As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Profit and loss account of Halma p.l.c. is not presented as part of 
these accounts.

Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Halma p.l.c.
We have audited the parent Company financial statements 
of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 weeks to 31 March 2007 which
comprise the Balance sheet together with the statement of
Accounting policies and the related notes numbered C1 
to C13. These parent Company financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements
of Halma p.l.c. for the 52 weeks to 31 March 2007 and on the
information in the Directors’ Report on remuneration that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body ,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
T o the fullest extent permitted by law , we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual report 
the Directors’ Report on remuneration and the parent Company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities. Our responsibility is to
audit the parent Company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Report on remuneration to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company
financial statements give a true and fair view , in accordance 
with the relevant financial reporting framework, and whether 
the parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you whether in our opinion the Report of the Directors
is consistent with the parent Company financial statements. 
In addition we also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual report 
as described in the contents section and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited parent Company financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any further information outside the Annual report.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
parent Company financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made 
by the Directors in the preparation of the parent Company
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the parent Company financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
Company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the parent Company financial statements give a true and fair
view in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice of the state of affairs of the Company as
at 31 March 2007;
– the parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent 
with the parent Company financial statements.

Report of the Directors
The Directors present their Annual report on the affairs of the
Group, together with the Accounts and the Independent Auditors’
reports, for the 52 weeks to 31 March 2007.
Activities
Halma p.l.c. is a holding company . A list of its principal subsidiary
companies and their activities is set out on pages 92 and 93.
Results of the period
The Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to
31 March 2007 is set out on page 38. The Group profit on
continuing operations before amortisation of acquired intangible
assets and taxation is £66,091,000 (2006: £58,140,000). 
The profit attributable to equity shareholders amounts to
£44,011,000 (2006: £40,875,000). 
Ordinary dividends
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 4.33p per
share and, if approved, this dividend will be paid on 22 August
2007 to ordinary shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 20 July 2007. T ogether with the interim dividend 
of 2.85p per share already paid, this will make a total of
7.18p (2006: 6.83p) per share for the financial year .
Business review
A review of activities together with business and future
developments, risks and uncertainties and key performance
indicators that management use is included on pages 20 
to 37 inclusive and forms part of this report. 
Share capital
Details of share capital issued in the financial year are set out 
in note 21 to the accounts.
Allotment authority
Under the Companies Act 1985 the Directors may only allot
shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. At the annual
general meeting an ordinary resolution will be proposed which, 
if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue new
shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £6,332,519.50 
(up to 63,325,195 new ordinary shares of 10p each), which is
equal to approximately 17% of the issued share capital of the
Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 19 June 2007 
(the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice
of meeting). The authority will expire five years after the date of
passing of the resolution or , if earlier , at the conclusion of the
annual general meeting of the Company in 2012. Passing this
resolution will give the Directors flexibility to act in the best
interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, by issuing
new shares.  
As at 19 June 2007 (the latest practicable date prior to the
publication of the notice), the Company had 373,239,695
ordinary shares of 10p each in issue and held 805,635 treasury
shares, which is equal to approximately 0.2% of the issued 
share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) 
as at that date. 
The Companies Act 1985 also requires that, if the Company
issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must
first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their
current holdings. At the annual general meeting a special
resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the
Directors to issue a limited number of shares for cash and/or 
sell treasury shares without offering them to shareholders first.
The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of up to 5% 
of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share capital of 
the Company as at 19 June 2007 (the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of the notice). The resolution will also
modify statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory
or practical problems that may arise on a rights or other 
pre-emptive offer or issue and to permit non pre-emptive issues
pursuant to an employee share scheme. The authority will expire
at the same time as the resolution conferring authority on the
Directors to allot shares. The Directors consider this authority
necessary in order to give them flexibility to deal with
opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions contained 
in the resolution.   
There are no present plans to issue shares, except under share
plans previously approved in general meeting.
Electronic communications
The Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act) has introduced
provisions designed to make it easier for companies to use 
the internet to communicate with shareholders, and so reduce
printing and distribution costs.
Although it has been possible for some years for the Company 
to use electronic means to deliver certain documents to 
our shareholders, the 2006 Act has extended the range of
information that can be communicated electronically and 
relaxed certain requirements for communication by our website.
As before, the Company cannot send a shareholder material 
by e-mail unless the shareholder has agreed to this, and has
supplied an electronic address for that purpose. Where, however ,
a company that complies with the requirements of the 2006 
Act wishes to communicate information to its shareholders by
making it available on a website, each shareholder who has been
invited to accept this form of delivery , and has not objected within
28 days, is deemed to have agreed to it. If special resolution 8 is passed at the annual general meeting,
the Company will be able to send shareholders a written request
(which must set out the consequences of a failure to respond) 
to agree to website delivery , and may deem the shareholder 
to have agreed unless the shareholder objects within 28 days. 
If a shareholder declines website delivery , that shareholder 
will continue to receive documents by post in the usual way and
the Company will not be permitted to seek that shareholder’s
deemed agreement to website delivery for at least 12 months.
Those shareholders who do not object to website delivery will 
no longer receive documents by post. They will, however , receive
notification as and when key information is made available 
on the Company’s website, with details of how to access it. 
This notification will be given by post (or , if the shareholder has
agreed, by e-mail). In addition, shareholders will still have the
right, once they have received information electronically , to
require the Company to send a hard copy of that information,
free of charge, within 21 days, and they may also opt for all
information to be sent in hard copy form.
The resolution, if passed, will supersede any inconsistent
provisions in the Company’s current Articles of Association.
The Company also intends to discontinue the practice of mailing
the half-yearly financial report to shareholders with effect from
November 2007 and will only make it available on its website 
and on request.
Purchase of own shares
The Company was authorised at the 2006 annual general
meeting to purchase up to 36,000,000 of its own 10p ordinary
shares in the market. This authority expires at the end of the 2007
annual general meeting. In accordance with the Directors’ stated
intention to seek annual renewal, a special resolution will be
proposed at the annual general meeting to renew this authority
until the end of next year’s annual general meeting, in respect of
up to 37,000,000 ordinary shares, which is approximately 10% of
the Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares)
as at 19 June 2007 (the latest practicable date prior to the
publication of the notice of meeting). The Directors consider it
desirable that the possibility of making such purchases, under
appropriate circumstances, is available. Their present intention is
that the shares purchased under the authority will (to the extent
statutory requirements are met) be held in treasury for future
cancellation, sale for cash or transfer for the purposes of, or
pursuant to, an employee share scheme, although in the light 
of circumstances at the time it may be decided to cancel them
immediately on repurchase. The effect of any cancellation would
be to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most purposes,
while held in treasury shares are treated as if they have been
cancelled (for example, they carry no voting rights and do not
rank for dividends). 
Following approval of the performance share plan (PSP) at the
2005 annual general meeting, the Directors made, and intend 
to continue to make, routine purchases of Halma shares in the
market for holding in treasury until required for vesting under 
the PSP . In the year to 31 March 2007, 614,000 shares were
purchased in the market for treasury . Otherwise, the Directors
have no present intention of using this authority . In reaching a
decision to purchase shares, the Directors will take into account
the Company’s cash resources, capital requirements and the
effect of any purchase on the Company’s earnings per share. 
It is anticipated that renewal of the authority will be requested 
at subsequent annual general meetings.
As at 19 June 2007, which is the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of the notice of meeting, options were
outstanding to subscribe for a total number of 10,314,962
ordinary shares, or 2.8% of the Company’s issued share capital.
If this authority to purchase shares were used in full and the
shares cancelled, the proportion of the adjusted issued share
capital represented by this figure would be 3.1%.
Deeds of indemnity
Following amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association
at the annual general meeting in 2006, the Company has 
entered into deeds of indemnity , which are qualifying third party
indemnity provisions for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985,
with each of the current Directors.
Supplier payment policy
The Company does not follow any particular supplier payment
code of practice. The Company has due regard to the payment
terms of suppliers and generally settles all undisputed accounts
within 30 days of the due date for payment. At 31 March 2007 the
Company’s trade creditors represented 37 days (2006: 39 days) 
of its annual purchases.
Employees
Matters which affect the Group are communicated to employees
through formal and informal meetings, internal announcements,
the Group intranet, the Group bulletin board on our secure Virtual
Private Network (VPN) and regular contact with Directors and
Divisional Chief Executives. 
An employee share scheme is open to all UK employees of the
Group following a qualifying period and has been operating
since 1980. 
The Company provides equal employment opportunities to all
employees and applicants for employment without regard to
ethnic origin, religion, gender , age, disability , sexual orientation 
or any other reason prohibited by local legislation. Halma gives
disabled people the same consideration as other individuals.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report
and the financial statements. The Directors are required to
prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Company 
law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4
of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards
Board’s “Framework for the preparation and Presentation 
of Financial Statements” 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved
by compliance with all applicable International Financial
Reporting Standards. 
The Directors are also required to:
� properly select and apply accounting policies;
� present information, including accounting policies, in a manner
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
� provide additional disclosures when compliance with the
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial
performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company , for safeguarding the assets, for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Report of the
Directors and Directors’ Report on remuneration which comply
with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the Company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions. 84 Halma p.l.c. 2007
Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the maintenance of high standards 
of Corporate governance. The policy of the Board is to manage
the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles 
of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance which is appended to the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority and for which the Board is
accountable to shareholders.
Compliance with the code of best practice
Throughout the financial year , the Company complied with 
the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the July 2003 FRC
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, as amended in 
June 2006, except in respect of provisions A3.2 and C3.1, 
which involve the composition of the Board and the Audit
Committee and the number of members who are independent
non-executive Directors. The Board reaffirmed its decision to
maintain the composition of the Board as a Chairman, three
independent non-executive Directors and four executive
Directors and is currently in the process of recruiting an
independent non-executive Director to fill the vacancy arising 
on Andrew Walker’s resignation. The Board believes this
composition is the most appropriate structure for the Company;
the Chairman also specifically raised this point with shareholders
during the 2005 annual general meeting and received the
unanimous support of those present. Once the non-executive
Director vacancy is filled, the Company will be able to report
compliance with provision C3.1 relating to the composition of 
the Audit Committee.
Application of the principles of good governance
The Group is controlled and directed by a Board consisting 
of a Chairman, four Directors and two other non-executive
Directors. Their biographies appear on page 78. The Nomination
Committee is currently in the process of recruiting another 
non-executive Director . This individual is expected to be a
member of each of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees following appointment. The Board considers the
Chairman and each of the non-executive Directors to be
independent. In assessing independence, the Board considers
that the Chairman and non-executive Directors are independent
of management and free from business and other relationships
which could interfere with the exercise of independent judgment
now and in the future. The Board believes that any shareholdings
of the Chairman and non-executive Directors serve to align 
their interests with those of all shareholders. Richard Stone 
is acknowledged as the Senior Independent Director . Upon
appointment and at regular intervals, all Directors are offered
appropriate training. Each Director is subject to re-election 
at least every three years. The Chairman confirms that 
non-executive Directors standing for re-election continue 
to be effective and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The Directors retain responsibility for the formulation of 
corporate strategy , investment decisions, and treasury and risk
management policies. There is a formal schedule of matters
reserved for the Board’s decision and the Board meets at least
six times each year with further ad hoc meetings as required.
Directors are issued an agenda and comprehensive board
papers in the week preceding each Board meeting. All Directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company
Secretary as well as there being an agreed procedure for
obtaining independent professional advice.

Committees of the Board
Halma has six committees of the Board: the Remuneration
Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, 
the Share Plans Committee, the Bank Facilities and Guarantees
Committee and the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee. 
Each of these committees has terms of reference approved by
the Board, copies of which are available on request from the
Company Secretary .
Remuneration Committee
Richard Stone chairs the Remuneration Committee of which 
Geoff Unwin and Stephen Pettit are members. Andrew Walker
was also a member of the Committee up to the date of his
resignation. The Committee makes recommendations to the
Board on the framework for executive Directors’ and senior
executives’ remuneration based on proposals formulated by 
the Group Chief Executive. The Committee meets at least twice
per year . Further information about the Committee is contained 
in the Report on remuneration on pages 87 to 91.
Audit Committee
Stephen Pettit chairs the Audit Committee, succeeding Andrew
Walker who resigned in March 2007. Richard Stone is also a
member of the Committee. The Committee reviews the interim
and annual accounts and the disclosures contained therein,
accounting policies and matters of significant judgment, the
statement on internal controls, the process of Internal Audit 
and the Group whistleblowing procedures. The Committee is 
also responsible for the relationship with the external auditors
including terms of engagement, fee levels, approval of the annual
audit plan, a review of the findings of the audit and assessing
auditor effectiveness and independence. The Chairman, Group
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and representatives
from the Auditors attend Committee meetings by invitation in
order to provide appropriate advice. The Committee routinely
meets with the Auditors without the involvement of the executive
Directors; the Committee meets at least three times per year .
The Board has designated Richard Stone as the member of the
Audit Committee with recent and relevant financial experience.
His background is as a senior insolvency practitioner with
Coopers & Lybrand (later PricewaterhouseCoopers). Halma p.l.c. 2007   85
Nomination Committee
Geoff Unwin chairs the Nomination Committee. 
Andrew Williams, Richard Stone and Stephen Pettit are also
members. Andrew Walker was a member up to the date of his
resignation. The Committee makes recommendations to the
Board on the appointment of new Directors. External search
consultancies are retained when recruiting non-executive
Directors and are used to evaluate internal and external
candidates for succession planning. The Committee meets 
at least annually . As previously noted, the Committee is currently
in the process of recruiting a non-executive Director to fill the
vacancy created by Andrew Walker’s resignation.
Other committees
The Share Plans, Bank Facilities and Guarantees and
Acquisitions and Disposals Committees’ terms of reference
provide that certain Directors and the Company Secretary 
may form sub-committees to cover administrative matters or to
formally enact matters that have already been determined by 
the Board in principle.
Executive Board
Control of divisional operating matters is delegated to 
the Executive Board of which the Group Chief Executive, 
Group Finance Director and all of the Divisional Chief 
Executives are members. Biographies of Executive Board
members appear on pages 78 and 79. The Group Chief
Executive chairs the Executive Board, which meets regularly ,
thereby ensuring the Board’s strategies are communicated to
those overseeing operations. 
The Executive Board reviews operational activities, trading
results, budgets, policy matters, investment opportunities,
resource allocation and risk exposures. Any matters arising 
out of the Executive Board meetings are reported to the 
Board via the Group Chief Executive’s report to the Board. 
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
also meet regularly with each Divisional Chief Executive 
to monitor progress against key objectives and review
operational performance.
Individual operating company boards, chaired by the appropriate
Divisional Chief Executive, manage operating companies. 
These boards have clearly defined responsibilities for the
operation of their businesses, including compliance with
legislation and regulations, and for internal reporting. The system
of internal control exercised within the Group is described below .
Board effectiveness
The Board evaluates its performance and that of the
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committees at least
annually . For 2006/07 the evaluation commenced with a 
self-assessment questionnaire, the results of which were
compiled by the Company Secretary and discussed by the 
Board at the February 2007 Board meeting. The Board also 
met in February 2007, separate from any scheduled meeting, 
for a general discussion on Board effectiveness followed by a
meeting of the executive Directors with the Chairman, a meeting
of the Chairman and non-executive Directors, and then a
meeting of the non-executive Directors without the Chairman
present. The outcomes of these meetings were then fed back 
to individuals by the Chairman, Senior Independent Director or
Group Chief Executive, as appropriate.
Investor relations
In regular meetings with shareholders and analysts the Group
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director communicate 
the Group’s strategy and results, disclosing such information 
as is permitted within the guidelines of the Listing Rules. 
Such meetings ensure that institutional shareholders
representing over 50% of the Company’s issued share capital
meet with the Company on a regular basis. Major shareholders
are also offered the additional opportunity to meet with the
Chairman and/or Senior Independent Director .
Kevin Thompson spoke at the Credit Suisse European Capital
Goods Conference in London in September 2006. He talked
about Halma’s business sectors, strategy and track record. 
He also addressed some of the frequently asked questions
about Halma and looked at the Group’s priorities for the 
current year .
In February 2007, Halma hosted a site visit to its BEA subsidiary’s
headquarters in Liège, Belgium for analysts and investors. 
No new trading information is disclosed during such visits.
Andrew Williams spoke at the Dresdner Kleinwort Capital Goods
Conference in London in March 2007.
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the annual general
meeting, and major shareholders are also invited to briefings
following the interim and annual results. The content of
presentations to shareholders and analysts at results
announcements and all announcements are available 
on the Group website, www .halma.com.
The Group website also contains electronic versions of the 
latest Annual report and accounts, Interim reports, biographical
information on key Directors and Officers, share price
information, and full subsidiary company contact details as well
as hotlinks to their own websites. The website also contains the
facility to request e-mail alerts relating to announcements made
by the Group.
The Financial calendar is set out on page 96.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility to the
shareholders for the Group’s system of internal control and
responsibility for reviewing its effectiveness has been delegated
to the Audit Committee. Any system of internal control can
provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. 
Following publication by the T urnbull Committee of guidance for
directors on internal control (“Internal Control: Revised Guidance
for Directors on the Combined Code (October 2005)”), the Board
confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the
Group, that this has been in place for the year under review and
up to the date of approval of the Annual report and accounts.
This process has been reviewed by the Board, and the Group
accords with the current T urnbull guidance. 86 Halma p.l.c. 2007
Corporate governance continued
The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte & T ouche LLP , have
audited the financial statements and have reviewed the internal
financial control systems to the extent they consider necessary 
to support their audit report.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has adopted
a schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it 
for decision. This schedule was reviewed during the year . This
procedure is intended to ensure that the Directors maintain full
and effective control over all significant strategic, financial and
organisational issues.
Central insurance cover is maintained for the Group and its
operating companies and its adequacy is subject to annual
review by the Board of Directors.
Group risk is mitigated by means of an operating structure which
spreads the Group activities across a number of autonomous
subsidiary companies. Each of these companies operates with 
a high quality board of directors including a finance executive.
Group companies operate under a system of controls which
includes but is not limited to:
� a defined organisational structure with an appropriate
delegation of authority to operational management; 
� deployment of finance executives in each operating company .
Further resource continues to be added in this area;
� the identification and appraisal of risks both formally , through
the annual process of preparing business plans and budgets,
through an annual detailed risk assessment carried out at local
level and informally through close monitoring of operations;
� a comprehensive financial reporting system within which 
actual results are compared with approved budgets and 
the previous year’s figures on a monthly basis and reviewed 
at both local and Group level;
� an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate
level of approval for all capital expenditure;
� self-certification by operating company management of
compliance and control issues, a process which was further
strengthened during the year; 
� a robust IT network for Group communication.
The processes which the Board has applied in reviewing the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control are
summarised below .
� Operating companies carry out a detailed risk assessment
each year and identify mitigating actions in place or proposed 
for each significant risk. A risk register is compiled from this
information, against which action is monitored through to
resolution. In addition, Divisional Chief Executives carry out an
independent risk assessment for each operating company . 
A review of Group risks is also conducted.
� Each month the board of each operating company meets,
discusses and reports on its operating performance, its
opportunities, the risks facing it and the resultant actions. 
The relevant Divisional Chief Executive chairs this meeting.
Divisional Chief Executives meet regularly with the Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director and report progress to 
the Executive Board.
� A set of “warning signs” which are specifically relevant to every
Halma operating company has been developed and these are
reported and monitored each month with actions taken at
senior level where required. These warning signs are firmly
embedded within the operating processes of each company . 
As a result, potential risks are highlighted at an earlier stage 
for corrective action.
� The Group Chief Executive submits a report to each
Halma p.l.c. Board meeting which includes financial information,
the main features of Group operations and an analysis of the
significant risks facing the Group at that time.
� Cyclical internal audit visits, the depth of which has been
increased this year , are carried out by senior finance staff
resulting in actions fed back to each company and followed up
by Divisional Finance Directors and Divisional Chief Executives.
Visit reports are coded in terms of risk with any significant
control failings reported directly to the Audit Committee and 
a summary of all such visits reported to the Audit Committee
regularly . Senior finance staff also carry out financial reviews 
at each operating company prior to publication of half year 
and year end figures.
� The Group Finance Director and Group Chief Executive report 
to the Audit Committee on all aspects of Internal Control for its
review . The Board receives the papers and minutes of the Audit
Committee meetings and uses these as a basis for its annual
review of internal control.
The Audit Committee established the internal audit function for
independent reporting of the outcome of internal control visits 
to the Audit Committee following its review of internal control
activities in 2004. 
As a result of the assessment of the Group’s internal audit
activities carried out last year , new resource has been added 
and additional training undertaken.
Auditor independence
The Audit Committee has responsibility for reviewing auditor
independence and objectivity annually . During 2003/04, the
Committee set down the “Policy on Auditor Independence and
Services provided by the External Auditor”. This policy states 
that the Group will only use the appointed external auditor for
non-audit services in cases where these services do not conflict
with the auditor’s independence. The policy also sets a fee level
of £100,000 above which non-audit services are subject to a
tendering process. The above fee levels for non-audit services
regarding the external auditors are also subject to an annual 
cap equal to the audit fee. Halma p.l.c. 2007   87
Report on remuneration
The following sections of the Report on remuneration have been
audited: the table of Directors’ remuneration; pension benefits;
Directors’ interests in shares.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently consists of the three 
non-executive Directors, the members being Richard Stone
(Chairman of the Committee), Geoff Unwin and Stephen Pettit.
During the year , Andrew Walker was also a member up to the 
date of his resignation and Geoff Unwin rejoined the Committee
following an amendment to the Combined Code. No Director 
takes part in discussions concerning his own remuneration.
The Committee, having taken external advice, makes
recommendations to the Board on the framework for executive
remuneration, based on proposals formulated by the Group
Chief Executive, and determines the terms of service and
remuneration of executive Directors and senior executives. 
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available from 
the Company Secretary on request, include:
� determining and agreeing with the Board the policy and 
framework for the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive,
the executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other
members of the executive management as it is designated 
to consider;
� approving the design of, and determining targets for , any
performance related pay plans operated by the Company and
agreeing the total annual payments made under such plans;
� reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval 
by the Board and shareholders, and determining, each year ,
whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of
such awards, the individual awards to executive Directors and
other senior executives and the performance targets to be set;
� determining the policy for , and scope of, pension arrangements
for each executive Director and other senior executives.
The Committee also monitors and considers, with the Group
Chief Executive, the framework of remuneration for subsidiary
chief executives and directors and ensures a consistent
approach is applied.
The Committee appointed Watson Wyatt to advise on various
aspects of executive remuneration. They also provided the
Company with limited additional advice, regarding the 
UK defined benefit pension plan, during the year .
Remuneration policy
The policy on Directors’ remuneration is to provide remuneration
packages necessary to attract, retain and motivate Directors of
the quality required to run the Group successfully , manage its
businesses and align the interests of the Directors with those of
the shareholders. In determining such packages, the Committee
considers whether members of the executive management of
the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible
manner , rewarded for their individual contributions to the 
success of the Group.
In accordance with rule 12.43A(c) of the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority the Board presents its Report on
remuneration to the shareholders. The Board confirms that when
determining the remuneration policy for executive Directors for
2006/07 full consideration was given to the Combined Code
appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority .
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary levels for each individual are determined with
reference to Watson Wyatt market survey data and other relevant
data in order to relate remuneration levels to comparable
companies. The Group Chief Executive is responsible for
assessing the performance of each senior executive taking
account of the complexity of the operations under their control,
their opportunities for advancement within the Group, their
remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their
bonus earning potential. He then formulates a remuneration
proposal for the Committee’s approval. Basic salary levels are 
set around the market median, and the Committee ensures 
that a balance between fixed and variable remuneration is
achieved. At targeted levels of growth, the bonus expectation 
is approximately 60% of salary .
Remuneration of subsidiary boards is set at competitive levels 
to reflect the size, complexity and geographic locations of 
the relevant businesses. 
Share plans
The Directors have long believed that share plans are an
excellent way to align the interests of senior management 
with those of shareholders and that share plans provide 
excellent motivation. The Committee, recognising the need 
to continually assess and evaluate such incentives adopted 
a performance share plan following approval at the 2005
annual general meeting. 
The Plan contains provisions permitting share option grants,
restricted share awards and performance share awards. 
Currently the Committee intend to use the Plan only to award
performance shares. The first awards were made in August 2005.
Awards, which are made annually , are determined by evaluating
the financial and operational performance of the executive
Directors and the Divisional Chief Executives and their attainment
of certain personal goals. The maximum award is fixed at 140%
of salary for executive Directors and 100% of salary for Divisional
Chief Executives. The expected level of award is 110% of salary
and 80% of salary respectively . Awards vest after three years on
a sliding scale, as set out below , subject to the Company’s relative
TSR performance against the FTSE 250 excluding financial
companies (current year awards), combined with a measure
based upon an absolute Return on total invested capital (ROTIC).
Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award
lapse. The performance share plan is also extended to certain
centrally based executives and subsidiary chief executives with
maximum awards of 40% of salary .  88 Halma p.l.c. 2007

14.0% 50.0 66.7 100.0 100.0
The 1990, 1996 and 1999 share option plans all provided for the
grant of two categories of option both of which are subject to
performance criteria. The exercise criteria for these three plans 
are noted in note 23 to the accounts. No further grants may be
made from the first two of these plans nor does the Company 
intend to make any further grants from the 1999 Plan now that
the performance share plan has been approved by shareholders
(2005 annual general meeting). The granting of options was 
spread over the life of the Plan. 
The total dilution effect under these various discretionary share
plans is less than 5%.
Performance related bonus scheme
This scheme, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional
Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the Remuneration
Committee and approved by the Board. There is no alternative
bonus arrangement for Directors and Divisional Chief Executives.
During the year the Remuneration Committee carefully assessed
existing bonus arrangements and determined that incentive
levels are appropriately set.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if
the profit of the Division for which he is responsible exceeds a
target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial
years. The profits calculated for this purpose regard each
Division as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with
the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions. 
For the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director ,
bonuses are calculated as above but based on the aggregated
profit of the Divisions exceeding a target calculated from the
profits of the Divisions for the three preceding financial years.
Since 2005/06, executive Directors and Divisional 
Chief Executives may increase their cash bonus, subject to 
a 100% of salary cap, by either 10% of salary if the Return 
on capital employed in their Division (or aggregate thereof)
exceeds 45%, or by 15% of salary if accompanied by absolute
profit growth in their Division (or aggregate thereof).
T ransitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure
Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary directors participate in bonus arrangements similar 
to those established for senior executives.

The fees paid in relation to Geoff Unwin were paid to Gunwin
Limited. Andrew Williams’ benefits include relocation expense
reimbursement of £74,000. Executive Directors received pension
supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension
entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan defined benefit
arrangements is limited by a pensionable salary cap introduced
from 6 April 2006. The Company introduced a pensionable salary
cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the
Pension Act 2006. Without the introduction of such a cap, there
would, effectively , have been no benefit limits. This could have
resulted in benefits in excess of prescribed levels with some
individuals suffering penal rates of tax and potentially causing 
a limitation on the tax deductibility of employer contributions. 
The Company obtained external advice regarding the changes 
to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and required
each affected executive to obtain independent advice prior to
implementing the changes. These changes reduce the Plan’s
future liabilities and their associated funding risk.
T o the extent that an executive’s current salary exceeds the Plan
salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate 
of 26% of the excess. As of 6 April 2006 Kevin Thompson chose
to cease entirely future service accrual in the Halma Group
Pension Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary .
Andrew Williams was the highest paid Director in the financial year . Halma p.l.c. 2007   89
Pension benefits
Except as noted above and below , the executive Directors
participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group
Pension Plan. This section is a funded final salary occupational
pension plan registered with HM Revenue & Customs, which
provides a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable
salary after 25 or more years’ service at normal pension age (60).
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest
salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before
retirement or leaving service. From 6 April 2006, final pensionable
salary is capped at 7.5% of the Lifetime Allowance equating to
£112,500 for the year ended 31 March 2007.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits in kind
are not pensionable nor subject to the pension supplement. 
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary ,
pensions in the event of early retirement through ill health and
dependants’ pensions of one-half of the member’s prospective
pension. Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age
50 with the consent of the Company and the T rustees of the
Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment
increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by
price inflation (subject to a maximum of 5%) through to 31 March
2007 and 3% thereafter .
Details of the value of individual pension entitlements are 
shown below .

Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors have 
contracts with an indefinite term up to the normal retirement 
age of 60 and providing for a maximum of one year’s notice.
There are no exceptions to this policy . None of the contracts 
has pre-determined compensation clauses in the event of 
early termination. The Board and the Remuneration Committee
confirm that these contracts are appropriate. 
Non-executive Directors
Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors have a
specific three-year term of engagement which may be renewed
for further three-year terms if both the Director and the Board
agree. The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive
Directors is determined by the Board based on independent
surveys of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive
Directors of similar companies. The Chairman and the 
non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented 
by additional fees for membership and/or chairmanship of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
The contract in respect of Geoff Unwin’s services provides for
termination, by either party , by giving not less than six months’
notice. The fee for Geoff Unwin’s services for 2006/07 was set 
at £140,000 per annum. In addition there is a contribution of
£16,150 towards office costs.
The other non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
The Chairman’s and the non-executive Directors’ fees were last
reviewed by the Board in April 2006 at which time the revised fee
levels were set for three years from 2006/07 as follows:
Geoff Unwin (appointed September 2002), Chairman £140,000
Richard Stone (appointed January 2001), 
Senior Independent Director , Remuneration 
Committee Chairman and Audit Committee member £43,000
Stephen Pettit (appointed September 2003), 
Audit Committee Chairman* and Remuneration 
Committee member £40,000
*From April 2007.
No fees are payable for membership of the Nomination
Committee of which each of the above Directors is a member .

Notes
1 A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint a
proxy or proxies to attend and on a poll, vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need
not be a shareholder of the Company . A personalised form of proxy is enclosed.
Appointing a proxy will not prevent a shareholder from attending the meeting
and voting in person.
2 T o appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must complete: (a) a hardcopy 
form of proxy , sign it and return it, together with the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) in hardcopy under which it is signed, or a hardcopy notarially
certified of such authority , to the Company’s registrars, Computershare
Investment Services PLC, or (b) a CREST Proxy Instruction (as set out below), 
in each case so that it is received no later than 11.30 am on 30 July 2007.
3 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST
electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the annual general meeting
and any adjournment(s) of the meeting by using the procedures described in
the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored
members and those CREST members who have appointed any voting service
provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s),
who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service 
to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must
be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo Limited’s specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described 
in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received
by the Company’s agent (ID 3RA50) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments set out in note 2 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the
message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is
able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by
CREST . After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through
CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers should note that CRESTCo Limited does not make available
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system
timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST
Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned 
to take (or , if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored
member or has appointed any voting service provider(s), to procure that 
his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as is
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST
system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular , to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical
limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the
circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.

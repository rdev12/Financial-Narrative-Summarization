Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements An improving market
The UK housing market has continued to recover with  
strength now being seen in all regions. Mortgage lending  
has improved and the Government’s Help to Buy scheme  
has had a positive effect in increasing the construction  
and sale of new housing. 
We were particularly pleased to see that in March, the Help to 
Buy (Equity Loan) scheme due to finish in 2016 was extended  
to 2020. This provides the industry with more continuity,  
an important consideration given the investment timescales 
involved in buying and developing land. 
The varied rates of recovery across different regions of the UK 
have been challenging for policy makers. In this context, the 
measures introduced by the Bank of England in June to limit 
high loan to value lending appear well targeted. 
We welcome a policy environment that provides greater  
stability in the longer term, which enables us to drive  
sustainable improvements in our returns.
An improved operating performance
During the year we have continued to benefit from the substantial 
improvements we have made to our operating performance. 
Acquiring land suitable for development on the right terms is  
the fundamental building block of our business. Whilst the land 
market has become more competitive, in particular in the South 
East, the quality and disciplined approach of our land teams 
means that high margin land in attractive locations continues  
to be secured. The new sites already in production are 
exceeding our target returns.
There is no doubt that increasing volumes across the industry 
have put pressures on our supply chain. I am pleased that the 
long term relationships with our suppliers have ensured that we 
have been able to work through these issues with little disruption 
to our business. 
At the same time, operating costs remain under control with a 
continued focus on process improvement, driven by the cost 
advantages of our centralised procurement systems, 
standardised build processes and IT systems.
Building quality homes
During the year we have increased our focus on design and the 
quality of the homes that we build. The Board believes that this 
customer-first ethos provides a competitive edge in terms of 
customer preference and pricing, whilst driving out costs 
resulting from poor build quality. 
For the tenth successive year the National House-Building 
Council (‘NHBC’) has awarded our site managers more Pride in 
the Job Awards than any other housebuilder. We are the only 
This has been a year of outstanding 
progress for the Group. In addition  
to stronger market conditions, we  
have benefitted from the underlying 
improvements we have embedded  
in the business. 
As a result, our profitability

more than doubled, we have hit  
our return on capital target two  
years early and have improved  
our margins significantly.

A year of outstanding progress
Chairman’s Statement major housebuilder to achieve the Home Builders Federation 
(‘HBF’) Five Star recommendation from customers for five 
consecutive years. 
We are committed to Building for Life 12, the new Government 
endorsed design standard.
Our employees
The recent progress of the Group could not have been 
achieved without the talent and hard work of our employees. 
On behalf of the Board, I wish to thank our employees for their 
efforts that underpin the quality, the safety and the success of 
our operations. We are committed to continuing the investment 
in the development of our people, which is at the heart of 
creating a great place to work.
Improving returns and the Capital Return Plan
ROCE is an important performance metric for our business  
and our initial target of 18% ROCE for FY16 has been achieved 
two years early. The Board has therefore set a new target of  
at least 25% for FY17 and, following recent consultation with 
shareholders, ROCE performance has now been linked to  
the Executive Long Term Performance Plan.
Looking at the medium term plan for the Group, with a backdrop 
of controlled volume growth, we expect to substantially increase 
cash generation. Whilst we will continue our disciplined approach 
to investing in high quality land opportunities and targeting 
minimal year end net debt, we believe it is now appropriate  
to supplement our ordinary dividend payments. The Board is 
therefore pleased to announce a medium term Capital Return 
Plan that will combine the ordinary dividend, which will continue 
to be based on the dividend being three times covered by 
earnings, together with a special cash payment programme.
Under the special cash payment programme we anticipate 
proposing a special cash payment with our FY15 results of 
£100m payable in November 2015, followed by a special cash 
payment of £125m proposed with our FY16 results payable in 
November 2016, and a special cash payment of £175m 
proposed with our FY17 results payable in November 2017 . We 
will consider the best mechanism to effect the special cash 
payment programme such as using a B-class share scheme or 
a special dividend.
We therefore expect to return around £950m of cash  
through ordinary
B
 dividend and special cash payments to our 
shareholders in the next three years, which equates to a total  
of 96 pence per share based upon 30 June 2014 share capital.
As the first payment in the Capital Return Plan, the Board 
proposes a final ordinary dividend of 7 . 1 pence per share payable 
in November 2014, which combined with the interim dividend of 
3.2 pence per share, gives a total dividend for FY14 of 10.3 pence 
per share. The dividend is covered three times by earnings, 
achieving our target for FY16 two years ahead of schedule.

The Board
The Board has set out a clear strategy for the future development 
of the Group and this is being successfully implemented by the 
Executive team. After six years as Chairman I will step down from 
the Board at the Company’s AGM. 
I am grateful for the contribution of my Board colleagues in 
developing the Group’s strategy through market conditions that 
were challenging and are now improving. They have consistently 
supplied the right degree of support and challenge.
For the next stage of the Group’s development, the Board has 
recruited an outstanding new Chairman, John Allan CBE. He 
joined the Board on 1 August 2014 and I wish him and the 
Board well for the future.
Bob Lawson
Chairman
9 September 2014
I am delighted to be joining the Board as Chairman Designate 
of the country’s leading housebuilder. Bob Lawson, who is 
retiring as Chairman, has led the Company with distinction  
for the last six years in difficult market conditions; his wise 
counsel will be greatly missed. He leaves with the business 
performing well, where profitability and return on capital are 
rising, and the balance sheet is strong. I look forward to 
supporting the management team in further developing  
our strategy and performance.

. Profitability has more than doubled to 
£390.6m (2013: £192.0m before exceptional items) and we 
achieved a ROCE of 19.5%, exceeding our target of 18% two 
years ahead of schedule. A continued focus on both profitability 
and ROCE will maximise sustainable shareholder value.
The stronger market conditions have resulted in a significant 
increase in activity levels and we have been particularly focused 
on maintaining discipline and control through every aspect of 
the business. We have strengthened our Balance Sheet, ending 
the year with a net cash balance of £73. 1m (2013: £25.9m net 
debt) – the first time we have been in a year end net cash 
position for eight years.
During the year we have also continued to identify and 
implement operational improvements that will further  
enhance our future performance.
 
Our performance
Building profitability
The very substantial increase in profitability has been driven  
by our land investment strategy, the efficiency of our business 
model and the prices we have achieved for the outstanding 
homes we have built.
Land investment 
Since re-entering the land market in 2009, we have approved 
the purchase of £3.8bn of land. All land approvals must meet 
our minimum hurdle rates of a 20% gross margin and 25% 
ROCE 
2
 without assuming price inflation. During the year, returns 
on newly acquired land exceeded these minimum hurdle rates. 
The transformation of our land bank from older low margin land 
to newly acquired high margin land is progressing well. In 2014, 
65% (2013: 49%) of completions were from newly acquired high 
margin land and this will increase in FY15, underpinning further 
improvements in financial performance. We expect 95% of all 
completions to be from new land for FY17 and that the Group 
gross margin will be a minimum of 20%.
Driving value 
During the year, private average selling price increased by 12.9% 
from £213,900 to £241,600. This reflects our strategy of changing 
the mix of homes we sell and ensuring we maximise value 
coupled with house price inflation of around 5% for the year. 
We are continuing to focus on carefully matching the type  
and style of homes we build to local demand conditions.  
We have traded very well throughout  
the year on the back of stronger market 
conditions in all parts of the country, our 
substantial land investments over the last 
five years and continuing improvements  
in our underlying performance.
1    Return on capital employed ‘ROCE’ is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, operating 
charges relating to the defined benefit pension scheme and operating exceptional items, 
divided by average net assets adjusted for goodwill and intangibles, tax, cash, loans and 
borrowings, retirement benefit obligations and derivative financial instruments.
2    Site ROCE on land acquisition is calculated as site operating profit (site trading profit less 
overheads less allocated administrative overheads) divided by average investment in site  
land, work in progress and equity share.
8 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strong performance  
in a recovering market
Group Chief Executive’s Review The proportion of larger homes in attractive locations has 
increased and we are building fewer apartments. Outside  
of London, the proportion of our completions that were 
apartments fell from 21.5% to 17 .4% during the year.
Stronger market conditions have led to an increase in underlying 
house prices. During the year we saw this reflected in the higher 
prices being achieved for our homes, particularly in London, the 
South East and the East of England with smaller increases 
elsewhere in the country. 
A key component of our marketing proposition remains quality 
and good design. Higher quality homes on attractive, well 
designed developments command a price premium compared 
to the second-hand market in many areas.
Efficiency and costs 
Higher production volumes across the industry placed a 
number of well publicised pressures on the supply chain. 
Increased costs and shortages of materials were experienced  
across the industry, however we experienced limited disruption 
to our build programme. 
Our operating model of building a high proportion of 
standardised products, strong supplier relationships and 
centralised procurement contracts has served us well. 
A shortage of skilled labour did increase costs, with bricklaying 
the most affected area. However, these costs form a low 
proportion of our total cost base. Overall we have seen a low 
single digit increase in our build costs. Over the next twelve 
months we expect low single digit build cost inflation. 
Driving returns on capital
During the year we continued our focus on increasing return  
on capital achieving a ROCE of 19.5%, up from 1 1.5% in FY13. 
As a result, we exceeded our target of 18% two years ahead  
of schedule and we have now revised our target to a ROCE  
of at least 25% for FY17 . 
New land coming into production is a key driver of return on 
capital for the business and we have a 25% hurdle rate for all 
the new land we acquire. On completed sites to date that were 
acquired since 2009, we have generated a 39.2% ROCE.
A stronger Balance Sheet
Over the last three years we have moved from net debt of 
£322.6m as at 30 June 201 1 to net cash of £73. 1m as at 
30 June 2014. This reflects our stronger trading performance 
combined with control of working capital. 
Our priorities
We have developed four priorities to deliver leading financial 
performance and returns for our shareholders; customer first, 
great places, building excellence and investing in our people.  
For each area we have a number of targets in place that will drive 
the performance of the business. We believe that by innovating  
in these areas and consistently applying best practice, we will 
maximise sustainable returns for our shareholders.
Customer first
A fundamental part of our strategy is to increase customer 
preference by building great homes and providing an 
outstanding experience for our customers. We have again 
achieved a customer recommendation score of over 90%, 
achieving a HBF 5 Star customer rating for the fifth consecutive 
year. We are the only major housebuilder to achieve this. 
We ensure that the value of our David Wilson and Barratt 
brands are maximised through carefully defined market 
positioning and by offering the right house types to the right 
market segments. During the year we have refreshed the 
Barratt Homes and Barratt London brands and this is proving 
popular with customers and our employees.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements 80% of customer leads are now generated through our 
websites and 94% of leads are actioned within five working 
hours. The cost-effectiveness of our lead generation is also 
reinforced by a national call centre that is now handling over 
70,000 enquiries per year. 
We continue to develop a series of optional extras for our 
customers to ensure that we meet their requirements. Last year 
57% of our customers chose optional extras with an average 
spend of £3,900.
In the longer term we are continuing to research the lifestyle 
choices of our customers to ensure we understand emerging 
consumer trends.
Great places
Building great places requires the ability to secure outstanding 
sites at the right price and ensuring that through thoughtful 
design they are transformed into attractive places to live.
 
We are positioning ourselves as the local developer of choice 
based on the quality of our business and the ability to secure 
the right planning consents. As a result, we have been able to 
develop innovative partnerships with a number of land owners. 
During the year we approved £1, 198. 1m (2013: £1,047 .3m) of 
land investment amounting to 21,478 (2013: 18,536) units on 
156 (2013: 145) sites. As at 30 June 2014 the Group had 4.7 
years (excluding JV’s) of land supply, slightly exceeding the 
Group target of 4.5 years. This reflects our success at both 
acquiring operational land in the market and converting land 
from our strategic land.
We have made good progress on building our strategic land 
portfolio, which now comprises c. 69,200 plots (2013: c. 59,800 
plots). In the year 10.0% (2013: 7 .0%) of total completions were 
on strategically sourced land, and as our rate of strategic land 
conversion increases, we expect strategic land to deliver around 
20% of completions in FY17 .
18.2% (2013: 24. 1%) of the land acquisitions approved in  
the year originated from the public sector. This is an area  
of competitive advantage for the Group as the procurement 
requirements are complex and require high design, 
environmental consideration and delivery capability. 
In terms of design, we are now using Building for Life 12  
on all new sites to ensure that we create great places to live.  
We are the only major housebuilder to commit to the full 
implementation of this standard.
Building excellence
The quality of our building processes and the homes we sell  
to our customers is of critical importance. For the tenth year in  
a row we have won more NHBC Pride in the Job Awards for the 
excellence of our site managers than any other housebuilder.
 
We believe that a ‘right first time’ approach is the most  
cost-effective option and we will continue to focus on the 
excellence of our build processes. 
Where there are cost advantages and quality can be 
guaranteed, we are already adopting modern methods of 
construction (‘MMC’) in certain elements of home construction 
such as roofing systems. In the short term we will develop this 
approach further and in the longer term we believe there will be 
opportunities to develop a ‘whole house’ MMC approach 
across the business.
Investing in our people
Attracting and retaining the best people by investing in their 
development is fundamental to the success of our business, 
particularly as the industry continues to recover and skill 
shortages remain. 
During the year over 750 of our sales advisers attended our 
internal sales academy, which awards a nationally recognised 
qualification, to ensure that our sales and service capability on 
site is enhanced. The first cohort of 36 assistant site managers 
We are continuing to see the benefits of  
the operational changes we have made  
in terms of efficiency and the focus we have 
placed on improving the design and quality 
of the homes we build.”
The Prime Minister, Rt Hon David Cameron MP , visited our West  
of Bedford development to meet some of our apprentices.

Group Chief Executive’s Review continued started our foundation degree course at Sheffield Hallam 
University and we now have 64 students on the course in total.
In addition, we announced a new target to recruit 1, 100 
apprentices, interns and graduates over a three year period. 
During the year our graduate scheme was voted the best in 
the UK in the Job Crowd’s ‘Best Companies for Graduates  
to work for’.
Current trading
Current market conditions remain strong. Following the launch 
of Help to Buy in April 2013, sales rates over the summer period 
last year were exceptionally strong. This year we have seen a 
return to more normal seasonal trends. We started the new 
financial year with a strong forward order position and in the  
last ten weeks net private reservations per active site per week 
have averaged 0.62 (FY14 equivalent period: 0.66) in-line with 
our targets.
Pricing remains strong as we focus on achieving the best value 
for the outstanding homes we build and continue to see the 
benefits of reduced sales incentives coupled with improvements 
in selling prices arising from both underlying price inflation and 
changes in mix. 
As at 7 September 2014 total forward sales (excluding JV’s)  
for the Group were up 22.3% at £1,505.9m (8 September 2013: 
£1,231.3m) equating to 7 ,682 plots (8 September 2013: 6,676 
plots). Private forward sales (excluding JV’s) were £1, 145.6m  
(8 September 2013: £880.4m), up 30. 1%. JV total forward  
sales at 7 September 2014 were £249.8m (8 September  
2013: £164.3m). JV private forward sales were £148.9m  
(8 September 2013: £156.3m).
Outlook
This has been a very strong performance and the outlook  
for the Group is positive. 
We are continuing to see the benefits of the operational 
changes we have made in terms of efficiency and the focus  
we have placed on improving the design and quality of the 
homes we build. These disciplines coupled with the strength  
of the market and the quality of the land we are acquiring will 
support a further significant increase in performance in FY15 
and progress towards the new ROCE target we have set of  
at least 25% by FY17 .
With our strong projected cash generation, we are pleased  
to announce that our ordinary dividend programme will be 
supplemented by a special cash payment programme for  
the three years to FY17 . The first special cash payment is 
£100m in November 2015, with £125m in November 2016  
and £175m in November 2017 . In combination, we expect  
to return around £950m of cash through ordinary (based  
on consensus earnings) and special cash payments to our 
shareholders in the next three years.

The UK economy and housing market
The UK economy continued to grow in the twelve months to  
30 June 2014, with most economic indicators showing significant 
improvements on the prior year. The UK housing market has 
continued to recover with strength beginning to be seen in all 
regional markets as well as in London and the South East. 
Mortgage lending has improved and the Government’s Help  
to Buy (Equity Loan) scheme has had an important effect in 
accelerating the construction of new housing. UK residential 
housing transactions for the year to 30 June 2014 increased  
by 24% on the prior year to 1. 19 million transactions (source:  
HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’)).
  
Housing supply
The supply of new housing has increased, with 137 ,780  
new housing starts in the year to 30 June 2014 in England,  
an increase of 22% on the prior year (source: Department  
for Communities and Local Government (‘DCLG’)). Whilst  
this represents a positive move, new housing starts remain  
c. 40,000 lower than the pre-downturn peak and significantly 
lower than that required to meet the demand from new 
household creation. The DCLG estimates that 221,000 homes 
need to be created per annum until 2021 to meet the demand 
from new household creation.
Help to Buy and mortgage availability
In April 2013 the Government introduced Help to Buy to improve 
the supply of mortgage finance. There are two parts to the 
scheme: Help to Buy (Equity Loan), which is for new homes  
in England, and Help to Buy (Mortgage Guarantee), which can 
be used on all home purchases. Help to Buy (Equity Loan) has 
had a major impact upon new housebuilding, enabling 25,992 
First time buyers Verity and Jamie Cundill purchased a home  
at Cathedral Walk in Wells, Somerset.
In the 2014 calendar year to date there 
has been house price growth across  
all UK regions. Housebuilders have 
responded by increasing the number  
of new homes being built but significant 
challenges remain to address the shortfall 
in housing stock.

of HMRC residential housing transactions in England

. Help  
to Buy (Mortgage Guarantee) has had a limited impact on  
the second-hand homes market, being used on only 7 ,313 
purchases over the first six months of its operation (source:  
HM Treasury).
During the year, there has also been an increase in the 
availability of mortgage finance. The number of mortgage 
approvals for house purchases rose by 25% to 798,645 
approvals in the year to 30 June 2014 and the value of 
mortgage approvals for house purchases rose by 32%  
to £126, 1 17m (source: Bank of England).
The Mortgage Market Review rules came into effect in April 
2014. These require lenders to undertake additional due 
diligence on borrowers’ ability to meet mortgage repayments. 
Also in May 2014, the Governor of the Bank of England 
expressed his concern on the growth of house prices in the 
South East of England. Subsequently, Lloyds Bank and the 
Royal Bank of Scotland introduced policies to address the risks 
relating to house price inflationary pressures in their mortgage 
portfolios by reducing the income multiple limits on higher value 
properties. In June 2014, the Bank of England outlined plans  
to limit the level of high loan to income mortgage lending.
House prices
The shortfall in the supply of housing stock and the greater 
availability of mortgage finance meant that house prices rose 
significantly in the year. The ONS house price index rose by  
Bodington Manor is set in the attractive suburb of Adel in North Leeds 
and offers David Wilson four and five bedroom homes.
an average of 10.2% p.a. across the UK for the month of June 
2014. The increase was particularly marked in London and the 
South East of England, where the ONS house price index  
for London properties rose by 19.3% in June 2014 on the prior 
year. Outside of London and the South East, the ONS house 
price index rose by 6.3% in June 2014. According to the Halifax, 
the UK average house price in June 2014 was £183,462,  
which rose by £15,794 on June 2013.
Housing market outlook
Underlying demand for new housing is expected to remain strong 
in the long term but based on the current level of new housing 
starts, supply is unlikely to meet this demand in the short term.

Housebuilding
We have experienced a positive trading environment with  
strong demand for new homes across the country and 
significant improvements in operating metrics across all six  
of our operating regions. 
Sales rates were up significantly in the year at 0.69 (2013: 0.58) 
net private reservations per active site per week. This increase 
reflects a full year of the Government’s Help to Buy (Equity Loan) 
scheme in England, as well as the combination of our carefully 
selected locations, improved house design and development 
layout, and the investment we have made in our sales and 
marketing functions.
During the year we operated from an average of 364 (2013: 381) 
active sites (excluding JV’s). We opened 132 sites (2013: 139 
sites) with the level of interest in our site openings showing the 
strong demand for our homes across the country. 
Completions for the full year including JV’s, were up 8.6% at

Delivering our priorities
Operating and Financial Review proportion of our completions that are on more recently 
acquired higher margin land; these accounted for 65% (2013: 
49%) of the total in the year. The growth in completion volumes 
has also enabled us to gain efficiencies from our 27 division 
operating structure.
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) has provided a very attractive 
opportunity for our customers, especially for first time buyers. 
During the year 31.4% (2013: 4.0%) of our total completions 
(excluding JV’s) used the scheme. 
We have seen a reduction in the use of our own sales schemes, 
with just 0.3% (2013: 10.0%) of our completions using equity 
share schemes other than Help to Buy (Equity Loan) and 8.3% 
(2013: 15.7%) using part-exchange. This has led to a reduction 
in our incentive costs. 
Our total average selling price (‘ASP’) increased by 12.9% to 
£219,900 (2013: £194,800) in the financial year. The majority  
of this increase continues to be driven by changes in mix. We 
have also seen underlying sales prices strengthen throughout 
the year across all regions. Private average selling price 
increased by 12.9% to £241,600 (2013: £213,900) driven  
by the same factors, and affordable average selling price 
increased by 2.8% to £105,300 (2013: £102,400).
During the year we saw some upward price pressure on 
materials, in particular for bricks and timber. A shortage of 
skilled labour did increase costs, with bricklaying the most 
affected area. However, these labour costs are a low proportion 
of our total cost base. Overall we have seen a low single digit 
increase in our build costs. Over the next twelve months we 
expect low single digit build cost inflation.
Housebuilding operating profit increased by 62.6% to £410.8m 
(2013: £252.7m before exceptional items, £249.9m after 
exceptional items).
We have a total of 12 (2013: 10) housebuilding JV sites  
of which 6 (2013: 7) are in London. The total future gross 
development value of our JV’s as at 30 June 2014 was  
£3.0bn, the majority of which is expected to be delivered  
over the next six years. We have continued to make good 
progress on our housebuilding JV’s and during the year fully 
completed the development of Altitude, Aldgate which is a 
Barratt London JV with L&Q. Housebuilding profit from JV’s  
and associates for the year was £40.7m (2013: £7 .7m).
Commercial developments
Since the downturn, outside London and the South East, the 
commercial occupier market has been able to satisfy demand 
through the availability of lower cost second-hand space. 
E-commerce logistics requirements present opportunities for 
larger distribution facilities. The retail occupier market remains 
challenging, although leisure occupiers have continued to 
perform well throughout the downturn. Mixed-use leisure  
and residential schemes are a focus for Wilson Bowden 
Developments going forward.
Lillies Hill, Felpham showcases the finest David Wilson home designs, and is located close to the countryside and the coast.
21 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Commercial development revenue was £14.4m (2013:  
£13.6m) with an operating loss of £1.0m (2013: break-even).  
We completed land sales totalling 31 acres, stock property 
disposals totalling 152,000 sq. ft. and we also agreed a 
forward-funded deal for a 1 18-bed hotel in Derby city centre, 
with works due to start on site shortly. In our town centre 
projects, build activity has commenced on our 200,000 sq. ft. 
Hinckley scheme, which is substantially forward-funded and 
pre-let. Barratt London and Wilson Bowden Developments 
have been appointed Preferred Developer on a major mixed-
use regeneration project in the London Borough of Hounslow.
Results
The improved performance in our housebuilding business 
resulted in an operating profit of £409.8m (2013: £252.7m  
before exceptional items, £249.9m after exceptional items)  
at an operating margin of 13.0% (2013: 9.7%).
The finance charge for the year was £59.7m (2013: £68.3m 
before exceptional items, £147 .6m after exceptional items), 
consisting of a cash finance charge of £26.7m (2013: £47 .5m) 
and £33.0m (2013: £20.8m) of non-cash charges.
Profit before tax for the year was £390.6m (2013: £192.0m 
before exceptional items, £104.5m after exceptional items).  
The increase of £198.6m excluding exceptional items was  
driven by increased completion volumes, a greater proportion  
of completions from more recently acquired land, some 
underlying house price inflation and continued efficiency gains.
The tax charge for the year was £85.2m (2013: £29.8m).  
The rate of tax assessed for the year is slightly below the 
standard effective rate of corporation tax of 22.5%  
(2013: 23.75%), due to a number of items, the largest of  
which was the use of previously unrecognised losses.
 
Profit after tax for the year was £305.4m (2013: £7 4.7m),  
resulting in basic earnings per share of 31.2p (2013: 7 .7p).
Return on capital employed
We have been focused on driving a substantially improved 
ROCE and for the year delivered a ROCE of 19.5% (2013: 
1 1.5%). This exceeds our target of 18% ROCE for FY16, two 
years ahead of schedule. We have now set a target of at least 
25% ROCE for FY17 .
Capital Return Plan
The Board has announced its Capital Return Plan with the 
intention of supplementing the Company’s ordinary dividend 
payments with a special cash payment programme.
The Board proposes to pay a final ordinary dividend of 7 . 1 pence 
(2013: 2.5 pence) per share for the financial year ended 30 June 
2014, which subject to shareholder approval, will be paid on  
20 November 2014 to shareholders on the register at the  
close of business on 31 October 2014. Together with the  
interim ordinary dividend of 3.2 pence per share, which was 
paid in the year, this gives a total ordinary dividend for the year 
of 10.3 pence per share. The ordinary dividend was covered 
around three times by basic earnings per share, achieving our 
target of three times ordinary dividend cover for FY16 two years 
ahead of schedule.
Under the special cash payment programme the Board 
anticipates proposing a special cash payment with our  
FY15 results of £100m payable in November 2015, followed  
by a special cash payment of £125m proposed with our  
FY16 results payable in November 2016, and a special cash 
payment of £175m proposed with our FY17 results payable  
in November 2017 . We will consider the best mechanism to 
effect the special cash payment programme such as using  
a B-class share scheme or a special dividend.
In combination, the Capital Return Plan is expected to  
return around £950m of cash through ordinary (based  
on consensus earnings) and special cash payments  
to the Company’s shareholders in the next three years.
Net cash
We generated £242.3m (2013: £165.8m) of cash from our 
operations during the year, which resulted in net cash of  
£73. 1m at 30 June 2014 (2013: £25.9m net debt). 
As we increase site numbers, make scheduled payments on 
agreed new land and build work in progress to deliver spring 
2015 completions, we expect net debt at 31 December 2014  
to increase in line with normal seasonal trends (2013: £155.0m). 
It remains our objective to maintain an appropriate capital 
structure and have minimal year end net debt.
Altitude is a stunning 27 storey tower situated in the heart of the 
regeneration of Aldgate.

Our vision is to lead the future of 
housebuilding by putting customers  
at the heart of everything we do.
We will deliver sustainable returns for  
our shareholders by focusing on our 
priorities and our principles.
 
Our Priorities
We have four priorities to strengthen  
our business: customer first, great  
places, building excellence and  
investing in our people.
Our priority is to build great homes and provide a customer 
experience that exceeds expectations. We seek to anticipate 
our customers’ evolving needs by continuously improving the 
homes and places we build.
Customer satisfaction
We are proud to have been awarded the Home Builders 
Federation (‘HBF’) 5 Star status five years in a row for excellence 
in customer recommendation as measured by the HBF/NHBC 
customer survey. We continually invest in both improving our 
product quality and customer service. In order to give our 
customers peace of mind we also offer a five-year customer 
warranty that covers the majority of fixtures and fittings over  
and above the ten-year NHBC structural warranty. 
We have reviewed all of our quality control procedures in the 
past year to ensure that they drive the best product quality 
possible. All of our homes are inspected at a number of key 
stages and are approved by site managers, contract managers, 
sales staff and a divisional director before handover to our 
customers. Our senior management team monitors customer 
satisfaction survey performance on a weekly basis.
Site-based technology facilitates the monitoring of both product 
quality and customer service. We have upgraded site-based 
technology in the last year with the introduction of tablet 
computers so that site managers can sign-off each quality 
control check point. We have also invested in our customer 
service reporting systems and are in the process of 
redeveloping our in-house system.
Key highlights
 – Only major housebuilder to achieve HBF 5 Star status for  
fifth consecutive year
 – Continually investing in improving product quality and customer 
service including site-based technology, our website and training 
 – Undertaken recent research into customer needs and are using 
this throughout our business including in our house designs
 – Working with lenders to provide our customers with access  
to a wide a range of mortgage products

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
Customer first Our people are central to delivering customer satisfaction and  
we have developed a new training programme for all customer-
facing staff to reinforce our policies and procedures and ensure 
that our employees understand and display customer focused 
behaviours. During the year, 327 existing employees have 
attended a one-day customer service training programme.  
All new customer-facing employees will attend a two-day 
programme in the first three months of employment.
Communicating with our customers is also essential for excellent 
customer service. We are rolling out a new customer service 
section of our website, which allows customers to make service 
enquires directly to the relevant member of our team. It also 
explains the service process and what is covered by warranties 
and guarantees. We have also reviewed our customer service 
communications in the year and have introduced a welcome card 
and email for every customer, which explains which divisional 
director approved their home and how to raise any queries.
Responding to customer needs
We carefully consider customer preferences in the development 
of the Barratt and David Wilson product ranges. Our product 
ranges are regularly reviewed to ensure that they reflect latest 
trends and customer feedback and provide internal layouts 
designed with modern living in mind, with free-flowing living 
areas and natural light. 
During the year we have conducted a number of consumer 
insight initiatives. These include customer segment research  
in order to better understand the product, service and marketing 
requirements of each type of customer; research into consumer 
attitudes towards sustainability and the awareness of the 
sustainable features of our homes; and a review of our current 
and proposed house type ranges for Barratt Homes. We are 
using the output from this research throughout our business 
from house design to sales and marketing.
Using technology to help improve quality for  
our customers
In 2010 our quality control procedures saw us put in place 
handheld devices in order to check and record the build 
quality of our plots. Building on that initial success we have 
conducted a full refresh of the application and the hardware  
in the last year.
All sites are now equipped with tablet computers with a quality 
control application installed for the systematic checking of 
plots through all stages of the build. The system is closely 
aligned to the NHBC equivalent ensuring that we follow 
diligently what is expected and beyond. 
Further to the Site Manager sign off there are several key 
stages that are to be checked periodically by the Contracts 
Manager adding that extra level of quality protection to  
our product. In total there are around 2,500 individual 
components that make up the standard quality checks  
for our homes.
Data from these inspections is collated and can be analysed  
to look for trends in the design, the construction or the 
materials used. We are able to perform this analysis on a 
national scale therefore the Site Manager now has a tool  
and a voice in order to raise any matters regarding the  
quality of our products. Similarly this information can be 
shared with subcontractors and suppliers in order to seek 
further quality improvements.

Operating and Financial Review continued Accessibility to home ownership
Customers now have improved access to mortgage finance 
that allows them to buy with a 5% deposit through the 
Government sponsored Help to Buy and NewBuy schemes 
and through an increase in the range of higher loan to value 
products available through regional building societies.
We welcome the recent recommendations from the Bank  
of England to put in place controls to limit the level of high  
loan to income lending from banks in the future and to  
ensure appropriate levels of affordability testing. We believe  
the proposals will provide greater stability for the market,  
without significantly reducing the ability of customers to secure 
mortgage finance. We believe that a stable pricing environment 
is one that will enable us to drive sustainable returns over the 
long term for our shareholders.
Over the last two years we have adopted a new sales training 
approach with an external training partner. Our aim is to 
ensure we have a sales team with the highest capability  
in the industry.
 
Investing in our sales advisers
We continue to work with a broad set of lenders through our 
approved brokers to ensure that our customers have access  
to a wide range of mortgage products. This has resulted in a 
reduction in the reliance of our customers on the two largest 
lenders, Lloyds Bank and Nationwide. During the year we 
launched a range of products exclusive to Barratt in association 
with the Leeds Building Society. The products are innovative, 
with some allowing an initial three or six months period with  
no interest charged, well priced and are backed by a service 
proposition designed around our customers’ needs.
The ‘Single Sales Principle’ training programme is accredited 
by the Institute of Sales and Marketing Management. It has 
also won the Sales Development Programme of the Year  
at the British Excellence in Sales & Marketing Awards. The 
methodology behind the programme is designed to ensure 
that customer’s needs are met and the highest value achieved 
for our homes.
 
We have trained our sales managers to become accredited 
assessors for the programme. This assessment is followed  
up with a mystery shopping programme twice a year.
 
In addition we have refined our recruitment criteria and 
selection processes. This is to ensure we appoint new  
sales advisers who benchmark well against the behaviours 
demonstrated by our very best people.
New starters are then inducted and trained through  
a three-month programme.

acres) of strategic land, which we actively manage to obtain  
the necessary planning consents. In the year, 5,205 plots  
(2013: 2,557 plots) were transferred from strategic land to our 
owned land bank, more than double the number in the prior 
year. Strategic land is expected to become an increasing 
proportion of our operational land in future years with a target  
of 20% of legal completions coming from this land for FY17 .
We continue to seek to defer payment for new land where 
possible to drive a higher ROCE. Land creditors as at 30 June 
2014 were £779.4m (30 June 2013: £7 44.4m) representing 33% 
(30 June 2013: 35%) of the owned land bank.
Key highlights
 – We continue to see high quality land opportunities across  
all regions that meet our required hurdle rates
 – The transformation of our land bank to more recently acquired 
higher margin land is progressing well (84% of our owned  
and controlled land bank at 30 June 2014)
 – Detailed planning permission has been obtained on 98% of FY15 
expected completions and outline planning on a further 2%
 – All developments designed from 1 January 2014 to meet the

As a business our success is dependent upon securing the 
best land in the most desirable locations by building long term 
partnerships, and designing developments that look great, are  
a pleasure to live on and enhance the existing local communities. 
Securing the best land
The most important factor in our drive to build profitability  
is acquiring and bringing into production high margin land.  
In the year, 65% (2013: 49%) of our completions were from 
more recently acquired higher margin land. 
We continue to see high quality land opportunities across all 
regions that meet our required hurdle rates of a gross margin  
of 20% and a ROCE of 25%. In the year we have approved a 
total of £1, 198. 1m (2013: £1,047 .3m) of land equating to 21,478 
plots (2013: 18,536 plots).
Our success in buying land is based on the extensive local 
knowledge of our divisional land teams and strong local 
relationships with land owners, combined with detailed 
assessments of local market conditions. We target locations 
based on the availability of land, housing market conditions  
and the likelihood of obtaining planning consent.
We continue to target a regionally balanced land portfolio  
with a supply of owned and controlled land of approximately 
4.5 years. As at 30 June 2014, we have achieved our target  
with a 4.7 year land supply (excluding JV’s) comprising 3.4 years 
of owned land, and 1.3 years of conditionally contracted land.

Great places Delivering strategic land
Montague Park comprises 85 acres of farmland on the south 
east corner of Wokingham. We secured our interest on this 
site in 1996 through part freehold acquisition and part option 
agreement. It was an excellent opportunity for development 
in a well located and connected market town with good 
transport links to the capital.
Through working closely with the local authority we achieved 
planning in 2012, and work began on site in November 2013 
with the first completions in June 2014.
This site will deliver 620 homes over the next five years 
across both the Barratt Homes and the David Wilson Homes 
brands, with all homes designed to suit the requirements  
of the Local Planning Authority. This site has a Building for 
Life 12 commendation for design, one of the first sites 
awarded this distinction in the country.

Obtaining effective planning permissions
An important part of bringing land into production is the 
planning process. We have seen some improvements,  
both as a result of changes in Government policy and 
operational improvements within our business. Following  
the implementation of the Government’s National Planning 
Policy Framework, there are stronger incentives for local 
authorities to put in place their plan for a five-year land  
supply. This is leading to an improved dialogue between  
local authorities and our divisions. Nevertheless, the planning 
process remains a lengthy one and on average it takes us 
around 70 weeks from commencing the formal pre-application 
process to achieving planning consent. The length of the 
planning process will remain a restriction on the speed  
at which housing supply can increase.
We have maintained good momentum in achieving planning 
consents, and during the year we secured planning on 21,004 
plots (2013: 14,964 plots). We currently have detailed planning 
permissions on 98% of expected FY15 completions and outline 
consent on a further 2%.
Designing great places
Designing great places is fundamental to our business: our 
customers want to live in great places; the vendors of the land 
we purchase want to work with developers who leave behind  
a legacy of design quality; and local people want developments 
that enhance their community. We have therefore made the 
commitment to achieve the Built for Life quality mark on all 
developments designed from 1 January 2014. Building for Life  
is the Government endorsed industry standard for creating  
well designed residential places. At the Building for Life launch 
event in April 2014, we won seven out of the 16 commendations 
awarded; with a further ten of our sites being awarded 
commendations by the end of June.
27 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Award winning design
De Lacy Court is a development of 13, two to five bedroom 
homes in the north Leicestershire village of Castle Donington 
designed to reflect the village’s heritage. It has been 
externally recognised for its design, being awarded a 
Building for Life 12 commendation and also winning the 
bronze award in the Best Development category of the  
2013 WhatHouse? awards.
The development layout was derived from a historical 
sandstone wall which originally ran 100 metres across 
the length of the site. Given its local significance, the original 
line of the wall has been retained, with the original stone 
creating a mixture of front garden walls, decorative plinths 
and ground level stone setts within driveways. Restoration 
work was carried out by a local stonemason who used 
traditional methods and lime mortar to rebuild the wall.  
This has been complemented by the retention of mature 
trees and hedges within the site.
The development uses David Wilson Homes standard house 
types, individually enhanced to include features inspired by 
existing properties found in Castle Donington. This includes 
the use of Victorian style square bays; wooden double 
glazed windows; timber doors; oak garage doors; and 
timber detailing. Traditional character and an established  
feel have been further added in the use of Flemish bond  
and recessed pointed brick work. The development integrates 
into its local context, with public open space at the entrance 
of the site providing a meeting point and play area.

Building excellence Quality construction
Elba Park, a partnership with the Homes and Communities 
Agency and Sunderland City Council, is creating a new 
community of 359 homes in a country park setting, on  
a site that was in continuous heavy industrial use for over 
360 years. The site uses house types specifically designed 
for the location and is complex with a wide range of 
materials, external and technical features, and the use  
of low carbon technologies.
Quality of construction is a key priority for Senior Site 
Manager Mark Summersgill, whose outstanding work  
at Elba Park saw him become national runner-up in the 
NHBC Pride in the Job Awards in 2013. The site has also 
won a Considerate Constructors silver award.
Mark has introduced innovative ways of encouraging 
and maintaining first-class build quality at the site. This 
includes sharing examples of excellent workmanship across 
trades engendering a sense of pride between them. This is 
important, as having trades work together so that each 
respects the other’s work, is key to construction excellence. 
In addition, a quality assurance process is applied to ensure 
that all stages of installation are signed-off. A strict regime of 
checks is conducted on each property, starting at foundation 
stage and continuing until the buyer has moved in, with Mark 
monitoring quality and progress on a daily basis.

workmanship in the NHBC Pride in the Job Awards. This is the 
tenth consecutive year that we have won more than any other 
housebuilder. We were also awarded Large Developer of the 
year at the 2014 RESI Awards.
Partnering with our supply chain
We have a centralised procurement team which has built  
long term relationships with our suppliers. This ensures the 
consistency of specification and technical performance of the 
materials used in our homes. Long term relationships have also 
enabled us to ensure the continuous availability of materials as 
demand increased. We also use many local subcontractors in 
the construction of our homes, who we partner with to ensure 
the availability of the skilled trades that we require.
We engage in continuous communication with our suppliers 
and hold regular performance and business reviews, training 
days and an annual supplier conference. This year we have  
also signed the Construction Prompt Payment Charter. 
We have implemented a sustainable procurement and timber 
sourcing policy. We purchase substantial amounts of timber 
and since December 2013, all timber and timber products  
that we use are FSC/PEFC certified and originate from well 
managed forestry sources.
Innovating to improve efficiency
We constantly review the latest available technologies to  
assist us in meeting evolving regulations, increases in predicted 
demand and material shortages. In the year we conducted an 
analysis of offsite manufacturing to understand its potential 
benefits, constraints and challenges.
The majority of our homes are built with traditional brick and 
block construction. Alternative approaches may become more 
compelling if there are changes in materials and skills availability 
or cost, the regulatory environment or the need for faster 
construction. In 2015 we are aiming to identify the technologies 
most suitable for our business that will enable us to deliver our 
longer term strategic objectives.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Excellence in complex project delivery
The Courthouse on Horseferry Road in the City of 
Westminster represents one of the most challenging  
delivery programmes ever undertaken by the in-house 
construction team at Barratt London.
The development is an 1 1-storey residential building 
comprising 129 luxury studio, one, two and three bed flats  
and penthouses. The development includes a double-height 
lobby, shared courtyard, concierge, fitness suite and 
underground car park with car stacker.
From inception to completion, the project’s development 
lifecycle presented a series of complex challenges for 
the Barratt London team. With both the original and the 
new building occupying the entire site footprint, significant 
constraints were placed on each of the demolition, logistics 
and construction aspects of the site’s development.
The initial challenge of getting out of the ground required 
a complex engineering effort and took 12 months 
from demolition to reach ground level. Once at ground 
level, the team managed the difficult site logistics, onsite 
construction of the development’s reinforced concrete 
frame, procurement and installation of the limestone 
facade and the fit out involving 450 tradespeople 
onsite from multiple disciplines. 
Barratt London’s construction expertise, focus on 
right first time delivery together with detailed planning, 
were essential in ensuring the successful delivery of 
this complicated development with construction from 
ground level to occupation completed in just 44 weeks.
Construction of the development within this timeframe 
would not have been possible without the support of 
local residents and community groups. Barratt London 
continuously communicated with local people, including 
through two public exhibitions, so they understood 
project milestones and could provide feedback.
  For further information see www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk
We have recently put together an Innovation Panel tasked with 
finding innovative products and services from across the supply 
chain. In 2015, we aim to work in partnership with some of our 
suppliers to explore ways to increase efficiencies in their 
materials manufacture and logistics processes.
We are also researching smart technologies and their use in 
future homes to improve the ability of customers to save energy.

Operating and Financial Review continued Developing our talented people
We are committed to the development of our people and 
assisting in rebuilding the housebuilding skills base in order  
to drive our success. We offer both vocational and leadership 
training programmes, as well as in-house schemes promoting 
employee development, engagement and recognition.
The Barratt Academy continues to provide structured, bespoke 
training to support individual development across three 
separate disciplines; apprentices, site managers and technical/
commercial roles. Courses combine professional training (onsite 
and in the classroom) with industry recognised qualifications.
We continue to invest in and develop our ‘Future Talent’ 
strategy. In September 2013, we committed to employing 
600 graduates, trainees and apprentices over a three-year 
period. In February 2014, we increased this number to 1, 100  
of which 340 will be recruited during 2014. 
During the year we introduced a number of new entry level 
programmes in addition to our award winning graduate and 
apprentice programmes. Our paid undergraduate internship 
programme supports students studying built environment, 
marketing or HR degrees through a 48-week industrial 
placement. During the programme, interns complete ‘mini 
rotations’ to learn about our business before specialising in  
one area for the remainder of the year. Those who perform  
well are offered a permanent position with us upon completion 
of their degree. 
We also introduced the concept of ‘Accelerated Programmes’. 
These are one-year programmes in sales or construction for 
graduates who want to fast-track their learning in a job role, with 
the aim of progressing through to a management position in the 
future. Our first group have performed well and as a result, we 
are recruiting a further 35 in 2014. 
Our two-year graduate programme continues to be a success. 
We were delighted to be ranked first in the Job Crowd’s ‘Best 
Companies for Graduates to work for’ across all companies. 
We are also delighted that our graduates continue to win 
awards including at the National Graduate Recruitment Awards 
and the Birmingham Young Professional of the Year Awards. 
Key highlights
 – Employee engagement of 78% with target for the year exceeded
 – Continue to invest in our ‘Future Talent’ strategy and are making 
good progress towards our target of employing 1, 100 graduates, 
trainees and apprentices over a three-year period

diversity and inclusion.
Engaging our people
As a business we believe that an engaged workforce is critical 
to our success. We conduct an annual employee engagement 
survey in order to gain valuable insight into how our people feel 
about working for us. In 2014 we appointed a new organisation 
to work with us to further develop employee engagement within 
our business. We are delighted that in our annual employee 
engagement survey we exceeded our target with an index of 
78%, which is better than the UK employers norm of 63%. We 
develop and implement action plans following each survey to 
strengthen our business and to continue our position of being 
an employer of choice. 
We have a ‘Get Recognised’ programme which allows our 
people to be rewarded by colleagues for a job well done  
with instant awards of £100 cash or a day’s holiday. We also 
recognise the outstanding contributions of our people through 
quarterly awards for sales staff, apprentices and site managers 
as well as via individual and team excellence awards. Around 
430 awards were made through these schemes in the last year.

Investing in our people Building skills for the future
Our bespoke Residential Development and Construction 
Foundation Degree was officially launched in November  
2013. Designed by Barratt with Sheffield Hallam University,  
the first cohort of 36 students – Assistant Site Managers and 
Trainee Assistant Site Managers – and their Construction 
Director mentors joined Mark Clare and the Dean of the 
University at the induction. We now have 64 students on the 
course in total.
The degree is a three-year, part-time course, comprising  
a mix of classroom learning at the University and site based 
work. On completion of this course, students can move onto  
an eighteen month top-up course to obtain a BSc qualification. 
It was created in response to a shortfall of young people 
entering professions within the industry and an absence  
of a degree programme in residential development. The 
programme is designed to equip school leavers with the skills 
and experience to cultivate successful and rewarding careers. 
It offers a credible alternative to university for those school 
leavers who wish to enter the workforce straightaway and  
still gain a degree level education. Following Barratt piloting  
the programme in the first year, the content will be shared 
across the Major Housebuilders Group.
The first set of students are performing well, with one already 
having been promoted to Site Manager. We’re also delighted 
that the programme gained runner up position in the National 
Graduate Recruitment Awards in the Best School Leaver 
Programme category.

When considering our focus on diversity we do not just think  
in terms of gender. This year we launched a pilot in one of our 
regions to enhance our ability to attract a more diverse pool  
of talent. Focusing on ethnic minorities in the Leicestershire 
region we engaged with local schools and colleges with a high 
ethnic student population, informing them of the many career 
opportunities we offer and encouraging applications onto our 
Apprenticeship schemes. It was pleasing to see a significant 
year-on-year increase in job offers to ethnic minority applicants, 
and also a significant increase in the ethnic minority mix of 
employees in our East region. It is our intention to roll this 
programme out to the rest of the business. 33% of our interns 
and 23% of our graduates this year are from ethnic minorities.

We support the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and have policies and processes in place to ensure that 
we act in accordance with our principles in relation to areas 
such as diversity, anti-corruption and whistleblowing.

Keeping people safe
There are inherent risks in construction, so maintaining stringent 
safety standards and a continuous focus on health and safety 
issues is paramount. Getting the basics right, good leadership, 
and commitment to health and safety from all levels of 
management delivers strong health and safety performance 
throughout our business.
Our Safety, Health and Environmental management system 
(‘SHE’) is subject to continuous review and improvement. All of 
our trading divisions are certified to OHSAS 18001 and adhere 
to our SHE guidelines with their ongoing compliance being 
verified by a programme of internal and external audits. During 
the year, we carried out 5,788 (2013: 5,437) monitoring visits 
and achieved an average compliance rate of 96% (2013: 97%).
Our overall aim is to have an injury free working environment,  
and whilst we believe that all injuries are avoidable, our objective 
for the year was to have a 5% reduction in our reportable Injury 
Incidence Rate (‘IIR’). During the year, our IIR disappointingly 
increased by 15% to 379 (2013: 329) per 100,000 persons 
employed, which is slightly above the HBF (April 2013 – March 
2014) average of 376. The housebuilding sector as a whole has 
seen an increase in IIR driven by the rapid increase in build rates 
and adverse winter weather conditions. We have investigated the 
causes of our IIR increase and have enhanced our procedures 
as a result. We have also appointed a Board Committee to 
improve the stewardship of health and safety performance.
At the NHBC 2014 Health and Safety Awards our site managers 
received six awards and Kirk Raine, site manager at our Webbs 
Meadow Development, won the best site award in the large

Being a trusted partner
We recognise that, whether acting as sole developer, JV partner, 
client or contractor, partnerships are vital to our success. 
We continue to work with private landowners, operators and 
agents to identify and bring forward land for development. 
Divisional land teams continue to work hard to try and ensure 
we are regarded as the housebuilder of choice by the local 
landowning and agency community. Our work with Sainsbury’s 
at Fulham Riverside and Nine Elms and with British Land at 
Aldgate show the benefits of this approach in securing large 
sites within London.
We form long term partnerships with the public sector and  
work to unlock challenging sites by finding solutions, sharing 
best practice and transferring knowledge. Our experience and 
expertise in regeneration is respected by our partners who have 
selected us to deliver a range of complex projects in the year 
including Cherry Knowle Hospital, Sunderland and Leatherhead 
Bypass, Surrey. 
Our principles in action
In order to build a sustainable business 
that delivers value for shareholders, 
partners, communities and society  
we must act responsibly. We do this  
by keeping people safe, being a trusted 
partner, building strong community 
relationships, safeguarding the 
environment and ensuring the  
financial health of our business.

Building strong community relationships
We engage with local communities in order to seek to address 
any impact that our developments may have on the environment 
and we respond to community aspirations by creating new jobs, 
training people and supporting local initiatives. By holding public

developments, 61 1 (2013: 556) hectares of open space were 
created and 866,819 (2013: 310,923) trees or shrubs were 
planted or retained. We published an Ecology and Biodiversity 
Policy during the year, and made a commitment to produce 
biodiversity action plans on all new developments. We have 
now entered into a unique national partnership in our sector 
with the RSPB to develop a programme to improve practices  
in this area.
Minimising our environmental impact
We seek to minimise the environmental impact of our operations 
by using resources efficiently and reducing waste and carbon  
in our construction processes. 
We segregate waste for recycling as standard across our sites 
and have achieved a recycling rate of 94% (2013: 95%) for the 
year. We narrowly missed our recycling target of 95% for the 
year and will continue to focus our efforts on identifying ways  
to ensure that we eliminate and reduce waste in FY15. 
We generated 6.39 tonnes (2013: 6.25 tonnes) of waste  
per legal completion in the year, this is an increase of  
2.2% compared to 2013, and we will re-focus our efforts  
on improving resource efficiency. 
Our direct and indirect operational greenhouse gas emissions 
are shown in the table below. This is based on the energy used 
in our offices, on our live developments and for business travel 
and, for the first time this year, includes emissions from air 
conditioning in our offices.

Our operational greenhouse gas emissions per 1,000 sq. ft. 
have increased very marginally this year, and we aim to analyse 
the causes of this increase and drive awareness and improved 
energy and greenhouse gas performance across our business.
Ensuring the financial health of our business
We are committed to ensuring the financial health of our business 
by ensuring that we maintain financial discipline across all aspects 
of our operations. All land purchases must meet our hurdle rates 
of 20% gross margin and 25% ROCE and be approved by the 
Land Committee. We maintain an appropriate capital structure, 
with land and long term work in progress funded by shareholders’ 
funds and land creditors, and minimal net debt at our year end. At 
30 June 2014, net cash was £73. 1m (2013: £25.9m net debt) and 
land creditors were 33% (2013: 35%) of the owned land bank.
We have around £850m of committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes to June 2016 and £650m to May 2018 with 
some of these facilities extending as far as 2021. Our covenant 
package is appropriate and our facilities provide appropriate 
headroom above our current forecast requirements.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Our performance is subject to a number of risks, of which the principal risks and 
the changes impacting on them are set out in the table below. No new principal 
risks have emerged during the financial year.
 
Risk and description
 
Relevance to strategy
 
Mitigation
Changes in factors impacting 
on the risk in 2014
Economic environment, 
including housing demand 
and mortgage availability
Changes in the UK and European 
macroeconomic environments, including 
unemployment, flat economic growth, 
buyer confidence, availability of mortgage 
finance particularly for higher loan to 
values including Government backed 
schemes, the ability of purchasers to 
repay equity share loans, interest rates, 
competitor pricing, falls in house prices  
or land values, may lead to a fall in the 
demand for houses, which in turn could 
result in impairments of the Group’s 
inventories, goodwill and intangible assets.
The majority of homes built by the 
Group are purchased by individuals 
who rely on the availability of mortgages. 
The confidence of buyers and their 
ability to obtain mortgages or other 
forms of financing are impacted by  
the macroeconomic environment. 
Accordingly, customer demand  
is sensitive to changes in  
economic conditions.
The Group’s ability to grow its business 
partly depends on securing land or 
options over sites and having adequate 
resources to build sufficient homes to 
meet demand. The Group’s ability to do 
this can be impacted by cash and profit 
constraints which, in turn, would have 
an adverse effect upon net operating 
assets and net debt (see also the 
liquidity, land and construction risks 
sections below).
• Executive Committee, regional  
and divisional weekly reviews 
of trading performance and key 
performance indicators
• Monthly Board report on trading 
performance and the economic 
environment, including mortgage 
affordability statistics
• Internal systems identify the impact 
of sales price changes on margins
• Quarterly site valuations and reviews
• Half yearly asset impairment reviews
• Comprehensive sales policies and 
procedures including transparency 
towards mortgage lenders
• Head of Mortgage Lender Relations 
works with key mortgage lenders 
to seek to ensure that appropriate 
policies are available for customers
The growth in consumer confidence 
that started in early 2013 has continued 
throughout the financial year, against 
the backdrop of an improving  
economic outlook.
We have also seen improvements in the 
underlying provision of mortgage finance.
Government support for the UK 
housebuilding industry has remained 
strong, with a number of initiatives  
in place designed to support house 
purchases and stimulate economic 
growth. The Government has extended 
Help to Buy (Equity Loan) in England 
until 2020. Help to Buy in both Scotland 
and Wales ends in 2016. We expect 
Help to Buy to remain a very attractive 
opportunity for our customers, 
particularly first time buyers.
  pages 18 and 19
Land purchasing
The ability to secure sufficient consented 
land at appropriate cost and quality to 
provide profitable growth.
The Group needs to purchase 
sufficient quantities of good quality, 
consented land at attractive prices  
in order to be in a position to achieve  
its annual construction forecasts and 
enhance the Group’s ability to deliver 
profit growth.
Acquiring poor quality or mispriced  
land would have an adverse impact  
on profitability and revenue.
• All potential land acquisitions are 
subject to formal appraisal, approval 
by the Group’s Land Committee and 
must meet minimum hurdle rates of 
20% gross margin and 25% ROCE
• Divisional, regional and Group 
monthly analysis of land currently 
owned, committed and identified 
against requirements
• Regular divisional land meetings
The Group continues to see a good 
range of opportunities for investment  
in its targeted locations without undue 
concentration and without relaxing its 
20% gross margin or 25% ROCE hurdle 
rates. However, there is a strong 
demand for conventional and low 
complexity sites particularly in London 
and the South East, with some location 
specific land price increases in these 
areas driven by competition and house 
price inflation.

 Principal risks and uncertainties
Managing Risk continued  
Risk and description
 
Relevance to strategy
 
Mitigation
Changes in factors impacting 
on the risk in 2014
Liquidity
Unavailability of sufficient borrowing 
facilities to enable the servicing of 
liabilities (including pension funding) and 
the inability to refinance facilities as they 
fall due, obtain surety bonds, or comply 
with borrowing covenants. Furthermore, 
there are risks to management of 
working capital such as conditional 
contracts, build costs, joint ventures  
and the cash flows related to them.
The Group maintains committed facilities 
of different duration that are designed  
to ensure that the Group has sufficient 
available funds for operations. The 
Group’s borrowings are cyclical during 
the financial year and peak around April/
May and October/November each year. 
Due to our seasonal trends in income, 
these are the calendar points when  
the Group has the highest working 
capital requirements.
The Group maintains sufficient 
committed debt facility headroom  
and in addition has a number of trade 
finance and surety facilities that are 
designed to ensure the Group has 
sufficient funds available. The absence 
of appropriate headroom would limit  
the Group’s land buying and operational 
capability, adversely affecting 
profitability and the Group’s ability  
to deliver shareholder value.
• Committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes of around £850m 
with maturities ranging from 2016 
to 2021
• Regular forecasts including working 
capital, cash flow facility headroom, 
surety bond requirements and 
compliance with banking covenants
• Group policies require maintaining 
facility headroom of up to £150m
The Group is in compliance with its 
borrowing covenants and, at the date  
of approval of the 2014 Annual Report 
and Accounts, the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in 
compliance with these covenants for 
the foreseeable future, being at least  
12 months from the date of approval.
 pages 35 and 102
Attracting and retaining  
high-calibre employees 
Inability to recruit and/or retain 
employees with appropriate skill sets or 
sufficient numbers of such employees.
The Group aims to attract, retain  
and develop a sufficiently skilled and 
experienced workforce in order to 
maintain high standards of quality  
and customer service.
Not having employees with appropriate 
skill sets can lead to build delays, 
quality issues, reduced sales, poor 
customer care and reduced profitability.
• Comprehensive Human Resources 
programme led by the Group  
Human Resources Director including 
apprenticeship schemes, a graduate 
development programme, succession 
planning and training academies 
tailored to each discipline
• Monthly monitoring of employee 
statistics including turnover  
and absence
• Exit interviews
• Annual employee engagement survey 
• Remuneration benchmarked against 
industry competitors
There continues to be high competition 
amongst employers in some regions, 
which has resulted in employee 
turnover increasing to 14% (2013: 13%). 
We have continued to invest in the 
training and development of our 
workforce in order to assist in both 
retention and succession planning.
To help the Group address the skill 
shortage in the building industry,  
in 2013 we aspired to recruit 600 
apprentices, graduates and trainees 
over a three year period. We have made 
rapid progress and aim to recruit 
around 1,100 apprentices, graduates 
and trainees over a three year period.
 page 31
Availability of raw materials, 
subcontractors and suppliers 
Shortages or increased costs of materials 
and skilled labour, the failure of a key 
supplier or the inability to secure supplies 
upon appropriate credit terms could 
increase costs and delay construction.
The Group relies upon affordable 
supplies of building materials from 
multiple sources and subcontractors  
to perform the majority of work on sites. 
This retains flexibility to commence 
work on new sites and enhances the 
Group’s build cost efficiency. Adverse 
management of these suppliers  
and/or subcontractors could lead  
to build delays, cost increases and 
reduced profitability.
• Centralised team led by the Group 
Procurement Director procures the 
majority of the Group’s materials from 
within the UK including subcontractor 
materials, ensuring consistent quality 
and costs and security of supply
• All of our significant supply 
agreements are fixed in advance, 
usually for 12 months
• Seek to establish and maintain long 
term supplier and subcontractor 
partnerships
• Group policies include tendering, the 
requirement for multiple suppliers for 
both labour contracts and material 
supplies and establish contingency 
plans should any key supplier fail
• Professional approach to  
site management 
During the year we saw some upward 
price pressure on materials, in 
particular for bricks and timber. A 
shortage of skilled labour did increase 
costs, with bricklaying the most 
affected area. However, these costs 
form a low proportion of our total cost 
base. Overall we have seen a low single 
digit increase in our build costs. Over 
the next twelve months we expect low 
single digit build cost inflation.
During the year, we have invested in  
our materials forecasting systems to 
provide suppliers with visibility of our 
forecasted material requirements.
We continue to renew our subcontractor 
and supplier agreements to ensure best 
pricing and the continuous availability of 
labour and materials.

Mitigation
Changes in factors impacting 
on the risk in 2014
Government regulation  
and planning policy 
Inability to adhere to the increasingly 
stringent and complex regulatory 
environment, including planning and 
technical requirements affecting the 
housing market and regulatory 
requirements more generally.
The Group’s land portfolio consists of 
land for the short and medium term as 
well as strategic land. Inability to obtain 
suitable consents, or unforeseen delays, 
could impact on the number or type  
of homes that we are able to build. We 
could also be required to fund higher 
than anticipated levels of planning 
obligations, or incur additional costs to 
meet increased regulatory requirements. 
All of these would have a detrimental 
impact on the contribution per plot.  
The Group seeks to meet regulatory 
and planning requirements to obtain  
the planning permission required to 
develop homes and communities.
• Consultation with the Government 
both directly and through industry 
bodies to highlight potential issues
• Considerable in-house technical  
and planning expertise devoted  
to complying with regulations  
and achieving implementable 
planning consents
• Rigorous design standards for the 
homes and places we develop
• Policies and technical guidance 
manuals for employees on regulatory 
compliance and the standards of 
business conduct expected
The Group continues to see some 
improvements in this area both as a 
result of changes in Government policy 
and operational improvements within  
its business.
Following the implementation of the 
Government’s National Planning  
Policy Framework, there are stronger 
incentives for local authorities to put  
in place five year land supplies. That in 
turn is leading to an improved dialogue 
between local authorities and the 
Group’s divisions.
Nevertheless the planning process 
remains a lengthy one and on average  
it takes the Group around 70 weeks  
from commencing formal pre-application 
process to achieving planning consent. 
The length of the planning process will 
remain a restriction on the speed at 
which housing supply can increase.
Since 1 January 2014, all new 
developments designed are required  
to meet with the Building for Life 12 
development standard.
   page 27
Construction and  
new technologies 
Failure to identify and achieve key 
construction milestones, due to factors 
including the impact of adverse weather 
conditions, the failure to identify cost 
overruns promptly, design and 
construction defects, and exposure  
to environmental liabilities, which could 
delay construction, increase costs, 
reduce selling prices and result in 
litigation and uninsured losses. There 
are also risks associated with climate 
change and the use of new technology 
in the build process e.g. materials 
related to carbon reduction.
The Group builds homes and 
communities in Britain ranging  
from houses to large-scale flatted 
developments. In the event we did not 
do so efficiently, or new technologies 
result in quality issues, the Group’s 
profitability and ability to grow the 
business could be impacted negatively.
• Executive Committee, regional  
and divisional weekly reviews  
of trading performance and key 
performance indicators
• Progress with development projects 
(including joint ventures and 
consortia) is monitored regularly 
by divisional management teams, 
including through monthly board 
meetings and regular site visits
• Any alternative forms of construction 
and building technologies and the 
quality of materials are subject to 
evaluation by external and internal 
technical experts, including the 
NHBC, to ensure compliance with  
all building and other regulations
• Quarterly site valuations and 
valuation reviews
• Monitoring of environmental  
impact indicators 
• Maintenance of appropriate 
insurance cover
The Group is currently undertaking  
an assessment of various modern 
methods of offsite construction and 
considering their suitability for utilisation 
within the business to reduce the risks 
inherent in the construction process.

Joint ventures  
and consortia
Large development projects, some of 
which involve joint ventures or consortia 
arrangements and/or commercial 
developments, are complex and capital 
intensive and changes may negatively 
impact upon cash flows or returns.
Due to their scale, some projects may 
require joint venture or consortium 
arrangements. Failure of a joint venture 
or consortium partner to perform its 
financial and/or operational obligations 
can place additional capital or 
operational burdens upon the Group.
• All potential joint ventures are subject 
to formal appraisal, approval by  
the Group’s Land Committee and  
the Board
• Once operational, the performance 
of joint ventures and consortia 
arrangements are subject to regular 
operational and financial review
During the year, the Group has entered 
into a number of new joint ventures.
A five year revolving credit facility of 
£120m has been arranged during the 
year for the Group’s joint ventures with 
L&Q. This facility is available to the joint 
ventures for land and build expenditure, 
although the joint ventures continue to 
be primarily equity funded by Barratt 
and L&Q.
 page 21
Safety, health  
and environmental 
Health and safety or environmental 
breaches can result in injuries to 
employees, subcontractors and site 
visitors, delays in construction or 
increased costs, reputational damage, 
criminal prosecution and civil litigation.
Health and safety is a key issue in the 
housebuilding sector. Given the inherent 
risks, it is of paramount importance to 
the Group. Senior management and 
the Board review health and safety 
matters on a regular basis and seek  
to reduce injury incidence rates by 
implementing policies and procedures 
aimed at keeping staff and visitors free 
from injury.
In addition to the possibly tragic impact 
of an accident on-site, there is potential 
for legal proceedings, financial penalties, 
reputational damage and delays to the 
site’s progress.
• Health and safety department, 
independent of the management  
of the operating divisions
• Regular health and safety audits  
and development monitoring 
visits with reports produced for 
divisional, regional, Health and Safety 
Committee, Executive Committee 
and Board review
• Group health and safety  
and environmental policies  
and procedures
During the year, the Group’s 
construction activity has increased.  
The Group has enhanced in its  
Health and Safety team to retain the 
frequency of the audit and monitoring

IT
Failure of the Group’s IT systems 
(whether due to cyber attacks or other 
causes) in particular those relating  
to surveying and valuation, could 
adversely impact the performance  
of the Group.
The ability to optimise prices and 
ensure operational efficiency is 
essential to the Group’s performance. 
The Group’s integrated management 
systems enable the Group to maintain 
tight control, especially with regard  
to surveying and valuation.
Adverse IT performance could cause 
delays in build and have an adverse 
impact on operational efficiency  
and profit.
• Centrally maintained IT systems
• Fully-tested disaster recovery 
programme
• Regular exercises completed to  
seek to reduce the risk of penetration 
through cyber attacks
The Group has continued to invest in its 
site based IT for sales and construction 
teams, customer websites, business 
systems and IT infrastructure.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Appointment and succession
During the year, the key focus of the Nomination Committee 
was my succession planning. This process was led by our 
Senior Independent Director, Mark Rolfe. As announced on 
1 1 March 2014, John Allan joined our Board as a Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman Designate on 1 August 2014, and 
subject to election by shareholders, he will succeed me as 
Chairman following the 2014 AGM. Details of John’s experience 
and skills can be found on page 44 of this report.
Board effectiveness
During the year we addressed all of the recommendations 
made by Mrs Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation 
following her effectiveness review in respect of the 2012/13 
financial year. We have assessed the performance of our Board 
and its Committees during the year under review through a 
series of individual Director and external adviser assessments. 
This process was led by me with support from the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary. The results of the 
review and the key areas of focus for the 2014/15 financial year 
are set out on page 49 of this report.
Diversity
We continue to promote diversity amongst our workforce.  
The Group Chief Executive and Human Resources Director 
provided a presentation upon our approach to this process at 
our strategic away day and a follow-up exercise was undertaken 
at the April Board meeting. Further details on our Diversity  
policy can be found on page 55 of this report.
Risk management and internal controls
Given the risks inherent with building and construction, the 
awareness of risk amongst Directors remains high. Board 
members are fully aware of the individual and collective 
responsibility of the Board to: (i) determine the nature and extent 
of the risks the Board is willing to take to achieve the Company’s 
strategic corporate objectives; and (ii) to review the effectiveness 
of the risk management systems and internal controls (in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee). The commentary on  
the management of risk and the review of principal risks and 
uncertainties on pages 38 to 41 contains an analysis of how  
the risks affecting the Group have changed in the financial year. 
We have also enhanced the focus upon the critical importance 
of seeking continuous improvement in our health and safety 
performance. Accordingly, with effect from 1 July 2014 we 
constituted a Safety, Health and Environmental Board 
Committee, chaired by Richard Akers, to assist the Board  
with discharging its responsibilities in this area moving forward.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to provide you with an update on the Company’s 
approach to corporate governance throughout the 2013/14 
financial year. This will be my last corporate governance 
statement for the Company as I have decided, after six years’  
of service, to step down from my position as Chairman of the 
Board following the annual general meeting in November 2014 
(‘2014 AGM’). Details of my successor, John Allan CBE, and  
the process we followed to recruit him can be found below  
and in the Nomination Committee Report. 
Over the last six years I have been privileged to have worked 
with a group of Directors who, through the Board and its 
Committees, have rebuilt the Company from the impact of the 
2008 downturn. This year, we have once again delivered on  
our strategic objectives and the Board will continue to focus  
on delivering sustainable shareholder value. 
I can confirm that during the financial year ended 30 June 2014 
your Company fully complied with the main and supporting 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) 
issued in September 2012 (a copy of which is available from 
www.frc.org.uk) and with the revised requirements for the 
Directors’ and Remuneration Reports, which formally apply this 
year. The Board appreciates that good corporate governance  
is more than just awareness and adherence to the Code. It is  
aware of the need to maintain a high standard of corporate 
governance in terms of leadership, remuneration, accountability 
and its relationship with shareholders and in setting the right  
tone at the top. I have, on the following pages, set out the work 
undertaken by the Board and its Committees to illustrate how 
corporate governance is embedded in our culture, processes 
and decision making throughout the whole business and how we 
have applied the Main Principles of the Code throughout the year.
42 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report
Chairman’s Introduction Shareholder engagement
As a Board we remain focused on delivering long term  
value to our shareholders, whilst ensuring that we continue to 
promote sustainable developments and homes. Accordingly, 
we place continuing importance upon maintaining strong 
relationships with our shareholders. We achieve this through 
regular dialogue on key issues impacting our business, as well 
as annually consulting with major shareholders in respect of  
our remuneration policy and during the year in response to our 
interim management statements and results announcements. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
During the year, the Board and its Committees completed 
implementation of the changes to the Code in the context  
of our Governance practices. One of these changes is the 
requirement for Directors to make a statement that they 
consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, 
to be fair, balanced and understandable. As part of our 
considerations, we reflected upon the feedback shareholders 
provided in respect of our 2012/13 Annual Report and Accounts 
(and the Remuneration Policy contained in it) and an appropriate 
timetable was established and followed to provide appropriate 
time for review and discussion on significant areas of the 
2013/14 Annual Report and Accounts. The Audit Committee 
then met to: (i) consider all the criteria for a fair, balanced and 
understandable Annual Report and Accounts; (ii) review the 
processes underpinning the compilation and assurance of the 
report, in relation to the financial and non-financial management 
information; and (iii) review the internal processes underpinning 
the Group’s reporting governance framework, the use of 
content owners and external legal and auditor review. 
Following the review by the Audit Committee, the Board then 
considered the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole and 
discussed the tone, balance and language of the documentation, 
being mindful of the new Code requirements and the need for 
consistency between the narrative section and the Financial 
Statements. The Board’s formal statement on the Annual 
Report and Accounts is contained within the Directors’ 
Responsibility Statement on page 92.
Conclusion
Our strategy has delivered. I am delighted that we have been 
able to announce a medium term Capital Return Plan 
supplementing our ordinary dividend payments with a special 
cash payment programme.
Looking forward, the Directors will continue to focus on 
delivering sustainable shareholder value. The Group’s  
business model and strategy to achieve this are set out  
in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 41.

Group and ensuring that the obligations to its shareholders and 
others are understood and met. The Board is responsible for 
setting the strategic direction of the Group and ensuring that it 
has adequate resources and appropriate controls, values and 
standards in place to deliver its strategy within a framework that 
enables risk to be identified and managed. Each Board Director 
is aware of their responsibilities, individually and collectively,  
to promote the long term success of the Group. 
Board composition
The names, responsibilities and other details of each of the 
Board Directors are set out on pages 44 and 45. Membership

Corporate Governance Report website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. The Board  
met on nine occasions during the financial year to review and 
approve various key matters including those matters specifically 
reserved to it. The key responsibilities of the Board and how 
these were undertaken throughout the year are set out below:
Key responsibilities and activities undertaken during  
the financial year (including Matters Reserved):
The Board follows an annual standing agenda which has  
been set in accordance with its terms of reference and  
matters reserved specifically to it. A copy of the matters 
reserved to the Board can be found on the Company’s  
Key responsibilities Activities undertaken during the year

In addition to a formal strategic review, the Board held meetings 
in, and conducted site visits in, the West and the Southern 
regions of the business for periods spanning two days each. 
Separate to these formal visits, individual Non-Executive 
Directors also undertook informal site visits as part of their direct 
engagement with employees. The Board also receives briefings 
from Regional Managing Directors who are not hosting annual 
site visits from time to time, together with presentations and 
updates from key support functions, such as health and safety, 
human resources, information technology and sales and 
marketing. This has assisted the Board with assessing the risks 
affecting the business, having had the benefit of direct input from 
those responsible for managing such risks on a regular basis.
Board committees
During the year the Board had three principal committees to which 
it delegated specific responsibilities: the Audit (pages 56 to 61); the 
Remuneration (pages 62 to 86); and the Nomination (pages 52 to 
55) Committees (each a ‘Committee’). Each Committee 
is provided with sufficient resources to undertake the duties 
delegated to them and is able to seek advice from the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary and external advisers, 
as appropriate. Membership and attendance at meetings of 
each of the Committees during the 2013/14 financial year are 
shown in Tables 4, 17 and 3 (pages 56, 82 and 52 respectively). 
Each of these Committees (and the Board) completed annual 
effectiveness reviews (see pages 61, 83, 53 and 49). 
The Board constituted a fourth committee, the Safety, Health 
and Environmental Committee (the ‘SHE Committee’) on 1 July 
2014 which will meet at least twice a year. The SHE Committee 
will assist stewardship of the safety, health and environmental 
issues impacting the business including, but not limited to, the 
Group’s compliance with the safety, health and environmental 
management system; to review and recommend appropriate 
policies for the Group in respect of this area; and to review and 
monitor significant health, safety and environmental risks and 
exposures to the business and the steps taken to mitigate 
against these. The Chairman of the SHE Committee is Richard 
Akers, Non-Executive Director and the members are Steven 
Boyes, Group Chief Operating Officer and Tom Keevil, Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary.

Directors’ Report continued
Corporate Governance Report continued Roles of the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive  
and the Senior Independent Director
The division of responsibility between the Chairman of the 
Board and the Group Chief Executive is clearly defined in writing 
and has been approved by the Board. The key responsibilities 
of the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Senior 
Independent Director are as follows: 
The Chairman – Bob Lawson
• leads the Board in the determination of strategy and in the 
achievement of its objectives;
• organises the business of the Board by setting its agenda 
and ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion  
of all agenda items, in particular strategic issues; 
• ensures that the Board receives timely, accurate and clear 
information so as to conduct its business properly;
• facilitates the effective contribution of the Non-Executive 
Directors and constructive relations between Executive  
and Non-Executive Directors; 
• ensures new Directors participate in a full and formal 
induction process; 
• makes certain that the continued development needs  
of the Directors are identified and addressed; and 
• ensures effective communication with shareholders. 
The Chairman is supported by Tom Keevil, the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, in carrying out these duties. 
The Group Chief Executive – Mark Clare 
• responsible for the day-to-day management of the operational 
activities of the Group in accordance with overall strategy 
and policy as determined by the Board; and
• chairs the Executive Committee through which he carries  
out his duties. Details on the membership and duties of the 
Executive Committee can be found on page 48 of this report.
The Senior Independent Director – Mark Rolfe
• responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chairman, 
at least annually; and
• responsible for ensuring that, where required, he is available 
to shareholders to: (i) address any material issues or 
concerns which the Chairman and/or Group Chief Executive 
have failed to resolve; and (ii) listen to their views in order  
for the Company to gain a balanced understanding of their 
issues and concerns.
Information and support
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Board 
receives accurate, timely and clear information. Each Director 
is issued with an agenda, briefing papers and comprehensive 
operating and financial management reports for the period 
under review, generally five working days before any Board 
meeting. The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary 
attends all Board and Committee meetings and all Directors 
have access to his advice and, if necessary, to independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense to assist with  
the discharge of their responsibilities as Directors.
Board performance evaluation
The Board is responsible for undertaking a formal and rigorous 
annual evaluation of its own performance, that of its Committees 
and of individual Directors. Given that an external consultant 
undertook the performance evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees for the 2012/13 financial year, the Board agreed  
to carry out such evaluation for the year under review through 
an internal process which was led by the Chairman.
Areas covered by the evaluation
The Board evaluation process covered the performance of 
the Board and its Committees on various areas, including: 
• contribution to strategy and shareholder accountability; 
• risk management; 
• financial and operating reporting; 
• succession planning (including diversity); 
• inter-relationships between the Board and its Committees; and
• Board Committees and decision making. 
Key findings
Overall feedback was positive with the Directors recognising that 
the performance and effectiveness of the Board had been further 
enhanced by implementing the recommendations made by Mrs 
Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation in respect of the 
previous financial year. In addition, the Directors complimented 
the strategy day in January in terms of subject matters addressed 
and the quality of the briefing papers produced.
Focus areas for 2014/15
The key areas that the Board will focus on and address 
throughout this financial year are to ensure that: 
• the disciplines enshrined into the Board process  
are maintained;
• focus remains on the Board and the Committees maintaining 
satisfactory skills, experience and knowledge to help deliver 
the Company’s long term strategy and objectives; and 
• succession plans continue to be monitored and refreshed  
in line with the needs of the business. 
Progress with 2012/13 focus areas
During the year the Board and its Committees addressed all  
the issues raised as part of the 2012/13 performance evaluation 
process, including setting aside time at each meeting to consider 
its effectiveness and the streamlining of briefing papers and 
presentations to the Board.
Evaluation of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
In accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Chairman 
met with the Non-Executive Directors independently of the 
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director , met without the Chairman being present, to 
assess the performance of the Chairman and provided feedback 
from the process. There were no issues of any substance arising 
from the review of the Chairman’s performance and there was 
unanimous support for him. In addition, the Chairman met with 
each Director individually to discuss their contribution to the Board 
and their performance as Directors during the year under review. 
In addition to these specific meetings the Non-Executive Directors 
also meet without the Executive Directors being present either 
immediately prior to or immediately following committee meetings, 
given that they are all members of each of these.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements (iv) Graduate recruitment
The Group runs a number of programmes for new entrants 
through our ‘Future Talent Strategy’. The Group currently has  
86 graduates across our two-year and one-year schemes, 64 of 
which commenced their training in September 2014. In addition, 
64 delegates have commenced our new bespoke Foundation 
Degree in Residential Development and Construction. We are 
currently training 332 Trade Apprentices, 34 Commercial and 
Technical Trainees and 21 undergraduate paid interns. Over a 
three year period, we have committed to recruit in aggregate 
1, 100 graduates, apprentices and trainees. 
(v) Employee training and development
The Group has a suite of leadership and management 
development programmes aimed at all levels within the 
organisation. The programmes are designed and delivered 
internally and are tailored to the needs of the business.
The Group also offers the Barratt Academy, a staged 
programme to enable employee development from Apprentice 
to site manager as well as within the areas of Technical, 
Commercial and Sales. Succession planning is in place across 
the Group and the leadership programmes assist with the 
development of individuals as part of this process.
(vi) Employee Sharesave Scheme
In April 2014 the Company invited all eligible employees of  
the Group to participate in the sixth grant under the Savings 
Related Share Option Scheme (the ‘2014 Sharesave’) which 
was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual 
general meeting (‘AGM’) held in November 2008. The invitations 
for the 2014 Sharesave were deferred until the current financial 
year to allow eligible employees to take full advantage of the 
changes introduced by HMRC to the maximum monthly 
savings limit. Consequently, the Company allowed eligible 
employees to contribute a maximum of £500 per month in  
one or a combination of Sharesave schemes, compared to the 
£250 per month permitted in previous years. This gave those 
individuals who had participated in previous grants under the 
Sharesave the opportunity to increase their savings and gave 
other employees (new and existing) the chance to participate  
in the 2014 Sharesave and become more involved in the 
Group’s performance. As at 30 June 2014, approximately  
45% of employees participate in one or more of the active 
Sharesave schemes. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of having an on-going 
relationship with its shareholders and other stakeholders. It fully 
supports the principles of the Code and the UK Stewardship 
Code which encourages open dialogue between companies 
and their shareholders. The Group has arrangements in place 
which enable it to communicate effectively with shareholders  
in respect of matters such as business strategy, governance, 
remuneration and any senior management or Board changes. 
All Directors are provided with a rolling three-year schedule of 
proposed meeting dates. Any Director who is unable to attend  
a meeting is invited to provide their views to the Chairman ahead 
of that meeting, having reviewed the agenda, briefing papers 
and management information. Reasons for non-attendance  
are recorded by the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and either he or the Chairman will, thereafter, meet 
with any absent Director to go through any action points which 
are of relevance to that Director. Formal minutes of each Board 
meeting are prepared, circulated and submitted for approval  
at the next meeting.
Employment policy and involvement
(i) Employment and diversity
The Group is committed to seeking to develop the talents of its 
employees so that they can maximise their career potential and 
providing rewarding careers in an atmosphere that engenders 
equal opportunities for all. Selection for employment and promotion 
is based on merit, following an objective assessment of ability and 
experience of candidates, after giving full and fair consideration to 
all applications (including individuals with disabilities). The Group  
is also committed to ensuring that its workplaces are free from 
discrimination. The Group strives to ensure that its policies and 
practices provide equal opportunities in respect of issues such as 
training, career development and promotion for all existing or 
potential staff irrespective of gender , race, ethnic origin, colour , 
religion, physical disability, marital status, sexual orientation or age. 
Every effort is made to retain and support employees who become 
disabled whilst working within the Group. 
(ii) Employee engagement
The Board recognises that appropriate employee engagement 
is a key factor in the long term success of the Group. It utilises  
a comprehensive employee engagement programme with the 
aim of creating a strong, shared culture. All employees are 
invited to take part in an on-line engagement survey each year. 
The results of this survey are fed back to each operating  
division who use the results to formulate plans for maintaining  
or improving engagement in the following year. 
(iii) Employee communications
A key part of effective employee engagement is communication. 
The Company seeks to ensure that all significant events, 
economic factors and financial updates and the impact of  
these on the performance of the Group are communicated to 
employees. This is mainly done through the Group’s intranet, 
email alerts, core briefings and regular newsletters. Additionally, 
the Group Chief Executive regularly briefs senior and middle 
management via conference calls and bulletins which gives 
them the opportunity to ask questions and enter into dialogue. 
Individually and collectively, the Board and the Executive 
Committee members visit operating divisions and sites 
frequently in order to assess operational performance, engage 
with employees on a one-to-one basis and gain first-hand 
experience of employees’ aspirations and concerns.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the report of the Nomination 
Committee. The key areas of focus during the year were:
Board changes
Rod MacEachrane stepped down from his position as a Non-
Executive Director at the 2013 AGM having served nearly eight 
years on the Board. The Nomination Committee reviewed the 
skills set and experience of each of the Non-Executive Directors 
and was satisfied that the composition of the Board remained 
satisfactory and balanced given the diverse range of skills, 
experience and background of the Non-Executive Directors to 
drive the Group’s strategy forward. Accordingly, the Nomination 
Committee concluded that a replacement for Rod was not 
necessary at this point in time. The Nomination Committee  
will continue to monitor the composition of the Board and 
recommend appointments (both Executive and Non-Executive)  
in the future as and when the needs of the business so require.
Chairman succession
The Nomination Committee, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, Mark Rolfe, facilitated the search for a suitable 
candidate to replace me as the Chairman of the Board. As is 
required by the Code, I did not attend any meetings or parts  
of meetings which related to my succession. The Nomination 
Committee engaged the services of the Zygos Partnership 
(‘Zygos’) to assist in this recruitment process and details  
can be found on pages 53 and 54 of this report. 
Performance evaluation
The Nomination Committee undertook an internal review  
of its effectiveness this year, given that an external review  
was undertaken by Independent Board Evaluation last year. 
During the year the Nomination Committee progressed the 
recommendations arising from the previous evaluation and 
details of this and the outcomes of this year’s review can be 
found on page 53. 
The following pages provide further detail on the work 
undertaken by the Nomination Committee throughout the year.

Nomination Committee Report
Letter from the Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee have no business or other relationship with the Group that 
might influence their independence or judgement. Details  
of their interests as shareholders are contained in Table 13  
on page 79 of the Remuneration Report. 
Bob Lawson was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the 
Company with effect from 1 July 2008 and was considered 
to be independent on his appointment. During the year the 
Nomination Committee considered Bob Lawson’s other 
significant commitments, his Non-Executive Chairmanship 
of Genus plc and his directorship of The Federation of 
Groundwork Trusts, and concluded that they do not impinge 
upon his availability to fulfil his duties to the Company. These 
commitments were also considered during the annual review 
of the effectiveness of the Chairman led by the Senior 
Independent Director and the same conclusion was reached.
Appointment and re-appointment  
of Non-Executive Directors 
The Nomination Committee leads the process for appointments 
to the Board and makes recommendations to the Board when 
suitable candidates have been identified. When a vacancy 
arises the Nomination Committee evaluates the balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board. 
It then prepares a description of the roles and capabilities 
required for that appointment. The search for Board candidates 
is carried out, and appointments are made, based on merit 
having regard to the need to maintain a balance of skills and 
experience on the Board, diversity and, where appropriate, 
refreshment of Board memberships. External recruitment 
consultants are used where appropriate.
Board balance
At the end of the financial year, the Board comprised eight 
members, including the Chairman, four Non-Executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee 
regularly reviews the balance of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board as and when necessary. 
Currently, the Board believes that it has the appropriate balance 
of Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors having 
regard to the size and nature of the business. In addition, the 
combination of the experience and calibre of the Non-Executive 
Directors collectively, having regard to their diverse backgrounds 
and experience and their varying lengths of service, further 
enhances this balance thereby mitigating the risk of ‘group think’. 
Board independence
The Company recognises the importance of its Non-Executive 
Directors remaining independent throughout their appointment 
as this enables them to provide objective advice and guidance 
to the Executive Directors through the use of their wide business 
and commercial experience and diverse backgrounds. The 
Non-Executive Directors are also able constructively to challenge 
and scrutinise the performance of the Executive Directors and 
to satisfy themselves with the integrity of the financial information 
considered by the Board and provided to the Company’s 
shareholders. In addition, their independence is of utmost 
importance when considering the appointment or removal 
of Executive Directors and in the determination of succession 
planning for the Board and other key individuals within the 
Group. The Nomination Committee has, during the year, 
reviewed and confirmed to the Board, that it remains satisfied, 
that all of the Non-Executive Directors, including John Allan 
as at the date of his appointment, are independent in that they 
Key responsibilities and activities undertaken during the financial year
The Nomination Committee met on four occasions to fulfill its key responsibilities as set out in its terms of reference, a copy  
of which can be found on the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. The activities undertaken by the Nomination 
Committee during the year are summarised below:
Key responsibilities Activities undertaken during the year
Succession planning • reviewed the succession plans in place for each of the Directors (including the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director) and  
senior management to ensure that they remain satisfactory to meet the needs of the business.
Board balance,  
independence,  
composition and  
effectiveness
• reviewed the structure, size and composition of the Board, having regard to the Board’s balance of skills, experience, independence  
and knowledge, particularly following Rod MacEachrane’s retirement at the 2013 AGM and the announcement of the Chairman’s  
intention to step down at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM; 
• considered and reviewed the other commitments of each of the Directors (excluding the Chairman) and confirmed their continued 
independence; and
• implemented the recommendations arising from the performance evaluation review undertaken by Mrs Ffion Hague of Independent Board 
Evaluation last year and undertook an internal performance evaluation of itself and its members. The overall results were positive, particularly in 
respect of the process followed to recruit a new Chairman, the skills within the Nomination Committee and the resources available to it to fulfil 
its work plan. The key areas of focus were to monitor and refresh succession plans in line with the requirements of the business.
Appointment and  
re-appointment  
of Directors
• appointed Zygos to assist with the recruitment of a new Chairman;
• met with potential candidates put forward as the Chairman’s successor and recommended a short list of candidates to the Board; 
• considered and recommended to the Board the appointment of John Allan as Non-Executive Director and Chairman Designate with 
effect from 1 August 2014 and as Chairman of the Board immediately following the conclusion of the 2014 AGM; and
• reviewed the skills, time commitment and tenure of each of the Non-Executive Directors and recommended the re-appointment of Mark 
Rolfe as Senior Independent Director for a further three-year term.
Conflicts of interest • recommended to the Board the re-authorisation of conflicts of interest of existing Directors. There were no situations notified by  
John Allan as potential conflicts of interest on his appointment. Such recommendations were unanimously endorsed by the Board. 
53 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Biographical details of each of the Directors and supporting 
statements for the election or re-election of the Directors are  
set out on pages 44 and 45 of this report and in the Notice  
of the 2014 AGM. These details illustrate the complementary 
diverse range of skill sets including general business, commerce, 
financial, housebuilding and digital marketing knowledge that 
Board members possess and apply to ensuring effective 
stewardship. Details of the Executive Directors’ service 
contracts can be found in the Remuneration Report on page 71. 
The Board recommends that shareholders approve the resolutions 
to be put forward at the 2014 AGM relating to the election and 
re-election of Directors.
Induction
The Nomination Committee, under the stewardship of the 
Chairman, ensures that on joining the Company, each new 
Director participates in a full and formal induction process. 
John Allan took part in this process which included health 
and safety training, site visits, meetings with all Board members, 
key external advisers and senior and operational management 
teams across the business. John was also provided with an 
induction pack containing general and specific information 
relating to his role such as a schedule of meetings, copies of 
Board minutes and various policies and procedures, details  
of his duties as a director of a listed plc and other obligations 
under the various regulations governing the Company. 
Development
In January of each year the Board meets for a full day to review 
and develop the overall business strategy of the Group which 
includes presentations from senior management within the 
Group as well as external professionals. In January 2014 the 
Board discussed the Group’s growth plans and a number of 
strategic issues including mortgage availability, customer 
demand, innovative methods of off-site construction, attracting 
and retaining high quality employees (in the context of 
enhancing diversity at all levels), planning issues, land supplies 
and Government programmes. The review is increasingly 
focusing on the medium and long term issues impacting the 
demand for the provision of homes.
The Nomination Committee ensures that Directors continue to 
update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Company 
by attending appropriate external seminars and training courses, 
meeting with senior management and visiting regional and 
divisional operating offices and sites collectively and individually. 
During the year under review, the Directors received 
presentations and updates on matters such as key accounting 
issues, narrative reporting, changes to the Code and the new 
reporting requirements on executive remuneration. The 
Chairman reviews training requirements and annually agrees 
development needs with individual Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed, subject to re-election  
by shareholders and statutory provisions relating to the removal 
of directors, by the Board, for an initial three-year term and 
normally serve a second three-year term. Beyond this a third 
term of up to three years may be served subject to particularly 
rigorous review and taking into account the need for progressive 
refreshment of the Board. The Articles, in accordance with the 
Code, require any Non-Executive Director who has served nine 
years or more on the Board continuously to be subject to 
annual re-appointment. 
During the year the Nomination Committee, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, undertook a process to identify a suitable 
candidate to take over as Chairman from Bob Lawson when 
he steps down in November 2014. Four leading firms were 
invited to tender for the appointment and advise the Committee. 
Zygos, an independent recruitment firm, was duly appointed 
and prepared a long list (including candidates of both genders). 
The Nomination Committee then proceeded to arrive at a 
shortlist and after interviews unanimously concluded that John 
Allan was the most appropriate candidate.
The letters of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s registered 
office during normal office hours and will also be available at the 
2014 AGM for 15 minutes before and throughout the meeting. 
The letters of appointment clearly set out the time commitment 
expected from each Non-Executive Director to ensure they 
satisfactorily perform their duties. Each Non-Executive Director 
confirms that they are able to allocate the time commitment 
required at the time of their appointment and thereafter as  
part of their individual annual effectiveness review undertaken 
by the Chairman.
Retirement and re-election of Directors
The Articles currently require Directors to submit themselves for 
re-election by shareholders at the first AGM following their initial 
appointment to the Board and thereafter at intervals of no more 
than three years. All Board members will, in accordance with 
the Code, stand for election or re-election (as applicable) by 
the shareholders at the 2014 AGM (with the exception of Bob 
Lawson (see above)) irrespective of their date of appointment 
and length of service on the Board. Each of the Directors has 
been subject to a formal performance evaluation process and 
the Nomination Committee, and the Board, are satisfied that 
they each continue to be effective in, and demonstrate 
commitment to, their respective roles. 
54 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report continued
Nomination Committee Report continued Directors’ conflicts of interest
On 1 October 2008, the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) codified 
the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, by which Directors have 
a duty to avoid a situation in which they have, or may have, a 
direct or indirect conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest 
with the Company. This duty applies to the exploitation of any 
property, information or opportunity regardless of whether the 
Company could have taken advantage of it. The Articles were 
amended at the AGM held on 18 November 2008 to include 
a general power for the Board to authorise such conflicts. 
The Board has, in accordance with the Articles and best practice 
guidance, authorised the Nomination Committee to oversee 
the process for reviewing and making recommendations to 
the Board concerning any actual or potential conflicts of interest 
which arise or may arise in relation to each member of the 
Board, including details of any terms and conditions which it 
deems necessary to impose on any authorisation given. This 
process was carried out satisfactorily during the year. 
The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary maintains 
a register of Directors’ conflicts of interest which is reviewed 
annually. Following this review he will make recommendations 
to the Board in respect of any changes to the authorisations, 
or terms and conditions applied, that may be required. Each 
Director is responsible for notifying, and is aware of their 
responsibility to notify, the Chairman and/or the Board of 
any new conflicts or possible conflicts and of any change in 
circumstances relating to authorisations already given. The 
Board, when authorising any conflict or possible conflict of 
interest, does not count in the quorum the Director whose 
conflict or possible conflict is being discussed and reserves 
the right to exclude a Director from a meeting whilst a conflict 
or possible conflict is being considered. The Board may revoke 
or vary any authorisation at any time.
Board gender diversity policy
The Nomination Committee continues to review the 
recommendations on gender diversity contained within 
Lord Davies’ report, ‘Women on Boards’, as part of its annual 
effectiveness exercise. The Nomination Committee’s primary 
goal remains to identify the most appropriate candidates to join 
the Board and other senior positions within the Group. However, 
in accordance with its terms of reference it also seeks to ensure 
that in considering succession planning it has due regard to 
the benefits of diversity for the Board (and for the Group as 
a whole), including gender. Accordingly, the Board will continue 
to work with recruitment search consultants but, moving 
forward, will only use those that have adopted a voluntary code 
of conduct addressing gender diversity. The Board has agreed 
not to impose a quota regarding gender balance, although the 
Nomination Committee and the Board recognise the need to 
ensure that the business reflects a diverse workforce, at all 
levels of seniority, when considering Board appointments and 
internal promotions, whilst always seeking to ensure that each 
post is offered strictly on merit to the best available candidate.  
A copy of this policy can be found on the Company’s website  
www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
As at 30 June 2014, the aggregate representation of women on 
the Board was 25% (two out of eight directors and one-third of 
the Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman)). Diversity 
within the Group’s workforce is considered within the Strategic 
Report on page 32.

Chairman of the Audit Committee
9 September 2014
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2014. The Audit Committee is 
responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s 
financial reporting and its systems of internal control and  
risk management.
During the financial year the Audit Committee has focused  
upon four key areas. First, it considered the Group’s key risks 
and risk management systems and controls, including how 
policies on internal controls and risk management are cascaded 
throughout the business and the risk of cyber threat to the 
Group. Secondly, it reviewed and challenged the accounting 
judgements being used in the preparation of the Group’s 
Financial Statements, especially those in relation to going 
concern, the land and work in progress valuation, the valuation 
of available for sale financial assets and the goodwill and 
intangible assets impairment review. Thirdly, it assessed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit Function and the 
External Auditor, including their independence, objectivity and 
tenure based upon a review of their respective engagements 
during the financial year. Finally, it considered the Group’s 
Annual Report and Accounts and concluded that they are fair, 
balanced and understandable, following the completion of a 
detailed review.
In order to provide the Audit Committee with an appropriate 
mix of skills and experience, including financial expertise, all 
Non-Executive Directors now sit on the Audit Committee and 
membership throughout the financial year is shown in Table 4.  
I can confirm that, in accordance with Code provision C.3. 1, 
each of the members is considered to be independent and 
the Board is satisfied that I have recent and relevant 
financial experience.

Audit Committee Report
Letter from the Chairman of the  
Audit Committee Key responsibilities and activities undertaken during the financial year
The Audit Committee follows an annual work programme, which covers the principal responsibilities as set under its terms of 
reference (available from the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk). The Audit Committee undertook, amongst 
other matters, the following key activities in respect of the financial year:
Key responsibilities Activities undertaken during the year
Going concern • assessed the Group’s available facilities, headroom and banking covenants;
• reviewed management’s detailed analysis, which included forecasts and scenarios considering potential downturns  
in the housing market; and 
• satisfied itself, and subsequently the Board, that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate  
in the context of the Group’s funding and liquidity position.
Further details upon the Group’s going concern assessment can be found on pages 91 and 102.
Integrity of  
financial reporting
• reviewed the integrity of the Financial Statements of the Group and the Company and all formal announcements relating 
to the Group’s and Company’s financial performance. This process included the review and debate over the following 
areas of significance and took into account the views of Deloitte LLP:
i) Land and WIP valuation
The Audit Committee reviewed the judgements made in respect of land and WIP valuation. This review involved detailed 
consideration of the assumptions made upon specific sites and in the context of the current UK housing market. Detail 
upon the judgements in this area are explained within the Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty on page 111.
The Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by management and concluded that the valuation of our land 
and WIP remains appropriate.
ii) Available for sale financial assets
The Audit Committee reviewed the judgements made in respect of the valuation of our available for sale financial  
assets. This review involved detailed consideration of the assumptions made including the estimation of the market 
value of properties at the forecast redemption date and the determination of a suitable discount rate. Detail upon  
the judgements in this area are explained within the Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation 
Uncertainty on page 111 and in note 17 on page 125.
The Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by management and concluded that the valuation of our 
available for sale financial assets remains appropriate.
iii) Annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
The Audit Committee considered the judgements made in relation to the valuation methodology adopted by 
management and the model inputs used. Detail upon the judgements in this area are explained within the Critical 
Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty on page 112.
The Audit Committee also reviewed and approved sensitivities used by management which were consistent with the 
2012/13 financial year and ‘a reasonably possible’ change to model inputs including related disclosure, as required by 
IAS 36. The Audit Committee agreed with the judgements made by management and concluded that no impairment  
of goodwill or intangible assets was required.
iv) Fair, balanced and understandable
The Audit Committee reflected upon the feedback provided by shareholders in respect of our 2012/13 Annual Report 
and Accounts (including the Remuneration Report), the interim management statement and the half year results and  
the regular updates the Board received throughout the year, and received an early draft of the 2014 Annual Report  
and Accounts to allow itself sufficient time to review the disclosures therein. The Audit Committee also received a report 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary which confirmed that: (i) the Annual Report and Accounts 
had been reviewed by the Group Executive Directors; and (ii) the Company had received confirmation from its external 
advisers and separately its auditor, Deloitte LLP , that the Annual Report and Accounts adhered to the requirements of 
the Code and relevant rules and regulations. The Audit Committee then assessed, at its September meeting, whether 
the Annual Report and Accounts were fair, balanced and understandable, reviewed the processes underpinning the 
compilation and assurance of the Annual Report and Accounts, in relation to the financial and non-financial 
management information and reviewed the internal processes underpinning the Group’s reporting governance 
framework, the use of content owners and external legal and auditor review. The Board’s formal statement on  
the Annual Report and Accounts is contained within the Directors’ Responsibility Statement on page 92.

The effectiveness of 
internal controls and the 
risk management process
In accordance with principle C.2.1. of the Code the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system  
of internal controls, covering all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management systems. A risk framework has been developed for all business processes by the internal audit function  
and approved by the Audit Committee. This framework forms the basis of the internal control audit plan for the year 
ahead, which tests if controls are being applied effectively in each operating division. Material issues identified during 
internal audits and follow-up action plans are reviewed by the Executive Directors and by the Board on a quarterly  
basis, and necessary actions are immediately taken to remedy any failings in the internal control system.
The Group’s system of internal controls is designed to manage risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s 
business objectives rather than to eliminate those risks entirely. The system of internal controls therefore provides only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal controls does, 
however, provide reasonable assurance that potential issues can be identified promptly and appropriate remedial  
action taken. 
The Group operates internal controls to ensure that the Group’s Financial Statements are reconciled to the underlying 
financial ledgers. A review of the consolidated accounts and Financial Statements is completed by management to 
ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are appropriately reflected. 
The Audit Committee plays a vital role in managing the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management 
process on behalf of the Board and accordingly, during the year it:
• reviewed the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls in relation to material financial risks and reviewed  
a number of process improvements during the year, on behalf of the Board, and confirmed that the risk management 
and internal control systems had been in place throughout the year ended 30 June 2014 and that they and their 
effectiveness accord with Turnbull guidance;
• provided regular reports to the Board in respect of its findings on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management process, in order to assist the Board to conclude and confirm that, in accordance with principle C.2 of  
the Code, it has maintained sound risk management and internal control systems throughout the year under review, 
which seek to safeguard shareholders’ investments as well as the Group’s assets. In addition, the reports allowed the 
Board to determine the nature and extent of the significant risks that it is appropriate for the Group to take to achieve  
its strategic objectives and to be assured that Executive Directors and senior management continue to implement 
and maintain the Group’s internal control and risk management systems within the governance and policy framework 
approved by the Board;
• spent time with management below Board level to understand risks and controls in a number of areas of the business 
including: cascading of internal control and risk management policies within the business; onsite IT systems; risk of 
cyber threat to the business; supply chain risks; and the enhancement of financial control following the increase in 
volume of homes built;
• reviewed in detail the output of the bi-annual controls self-certification process from each of the divisions;
• considered all whistleblowing and fraud reports and actions;
• reviewed all internal audit results and action plans;
• received regular reports from the Risk Committee in respect of the work it had undertaken to review the effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control policies and procedures for the identification, assessment and reporting of risks and for 
assessing individual key risks on a rolling basis. During the year the Risk Committee reviewed and updated its terms  
of reference in order to enhance their alignment with the responsibilities of the Audit Committee in respect of internal 
controls and risk management; 
• reviewed the risk framework to determine if the system of internal control remains effective and reported their findings  
to the Board when considering the draft interim and full year Financial Statements; and
• assisted the Executive Committee to prioritise the risk framework by identifying the risks considered most significant  
to the Group. Consequently, for each of the risks so identified, an assessment has been made of the probability and 
potential impact on the business and these risks are reported on internally and reviewed during internal audits and 
control self-assessments.

The effectiveness of 
internal controls and the 
risk management process
continued
The structure deployed by the Group when assessing risks is set out in Managing Risk on pages 36 and 37  
of the Strategic Report. The key aspects of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management framework  
are as follows:
i) a clear organisational structure with defined levels of authority and responsibility for each operating division;
ii)  financial and management reporting systems under which financial and operating performance is consistently 
reviewed against budget and forecasts at divisional, regional and Group level on a monthly basis;
iii)  identification and review of principal operational risk areas to ensure they are embedded in the Group’s monthly 
management reporting system, so that risk identification and the control of risk are a routine aspect of management 
responsibility. Details of the management of risk system utilised and the principal risks and uncertainties and their 
relevance to the operations and financial performance of the Group are set out in Managing Risk on pages 36 to 41 
of the Strategic Report. Amongst other matters, the risks reviewed by management, the Audit Committee and the 
Board include: 
 – economic environment, including housing demand and mortgage availability;
 – land purchasing;
 – liquidity;
 – attracting and retaining high-calibre employees;
 – availability of raw materials, subcontractors and suppliers;
 – Government regulation and planning policy;
 – construction and new technologies;
 – joint ventures and consortia;
 – safety, health and environmental; and
 – IT; and 
iv)  assessment of compliance with internal control and risk management systems. This assessment is supported  
by the Group’s internal audit team which is responsible for undertaking an annual audit plan, ad hoc audits and 
reporting to the Audit Committee, and, if necessary, the Board, on the operation and effectiveness of those  
systems and any material failings with them. The planned programme of audit appraisals across Group operations  
is approved by the Audit Committee. It includes full divisional audits and targeted audits of key risk areas such as  
the land viability process, land acquisition control and monitoring, WIP and subcontractor payment controls. Where 
the internal audit team does not have the expertise or resources required to conduct complex audits they deploy 
external expertise. 
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of 
changes in borrowing and debt profiles, market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant 
of these to the Group is liquidity risk. Accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of 
cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate 
mitigating actions taken. These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that 
adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk 
management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular 
by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest and currency rates. The Group does not 
use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Such activities are delegated, by the Board, to a centralised 
Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements 
guidelines that are established by the Board, in accordance with approved treasury policies, and the Treasury  
Operating Committee. 
The Audit Committee is pleased with the progress made to date, and recognises that work will need to be  
continued in these areas during the next financial year. The Board has not identified nor been advised of any  
failings or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. Therefore, a confirmation of necessary actions  
has not been considered appropriate. 
59 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Key responsibilities Activities undertaken during the year
Review of  
accounting policies
• considered the impact of the adoption of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ 
and the choice of accounting framework for the Company’s subsidiaries following the decision to replace UK Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’) which will apply from 1 July 2015.
External auditor • considered the following areas in respect of the external auditor:
i) Re-appointment of auditor
The Audit Committee took into account the following factors when considering the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP  
as the auditor to the Company and whether or not to tender the external audit in respect of the 2014/15 financial year: 
 – feedback on the effectiveness of the external audit from divisional, regional and Group Management who were closely 
involved in both the interim and year end reporting process;
 – the Code’s requirement to put the external audit out to tender every ten years, Deloitte LLP was appointed as the 
auditor of the Company through an external tender process in 2007; 
 – the appointment of Mark Goodey as the lead audit partner during the last financial year. Mark Goodey will continue  
to act in this capacity until the conclusion of the 2017 audit subject to satisfactory performance. FRC guidance and 
the Code suggest that the tendering should normally align with the five-yearly cycle of partner rotation; 
 – Deloitte LLP’s objectivity and independence; 
 – Deloitte LLP’s performance against the audit plan for the 2013/14 financial year; and 
 – the quality of advice and assistance brought to bear and received throughout the year. 
 
The Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte LLP’s performance as auditor to the Company continues to be 
satisfactory and that it was not necessary to consider a tender process this year. The Audit Committee will assess  
its tendering arrangements towards the conclusion of Mark Goodey’s period in office, or earlier if it has reason to  
do so. Accordingly, it recommended to the Board that a resolution re-appointing Deloitte LLP as the auditor to  
the Company be proposed at the 2014 AGM. That recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the Board.  
There are no contractual obligations which restrict the Audit Committee’s choice of external auditor.
ii) Auditor objectivity, audit effectiveness and independence
The Audit Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit and concluded that the audit process as  
a whole had been conducted robustly and that the team selected to undertake the audit had done so thoroughly  
and professionally. In coming to this conclusion the Audit Committee reviewed amongst other matters:
 – Deloitte LLP’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and the absence of any variations from it;
 – reports highlighting the material issues and accounting judgements that arose during the conduct of the audit;
 – feedback from Group and Regional management finance functions and the Chief Internal Auditor evaluating the 
performance of the audit; and
 – the report from the FRC’s Audit Quality Review Team.
iii) Auditor independence and non-audit fees policy
The Audit Committee formally reviewed the policy which the Company has implemented on Auditor Independence  
and Non-Audit Fees (the ‘Policy’) during the year. The Policy sets out the duties of the Audit Committee and the limited 
range of services which the auditor may provide without requiring prior approval of the Audit Committee. Any services 
outside this scope must be approved by the Audit Committee in order to maintain auditor independence and to monitor 
non-audit fees incurred by the Group. The Policy also sets out a number of services which the external auditor is 
excluded from providing to the Group. These include:
 – bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or Financial Statements;
 – financial information systems design and implementation relating to the Financial Statements or accounting records;
 – appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contributions-in-kind;
 – actuarial services;
 – internal audit outsourcing services;
 – management functions or human resources;
 – broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services;
 – legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and
 – executive recruiting.

Directors’ Report continued
Audit Committee Report continued Key responsibilities Activities undertaken during the year
External auditor
continued
Under the Policy the Company is required to, and does, obtain written confirmation from Deloitte LLP that they remain 
independent on an annual basis. Deloitte LLP have also provided a comprehensive report to the Audit Committee 
verifying that they have performed their audit and audit-related services in line with independence requirements and 
assessing why Deloitte LLP believe they remain independent within the requirements of the applicable regulations and 
their own professional standards, which were conclusions that the Audit Committee endorsed. 
In reaching these conclusions the Audit Committee reviewed, amongst other matters, the:
 – report from Deloitte LLP describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest; 
 – extent of the non-audit services provided by Deloitte LLP; and
 – the ratio of audit to non-audit fees more generally.
iv) Non-audit services
The Audit Committee, while being satisfied that the ratio of audit to non-audit fees for the 2013/14 financial year was 
within the guidelines contained within the Policy, considered this area carefully given that the non-audit fees excluding 
audit-related assurance services were almost equal to the audit fees including the audit-related assurance services 
incurred by the Group for the same period. Details of the audit (including audit-related) and non-audit fees incurred by 
the Group can be found on page 116. 
The Audit Committee discussed the level of non-audit fees in detail with the Group Finance Director to gain an 
understanding of their nature and the rationale for engaging Deloitte LLP . The Audit Committee noted that the majority 
of the non-audit fees related to audit-related assurance services which principally comprise the review of the Group’s 
interim report, taxation compliance (for which Deloitte LLP were appointed on 1 December 2010 following a competitive 
tender process in which four of the leading audit firms took part), and also taxation advice on various land acquisitions 
and disposals during the year. Accordingly, the Audit Committee was satisfied that the work performed by Deloitte LLP 
was appropriate in the context of ensuring their independence as auditor, particularly given that the audit-related 
assurance services, relating to the review of the Group’s interim report, can only be conducted by the Group’s auditor 
and that the tax advisory services had been managed by a partner who has no involvement with the audit of the Group. 
Consequently, the Audit Committee concluded that the level of non-audit fees was justified and did not raise any 
concerns in terms of Deloitte LLP’s independence as auditor to the Group. Deloitte LLP have also confirmed, in writing, 
that they are in agreement with this conclusion.
The Audit Committee confirms that there are no independence issues in respect of the auditor and that the Policy has 
been appropriately complied with throughout the year under review. 
Internal Audit Function • received reports from the Chief Internal Auditor on the findings of internal audits conducted throughout the business; and 
• reviewed the systems and processes adopted by the internal audit function to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. 
Audit Committee  
effectiveness
• implemented the recommendations arising from the previous year’s performance evaluation; and 
• evaluated its own performance and that of its members through an internal process led by the Chairman of  
the Committee. The outcome of the review was positive particularly in respect of each member having a clear 
understanding of what is expected of them to undertake and discharge their responsibilities. The areas of focus 
identified were to continue monitoring the level of relevant financial experience within the Audit Committee; to  
continue to seek to streamline the Audit Committee’s briefing papers further; and to ensure that there was  
adequate time allocated to each item for discussion at the meeting.
Whistleblowing • received updates from the Chief Internal Auditor on new whistleblowing incidents, on-going investigations and the 
outcome of any completed investigations;
• assessed the adequacy of the Group’s whistleblowing policy in accordance with the requirements of the Code; and
• reviewed the procedure adopted by the Group to ensure it remains appropriate and adequately allows individuals  
who become aware of possible improper, unethical or even illegal behaviour to raise the matter with their manager  
or alternatively refer the matter to a confidential and independent telephone number (the ‘Whistleblowing Number’). 
The Whistleblowing Number is available to all employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week and any issues reported  
to the Whistleblowing Number are immediately brought to the attention of the Chief Internal Auditor. The Chief Internal 
Auditor reviews and investigates the issue, and at his sole discretion can seek guidance from appropriate individuals 
within the Group, such as the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, as and when he deems necessary.

2013/14 Remuneration Outcomes
Based on the Group’s performance, the Committee approved 
the following remuneration for the Executive Directors in respect 
of the 2013/14 financial year:
Annual bonus
In July 2013 when the Committee was setting the objectives  
for the annual bonus, budgeted profit before tax was around 
£297m. Accordingly, the Committee established a target level  
of £300m, with a minimum profit before tax threshold for the 
bonus at £285m and a maximum threshold of £345m. For the 
financial year ended 30 June 2014, the Group achieved profit 
before tax of £390.6m (2013: £192.0m before exceptional 
items), an increase of 103.4% from the previous year. In addition, 
the Group moved from a net debt of £25.9m to a cash surplus 
of £73. 1m, return on capital employed for the Group was at 
19.5% and the Group achieved 4.7 years’ supply of owned and 
controlled land. Taking these factors into consideration, together 
with the individual contributions of all senior managers within the 
Group in achieving strong results across all operating metrics, 
the Committee concluded that maximum bonus awards for 
Executive Directors (after taking into account adjustments for 
the value of land) as set out on page 76 was justified. Bonus 
earned in excess of 100% of base salary will be deferred into 
shares for a period of three years and will be subject to a 
continued employment condition.
Long Term Performance Plan
The performance period for the award made on 20 October 
201 1 (the ‘201 1/12 LTPP’) ended on 30 June 2014. Both of the 
total shareholder return and earnings per share performance 
conditions applicable to this award were tested after the 2013/14 
financial year end. The total shareholder return of the Group  
was in the top quartile compared to the performance of the 
comparator group comprising the constituents of the FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) and the Group achieved adjusted 
basic earnings per share of 31.2 pence per share. Accordingly, 
100% of the total shareholder return element and 91.62% of the 
earnings per share element vests on 20 October 2014. The 
participants of the 201 1/12 LTPP will therefore receive 95.81%  
of the award granted to them in October 201 1. The relevant 
number of shares (net of any tax and national insurance liabilities) 
will be issued to each of the participants in October 2014.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration  
Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2014 on behalf  
of the Remuneration Committee. As we did last year and  
in accordance with the requirements of the Large and  
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and  
Reports) (Amendments) Regulations 2013, which became 
mandatory for us this financial year, we have divided this 
Remuneration Report into the following parts:
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy on pages 64 to 7 4 sets out 
the Company’s proposed policy on Directors’ remuneration. 
This policy will be presented to shareholders for a binding vote 
at this year’s AGM. If approved, the Policy will be effective from 
12 November 2014 for a period of three years provided no 
changes are required during this period; and
• The Annual Report on Remuneration is set out on pages  
75 to 86 and details the Directors’ remuneration outcomes; 
how such remuneration is linked to the performance of  
the Group and how the Policy will apply in respect of the 
2014/15 financial year. It also sets out Governance matters 
such as the Committee membership and the business the 
Committee undertook. The Annual Report on Remuneration 
will be presented to shareholders for an advisory vote at the 
2014 AGM.
Our strategy and performance
The Committee aims to ensure that Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration is clearly linked to the Group’s strategy of 
delivering sustainable shareholder value and Executive  
Directors are appropriately rewarded for performance  
against the Group’s key financial objectives.

Directors’ Report continued
Remuneration Report
Annual Statement from the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee Shareholding requirements
With effect from 1 July 2014, the Committee amended the 
shareholding requirements applicable to Executive Directors 
and senior managers. Under the revised requirements the 
Group Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Directors  
must hold shares in the Company equivalent to 200% and 
150% of base salary respectively. In addition, the Committee 
has introduced a shareholding requirement of 100% of base 
salary for senior managers. The requisite level of shareholding 
must be attained within five years of appointment or, in the  
case of current employees, within five years of the revised 
requirements coming into effect.
Changes to the Board 
Rod MacEachrane stepped down as a Non-Executive Director,  
and consequently as a Committee member, at the last AGM 
and currently there is no intention to replace him (see page 52 of 
the Nomination Committee Report). As announced on 1 1 March 
2014, Bob Lawson will be stepping down from his position as 
Chairman of the Board at the conclusion of the 2014 AGM. He 
will be replaced by John Allan, who joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman Designate on 1 August 
2014. John will receive a fee of £48,000 per annum (pro-rata) for 
the period 1 August 2014 to 12 November 2014, which is in line 
with the fee paid to the other Non-Executive Directors. On his 
appointment as Chairman of the Board, John’s fee will increase 
to £300,000 per annum. The Board approved this fee following 
a benchmarking exercise undertaken by New Bridge Street 
against other companies with a similar market capitalisation to 
the Company.
Conclusion
Throughout the year the Committee complied with those 
aspects of the UK Corporate Governance Code relevant to  
its business and took into account the remuneration guidelines 
and guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers,  
the National Association of Pension Funds and Pensions 
Investment Research Consultants when setting the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration policy. The Committee continues to 
demonstrate its accountability on executive remuneration to 
shareholders through this report and through regular dialogue. 
As in previous years, the Committee engaged with key 
institutional investors and shareholder representative bodies  
in respect of the policy for Executive Directors and senior 
managers for the forthcoming year and took into account the 
feedback received from this process when setting this policy.
I would like to thank all shareholders for their support of our 
remuneration policy to date and hope that you will continue  
to support the Remuneration Report at this year’s AGM by 
voting in favour of both the Directors’ Remuneration Policy  
and the Annual Report on Remuneration.

2014/15 Remuneration
Taking into account the improved business environment,  
the Company’s evolving strategy and feedback received  
from shareholders on the Company’s remuneration policy,  
the Committee undertook a detailed review of the remuneration 
for Executive Directors and senior managers. As a result of this 
review, the Committee has approved a number of changes to 
Executive Remuneration for the financial year ending 30 June 
2015, which increase the emphasis on sustaining and improving 
performance of the business with particular focus on return on 
capital employed. The changes are summarised below:
Base salary/fees 
Increases in base salary for the 2014/15 financial year have been 
limited to 3% for Executive Directors and senior management in 
line with the increase awarded to all employees across the Group. 
There is no change to the fees of the current Chairman or the 
Non-Executive Directors. See pages 84 and 86 for further details.
2014/15 Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential has been maintained at 150%  
of base salary for any bonus earned in respect of the 2014/15 
financial year. Any bonus in excess of 100% will be deferred  
into shares in the Company for a period of three years and 
subject to a continued employment condition. The Committee 
has however revised the performance measures and their 
weightings by reducing the weighting against profit before tax, 
increasing the weighting against employee engagement and 
introducing Health and Safety and Customer Service as new 
performance measures, as opposed to penalties for non-
performance. Full details of the performance measures to be 
used and their respective weightings are set out on page 84. 
2014/15 LTPP Award
Consistent with the approach taken last year, the Committee 
intends to make awards to Executive Directors and senior 
management under the LTPP during the 2014/15 financial year 
(the ‘2014/15 LTPP’). The level of the award to be granted will 
continue to be no more than 200% for the Executive Directors. 
Following consultation with major shareholders in May 2014,  
the Committee has introduced return on capital employed as  
an additional performance condition to this award, such that  
the award will be subject to three performance targets: total 
shareholder return, absolute earnings per share and return on 
capital employed, with each representing one-third of the award. 
To further enhance the alignment of the interests of Executive 
Directors and senior management with those of shareholders, 
the Committee has also, in respect of the 2014/15 LTPP and 
future awards, introduced a two year ‘holding period’ before 
shares which vest under the 2014/15 LTPP and future long term 
performance plan awards can be sold, other than to settle any 
tax and national insurance due. Further details on the 2014/15 
LTPP can be found on page 85.

The following table sets out a summary of the Company’s remuneration for the Directors. A description of how the Company intends 
to implement the Policy set out in this table for the 2014/15 financial year can be found on pages 84 to 86.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the ‘Policy’), as set on pages 64 to 7 4 will, subject to shareholder approval, apply for a period  
of three years from 12 November 2014 and is available to view at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk. The Committee will continue to 
review the Policy on an annual basis in the context of the business environment, regulation, best practice and market trends for the 
current and subsequent financial years. It will also ensure that the fixed and variable remuneration elements are simple, transparent 
and continue to be aligned with the interests of shareholders and designed to reflect the views of our investor shareholder bodies 
and other stakeholders. Should any changes be required to the Policy within the three years, the Policy will be re-presented to 
shareholders for approval.

policy from the previous year
2
  Annual bonus To motivate and reward 
Executive Directors and  
Senior Management for the 
achievement of demanding 
financial objectives and key 
strategic measures over the 
financial year.
The performance targets set  
are stretching whilst having 
regard to the nature and risk 
profile of the Company and  
the interests of its shareholders.  
The focus of the performance 
targets is to deliver profit growth 
and to ensure we have an 
adequate land bank acquired 
within the constraints of our 
balance sheet commitments.
Variable remuneration allows 
the Group to manage its cost 
base by giving it the flexibility to 
react to changes in the market 
and any unforeseen events.
The Committee sets the performance targets on an annual basis at the start of the relevant 
financial year. Group and individual performance against these targets is measured at the end  
of the financial year and the level of bonus payable is calculated at that point.
Bonuses up to 100% of base salary are paid in cash. Any bonus earned in excess of this (up to  
a maximum of 50% of base salary) is compulsorily deferred into shares for a period of three years, 
subject to a continued employment condition. Deferred shares may be forfeitable if an individual 
leaves prior to the release date. Deferred shares do not accrue dividends.
Clawback may apply to both the cash and deferred element of the bonus, in the event of material 
misconduct and/or material misstatement or error of financial results. For full details see page 73.
When setting bonus targets, the Committee considers the effect of corporate performance  
on environmental, social and governance risks and sustainability issues generally to ensure  
that remuneration structures do not inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour.
Annual bonus is not pensionable.
150% of base salary.
50% of the potential maximum bonus  
(75% of salary) is payable for achievement  
of on-target performance.
Performance measures have been divided  
into three categories:
• Financial items (e.g. profit before tax); 
• Balance sheet items (e.g. net debt/land creditors; or land 
commitment);
• Non-financial items (e.g. health & safety, customer  
service, employee engagement and personal objectives).
 
The Committee has the discretion to vary the elements  
of each of these items and weightings of each component  
on an annual basis to ensure that they remain aligned to  
the strategy of the business and market conditions.
Financial items will however have majority weighting.
No Executive Director has any contractual right to receive  
a bonus. The Committee has an absolute discretion whether  
or not to award a bonus and as to the level of bonus to be 
awarded up to a maximum of 150% of base salary. The level  
of bonus to be awarded will be determined with reference  
to the performance of the Company against the relevant 
performance conditions and the underlying financial and 
operational performance of the business relative to the  
sector (as noted above). Where the Committee believes that 
performance does not warrant the level of bonus determined,  
it may use its discretion to reduce the award (possibly to nil)  
as it deems appropriate.
• Weighting against the financial items 
has been reduced;
• Replacing health & safety and 
customer service penalties with 
health & safety and customer service 
performance targets; and 
• Removal of the Committee’s 
discretion against the personal 
objectives measure so that 
performance is measured  
entirely against the achievement  
of defined objectives.
  Long Term 
Performance 
Plan (‘LTPP’)
To motivate and reward 
Executive Directors and Senior 
Management for the delivery of 
the long term performance of 
the Group.
To facilitate share ownership  
by Executive Directors and 
Senior Management. 
The Committee ensures that 
targets, whilst stretching, are: 
realistic and attainable; for the 
long term benefit of the Group; 
and do not encourage 
inappropriate business risks.
The rules of the LTPP were approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM.
LTPP awards:
i. are structured as nil-cost options and granted annually so that no undue emphasis is placed  
on performance in any one particular financial year;
ii. are at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the 
overall performance of the Group;
iii. vest on the third anniversary subject to achievement of stretching performance conditions 
measured over three financial years and to continued employment;
iv. are satisfied by either newly issued shares or shares purchased in the market. Newly issued 
shares are subject to the dilution limits set out in the scheme rules and in accordance with 
guidelines from the Association of British Insurers (‘ABI’); and 
v. do not accrue dividends.
The Committee has the discretion to impose such post-vesting holding periods as it deems fit. For 
the 2014/15 LTPP and all future LTPP awards, the Committee has introduced a two-year holding 
period for shares commencing from the end of the relevant performance period (net of any shares 
required to satisfy tax and national insurance liabilities), resulting in an aggregate five-year lifespan for 
each award.
LTPP awards made prior to the Policy coming into effect were granted on the same terms as stated 
in the Policy and were subject to total shareholder returns (‘TSR’) and earnings per share (‘EPS’) 
performance conditions. Details of these performance conditions can be found on pages 62 and 81.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct and/or material misstatement or error  
of financial results. For full details see page 73.
In accordance with the rules of the LTPP the 
Committee has the discretion to grant an award 
equal to 200% of base salary to each of the 
Executive Directors.
Subject to three performance conditions, TSR, absolute  
EPS and return on capital employed (‘ROCE’). The TSR 
performance condition is monitored on the Committee’s 
behalf by New Bridge Street (‘NBS’) whilst EPS and ROCE 
performance is verified by the Committee. The TSR, EPS  
and ROCE performance conditions were selected by the 
Committee on the basis that they reward outperformance 
against returns generated by our listed company peers  
and to ensure efficient and effective management of our 
business whilst aligning interests with those of shareholders. 
The Committee has the discretion to determine the weighting 
of each element on the grant of an LTPP award.
25% of an award will vest at threshold performance  
(0% vests below this level) increasing pro-rata to 100% 
vesting for maximum performance. 
Overall, the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying 
financial performance of the Group over the performance 
period warrants the level of vesting as determined by 
applying the above targets. If the Committee is not of this 
view, then it is empowered to reduce the level of vesting.
• Introduction of a two-year holding 
period; and
• ROCE included as an additional 
performance measure.
  D e fe r r e d  
Bonus Plan 
(‘DBP’)
Any annual bonus which is 
deferred into shares is held  
in this plan.
The aim is to encourage  
long term focus and to further 
align interests with those of 
shareholders and discourage 
excessive risk taking.
The Committee utilises the rules of the Group’s Co-Investment Plan (the ‘CIP’) for the purposes  
of the DBP . Under these rules the Committee has a discretion which allows it to award matching 
shares (the ‘Matching Award’) should it deem appropriate to do so.
DBP awards made prior to the Policy coming into effect were granted on the same terms as stated 
in the Policy and were subject to a continued employment condition. Further details of these awards 
can be found on pages 76 and 78.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct and/or material misstatement or error  
of financial results. For full details see page 73.
Any bonus paid in excess of 100% of salary  
is deferred into shares and held in the CIP .
Participants also have the opportunity to voluntarily 
defer additional amounts of annual bonus up to a 
maximum of 25% of base salary into the CIP . 
Should the Committee decide to make Matching 
Awards, these may be made at a rate of one for  
one for compulsory deferral and at a maximum  
of four for one for voluntary deferral.
Any shares awarded remain subject to a continued 
employment condition over a three-year period and  
‘good’ and ‘bad’ leaver provisions. 
Any Matching Awards, if granted, will be subject to 
performance conditions and levels of vesting similar to  
those attached to any LTPP award to be made during  
the year and will be measured over a period of three years.

Non-Executive Directors 
(including the Chairman).
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is set by the Board on the recommendation  
of a Committee of Executive Directors having regard to the time commitment and responsibilities 
associated with the role. The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Committee, again having regard to the time commitment and

Company and its subsidiaries.
No awards can be granted under the ESOS in the same financial year as an award is granted under 
the LTPP . 
The Committee retains the discretion to make future awards under the ESOS should market 
conditions dictate that it is more appropriate to grant under the ESOS than the LTPP .
Subject to the relevant performance targets being met, options are normally exercisable up to the 
10th anniversary of grant or during such shorter period as may be specified at the time of grant.
The last award, made under the ESOS in December 2009, vested in December 2012. Executive 
Directors have until 19 December 2019 to exercise their vested option, after which time it will lapse.
Clawback may apply in the event of material misconduct and/or material misstatement or error  
of financial results. For full details see page 73.

Performance scenario charts – fixed and variable pay
The Group’s policy seeks to ensure that a substantial 
proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is performance 
related and that enhanced rewards are only paid for exceptional 
performance. The chart below shows how the composition of 
each of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages varies 
at different levels of performance achievement for the 2014/15 
financial year. 
Chart 1: Executive Directors’ potential remuneration
Assumptions:
1.   Be n e fi ts – the value receivable in the 2014/15 financial year  
is taken to be the value received in the 2013/14 financial year 
as disclosed in the Single figure of remuneration table on 
page 75;
2.  B o nu s – the on-target level of bonus is taken to be 50%  
of the maximum bonus opportunity. No share price 
appreciation has been assumed for the deferred share 
amount payable at maximum bonus; and
3.  LT P P A w a r d – the on-target vesting level is taken to  
be 50% and the maximum value is taken to be 100%  
of the face value of the award at grant. No share price 
appreciation has been assumed.
Remuneration strategy
The Group’s current Remuneration Policy aims to:
• promote the long term success of the Company and 
attract, retain, motivate and competitively reward Executive 
Directors and Senior Management with the experience, 
skills and ability to support the achievement of the Group’s 
key strategic objectives in any financial year; 
• be fully aligned with the performance and strategic 
objectives of the Group applicable for any financial year; 
• reflect the interests and expectations of shareholders  
and other stakeholders;
• take account of pay and employment conditions  
of employees across the Group; 
• reward the sustained growth and profitability of the 
business, the maintenance of an appropriate capital 
structure and improve the return on capital employed  
by the business; 
• ensure that exceptional performance against challenging 
targets is adequately rewarded;
• ensure Executive Directors and Senior Management 
maintain a long term focus by deferring any bonus earned 
in excess of 100% of base salary into shares for a 
minimum of three years and also by requiring Executive 
Directors and Senior Management to maintain a 
significant shareholding in the Company;
• conform to market-leading best practice and regulations;
• encourage management to adopt a level of risk which is in 
line with the risk profile of the business and as approved 
by the Board; and
• ensure that there is no reward for failure; that termination 
payments are limited to those (if any) that the Executive 
Director is contractually entitled to; and in exercising its 
discretion, the Committee robustly applies the ‘good’ and 
‘bad’ leaver provisions as defined in the rules of each of 
the share schemes operated by the Group.

Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are  
included in Table 6 and their emoluments are shown in Table 8 
on page 75. The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors’ 
(including new appointments) service contracts to be for a rolling 
12 month period which can be terminated by 12 months’ notice 
given by either the Company or by the Executive Director at any 
time. The service contracts entitle Executive Directors to the 
provision of a company car, annual medical screening, private 
medical insurance, some telephone costs and contributions to 
the cost of obtaining independent tax advice. The Committee 
regularly reviews contractual terms for Executive Directors to 
ensure that they continue to reflect best practice.
All Executive Directors’ appointments and subsequent  
re-appointments are subject to election and annual re-election 
by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting.

Executive Directors’ service contracts are available for 
inspection by any person at the Company’s registered  
office during normal office hours. 
Executive Directors’ policy on payment on loss of office
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early 
termination (except for payment in lieu of holidays accrued but 
untaken) or loss of office due to a change of ownership of the 
Company. The Committee reserves the right to make additional 
payments where such payments are made in good faith: (a) in 
discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages 
for breach of such an obligation); or (b) by way of settlement  
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the 
termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.  
The Committee will apply mitigation against any contractual 
obligations as it deems fair and reasonable and will seek legal 
advice on the Company’s liability to pay compensation. The 
Committee also seeks to reduce the level of any compensation 
payable and takes into account, amongst other factors,  
the individual’s and the Group’s performance; the Director’s 
obligation to mitigate their own loss; and the Director’s length of 
service when calculating termination payments. The Committee 
reserves the right to phase any such payments if it deems that  
it is appropriate to do so. Any amount that the Committee 
decides to pay an Executive Director will be based on the  
main elements of Executive Remuneration namely, base salary, 
annual bonus (subject to the Committee’s discretion), benefits 
and pension. The Committee also takes into account the rules 
of the annual bonus and LTPP Schemes when determining any 
payments for loss of office as follows:
Recruitment of Executive Directors 
The Committee will determine the remuneration for any new 
Executive Directors in accordance with the Policy as set out  
in the Future Policy Table on pages 64 to 69 and will take into 
consideration each of the following elements:
Salary and benefits – the Committee will take into account 
market data for the scope of the job and remuneration for the 
relevant role, the salaries of and benefits provided to existing 
Executive Directors, the new Executive Director’s experience, 
location and current base salary and benefits package. In the 
event an Executive Director is recruited at below market levels, 
their base salary may be re-aligned over a period of time (e.g. 
two to three years) subject to their performance in the role. The 
Committee may also agree to cover relocation costs if it deems 
it appropriate.
Pension – Executive Directors will be auto-enrolled from the 
date of recruitment unless they opt-out. If an Executive Director 
chooses to opt–out they may elect to receive a pension 
supplement in cash. The Committee has discretion to 
determine the level of pension supplement to be awarded to  
the Executive Director, up to a maximum of 30% of base salary, 
having regard to the pension supplement given to existing 
Executive Directors. Alternatively, the Executive Director may 
choose to join the defined contribution money purchase 
pension plan provided they meet all of the eligibility criteria.  
The Executive Director also has the option to receive some  
of their pension entitlement in cash and have the remainder 
contributed to the defined contribution money purchase 
pension plan, provided this does not, in aggregate, exceed  
30% of base salary.
LTPP – new Executive Directors may be able to participate  
in the LTPP on terms to be considered by the Committee on  
a case by case basis. Any award made to the new Executive 
Director will usually be on the same terms as set out in the 
Future Policy Table on page 66. The level of the award will be  
no greater than that made to existing Executive Directors and 
will be pro-rated based on the number of weeks remaining 
outstanding of the relevant performance period. 
The Committee may also consider buying out incentive awards 
which an individual would forfeit upon leaving their current 
employer, again this would be reviewed on a case by case 
basis. The Committee would however in all cases seek 
validation of the value of any potential incentive that is being 
forfeited and take into account the proportion of the 
performance period remaining of the award, the type of award 
(i.e. cash/shares) and the performance achieved (or likely to be 
achieved). Replacement share awards, if any, will be capped at 
the amount forfeited and will be subject to the performance 
conditions applicable under the terms of the Company’s 
Executive Director share scheme in operation at the time.
Where an individual is recruited internally to the position of 
Executive Director, the Company will honour any pre-existing 
contractual commitments.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Non-Executive directorships 
Subject to Board approval, Executive Directors are permitted  
to accept one non-executive directorship outside the Company 
and retain any fees received from such a position. Executive 
Directors are not allowed to take on the Chairmanship of any 
FTSE 100 company. Board approval will not be given for any 
non-executive position where such appointment would lead  
to a material conflict of interest or would have an effect on the 
Director’s ability to perform their duties to the Company.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ letters  
of appointment
The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They 
do not have service contracts and their appointments can be 
terminated (by the Board) without compensation for loss of 
office and by giving the appropriate length of notice as 
prescribed in their respective letters of appointment.
The notice period applicable, from either party, for the Chairman 
is three months and for each of the other Non-Executive Directors 
is one month. Under governance policies approved by the 
Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year 
term and usually serve a second three-year term subject to 
performance review and re-election by shareholders. Beyond 
this a further term of up to three years may be served subject  
to rigorous review by the Chairman and the Nomination 
Committee and re-election by shareholders. Details of  
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment can be  
found in Table 7 .

2 John Allan joined the Board on 1 August 2014 as a Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
Designate. He will succeed Bob Lawson as Chairman of the Board with effect from the 
conclusion of the 2014 AGM.
The letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection by any person at the Company’s 
registered office during normal office hours.
Annual bonus – in terms of the annual bonus, in accordance 
with the provisions contained within the service contracts, 
Executive Directors are not usually entitled to any bonus 
payment (other than in circumstances where they are deemed 
by the Committee as a ‘good leaver’, which includes but is not 
limited to redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability or any 
other circumstance which the Committee may decide), unless 
they remain employed and are not under notice as at the 
payment date. Any bonus payment for a ‘good leaver’ will be 
based on the individual performance of the Executive Director 
concerned as well as the Company’s performance during the 
relevant period. Such payment will be pro-rated depending  
on the proportion of the bonus period worked by the  
relevant individual.
Deferred bonus – for any bonus deferred into shares, if the 
Executive Director is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’ (as defined 
above), he will be entitled to retain the shares subject to settling 
any tax and national insurance liability that may become due  
on release of the shares. In all other cases, the shares will  
lapse immediately on the date that the Executive Director’s 
employment with the Company ends and there is no 
entitlement to any compensation for the loss of the shares.
In the event any Matching Awards have been granted to the 
Executive Director, these will lapse immediately unless the 
individual is leaving for a ‘permitted reason’ (this includes, but  
is not limited to, redundancy, retirement, ill-health or disability).  
If the Executive Director is leaving for a permitted reason, the 
unvested award will become vested and the number of shares 
subject to the award will be pro-rated based on the number of 
weeks of the performance period that have been completed 
and the level of the performance conditions that have been  
met up to that date. 
LTPP – under the rules of the LTPP , unless the Executive 
Director is deemed by the Committee to be a ‘good leaver’  
(as defined above) any LTPP awards held by him will lapse on 
cessation of his employment. If he is a ‘good leaver’, the number 
of shares subject to the award will be pro-rated based on the 
number of weeks of the relevant performance period completed 
by him. No shares will however, be released to the Executive 
Director, until the normal vesting date, being three years from 
the date of grant. During this time the shares will continue to be 
subject to the relevant performance conditions until the end of 
the performance period, at which point the Committee will test  
the performance conditions and determine how much, if any,  
of the remaining shares will vest.
Change of control – the rules of each share scheme operated 
by the Company contain provisions relating to a change of 
control. In the event that a change of control does occur any 
unvested options/awards will become vested on the date of the 
relevant event. However, the number of options/awards that 
vest will be pro-rated depending on the number of weeks 
completed within the relevant performance period and the level 
of performance conditions achieved during that period. Options/
awards which have already vested as at the date of the relevant 
event may still be exercised within the prescribed timescales set 
out in the rules.
72 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report continued
Remuneration Report: Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued Statement of consideration of pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere across the Group
The level for all employees’ salaries is determined with reference 
to the rate of inflation, salaries for similar positions throughout 
the industry and general themes and trends in respect of 
remunerating employees.
When reviewing the pay and employment conditions of 
Executive Directors and Senior Management, including increase 
in base salary, the Committee takes into consideration the pay 
and employment conditions of all employees across the Group. 
The Company does not directly consult with employees when 
setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, however the 
Company does have forums through which employees  
can ask questions on such matters should they so wish.
Differences between Executive Directors’ and 
Employees’ remuneration
The following differences exist between the Company’s policy 
for the remuneration of Executive Directors as set out in the 
Future Policy Table on pages 64 to 69 and its approach to the 
payment of employees generally:
• a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity may 
apply to employees other than the Executive Directors and 
certain senior executives. All employees, including Executive 
Directors and Senior Management, are subject to the same 
performance targets, however the weightings against the 
various targets may vary;
• Executive Directors and Senior Management are required  
to defer any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary 
into shares for a period of three years;
• Executive Directors’ may opt to receive a cash supplement  
in lieu of being auto-enrolled or contributing to the defined 
contribution section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life 
Assurance Scheme. In addition, the maximum rate of 
employer’s contribution varies between 5% – 30% for other 
employees across the Group and 30% for Executive 
Directors; and
• only Executive Directors and Senior Management are able  
to participate in the LTPP . A number of select employees 
operating below Senior Management may be invited to 
participate in the Senior Managers’ Incentive Scheme,  
which is subject to long term performance conditions.
In general, these differences arise from the development  
of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive  
for the various categories of individuals. They also reflect  
the fact that, in the case of Executive Directors and Senior 
Management, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on 
performance-related pay.
Gifts to Directors on leaving employment
The Committee reserves the discretion to approve gifts to long 
serving Directors who are retiring or who are ‘good leavers’  
e.g. those leaving office for any reason other than dismissal  
or misconduct. The value of the gift for any one Director shall  
be limited to a maximum of £5,000 and where a tax liability  
is incurred on such a gift the Committee has the discretion to 
approve the payment of such liability on behalf of the Director  
in addition to this maximum limit.
Legacy arrangements
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving the Policy, authority  
is given to the Company to honour any previously disclosed 
commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
including, but not limited to, payment of pensions or the vesting/
exercise of past share awards.
Clawback 
Both the annual bonus (including any deferred bonus and any 
matching element) and the LTPP are subject to the Company’s 
power of clawback (the ‘Clawback’) for a period of two years 
following vesting. The Clawback is applicable in respect of any 
annual bonus paid/deferred and to any share awards granted 
under the LTPP or the ESOS in respect of the financial year 
ended 30 June 2010 and later years, subject in the case of 
HMRC approved options, to such approval. In addition, the 
Clawback will also apply to any awards granted under any 
senior manager share schemes.
The Clawback can be invoked if: 
(a) it is necessary to restate the Group’s accounts used to 
calculate a participant’s entitlement to bonus or share awards 
in circumstances where the original over-statement has led to 
a bonus being paid/deferred or share awards being granted 
which would not otherwise have been paid or granted; or 
(b) the participant is found guilty of any criminal activity in 
connection with his or her employment and this related  
to an act which led to a bonus being paid/deferred or  
share awards being granted to him or her. 
In such circumstances, the Committee may determine that the 
bonus and/or share award will be retrospectively recalculated.  
If bonus monies have been paid, the participant will be required 
to reimburse the Company for an amount up to the total amount 
of the net bonus paid, less any bonus that the Committee 
determines would have been paid regardless of the event  
in question. If share awards have been granted, the number  
of awards or options granted will be reduced accordingly.  
If the award has vested and shares have been issued to the 
participant, the participant will be required to repay the value  
of the relevant number of shares based on the Company’s 
closing share price as at the date the shares were issued.

4 Performance conditions tested after 30 June 2014 and 95.81% of the award is due to vest in October 2014. Market price of shares has been calculated based on an average market value over  
the three months to 30 June 2014 (£3.6916 per share).
5 Re-calculated using share price of £3.3856 per share being the market value of the shares on the vesting date 24 October 2013 as opposed to the market price of £3.0812 per share calculated 
based on an average market value over the three months to 30 June 2013 as disclosed in last year’s remuneration report. 
6 The Sharesave option granted in March 2010 was subject to a continued employment condition and matured on 1 June 2013. The value is calculated using a share price of £3.198 per share being 
the market value of the share on the date of maturity.

 Annual bonus
For the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to earn an annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary, 140%  
is based on the attainment of Group performance targets and 10% on personal objectives, both of which are linked directly  
to the Group’s strategy. Any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. 
All targets, Group and personal, were agreed at the beginning of the financial year. The Group performance targets which applied  
to the bonus for the 2013/14 financial year and the resulting outturn were as follows:

for the first five dealing days following the date on which the Group announces its annual results for the 2013/14 financial year. The actual number of shares awarded in respect of the 2013/14 deferred 
bonus was not therefore available as at the date of this report and will be disclosed in next year’s report.
2 Shares are held in the CIP for a period of three years commencing from the date of the award and subject to a continued employment condition.
3 The Executive Directors earned a total bonus of 150% of base salary for both of the 2013/14 and 2012/13 financial years. Accordingly, any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary is deferred into shares.

Vesting of 2011/12 LTPP (included in 2013/14 Single Figure) (Audited)
The 201 1/12 LTPP award granted on 20 October 201 1 was based on performance to the year ended 30 June 2014 and will vest  
on 20 October 2014. The performance condition for this award and the resulting vesting level is as follows:

1 Following the Company’s refinancing during the last financial year, the Committee informed each participant of the 2011/12 and 2012/13 LTPPs that it would be adjusting the vesting levels, at the end 
of each of the respective plan periods (30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 respectively) to ensure that participants do not benefit from the expected positive impact upon EPS arising from the refinancing 
for the relevant parts of those plan periods. Accordingly, the EPS threshold and stretch targets were increased by 2p each from 12.5p and 30p respectively.
2  The actual earnings per share of 31.2p has been rebased using the corporation tax rate applicable at the date on which the 2011/12 LTPP targets were set, as the subsequent reduction to the rate of 
corporation tax was not performance related. The actual earnings per share has also been rebased using the same number of shares in issue as used in the 2011/12 LTPP targets. The rebased 
earnings per share used for the purpose of determining vesting, which is directly comparable to the 2011/12 LTPP targets, was 30.0p.

Directors’ Report continued
Remuneration Report: Annual Report on Remuneration continued The Committee considered the underlying financial performance of the Group and was satisfied that the above level of vesting of 
the 201 1/12 LTPP was justified given the continued improvement in the Group’s financial results as illustrated on pages 12 to 17 of 
this Annual Report and Accounts. Accordingly, the award details for each of the Executive Directors are as follows:

The 2013/14 LTPP is subject to two performance conditions, TSR (50%) and EPS (50%). The levels of vesting against TSR, 
measured over a three-year period commencing 1 July 2013, and against EPS for the financial year ending 30 June 2016,  
are as follows:
• the TSR element will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the top quartile relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index  
(excluding investment trusts). 25% will vest at median performance and there will be no vesting for performance below  
median; and
• the EPS element will vest in full if EPS for the 2015/16 financial year is 40 pence per share or higher. This element will reduce  
to 25% for EPS of 30 pence per share. There will be no vesting if EPS is less than 30 pence per share. Vesting will be on  
a straight-line basis for EPS between 30 pence and 40 pence per share. 
Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited)
For the financial year ended 30 June 2014 Executive Directors were required to hold shares in the Company equivalent in  
value to 100% of base salary and must retain all of the net of tax value of any vested LTPP shares until this guideline is met.  
As at 30 June 2014, all of the Executive Directors had met the shareholding requirement (see Table 13 on page 79).
The interests of the Directors serving during the financial year and their connected persons in the ordinary share capital of  
the Company at the beginning and end of the year are shown in Table 13 on page 79. No notification has been received of any 
change in the interests below during the period 30 June 2014 to 9 September 2014 inclusive, with the exception of the shares  
to be deferred in respect of the bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary by Executive Directors for the financial year  
ended 30 June 2014 as described on page 76.

1 The earliest date on which an award may vest, in normal circumstances, having fulfilled all qualifying conditions, after which ordinary shares are transferred automatically to the participants as soon  
as possible.
2 The ESOS is divided into two sub-schemes, one of which is approved under the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and the other of which is not. The exercise price is calculated differently 
for each sub-scheme in accordance with the rules of the ESOS. Executive Directors have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their options under the ESOS.
3 73.9% of this award vested on 14 October 2013. The relevant number of shares was released to each participant thereafter following the settlement of any tax and national insurance liabilities due  
on the shares.
4  This award was tested after 30 June 2014 and 95.81% of the award will vest in October 2014 (see page 76 of this Annual Report on Remuneration for further details).
5  Award based on an allocation of ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 200% of base salary. Half of the award is subject to a three-year TSR performance condition (100% vesting  
for upper quartile, 25% for median and no vesting below median) and the other half is based on the achievement of an EPS target for the financial year ending 30 June 2015 (100% vesting at 26p  
or higher; 50% at 22p; 25% at 18p and no vesting for below 18p). There is no re-testing of performance conditions.
6  All unexercised options granted under the ESOP lapsed on 9 October 2013, being the end of the ten year lifespan of the option.

Remuneration Report: Annual Report on Remuneration continued All conditional awards and share options are subject to an overriding Committee discretion, in that the Committee must be satisfied 
that the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as determined by 
applying the relevant targets. If the Committee is not of this view, it has the authority to reduce the level of vesting as it deems appropriate.

On maturity or vesting of any of its share incentive schemes the Company satisfies the awards through: a new issue of shares; 
market purchases; or the Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’). As at 30 June 2014, the Company proposes to satisfy all outstanding 
Executive options and awards under the LTPP , 2009/10 ESOS, the DBP and the Sharesave through a new issue of shares, subject 
to the dilution limits described below. Only awards made to individuals below Senior Management level will be satisfied through 
shares currently held, or to be purchased in the market, by the EBT. 
The Company regularly monitors the number of shares issued under its schemes and the impact on dilution limits. The Company  
is satisfied that as at 30 June 2014 its usage of shares is compliant with the relevant dilution limits set by the ABI in respect of all 
share plans (10% of the Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period) and discretionary share plans (5% of the 
Company’s issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period). In the event that the outstanding options under each of the schemes 
to be satisfied through a new issue of shares were to vest and had been exercised on 30 June 2014, the resulting issue of new 
shares would represent 3.25% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date. 
 Executive Directors’ pension arrangements 
The Company’s pension policy for Executive Directors is that on joining the Group they will be auto-enrolled unless they choose  
to opt-out. Upon opting-out, the Executive Director may choose to receive a cash supplement (which does not count for incentive 
purposes) and/or participate in the Company’s defined contribution money purchase pension plan. Each of the Executive Directors 
has opted to receive a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of pension. Only the base salary element of a Director’s 
remuneration is pensionable.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Defined benefit section
Steven Boyes was a deferred member of the defined benefit section of the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme  
(the ‘Scheme’) during the year ended 30 June 2014.
The Scheme was closed to new entrants in 2001 and on 30 June 2009, the Company exercised its consent under the rules of the 
Scheme and agreed to cease offering future accrual of defined benefits for current members. Members of the Scheme became 
eligible to join the defined contribution money purchase section of the Scheme with effect from 1 July 2009.
Up until 30 June 2009, Steven Boyes was an active member of the defined benefit section of the Scheme. This entitlement was 
based on a 1/60 accrual rate and a normal retirement age of 65. Since 1 July 2009 Steven Boyes has been entitled to receive a 
cash supplement equal to 30% of his base salary per annum.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2013 showed a deficit of £34.8m calculated on the basis of the 
Scheme’s technical provisions. The Company and the Trustees of the Scheme have agreed a plan to address the shortfall which 
requires the Company to continue to make deficit reduction payments of £13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015, followed  
by payments of £9.5m per annum from 1 December 2015 until 31 December 2016. The Company will discuss the funding 
requirements of the Scheme with the Trustees if any material change in the Group’s financial circumstances is anticipated.  
The valuation for the Financial Statements was updated to 30 June 2014 by a qualified independent actuary and a surplus  
of £3. 1m (2013: deficit of £13.4m) is included in the Group Balance Sheet as shown in note 28 of the Financial Statements. 
Members of the Scheme are also eligible for an insured lump sum of up to five times pensionable salary on death in service. 
Current employees who were members of the defined benefit section of the Scheme at closure also retain their dependants’ 
pension entitlements. 
No excess retirement benefits have been paid to or are receivable by current and/or past directors in respect of their qualifying 
services during the financial year and there are no arrangements in place that guarantee pensions with limited or no abatement  
on severance or early retirement.
Payments to Directors leaving the Group (Audited)
The Board presented Rod MacEachrane with £2,000 worth of gift vouchers as a retirement gift to reflect the significant contribution 
he made to the Board during his eight years’ of service. As these vouchers are deemed to be a benefit, they are subject to tax, 
which the Company settled on Rod’s behalf.
Payments for loss of office (Audited)
No payments were made in respect of loss of office during the year ended 30 June 2014 (30 June 2013: £nil).

In accordance with Code provision D.2.1, each of the Non-
Executive Directors on the Committee (including John Allan)  
is considered to be independent with no financial interest in the 
Committee’s decisions, other than as shareholders and the 
fees paid to them. Details of their shareholdings and fees can

Advice/Advisers 
The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external 
independent remuneration consultants and is solely responsible 
for their appointment, retention and termination. During the year 
the Committee has taken advice from independent advisers, 
NBS, a part of Aon plc. NBS was appointed by the Committee 
as its remuneration consultant in 2008 and is a founder signatory 
to the Remuneration Consultants Group’s Code of Conduct.  
In addition to advising the Committee, NBS also provided the 
Company with advice on implementing decisions made by the 
Committee and remuneration benchmarking. NBS’s fees for 
providing such advice amounted to £26,716 (2013: £16,358)  
for the year ended 30 June 2014. In line with best practice,  
the Committee assesses, from time to time, whether the 
appointment remains appropriate or if it should be put out to 
tender as part of its effectiveness review. NBS’s appointment 
was reconfirmed by the Committee in June 2014 after an annual 
review of the quality of the advice received and fees charged. 
The Committee is comfortable that the NBS engagement 
partner and team, which provide remuneration advice to the 
Committee, do not have connections with the Company that 
may impair their independence or objectivity. The Committee 
reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that 
there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Aon plc also provided broking services to the Company in 
respect of private medical insurance, Death in Service benefits 
and Group Income Protection.
Mercer Limited has been appointed actuary to the Barratt Group 
Pension and Life Assurance Scheme since 2004 and act

Governance
The Committee 
The main role of the Committee is to design and implement a 
remuneration framework which is aligned to the interests of the 
shareholders and allows the Group to recruit and retain Executive 
Directors and Senior Management who are fully focused and 
motivated to achieve and deliver the Group’s key business 
strategies. The Committee operates within terms of reference (the 
‘Terms of Reference’) and governance policies approved annually 
by the Board and in accordance with the Code. The full Terms  
of Reference, which are reviewed annually, are available from  
the Company’s website at www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Principal responsibilities 
The principal responsibilities of the Committee undertaken  
in each annual cycle (where appropriate) are:
• determining and reviewing the overall remuneration policy of 
the Group with regard to attracting, retaining and motivating 
Directors and Senior Managers of the experience and calibre 
required by the Group having regard to remuneration paid to 
employees across the Group and an external comparable 
group of companies; 
• determining, reviewing and making recommendations to the 
Board on the remuneration package and terms of appointment 
of the Chairman; 
• agreeing measures and targets in respect of performance 
related pay schemes, including long term performance 
plans, for all participating employees which are, sufficiently 
challenging and motivating, commensurate with sector 
practice, and consistent with maximising shareholder value 
and the interests and expectations of shareholders; 
• agreeing severance arrangements or other compensation  
for loss of office or early retirement for the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and Senior Management; 
• determining the total remuneration package of the Group 
Chief Executive and, after consultation with him, the total 
individual remuneration package of each Executive Director 
and for each member of the Senior Management team 
including bonuses, incentive payments, share options/
awards and pension arrangements; 
• understanding and keeping up to date, with the assistance  
of its external advisers, on market best practice on 
remuneration; and
• undertaking consultations with institutional shareholders on 
remuneration policy and/or other aspects of senior remuneration, 
as appropriate and ensuring that the Policy is aligned with 
regulatory requirements. 
The Committee is also responsible for appointing consultants  
to advise on Executive Remuneration. Details of the consultants 
utilised during the financial year ended 30 June 2014 are set out 
in the section titled ‘Advice/Advisers’. 
Membership 
Membership of the Committee and attendance at each  
of its meetings during the year is set out in Table 17 . John  
Allan became a member of the Committee on 1 August 2014, 
when he joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director and 
Chairman Designate.

on such matters. Slaughter and May, the Company’s corporate 
legal advisers, have also provided advice as and when necessary.
In addition to advice from external consultants, the Committee 
received input into its decision-making from the Group Chief 
Executive, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary 
and the Group Human Resources Director, none of whom  
were present at any time when their own remuneration was 
being considered.
Effectiveness
Following an external performance evaluation by Independent 
Board Evaluation last year, it was agreed that the performance 
of the Committee would be evaluated internally, led by the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. The outcome 
was positive. In line with the revisions proposed to the existing 
remuneration policy, a key focus would continue to be ensuring 
that the remuneration structure (and the aggregate value of the 
fixed and variable elements) remains appropriate within the 
market and in the context of the Company’s evolving strategy. 
The Committee also reviewed its Terms of Reference as part of 
the annual effectiveness process and concluded that they follow 
best practice and are fit for purpose.

Non-Executive Directorships
During the year, Mark Clare was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director of United Utilities Group PLC on an annual fee of £59,850. 
Subsequently, in July 2014, he became the Senior Independent 
Director of United Utilities Group PLC for which he receives an 
additional fee of £10,000 per annum (increased to £12,500 per 
annum from 1 September 2014). He will retain both of these fees 
in full. Mark Clare is also a trustee of the BRE Trust and UK GBC 
Limited, a member of the Government’s Construction Leadership 
Council and he also sits on the CBI Construction Council. Mark 
Clare does not receive any fees for these positions. The time 
commitment (excluding travelling and pre-reading time) expected, 
in aggregate, for these positions is approximately 100 hours per 
annum. Neither David Thomas nor Steven Boyes held any 
non-executive directorships with other companies during the year.
Meetings
The Committee met on five occasions during the financial year 
and attendance at each of these meetings is described in  
Table 17 on page 82 of this report.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Statement of implementation of the Policy for the 2014/15 financial year 
Executive remuneration package for the 2014/15 financial year
In line with its remuneration strategy described on page 70, the Committee has based the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
package for the forthcoming year on the following principles: 
• performance-related remuneration should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets; 
• performance-related remuneration should reflect the responsibilities of the Executive Directors; currently approximately 72%  
of the Group Chief Executive’s and the other Executive Directors’ remuneration potential is performance based (see Chart 1  
on page 70); 
• performance-related remuneration should align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders by setting 
performance targets based on measures of shareholder return. Accordingly, the Committee’s policy is to use a combination  
of TSR, EPS and ROCE performance conditions to achieve this alignment; 
• total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector; and 
• total remuneration should take into account levels of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group. 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration for the 2014/15 financial year
 Base Salary
With the assistance of NBS, the Committee undertook a benchmarking exercise of Executive Director salaries and concluded that 
it would award all of them a salary increase of 3% for the 2014/15 financial year in line with the increase awarded to all employees 
across the Group. Following this increase, Executive Directors’ salaries remain appropriately within the range for the housebuilding 
sector and the wider population of the comparators from the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts). Executive Director salaries, 
with effect from 1 July 2014, are therefore as follows:
Table 18 – Executive Directors’ salary increases

expressed as a percentage of salary for the 2014/15 financial year will be:

* Any bonus earned in aggregate in excess of 100% will continue to be deferred into shares and held in the CIP . The Committee has agreed that no matching shares will be awarded against any 
deferred shares in respect of the 2014/15 financial year.
84 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report continued
Remuneration Report: Annual Report on Remuneration continued The individual targets for each performance measure are commercially sensitive and therefore not disclosed in this year’s report. 
We will however provide full disclosure on the targets and performance against them in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
The annual bonus performance measures have been reviewed against last year’s and the following changes have been made  
to align them with the Company’s strategy: 
• the weighting against profit before tax has been reduced to give it a more appropriate focus relative to other measures;
• the health & safety and customer service penalties have been revised into pro-active bonus components in order to increase 
Executive Directors’ and Senior Managements’ focus in these areas and to ensure that they continue to improve in line with  
the growth of the business; and
• the Committee’s discretion over 50% of the Executive Directors’ personal objectives element has been removed so that the  
full 10% will be based on the achievement of objectives. This provides clarity to Executive Directors and Senior Management  
in terms of what needs to be delivered in order to earn this element.
The Committee will continue to have an overriding discretion in respect of any bonus payment as set out in the Future Policy Table 
on page 66. In addition, any bonus awarded for the 2014/15 financial year will be subject to Clawback (see page 73).
 LTPP
The level of the LTPP award to be granted to Executive Directors and Senior Management during the 2014/15 financial year will  
be in line with that described on page 66. The Committee is cognisant that such an award should be subject to performance 
targets which are stretching and challenging whilst aligned with the short and long term performance of the Group and total 
shareholder return. Accordingly, the Committee has agreed that the extent to which the LTPP award to be granted in 2014/15  
(the ‘2014/15 LTPP’) will vest, will be dependent on three independent performance conditions as follows:

EPS and ROCE performance targets
Having assessed the improved financial performance of the Group since 2007 , and balanced the reduced weighting that EPS 
performance will have under the 2014/15 LTPP with the increased commercial sensitivity of the EPS target to the Group’s future 
strategy, the Committee has concluded that it is no longer appropriate to publish the EPS target prospectively. Additionally, given 
the link between the EPS and ROCE calculations, the Committee has also agreed not to publish the specific ROCE targets for the 
2014/15 LTPP . The Company will however, provide an update on EPS and ROCE performance against targets on an annual basis. 
The specific target range for the 2014/15 LTPP will remain designed to incentivise significant performance improvement across the 
business, deliver a strong return to shareholders and represent a stretching target for Executive Directors and Senior Management. 
When setting the target range for the 2014/15 LTPP , the Committee has also taken into account the Board’s assessment of optimal 
scale of business, the Group’s target of a ROCE of at least 25% for FY17 and current market consensus relating to PBT. 
Each of the above performance conditions will remain subject to an overriding Committee discretion as set out in the Future Policy 
Table on page 67 . Clawback will also apply to the 2014/15 LTPP .
In addition to the inclusion of ROCE as a performance condition, the Committee has introduced a two-year holding period  
for any shares (net of any shares sold to satisfy tax and national insurance liabilities) which vest under the 2014/15 LTPP  
(and future awards).

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
Other statutory information In respect of the transaction between the son of Mark Clare  
and Alie Street LLP (another joint venture partnership between 
BDW and L&Q) which was disclosed in last year’s report, legal 
completion occurred on 20 February 2014 and any outstanding 
balances on that date were paid in full. Accordingly, there are  
no outstanding balances in respect of this transaction as at  
30 June 2014.
Fulham Wharf LLP and Alie Street LLP are not controlled by  
and are not subsidiary undertakings of the Company.
On notification by Mark Clare of the above transactions, the 
Board sought advice from its legal advisers and corporate 
brokers in respect of the application of Chapter 1 1 and section 
190 of the Act (Substantial Property Transactions) (‘Section  
190’) to the transactions. The advice received concluded  
that Chapter 1 1 and Section 190 did not extend to LLPs and 
therefore the provisions of Chapter 1 1 and Section 190 did  
not apply to either of these transactions. Consequently, no 
shareholder approval was required for the transactions.
Disclosure of information to auditor 
So far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information (that is, information needed by the Company’s 
auditor in connection with preparing its report) of which the 
Company’s auditor is not aware.
Each of the Directors has taken all reasonable steps that they 
ought to have taken in accordance with their duty as a Director to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
ensure that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Act.
Political donations and expenditure
No political donations or expenditure were made or incurred 
during the year (2013: £nil). 
Offices
The Group had 27 offices (excluding those offices undertaking 
an administrative function only) located throughout Britain at the 
end of the financial year. No branches are located outside of  
the United Kingdom. A full list of the Group’s offices and their 
locations can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary at the registered office of the Company or 
from the Company’s website www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk.
Capital structure
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided 
into ordinary shares of 10 pence each. All issued shares are in 
registered form and are fully paid. Details of the Company’s 
issued share capital and of the movements in the share capital 
during the year can be found in note 29 to the Financial 
Statements on page 146.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Act and any directions given by 
special resolution, the business of the Company is ultimately 
managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers of the 
Company, whether relating to the management of the business 
of the Company or otherwise. In particular, the Board may 
exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, property, 
assets and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other 
securities and to give security for any debt, liability or obligation 
of the Company to any third party.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
As at the date of this Annual Report and Accounts, there are 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions governed by the Act 
in place under which the Company has agreed to indemnify the 
Directors, former Directors and the Company Secretary of the 
Company, together with those who have held or hold these 
positions as officers of other Group companies or of associate 
or affiliated companies and members of the Executive Committee, 
to the extent permitted by law and the Articles, against all liability 
arising in respect of any act or omission in the course of 
performing their duties. In addition, the Company maintains 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for each Director  
of the Group and its associated companies. 
No Director of the Company or of any associated company  
shall be accountable to the Company or the members for any 
benefit provided pursuant to the Articles and receipt of any such 
benefit shall not disqualify any person from being or becoming  
a Director of the Company.
Related party transactions
The Board and certain members of senior management are 
related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related 
Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) and the Board are related parties 
within the definition of Chapter 1 1 of the UK Listing Rules 
(‘Chapter 1 1’). There is no difference between transactions 
with key personnel of the Company and transactions with 
key personnel of the Group.
During the year, the Company entered into the following 
transaction which, for the purposes of IAS 24 is considered 
to be a ‘related party transaction’: 
In August 2014, Mark Clare, Group Chief Executive, reserved an 
apartment (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf 
LLP , a joint venture partnership between BDW Trading Limited 
(‘BDW’) (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London 
and Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a purchase price of 
£1,692,350.  This purchase was conducted at a fair and 
reasonable market price based on four independent market 
valuations and similar comparable transactions at that time. An 
amount of £2,500 was paid on reservation. As at 9 September 
2014, contracts had not been exchanged between the parties. 
A deposit will be payable on exchange of contracts and the 
remaining balance will become payable on legal completion, in 
accordance with the Group’s normal terms of trading.

Directors’ Report continued
Other statutory information continued Transfer of shares
Shares in the Company may be in uncertificated or certificated 
form. Title to uncertificated shares may be transferred by means 
of a relevant system and certificated shares may be transferred 
by an instrument of transfer as approved by the Board. The 
transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder until  
the transferee’s name is entered into the Company’s register  
of members.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares except as 
follows. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without 
giving any reason, decline to register any transfer of any share 
which is not a fully paid share. Registration of a transfer of an 
uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set 
out in the uncertificated securities rules (as defined in the 
Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders,  
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share  
is to be transferred exceeds four. 
The Board may decline to register a transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is duly stamped or 
certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to 
be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant 
share certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer 
as the Board may reasonably require; (ii) is in respect of only one 
class of share; (iii) if joint transferees, is in favour of not more 
than four such transferees; or (iv) where the transfer is requested 
by a person with a 0.25% interest (as defined in the Articles) if 
such a person has been served with a restriction notice after 
failure to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided under the Act, 
unless the transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant to an 
arm’s length sale (as defined in the Articles).
Shareholder authority for purchase of own shares 
At the Company’s AGM held on 13 November 2013, 
shareholders gave authority to the Company to buy back up to 
an aggregate of 97 ,993,080 ordinary shares (representing 10% 
of the Company’s issued share capital). This authority is valid 
until the end of the 2014 AGM or, if earlier, until the close of 
business on 12 February 2015. Under the authority there is 
a minimum and maximum price to be paid for such shares.  
Any shares which are bought back may be held as treasury 
shares or, if not so held, will be cancelled immediately upon 
completion of the purchase, thereby reducing the Company’s 
issued share capital.
No purchases had been made under this authority as at the 
date of this Annual Report and Accounts. A resolution renewing 
the authority will be proposed at the 2014 AGM.
Subject to the Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ rights, 
shares are at the disposal of the Board. At each AGM the Board 
seeks authorisation from its shareholders to allot shares. At the 
AGM held on 13 November 2013, the Directors were given 
authority to allot shares up to a nominal value of £32,664,362 
(representing one-third of the nominal value of the Company’s 
issued share capital as at 4 October 2013), such authority to 
remain valid until the end of the 2014 AGM or, if earlier, until the 
close of business on 12 February 2015. A resolution to renew 
this authority will be proposed at the 2014 AGM.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, shares may  
be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may 
by ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution  
or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the Board 
may decide. 
Subject to the Act, the Articles specify that rights attached to 
any existing class of shares may be varied either with the written 
consent of the holders of not less than three-fourths in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares 
of that class held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of 
a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. The rights conferred upon the holders 
of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided 
in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied 
by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu  
with them. 
Voting
Subject to any special terms as to voting upon any shares 
which may be issued or may at the relevant time be held, every 
member present in person or by proxy at a general meeting 
or class meeting has one vote upon a show of hands or, upon 
a poll vote, one vote for every share of which such member is 
a holder. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the 
senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall 
be accepted to the exclusion of votes of the other joint holders 
and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. 
In accordance with the Act, each member is entitled to appoint 
one or more proxies, and in the case of corporations, more than 
one corporate representative to exercise all or any of their rights 
to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or 
class meeting. The timescales for appointing proxies are set out 
in the Notice of the 2014 AGM. 
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or 
class meeting in respect of any shares held by them if any call 
or other sum then payable by them in respect of that share 
remains unpaid or if they have been served with a restriction 
notice (as defined in the Articles) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those  
shares required to be provided under the Act. 
89 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Significant agreements 
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control of the Company:
• The revolving credit facility agreement dated 14 May 2013 
made between, amongst others, the Company, Lloyds Bank 
Plc (as the facility agent) and the banks and financial 
institutions named therein as lenders (the ‘Revolving Credit 
Facility Agreement’) contains a prepayment provision at the 
election of each lender on change of control. The Company 
must notify the facility agent promptly upon becoming aware 
of the change of control. After the occurrence of a change of 
control, the facility agent shall (if a lender so requests within 
20 days of being notified of the change of control) by notice 
to the Company, on the date falling 30 days after the change 
of control, cancel the commitment of such lender under the 
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and declare all amounts 
outstanding in respect of such lender under the Revolving 
Credit Facility Agreement immediately due and payable. The 
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also contains a provision 
such that, following a change of control, a lender is not 
obliged to fund any further drawdown of the facility (other 
than rollover loans). For these purposes, a ‘change of control’ 
occurs if any person or group of persons ‘acting in concert’ 
(as defined in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers) 
gains control (as defined in the Corporation Tax Act 2010)  
of the Company. 
• Each of the note purchase agreements entered into in 
respect of the Group’s privately placed notes (being the 
US$80m of notes issued pursuant to the following note 
purchase agreements: (i) a note purchase agreement in 
respect of the issue of US$15m notes dated 10 May 201 1  
(as amended and restated on 14 May 2013); and (ii) a note 
purchase agreement in respect of the issue of US$65m 
notes also dated 10 May 201 1 (as amended and restated  
on 14 May 2013)) contains a change of control prepayment 
provision. Each such control provision provides that promptly 
after the Company becomes aware that a change of control 
has occurred, the Company shall notify all the holders of the 
notes of the same and give the noteholders the option to 
require the Company to prepay at par all outstanding 
amounts (principal and interest) under the notes. If a 
noteholder accepts such offer of prepayment, such 
prepayment shall take place on a date that is not more than 
90 business days after the Company notified the noteholders 
of the change of control. For these purposes a ‘change of 
control’ means the acquisition by a person or a group of 
persons ‘acting in concert’ (as defined in the City Code  
on Takeovers and Mergers) such that they gain beneficial 
ownership of more than 50 per cent of the issued share 
capital of the Company carrying voting rights. 
• The £100m term facility agreement between, amongst 
others, the Company and Prudential/M&G UK Companies 
Financing Fund LP dated 10 May 201 1 (as amended and 
restated on 14 May 2013) also contains a prepayment 
Dividends and distributions 
Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may by 
ordinary resolution from time to time declare dividends for 
payment to the holders of the ordinary shares of 10 pence  
each, of an amount which does not exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any fixed rate dividend, whenever the 
financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies their payment. If the Board acts in good faith, it is not 
liable to holders of shares with preferred or pari passu rights for 
losses arising from the payment of interim or fixed dividends on 
other shares. The Board may withhold payment of all or any 
part of any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the 
Company’s shares from a person with a 0.25% interest if such 
person has been served with a restriction notice after failure to 
provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares required to be provided under the Act.
Shareholder arrangements to waive dividends 
The Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘EBT’) 
holds ordinary shares in the Company for the purpose of 
satisfying options and awards that have been granted under  
the various employee share schemes operated by the 
Company. Details of the shares so held are set out in  
note 29 to the Financial Statements.
The EBT has agreed to waive all or any future right to dividend 
payments on shares held within the EBT and these shares do 
not count in the calculation of the weighted average number of 
shares used to calculate EPS until such time as they are vested 
to the relevant employee. 
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on 
shares held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing so 
may take into account both financial and non-financial interests 
of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants. 
Employee share schemes
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 30  
to the Financial Statements.
Approach to tax and tax governance
Across all taxes, it is the Group’s aim to ensure it accurately 
calculates and pays the tax that is due at the correct time. 
Whilst the Group does seek to minimise its tax liabilities through 
the use of legitimate routine tax planning, it does not participate 
in aggressive tax planning schemes. The Group also seeks to 
be transparent in its dealings with HM Revenue & Customs and 
has regular dialogue with them to discuss both developments in 
the business and the ongoing tax position. 
The Group Finance Director retains overall responsibility for 
oversight of the tax affairs of the Group and receives updates 
on the tax position on a regular basis. In addition taxation is 
discussed by the Audit Committee at least annually.
90 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Directors’ Report continued
Other Statutory Information continued The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon  
the wider economic environment in which the Group operates. 
As explained in the Managing Risk section on pages 36 to 37 , 
factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group 
include changes in the macroeconomic environment including 
buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the 
Group’s customers and interest rates.
The Group has total committed facilities and private placement 
notes of £848.4m. The maturity of these facilities range from 
June 2016 to July 2021, with £150m of the revolving credit 
facility maturing in June 2016 and £550m of the revolving credit 
facility maturing in May 2018. The committed facilities and 
private placement notes provide appropriate headroom above 
our current forecast debt requirements. In addition to these 
committed borrowing facilities the Group has secured £32.4m 
of financing from the Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ and 
‘Growing Places Fund’ schemes. These funds are repayable 
between 31 December 2014 and 31 March 2018.
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered 
forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have 
formed a judgement, at the time of approving the Financial 
Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, being at least twelve 
months from the date of these Financial Statements. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated Financial Statements.

provision on a change of control at the election of each 
lender; such prepayment provision is the same as that 
described for the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement  
(save for the fact that the term loan is fully drawn and so  
the restrictions on drawing described for the Revolving  
Credit Facility Agreement do not apply).
• Each of the debt facility agreements (based on a pro forma 
agreement agreed in October 2012) between the Company 
(as guarantor), BDW (as borrower and developer) and the 
Homes and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) (as lender), 
whereby the HCA has made up to £33m (in aggregate)  
of project financing available to fund up to 20 development 
sites, contains a provision requiring BDW to obtain the 
consent of the HCA on a change in control of the Company, 
BDW or any of their holding companies (if relevant). The HCA 
is entitled to withhold its consent to such a change in control 
if the new controller does not have sufficient reputation, 
financial standing or organisational standing and capacity. A 
failure to: (i) obtain the HCA’s consent to a change in control; 
and (ii) provide the HCA with notice of the change in control 
within a specified time period, is an event of default under 
each of these agreements. On such an event of default the 
HCA may, by notice in writing to BDW, terminate each debt 
facility agreement and require BDW to prepay the project 
financing. For these purposes a ‘change in control’ means 
the acquisition by a person or a group of persons acting 
together such that they gain beneficial ownership of more 
than 50 per cent of the issued share capital or voting rights  
of the relevant company, have the right to appoint the 
majority of the directors of the relevant company or otherwise 
control the votes at board meetings of the relevant company.
The note purchase agreements also impose upon the holders 
customary restrictions on resale or transfer of the notes, such  
as the transfer being subject to a de minimis amount.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the 
Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider 
whether the Group can continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future.
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the 
Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, 
financial performance and financial position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 2 to 41. The material financial and 
operational risks and uncertainties that may have an impact 
upon the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined 
on pages 38 to 41 and financial risks including liquidity risk, 
market risk, credit risk and capital risk are outlined in note 27  
to the Financial Statements.

Financial Statements and accounting records
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts including the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The Directors are required  
by the International Accounting Standards Regulation (the ‘IAS 
Regulation’) to prepare the Group Financial Statements under 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare the 
Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with 
IFRS. The Financial Statements are also required by law to be 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. Under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, the Directors must not approve the 
Accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Company for that period.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Financial 
Statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This 
requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, 
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards 
Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and presentation  
of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair 
presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
IFRS. Directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for  
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the

Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Accounting Policies on pages 102 to 109 that the Group 
is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Financial Statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources  
in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Carrying value of land and work in progress
The Group’s assessment of the carrying value of land and work in progress, 
being the lower of cost and net realisable value, is a judgemental process 
which requires the estimation of future selling prices, sales rates and costs to 
complete, determined on a site by site basis. These factors drive the gross 
margin for each site and hence that recognised at the point of sale. Revenue 
recognition on social housing developments accounted for under IAS 1 1 
‘Construction Contracts’ requires additional judgement in calculating the 
revenue and profit to be recognised, estimating the total expected costs  
to complete each site and the percentage of completion at the balance  
sheet date.
Our work involved testing each of the key assumptions and forecasts which 
support the basis of the valuation of land, including strategic land, and work 
in progress. We have compared the Group assumptions to external market 
forecasts for sales price inflation and build cost inflation and have tested  
a sample of sites to current market data on sales rates, sales prices and 
cost assumptions. We have performed independent sensitivity analysis, 
informed by external forecasts. We attended a sample of valuation 
meetings to assist us in assessing the adequacy of management’s key 
controls around the forecasting of costs. We also tested the design and 
implementation of the Group’s controls relating to the determination of 
costs to complete as this is the most significant judgment applied to each 
site valuation. A sample of construction contracts were tested through 
verification of costs incurred and supporting evidence for the percentage 
completion at the balance sheet date sought from third party surveyors.  
A selection of these schemes have been reviewed with a sample of costs 
agreed to surveyors certificates, total sales values agreed to contracts,  
and the recognition formula verified to support revenue recognised.
Valuation of available for sale financial assets
The Group’s available for sale financial assets are held at fair value. The 
assets represent loans granted as part of housing sales transactions that  
are secured by way of a second charge on the respective property. The 
valuation requires the exercise of significant judgement in estimating the 
future cash flows expected from the redemption of the loans, including  
an estimate of the market value of the property at the estimated time of 
repayment, and the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate  
the present value of the cash flows.
We have tested each of the key assumptions underpinning the fair value 
model through comparison to historic experience of the Group in terms  
of redemption values and defaults, tested the consistency of assumptions 
employed by the Group for forecast sales price inflation and compared the 
discount rate employed to the equivalent interest rate charged on a second 
charge loan of similar quantum and duration to the average loan issued by 
the Group. We have employed sensitivity analysis to the key assumptions 
and have reviewed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided  
in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and IFRS 7  
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, including the classification within  
the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Statements Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is  
a judgemental process which requires estimates concerning the estimated 
future cash flows associated with the goodwill and brand assets held, the 
discount rates and the growth rate of revenue and costs to be applied in 
determining the value in use.
We challenged each of the key assumptions employed in the annual 
goodwill impairment test. This included reference to our internal valuation 
specialists’ benchmarking of the discount rate employed, including its 
methodology and constituent inputs, comparison to independent market 
forecasts of revenue and cost growth in the housebuilding sector and  
an assessment of the Group’s historic forecasting accuracy. We also 
performed sensitivity analysis in relation to the key inputs to the goodwill 
impairment test model and focused on the appropriateness of the 
disclosures provided in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 57 . The key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out on page 1 1 1.
 
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and not to express  
an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the Financial Statements is not modified with respect to any  
of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work.
 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £24 million, which is 6.1% of statutory pre-tax profit. 
 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.48 million, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the Group level. The entire Group is audited by one audit team, led by the Senior Statutory Auditor. The audit is performed centrally 
and includes all of the divisions which comprise the Group’s housebuilding segment, the Group’s commercial developments segment and the head office 
consolidation. We choose to visit eight of the Group’s housebuilding divisions across each of the Group’s six regions, selected on a rotational basis and with 
reference to size and complexity among other factors. We always visit each of the London divisions and we visit Wilson Bowden Developments Limited, 
which constitutes the Group’s commercial developments segment. We consider that we obtain a better level of understanding of the business to underpin 
our robust audit approach by visiting a number of divisions rather than performing all of our work centrally from the Group’s head office.
 
We audit all of the Group’s subsidiaries which are subject to audit at a statutory materiality level, which in most cases is substantially lower than  
Group materiality.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Financial Statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Financial Statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches  
not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members  
of Barratt Developments PLC continued Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified  
any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards 
review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s Report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
Financial Statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. In addition, we read  
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
Cash Flow Statements Year ended 30 June 2014
Basis of preparation
These Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations and Standing Interpretations 
Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations as adopted and endorsed by the European Union (‘EU’) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore the Group Financial Statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards 
Regulation. The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial 
assets, derivative financial instruments and share-based payments. A summary of the more significant Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of the amounts, actual results may ultimately differ from those 
estimates. The most significant estimates made by the Directors in these Financial Statements are set out in ‘Critical Accounting Judgements and Key 
Sources of Estimation Uncertainty’.
Going concern
In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Group’s business activities, together with factors which the Directors consider are likely to affect its future development, financial performance and 
financial position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 41. The material financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may have an 
impact upon the Group’s performance and their mitigation are outlined on pages 38 to 41 and financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk 
and capital risk are outlined in note 27 to the Financial Statements. 
The financial performance of the Group is dependent upon the wider economic environment in which the Group operates. As explained in the Managing 
Risk section on pages 36 to 37 , factors that particularly affect the performance of the Group include changes in the macroeconomic environment 
including buyer confidence, availability of mortgage finance for the Group’s customers and interest rates. 
The Group has total committed facilities and private placement notes of £848.4m. The maturity of these facilities range from June 2016 to July 2021, with 
£150m of the revolving credit facility maturing in June 2016 and £550m of the revolving credit facility maturing in May 2018. The committed facilities and 
private placement notes provide appropriate headroom above our current forecast debt requirements.
In addition to these committed borrowing facilities the Group has secured £32.4m of financing from the Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ and ‘Growing 
Places Fund’ schemes. These funds are repayable between 31 December 2014 and 31 March 2018.
Accordingly, after making enquiries and having considered forecasts and appropriate sensitivities, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of 
approving the Financial Statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, being at least twelve months from the date of these Financial Statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the year ended 30 June 2014, the Group has adopted:
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’; and
• IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’.
The adoption of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ has resulted in a review of the way the Group values financial assets and liabilities measured at fair 
value (see notes 24, 25 and 27). In accordance with IFRS 13, the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities now includes an assessment of credit 
risk in respect of the counter party and own credit risk respectively.
In the year ended 30 June 2013, the Group had financial assets that included foreign currency swaps with a third party financial institution. The Group has 
a net settlement arrangement with the financial institution in respect of the foreign currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Due to this net settlement 
arrangement the Group has assessed credit risk associated with the foreign currency swap to be nil. Therefore, the Group’s foreign currency swaps 
financial assets fair values have not been restated for the comparative prior year.
102 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements continued
Accounting Policies The financial liabilities at fair value relate to interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps with third party financial institutions. In accordance with IFRS 13 
‘Fair Value Measurement’ the Group has undertaken an assessment of its own credit risk. When assessing the Group’s own credit risk the Directors have 
considered the financial covenants, which the Group is party to as part of its senior lending facilities. Following a review of these financial covenants the 
Directors believe that the Group has sufficient resources to fulfil its interest rate swap and foreign currency swap obligations in the future and the likelihood 
of default to be remote. Therefore, the Group has assessed its credit risk as nil and has not restated its financial liabilities fair values for the comparative 
prior year. 
The impact to the Group of adopting IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ has been a change in the calculation of the interest cost charged to the profit 
and loss on employee benefits. In accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’, interest is now calculated on the net defined benefit asset/
liability. The Group interest expense has been restated from £0.5m to £0.8m for the comparative year (see note 3). The increased finance cost has resulted 
in an equivalent credit being recognised in other comprehensive income. There has been no impact on the defined benefit asset/liability.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements include the results of Barratt Developments PLC (the ‘Company’), incorporated in the UK, and all its subsidiary 
undertakings made up to 30 June. The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are consolidated from the date when control passes to the Group 
using the purchase method of accounting and up to the date control ceases. All transactions with subsidiaries and intercompany profits or losses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations
All of the subsidiaries’ identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values.  
All changes to those assets and liabilities and the resulting gains and losses that arise after the Group has gained control of the subsidiary are included  
in the post-acquisition income statement.
Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest with one or more other parties where a contractual arrangement has established 
joint control over the entity. Jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Jointly controlled operations
The Group enters into jointly controlled operations as part of its housebuilding and property development activities. The Group’s share of profits and 
losses from its investments in such jointly controlled operations is accounted for on a direct basis and is included in the Income Statement. The Group’s 
share of its investments, assets and liabilities is accounted for on a directly proportional basis in the Group’s Balance Sheet.
Associated entities
An associated entity is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, in which the Group holds a significant influence and that  
is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Associated entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised at legal completion in respect of the total proceeds of building and development. An appropriate proportion of revenue from 
construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of contract activity. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration 
received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for the property, net of discounts and VAT. The sale proceeds of part-exchange properties 
are not included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Construction contracts
Revenue is only recognised on a construction contract where the outcome can be estimated reliably. Variations to, and claims arising in respect of, 
construction contracts, are included in revenue to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer. Revenue and costs are recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion of contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date. 
Contracts are only treated as construction contracts when they have been specifically negotiated for the construction of a development or property.  
When it is probable that the total costs on a construction contract will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense  
in the Income Statement immediately.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade receivables and stated at cost plus attributable profit less any foreseeable losses. 
Payments received on account for construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on construction contracts. 
Payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on construction contracts are included in trade payables.
103 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Exceptional items
Items that are material in size or unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the Income Statement. The Directors are of the opinion 
that the separate presentation of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance. Examples of events 
that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, refinancing costs, 
gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets, pension scheme curtailments and asset impairments, including land, work in progress, 
goodwill and investments.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs are recognised in the Income Statement when the Group has a detailed plan that has been communicated to the affected parties.  
A liability is accrued for unpaid restructuring costs.
Profit from operations
Profit from operations includes all of the revenue and costs derived from the Group’s operating businesses. Profit from operations excludes finance costs, 
finance income, the Group’s share of profits or losses from joint ventures and associates, tax and gains/(losses) on disposal of investments.
Segmental reporting
The Group consists of two separate segments for internal reporting, regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources  
to the segments and to assess their performance, being housebuilding and commercial developments. These segments therefore comprise the primary 
reporting segments within the Financial Statements. All of the Group’s operations are within Britain, which is one geographic market in the context  
of managing the Group’s activities.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets  
and liabilities acquired. 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses is capitalised as an asset but reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination at acquisition being housebuilding and commercial developments. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested  
for impairment at least annually. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss  
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the 
carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
 
Intangible assets
Brands
Internally generated brands are not capitalised. The Group has capitalised as intangible assets brands that have been acquired. Acquired brand values  
are calculated using discounted cash flows. Where a brand is considered to have a finite life, it is amortised over its useful life on a straight-line basis. 
Where a brand is capitalised with an indefinite life, it is not amortised. The factors that contribute to the durability of brands capitalised are that there are  
no material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these intangible assets.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of indefinite life brands as part of the review of the carrying value of goodwill, by performing a 
value-in-use calculation, using a discount factor based upon the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Investments
Interests in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost less any provision for impairment.
Where share-based payments are granted to the employees of subsidiary undertakings by the Company, they are treated as a capital contribution to the 
subsidiary and the Company’s investment in the subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided to write-off 
the cost of the assets on a straight-line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives. Residual values and asset lives are reviewed annually.
Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 25 years. Freehold land is not depreciated. Plant is depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over its expected useful life, which ranges from one to seven years.
104 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements continued
Accounting Policies continued Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads that have 
been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Land held for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at discounted cost. Where, through deferred purchase credit 
terms, the carrying value differs from the amount that will ultimately be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the Income 
Statement over the period of settlement.
Due to the scale of the Group’s developments, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units built in the current year and in future 
years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. In making these assessments, there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The 
Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Leases as lessee
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Income Statement in equal instalments over the life of the lease.
Leases as lessor
The Group enters into leasing arrangements with third parties following the completion of constructed developments until the date of the sale of the 
development to third parties. Rental income from these operating leases is recognised in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
in the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Group issues both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. In accordance with the transitional provisions,  
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. Fair value is measured either using 
Black-Scholes, Present-Economic Value or Monte Carlo models depending on the characteristics of the scheme. The fair value is expensed in the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest where non-market vesting 
conditions apply. 
Non-vesting conditions are taken into account in the estimate of the fair value of the equity instruments.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because  
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax  
is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not been reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events 
that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to 
taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
105 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Pensions
Defined contribution
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for certain employees. The Group’s contributions to the schemes are charged in the Income 
Statement in the year in which the contributions fall due.
Defined benefit
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside profit or loss 
and presented in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. Net-interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
Past service cost, until the scheme ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions to employees from 30 June 2009, was recognised 
immediately to the extent that the benefits were already vested, and otherwise was amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until  
the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past  
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the 
asset where developments are considered to fall under the requirements of IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’ (Revised). Otherwise, the Group expenses borrowing 
costs in the period to which they relate through the Income Statement.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset  
and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
The Group derecognises a financial liability only when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as either ‘available for sale financial assets’ or ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends  
on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Available for sale financial assets
Secured loans
Non-interest bearing loans granted as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property are classified 
as being available for sale and are stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 17 .
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from impairment 
losses, changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the ‘effective interest rate’ method are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
Residential property fund
Revenue from transactions involving available for sale financial assets is recognised at the fair value of consideration receivable. The fair value  
of consideration received is the initial fair value of the units received in the property fund.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in equity within other comprehensive income. The fair value of this investment  
is calculated using the unadjusted quoted price of units in the property fund obtained from independent brokers.
Gains and losses arising from impairment losses and changes in future cash flows are recognised directly in the Income Statement.
106 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements continued
Accounting Policies continued Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current 
assets, except for those with maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets and are 
measured at amortised cost less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. The net of these balances are classified as ‘trade and other receivables’  
in the Balance Sheet. 
Trade and other receivables are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Impairment of financial assets
Trade and other receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date and are impaired where there is objective evidence  
that the recovery of the receivable is in doubt. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the customer, default on payment terms or the customer going  
into liquidation.
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade or other receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance 
account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement.
For financial assets classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the value of the property underpinning the value of the loan or 
increased risk of default are considered to be objective evidence of impairment.   
In respect of debt instruments classified as available for sale financial assets, increases in the fair value of assets previously subject to impairment, which 
can be objectively related to an event occurring after recognition of the impairment loss, are recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that they 
reverse the impairment loss. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and balances in bank accounts with no notice or less than three months’ notice from inception and  
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as ‘loans and receivables’.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments consist of the Company’s ordinary share capital and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
All non-derivative financial liabilities are classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
Other financial liabilities consist of bank borrowings and trade and other payables. 
Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Trade and other payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which 
they relate by discounting at prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which will be paid in settling the 
deferred purchase terms liability, is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method.
107 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where bank agreements include a legal right of offset for in hand and overdraft balances, and the Group intends to settle the net outstanding position,  
the offset arrangements are applied to record the net position in the Balance Sheet.
Finance income and charges are accounted for using the ‘effective interest rate’ method in the Income Statement. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement in the period to which they relate.
Get Britain Building
The Group has received cash upon specific sites under the Government’s ‘Get Britain Building’ scheme, which is repayable in future periods, as the sites 
to which it relates are developed. These loans are interest bearing and are recorded at the proceeds received plus accrued interest. These loans are 
included within loans and borrowings.
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement in the period to which they relate.
Growing Places Fund
The Group has received cash under a local government ‘Growing Places Fund’ scheme which is repayable over four years in eight six-monthly instalments. 
This loan is interest bearing and recorded at the proceeds received plus accrued interest less repayments to date. This loan is included within loans  
and borrowings. 
Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement in the period to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage the interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risk arising from the Group’s operations and sources of finance. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies 
approved by the Board of Directors as detailed in notes 26 and 27 to the Financial Statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each 
balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. 
The interest rate and cross currency swap arrangements are designated as hedging instruments, being either hedges of a change in future cash flows  
as a result of interest rate movements or hedges of a change in future cash flows as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedging relationship  
is more than twelve months and as a current asset or a current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than twelve months.
Hedge accounting
All of the Group’s interest rate and cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for 
undertaking various hedged transactions. In addition, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items.
Details of the fair values of the interest rate and cross currency swaps are provided in notes 24, 25, 26 and 27 to the Financial Statements. Movements  
on the hedging reserve in equity are detailed in the Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity.
108 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements continued
Accounting Policies continued Cash flow hedge
To the extent that the Group’s cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swap  
arrangements are deferred in equity in the hedging reserve until realised. On realisation, such gains and losses are recognised within finance  
charges in the Income Statement. 
To the extent that any hedge is ineffective, gains and losses on the fair value of these swap arrangements are recognised immediately in finance  
charges in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold or terminated or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was 
deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the 
grants will be received. 
Government grants are recognised in the Income Statement so as to match with the related costs they are intended to compensate for. Grants related to 
assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. Grants related to income are included in the appropriate line within the Income Statement.
Kickstart
The Group has been granted assistance for the development of a number of sites under the Homes and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) ‘Kickstart’ scheme. 
Where receipts under the Kickstart scheme relate to grants, they are accounted for in accordance with the policy for Government grants stated above.
 
In addition, the Group has received cash upon specific sites under the Kickstart equity scheme which is repayable in future periods, as the sites to which it 
relates are developed, along with the share of the profits or losses attributable to the HCA arising from the sites. This liability is included within borrowings 
and is initially recognised at fair value by discounting it at prevailing market interest rates at the date of recognition. The discount to nominal value, which 
will be paid in settling the liability, is amortised over the expected life of the site and charged to finance costs using the ‘effective interest rate’ method. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the liability related to the HCA’s share of the profits or losses of the site are recognised directly in  
the Income Statement.

and Annual Improvements 201 1-2013 have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group has not early-adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation.
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to have an impact upon the Group are: 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ was reissued in October 2010 as the second step in the IASB project to replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. During the year the IASB reissued IFRS 9 to include hedge accounting and details on early adoption. The final revision 
to the standard incorporating the impairment, classification and measurement requirements was issued by the IASB in July 2014. The Group is 
currently assessing the impact of the revisions on the Group’s results and financial position.
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ was issued on 28 May 2014. This standard sets out revenue recognition conditions for the Group. 
The impact of this standard on the Group is being assessed.
• Amendment to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisition of Interest in Joint Operations’. The amendment requires companies to apply IFRS ‘Business 
Combinations’ acquisition and disclosure requirements to investments in Joint Operations. The only exemption from this is if the formation of the  
Joint Operation coincides with the formation of the business.
The adoption of the following standards, amendments and interpretations is not expected to have any material impact on the Financial Statements  
of the Group:

• IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. None of the amendments are expected to impact the Group.
• IAS 28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. None of the amendments are expected to 
impact the Group.
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 ‘Investment Entities’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. These amendments give guidance  
on exemptions from consolidating certain subsidiaries for investment entities. The amendments are not expected to impact the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 36 ‘Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. This amendment 
primarily reduces the circumstances in which the recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is required to be disclosed. The amendments 
are not expected to impact the Group.
• Amendments to IAS 39 ‘Novation of Derivative and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’ will apply to the Group from 1 July 2014. This amendment 
confirms that there is no need to discontinue hedge accounting if a hedging derivative is novated, provided certain criteria are met. The amendments 
are not expected to impact the Group.

Impact of Standards and Interpretations in issue  
but not yet effective
Financial Statements continued In accordance with the requirements of IFRS, the Group has detailed below the critical accounting judgements made and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty within these Financial Statements.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in the accounting policies note, the Directors have made no individual 
judgements that have a significant impact upon the Financial Statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet dates, are discussed below.
Carrying value of land and work in progress
The Group’s principal activity is housebuilding and commercial development. The majority of the development activity is not contracted prior to the development 
commencing. Accordingly, the Group has in its Balance Sheet at 30 June 2014 current assets that are not covered by a forward sale. The Group’s internal 
controls are designed to identify any developments where the Balance Sheet value of land and work in progress is more than the lower of cost or net 
realisable value.
The Group conducts six-monthly reviews of the net realisable value of its land and work in progress. Where the estimated net realisable value of the site 
was less than its current carrying value within the Balance Sheet, the Group has impaired the land and work in progress value. 
During the year, due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross impairment charges of £26.5m (2013: £25.7m) and 
gross impairment reversals of £22.0m (2013: £22.5m) resulting in a net inventory impairment of £4.5m (2013: £3.2m) included within profit from operations 
for housebuilding sites for development. In addition there was a charge of £4.4m (2013: £9.1m) related to housebuilding sites not currently under 
development due to changes in planning status and the viability of these sites.
There was also a gross impairment charge of £0.4m (2013: £0.6m) and a gross impairment reversal of £0.4m (2013: £0.1m) for the commercial 
developments business, resulting in a net inventory impairment of £nil (2013: £0.5m), due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and 
estimated costs to complete. Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current 
prices being achieved upon each site for each product type. In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis 
for low single-digit sales price inflation in future periods. The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single-digit build costs 
inflation in future periods. During the year the Group benefitted from stronger market conditions. If the UK housing market were to change beyond 
management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and estimated costs to complete, further 
adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
The land held at the balance sheet date that has already been impaired is most sensitive to the judgements being applied and the potential for further 
impairment or reversal. Forecasting risk also increases in relation to those sites that are not expected to be realised in the short to medium term. 
Available for sale financial assets
The Group holds available for sale financial assets principally comprising interest free loans granted as part of sales transactions that are secured by way 
of a second legal charge on the respective property, which are held at fair value. The fair value calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows 
expected from the redemption of interest free loans, including an estimate of the market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment, and 
requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The estimated market value is based on original 
selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation. The estimated repayment profile is based on historical 
data for first time buyers selling their property. The discount rate used is consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge loan of a 
similar amount and duration. 
The interrelationship between these assumptions, particularly those related to estimated market value and estimated repayment profile, means that there 
is not a direct correlation between house price inflation and the valuation of the Group’s available for sale financial assets. During the year, the levels of 
house price inflation and redemptions have been in line with those expected in the fair value calculation. Accordingly, there has been no significant change 
in the Balance Sheet valuation due to the improved market. At 30 June 2014, the total asset recognised on the Balance Sheet in relation to these secured 
loans was £122.4m (2013: £128.4m), with the reduction primarily due to redemptions.
111 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources  
of Estimation Uncertainty Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review
The impairment review for the goodwill of the housebuilding business and the Group’s indefinite life brand, David Wilson Homes, requires an estimation  
of the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment as defined in notes 12 and 13. The value-in-use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows 
expected from the housebuilding business, including the anticipated growth rate of revenue and costs, and requires the determination of a suitable 
discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The discount rate used is based on the average capital structure of the Group, current 
market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s housebuilding business. Changes in these may impact upon the 
Group’s discount rate in future periods. The carrying amount of goodwill at 30 June 2014 was £792.2m and the indefinite life brands was £100.0m with  
no impairment recognised during the year ended 30 June 2014.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future 
performance based upon current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs to complete, the housebuilding 
segment’s goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired. The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by 
£1,213.2m (2013: £1,140.6m). 
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 3.3% per annum (2013: 3.8% 
per annum) or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 2.9% (2013: 2.6%) and all other variables were held constant, then the recoverable value 
of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value.
Investment in joint venture holding non-current available for sale financial assets
The Group holds a joint venture investment of £25.6m (2013: £25.8m) in Rose Shared Equity LLP . This entity holds non-current available for sale financial 
assets comprising interest free loans that are secured by way of a second charge on the respective property. The Group’s investment is accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting. In line with the Group’s other joint venture investments, the carrying value is reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
This review requires estimation of the cash flows expected to be received by the Group which is based upon calculation of the fair values of the loans held 
by the entity including an estimate of future cash flows expected from the redemption of interest free loans, including an estimate of the market value of the 
property at the estimated time of redemption, and requires the determination of a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows. 
The estimated market value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation. The 
estimated repayment profile is based on historic data for first time buyers selling their property. The discount rate used is consistent with the interest rate 
payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount and duration.
Estimation of costs to complete
In order to determine the profit that the Group is able to recognise on its developments in a specific period, the Group has to allocate site-wide  
development costs between units built in the current year and in future years. It also has to estimate costs to complete on such developments. 
In making these assessments there is a degree of inherent uncertainty. The Group has developed internal controls to assess and review carrying  
values and the appropriateness of estimates made.
Recognition of profit where developments are accounted for under IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ 
The Group applies its policy on contract accounting when recognising revenue and profit on partially completed contracts. The application of this policy 
requires judgements to be made in respect of the total expected costs to complete for each site. The Group has in place established internal control 
processes to ensure that the evaluation of costs and revenues is based upon appropriate estimates.
Defined benefit pension scheme 
The Directors engage a qualified independent actuary to calculate the Group’s asset in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme. In calculating this 
asset, it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, which include discount rates, salary and pension increases, price inflation, the long term rate 
of return upon scheme assets and mortality.
As actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from those assumed, the pension asset may differ from that included in these Financial Statements.
The Group has obtained legal advice on the rights to the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme’s assets after the death of the last member. Based on 
this advice, the Group has concluded that it is appropriate to recognise an asset related to this scheme.
Deferred tax assets
At 30 June 2014, the Group recognised a net deferred tax asset of £19.6m comprising gross deferred tax assets of £43.5m and gross deferred tax 
liabilities of £23.9m. £19.7m of the gross deferred tax assets relate to losses that arose during preceding years, predominantly as a result of the refinancing 
and land impairments, which are to be carried forward and relieved against profits arising in future periods. The judgement to recognise the deferred tax 
asset is dependent upon taxable profits arising in the same company as the losses originally arose and the Group’s expectations regarding future 
profitability including site revenue and cost forecasts for future years which contain a degree of inherent uncertainty.

Financial Statements continued
Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources  
of Estimation Uncertainty continued Hedge accounting
The majority of the Group’s facilities are floating rate, which exposes the Group to increased interest rate risk. The Group has in place £137 .0m (2013: 
£137 .0m) of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. The Group has adopted hedge accounting for these swaps on the basis that it is highly probable that 
there is sufficient forecast debt to match with the period of swaps. If this basis was not met in the future any changes in fair value of the swaps would be 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, rather than in equity. During the year ended 30 June 2014, there was a gain of £7 .7m (2013: £6.9m) 
included in equity related to these swaps. 
In addition, the Group has US$80.0m (2013: US$246.6m) of cross currency swaps to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange, arising  
from the Group’s sources of US Dollar denominated finance. These swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge against future foreign exchange rate 
movements. If the hedges ceased to be highly effective, any changes in fair value of the swaps would be recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement, rather than equity. During the year ended 30 June 2014, there was a loss of £7 .3m (2013: gain of £0.7m) included in equity related to  
these swaps.

2. Segmental analysis
The Group consists of two separate segments for management reporting and control purposes, being housebuilding and commercial developments.  
The segments are considered appropriate for reporting under IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ since these segments are regularly reviewed internally  
by the Board without further significant categorisation. The Group presents its primary segment information on the basis of these operating segments.  
As the Group operates in a single geographic market, Britain, no secondary segmentation is provided.

3. Restatement of the comparative year arising on the adoption of IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’
In the year ended 30 June 2014, the Group has adopted IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. The impact on the Group and the Company of adopting 
this standard was a change in the calculation of the interest cost charged to profit and loss on employee benefits. In accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) 
‘Employee Benefits’ interest is now calculated on the net defined benefit pension asset/liability. The Group and Company interest expense within finance 
costs has been restated for the comparative year from £0.5m to £0.8m. The increased finance cost has resulted in an equivalent credit recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. There has been no impact on the defined benefit asset/liability.
4. Exceptional items
In the year ended 30 June 2014, there were no exceptional items.
In the year ended 30 June 2013, there were the following exceptional items:
Debt refinancing
On 14 May 2013, the Group agreed a comprehensive refinancing package. The Group entered into a new £700m revolving credit facility, reducing to 
£550m in June 2016 and maturing in May 2018. The Group retained US$80m of private placement notes that were issued in May 2011 and mature in 
August 2017 and the £100m term loan that was drawn in July 2011, of which 25% is scheduled to be repaid in 2019, 25% in 2020 and the balance in 2021. 
As a result of the refinancing the Group incurred fees of £14.9m, which are being amortised over the life of the facilities. In addition, the Group accelerated 
the amortisation of refinancing fees previously capitalised of £7 .8m.
The Group’s private placement notes that were issued in 2007 and 2008 (which amounted to £151.9m equivalent), together with the associated foreign 
exchange swaps, were cancelled with effect from 2 July 2013. The interest make-whole of £53.0m was recognised as an exceptional charge in the 
Consolidated Income Statement as the Group was irrevocably committed to this repayment as at 30 June 2013. 
 
The Group cancelled £55m nominal value of interest rate swaps resulting in an exceptional interest charge of £18.5m.
As a result of the refinancing, total exceptional finance costs were £79.3m with a related tax credit of £18.8m.
Part sale of non-current available for sale financial asset
On 13 May 2013, the Group entered into a joint venture, Rose Shared Equity LLP (‘Rose’), with a fund managed by Anchorage Capital Group LLC 
(‘Anchorage’). The Group disposed of the majority of its own equity share loans that originated in the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 
into the joint venture at no gain or loss. Anchorage acquired a 50% interest in Rose for £33.7m. The Group has recognised exceptional administrative 
costs related to fees upon this transaction and the comprehensive debt refinancing of £2.8m with a related tax credit of £0.6m.
Impairment of inventory relating to investments accounted for using the equity method
At 30 June 2013, the Group conducted an impairment review of its share of the inventories included within its investments accounted for using the equity 
method. This resulted in an impairment charge for the year of £5.4m with a related tax credit of £1.3m.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued 8. Tax (continued)
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were enacted in the Finance Act 2013 on 17 July 2013, including a reduction in the main rate  
of corporation tax from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. The reductions from 23% were substantively 
enacted during the period and have therefore been reflected in the accounts for this year. Accordingly, the current year tax charge has been provided for 
at an effective rate of 22.50% (2013: 23.75%) and the closing deferred tax asset has been provided in these Financial Statements at a rate of between 20% 
and 21% (2013: 23%) depending upon when the asset is expected to reverse.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £305.4m (2013: £7 4.7m (*restated)) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, 
which was 979.1m (2013: 973.7m) shares.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £305.4m (2013: £74.7m (*restated)) by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the year, giving 
a figure of 1,004.7m (2013: 998.7m) shares.

At 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014 792.2
The Group’s goodwill has a carrying value of £792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment. The goodwill relating to the commercial developments 
segment, with a cost of £24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments. 
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2014 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its 
tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill. The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata 
basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment. The first two years of cash flows were 
determined using the Group’s approved detailed site-by-site business plan. The cash flows for the third to fifth years were determined using Group level 
internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in 
progress levels. The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon 
the expected long term growth rate of the UK economy. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were:
• Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Group’s 
housebuilding business. Accordingly, the rate of 12.6% (2013: 12.2%) is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted 
discount rate, being the Group’s estimated long term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. This rate used in the 30 June 2014 impairment review is 
calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality of the Group’s 
borrowing requirements and reflects the Group’s reduced borrowing costs following the comprehensive refinancing completed during the prior year. 
• Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis 
for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level 
based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
• Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and 
planning permissions. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future 
changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
• Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the expected costs of 
completing all aspects of each individual development. For years three to five, these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience 
and expectations of future changes in the market, taking into account external market forecasts.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that given the current position of the housebuilding segment and the expectations as to its future 
performance based upon current forecasts for sales volumes and expected changes in both selling prices and costs to complete, the housebuilding 
segment’s goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired. The recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by 
£1,213.2m (2013: £1,140.6m). 
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 3.3% per annum (2013: 3.8% 
per annum) or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 2.9% (2013: 2.6%) and all other variables were held constant, then the recoverable value 
of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value. Further information is given in Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty on page 112.

The Group does not amortise the housebuilding brand acquired with Wilson Bowden, being David Wilson Homes, valued at £100.0m, as the Directors 
consider that this brand has an indefinite useful economic life due to the fact that the Group intends to hold and support the brand for an indefinite period 
and there are no factors that would prevent it from doing so.
The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. At 30 June 2014, an 
impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 12. The conclusion of this impairment review was that the 
Group’s David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments (valued at £7 .0m prior to amortisation) was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business 
brand operating in niche markets. Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

Available for sale financial assets principally comprise interest free loans that are granted as part of sales transactions and for which the cash flows 
receivable are based on the value of the property at redemption. These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property 
(after the first mortgage). These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the estimated market value of the 
property at the estimated time of repayment. The Consolidated Income Statement includes a net impairment reversal of £2.8m (2013: charge of £6.1m) in 
cost of sales.
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
125 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 17 . Available for sale financial assets (continued)
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge 
loan of a similar amount and duration. This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in nature to second charge 
loans offered by third party financial institutions. The average discount rate used for the year ended 30 June 2014 was 8.0% (2013: 8.0%). A fair value
adjustment credit of £0.7m has been taken through other comprehensive income reflecting the unwinding of the discount in the year (2013: charge of 
£6.2m resulting from an increase of 0.5% to the average discount rate applied).
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices and local market conditions with an allowance for low single-digit sales price inflation.  
The Group has also used independent valuation specialists in prior years to review and assess the estimated portfolio value, which has been updated 
using house price indices.
The repayment profile used to calculate the timing of future cash flows is based on historical data for first-time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment reversal/charge of the available for sale financial assets taken through the Consolidated Income Statement relates to borrower default 
including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first charge provider and the 
impact of the change in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of these assets.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in note 24 and note 27(b)(i).
Residential property fund
During the year, the Group disposed of its 1.3m units in a residential property fund that was managed by Hearthstone Investments, which at 30 June 
2013, based on unadjusted quoted prices, had a market value of £1.3m, classified within current available for sale financial assets. No gain or loss was 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of this disposal for the year ended 30 June 2014.

It is not anticipated that any of the deferred tax liability in respect of brands will reverse in the twelve months following the balance sheet date. Whilst it is 
anticipated that an element of the remaining deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse during the twelve months following the balance sheet date, at 
present it is not possible to quantify the value of these reversals.
In addition to the above, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of £2.3m (2013: £6.0m) in respect of capital and other losses because these 
are not considered recoverable in the foreseeable future.

a) Nature of inventories
The Directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature, although the Group’s operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will 
not be realised within twelve months. It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number 
of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays. 
b) Impairment of inventories
At 30 June 2014, the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its housebuilding sites under development. 
The impairment review compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying value. During the 
year, due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross impairment charges of £26.5m (2013: £25.7m) and gross 
impairment reversals of £22.0m (2013: £22.5m) resulting in a net inventory impairment of £4.5m (2013: £3.2m) included within profit from operations for 
housebuilding sites for development. 
In addition there was a charge of £4.4m (2013: £9.1m) related to housebuilding sites not currently under development due to changes in planning status 
and the viability of these sites.
There was also a gross impairment charge of £0.4m (2013: £0.6m) and a gross impairment reversal of £0.4m (2013: £0.1m) for the commercial 
developments business, resulting in a net inventory impairment of £nil (2013: £0.5m), due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site, which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and 
estimated costs to complete. Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current 
prices being achieved upon each site for each product type. In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis 
for low single-digit sales price inflation in future periods. The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single-digit build cost 
inflation in future periods. Further information regarding these judgements is included within the Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of 
Estimation Uncertainty section on page 111.

127 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 19. Inventories (continued) 
b) Impairment of inventories (continued)
During the year, the Group has benefitted from stronger market conditions. If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations 
in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around sales prices and estimated costs to complete, further adjustments to the carrying value 
of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments, £198.6m (2013: £325.7m) of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c) Expensed inventories
The value of inventories expensed in the year ended 30 June 2014 and included in cost of sales was £2,500.7m (2013: £2,139.3m) including  
the inventory impairments. 
d) Company
The Company has no inventories.

The allowance for doubtful receivables consists of individually impaired trade receivables that are in default. The impairment recognised in cost of sales 
represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of any expected recoveries. The Group does not 
hold any collateral over these balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

On 2 July 2013, the Group cancelled $166.6m of US$ foreign exchange swaps as part of the comprehensive refinancing package agreed on 14 May 
2013. Further details are provided in note 4. 
 
Trade and other payables excludes deferred income, payments received in excess of amounts recoverable on contracts, tax and social security and other 
non-financial liabilities.
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:
• The fair values of the secured loan available for sale financial assets are calculated using an internal valuation model. The model calculates the fair  
value on a loan by loan basis using the present value of expected future cash flows of each loan. The future value of each loan is based on original 
selling prices adjusted for regional house price inflation, which in turn is based upon independent valuation specialists and official published valuation 
data. Each loan includes an allowance for future low single-digit house price inflation on the property. In addition, the Group includes an allowance  
for borrower default, including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or first  
charge provider.
• The fair value of the residential property fund available for sale financial assets are calculated using the unadjusted quoted price of units in the property 
fund obtained from independent brokers.
• Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates.
• The fair values of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are determined based on discounted cash flow analysis using current market rates 
for similar instruments.
Trade and other payables include land payables, which may bear interest on a contract specific basis, and items secured by legal charge as disclosed  
in note 21.

a) Interest rate swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks, related to interest rates, 
arising from the Group’s and Company’s sources of finance. 
The Group’s and Company’s £60.0m 2017 and £25.0m 2022 interest rate swap arrangements contain a clause that allows the Group and the Company 
or counterparty to cancel the swap in May 2015 at fair value.
As at 30 June 2014, the Group had outstanding floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £164.3m (2013: £132.4m) and the Company 
had outstanding net floating rate Sterling debt and overdrafts, excluding fees, of £156.8m (2013: £150.9m). In obtaining this funding, the Group and the 
Company sought to achieve certainty as to the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future  
debt requirements.
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap £137 .0m (2013: £137 .0m) of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance 
with the Group and Company treasury policy outlined in note 27 . After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates applicable to the 
debt were as follows:

a) Interest rate swaps (continued)
The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future interest rate movements. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 
June 2014, which is based on third party valuations, was a liability of £19.4m (2013: £27 .1m) with a gain of £7 .7m (2013: £6.9m) charged directly to equity  
in the year. 
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the Consolidated Income Statement during the year or the prior year.
Further disclosures relating to financial instruments are set out in note 27 .
b) Foreign exchange swaps 
The Group and Company enter into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks related to foreign exchange 
arising from the Group’s sources of finance denominated in US Dollars. 
As at 30 June 2014, the Group and Company had outstanding fixed rate US Dollar loan notes of $80.0m (2013: $246.6m). 
The Group and Company have entered into swap arrangements to swap all of this debt into fixed rate Sterling debt in accordance with the Group and 
Company treasury policy outlined in note 27 . After taking into account swap arrangements, the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows:

foreign exchange swaps, with effect from no later than 2 July 2013. Accordingly, on 2 July 2013, foreign exchange swaps of US$166.6m were cancelled.
The swap arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges against future foreign exchange rate movements. The hedges match the contractual initial 
receipt, the final settlement and match 100% of the interest payments. The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 30 June 2014, which is based on 
third party valuations, was a liability of £1.8m (2013: asset of £29.3m) with a loss of £7 .3m (2013: gain of £0.7m) charged directly to equity in the year.
There was no ineffectiveness to be taken through the Consolidated Income Statement during the year or the prior year. Further disclosures relating to 
financial instruments are set out in note 27 .
27 . Financial risk management
The Group’s approach to risk management and the principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 36 to 41. The Group’s financial assets, 
financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 24, 25 and 26.
The Group’s operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit 
risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the 
reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating 
actions taken by the central treasury department. These forecasts are further stress-tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate 
headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained. In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the 
adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest 
rates and currency rates. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, 
which in turn regularly reports to the Board. The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury  
Operating Committee.

137 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 27 . Financial risk management (continued)
a) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium 
term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations. The Group’s borrowings are typically 
cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May; and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income. Accordingly, 
the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements. On a normal operating basis, the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom 
of up to £150.0m. The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows 
from its operations. At 30 June 2014, the Group had committed bank and other facilities of £880.8m (2013: £1,030.5m) and total facilities of £932.0m (2013: 
£1,076.7m). The Group’s drawn debt, excluding fees, against the committed facilities was £180.8m (2013: £330.5m). This represented 20.5% (2013: 32. 1%) 
of available committed facilities at 30 June 2014. In addition, the Group had £274.7m (2013: £294.4m) of cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2014. At the date of approval of the Financial Statements, the Group’s internal 
forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future, being at least twelve months from the date of signing 
these Financial Statements.
The Group’s objective is to minimise refinancing risk. The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private 
placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years. At 30 June 2014, the average maturity of the Group’s facilities was 3.7 years 
(2013: 3.9 years).
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations. The undrawn committed facilities 
available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows:

b) Market risk (price risk)
i) UK housing market risk
This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group Balance Sheet. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK 
house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage 
availability and competitor pricing. However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate 
product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions. The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks, 
which include:
• a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash  
flow projections;
• the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order  
that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision; and
• collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these 
Financial Statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and intangible assets.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities, which are directly linked to the UK housing market, are as follows:

The value of the Group’s available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market. At 30 June 2014, these assets were carried at a fair 
value of £122.4m (2013: £128.4m). Further information is set out in note 17 .
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis
At 30 June 2014, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked financial assets and 
liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £2.7m (2013: £8.4m) with a corresponding 
reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities. Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and 
fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long term fixed rate funding and medium term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate 
flexibility for the Group’s operational requirements. The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate 
movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.
The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy and the Group’s interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt 
instruments. The Group’s policy is for 0-40% of average borrowings over the 3 year plan period to be at fixed rates of interest. Due to the seasonality of the 
Group’s funding requirements, 87 .2% (2013: 65.3%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were fixed as at 30 June 2014 and the average over the 3 year plan 
period was 39%. Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.

Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to the UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates. The floating rates are fixed in advance for 
periods generally ranging from one to six months. Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank 
facilities. The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2014 was 3.4% (2013: 3.6%).
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of £46.1m (2013: £133.5m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate 
swaps, for 2014 was 8.2% (2013: 10.2%) with, at 30 June 2014, a weighted average period of 3.2 years (2013: 1.5 years) for which the rate is fixed.
On 14 May 2013, the Group completed a comprehensive refinancing package and irrevocably committed to prepay the £65.8m Sterling private placement 
notes and US$166.6m private placement notes and cancel the associated foreign exchange swaps, with effect from no later than 2 July 2013. 
Accordingly, on 2 July 2013 the Sterling private placement notes of £65.8m and US$166.6m private placement notes were prepaid and foreign exchange 
swaps of US$166.6m were cancelled.
In the year ending 30 June 2013, Sterling private placement notes of £65.8m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value 
interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes was 12.0% with, at 30 June 2013, a weighted average 
period of zero years for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2014, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower, as this is a reasonably possible change, and all other variables 
were held constant, the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £0.7m (2013: £0.6m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by 
£0.5m (2013: £0.5m) and the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £0.5m (2013: £0.5m).

iii) Foreign exchange rate risk
As at 30 June 2014, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $80.0m (2013: $246.6m). In order to mitigate risks 
associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and  
a significant proportion of the interest payments. The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar 
denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges, which fully hedge the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and the US Dollar 
interest payments.
On 14 May 2013, the Group completed a comprehensive refinancing package and irrevocably committed to prepay US$166.6m of private placement 
notes and cancel the associated foreign exchange swaps, with effect from no later than 2 July 2013. Accordingly, on 2 July 2013 foreign exchange swaps 
of US$166.6m were cancelled.
Details of the Group’s foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 26.
Sensitivity analysis
In the year ended 30 June 2014, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s pre-tax profit would decrease/increase by £nil (2013: £0.4m), the Group’s post-tax profit would decrease/increase by £nil (2013: £0.3m) and 
the Group’s equity would decrease/increase by £nil (2013: £0.3m).
c) Credit risk
In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Providers 
for affordable housing. The Group has £122.4m (2013: £128.4m) of available for sale financial assets, which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is 
spread over a large number of properties. In addition, the Group and Company have an investment of £25.6m (2013: £25.8m) in a joint venture that holds 
available for sale financial assets, which exposes the joint venture to credit risk, although this is spread over a large number of properties. Included within 
trade and other receivables £41.4m (2013: £10.6m) is due from the Homes and Communities Agency in respect of the Help to Buy scheme. Since this 
receivable is due from a UK Government agency, the Group considers that this receivable has an insignificant risk of default. Other than this, neither the 
Group nor the Company have a significant concentration of credit risk, as their exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways:
• The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings, as set by international credit rating agencies, and has  
a policy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty. 
• The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.  
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Group’s credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2014 was £71.8m (2013: £76.9m) of cash on deposit with a financial institution. The carrying 
amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk. 
As at 30 June 2014, the Company was exposed to £810.2m (2013: £969.6m) of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial 
guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings. The Company was also exposed to credit risk through its joint 
venture as explained above. Further details are provided in notes 35 and 36.
d) Capital risk management (cash flow risk)
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders  
and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, its bank borrowings (being overdrafts, loan  
notes and bank loans) and its private placement notes, as set out in note 25. 
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Group’s earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices. UK 
house prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage 
availability and competitor pricing. The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 36 to 41.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short term and long term capital structure include: adjusting the level of dividends and 
special cash payments paid to shareholders (assuming the Company is paying a dividend or a special cash payment); issuing new share capital; arranging 
debt to meet liability payments; and selling assets to reduce debt.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
a) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees, under which it pays contributions to an independently 
administered fund. Contributions are based upon a fixed percentage of the employee’s pay and once these have been paid, the Group has no further 
obligations under these schemes.

Contributions during the year
Group defined contribution schemes Consolidated Income Statement charge 7.8 7.0
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £0.8m (2013: £0.7m), which were paid on or before the due date.
b) Defined benefit scheme 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), which 
with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions. Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in 
place for current employees.
The Scheme provides benefits to members based on their length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement or date of ceasing 
active accrual if earlier. The Group operates the Scheme under the UK regulatory framework, with a legally separate fund that is Trustee-administered.  
The Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the Scheme is sufficiently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and for the investment policy 
with regard to scheme assets. 
The Trustees must agree a funding plan with the Group such that any funding shortfall is expected to be met by additional contributions and investment 
performance. In order to assess the level of contributions, triennial valuations are carried out using prudent assumptions.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2013. The results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 
2014 by a qualified independent actuary. The Group has agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme to make contributions to the Scheme of £13.3m per 
annum until 30 November 2015 and then £9.5m per annum until 31 December 2016 to address the Scheme’s actuarial deficit. The Group also continues 
to meet the Scheme’s administration expenses, death in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy. 
At the balance sheet date, there were outstanding contributions of £1.1m (2013: £1.1m).
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant being:
Risk Description
Volatile asset returns The defined benefit obligation (‘DBO’) is calculated using a discount rate set with reference to high quality corporate bond yields. 
If assets underperform this discount rate, this will create a plan deficit. The Scheme holds a significant proportion of its assets in 
equities and other growth assets which are expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term. However, returns are 
likely to be volatile in the short term, potentially resulting in short term cash requirements and an increase in the defined benefit 
obligation recorded on the Balance Sheet. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given 
the Scheme’s long term objectives.
Changes in bond yields A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the funding and accounting liabilities, although this will be partially offset by  
an increase in the value of the Scheme’s investments in corporate and government bonds. 
Inflation risk A significant proportion of the DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, with higher inflation leading to higher liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the Scheme’s obligations are to provide a pension for the life of each of the members, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
For the purposes of calculating the accounting costs and obligations of the Scheme, the assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair 
(bid) value. The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions:
Principal actuarial assumptions 2014 2013
Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations
Discount rate 4.30% 4.70%
Rate of price inflation 3.30% 3.40%
Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost
Discount rate 4.70% 4.80%
Rate of price inflation 3.40% 2.90%
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
143 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 28. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)
b) Defined benefit scheme (continued) 
Members are assumed to exchange 19% of their pension for cash on retirement. The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from 
Mercer Limited, the Group’s actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the 
Scheme liabilities:
Assumptions Male Female 
Retired member born in 1949 (life expectancy at age 65) 23.6 years 26.0 years
Non-retired member born in 1969 (life expectancy at age 65) 25.4 years 28.0 years
The Trustees carried out an actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2013. As part of this valuation a postcode analysis was carried out and 
the Trustees updated their mortality assumptions to reflect the results of this analysis. The Group has reflected this analysis for the 30 June 2014 year end 
which has led to a decrease in life expectancies for the Scheme.
The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables with an adjustment to allow for the Scheme members being 1.5 years younger 
than the population of the S1NA mortality tables. Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the CMI 2013 projections with a long 
term trend of 1.25% (2013: 1.25%).

a) Details of the share-based payment schemes
i) Long Term Performance Plan
The Long Term Performance Plan (the ‘LTPP’) was initially approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect 
from 1 July 2003. The ten year limit on powers to grant any awards under the LTPP expired on 12 November 2013 and a resolution seeking: (i) the 
approval of shareholders to extend the LTPP for a further ten years to 12 November 2023; and; (ii) the adoption of the updated rules of the LTPP , was 
proposed to, and passed by, shareholders at the 2012 Annual General Meeting. During the financial year ended 30 June 2014, 2,407 ,303 (2013: 4,620,159) 
awards were granted under the LTPP . Awards under the LTPP are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), taking into account 
individual performance and overall performance of the Group. An employee is not eligible to receive options under the Executive Share Option Scheme 
and awards under the LTPP in the same financial year. Information on the performance conditions for the LTPP awards to be granted during the 2014/15 
financial year and each of the outstanding LTPP awards, can be found on pages 66 to 69 and page 85.

a) Details of the share-based payment schemes (continued)
ii) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (‘SRSOS’). Under the SRSOS, participants are required to make 
monthly contributions to a HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) approved savings contract with a bank or building society for a period of three or five 
years. On entering into the savings contract, participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price determined 
under the rules of the SRSOS. The SRSOS is open to all eligible employees as determined by the Board and is not subject to the satisfaction of any 
performance conditions.
iii) Executive Share Option Scheme
In November 2008, the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’). The grant of share options under the ESOS is at the discretion 
of the Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group. Options must be held for a minimum of three years 
from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of options granted under 
the ESOS is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee, which for options granted in 2009/10 was based upon 
total shareholder return and earnings per share performance conditions. The performance conditions for the ESOS granted in December 2009 (the 
‘2009/10 ESOS’), were tested after the financial year ended 30 June 2012 and accordingly, 32.8% of the 2009/10 ESOS vested on 10 December 2012. 
Participants have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their options.
iv) Senior Management Share Option Plan
In December 2009, the Company adopted the Senior Management Share Option Plan 2009-2012 (the ‘SMSOP’). The Board approved the grant of share 
options to employees under the SMSOP , which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, provided the employee 
remains employed by the Group. Individuals who participate in the SMSOP are not eligible to participate in the LTPP or ESOS; therefore Executive 
Directors do not participate in the SMSOP . There is currently no intention to make any further grants under the SMSOP . The options granted under the 
SMSOP in December 2009 (the ‘2009/10 SMSOP’), were subject to a ‘continued employment’ performance condition. The 2009/10 SMSOP vested on 
10 December 2012 and participants have until 9 December 2019 to exercise their options.
v) Executive Share Option Plan
In November 1997 , the Company adopted the Executive Share Option Plan (the ‘ESOP’). Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date 
of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of options granted under the ESOP is 
subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Committee. The ten year limit to grant options under the ESOP expired in 
November 2007 . No further grants will therefore be made under the ESOP . The outstanding unexercised options granted under the ESOP in October 
2003 lapsed in October 2013. There are no outstanding awards under the ESOP . 
vi) Employee Share Option Plan
In November 1999, the Company adopted an Employee Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Plan’). The Board approved the grant of share options to 
employees under this Employee Plan, which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant. The exercise of the options 
granted under the Employee Plan was subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board. Those who have participated  
in the ESOP do not participate in the Employee Plan. The authority to grant options under the Employee Plan expired on 10 April 2010 (ten years from  
the date of the first grant under the Employee Plan); no further options will therefore be granted under the Employee Plan. The outstanding unexercised 
options granted under the Employee Plan on 14 May 2004 lapsed in May 2014 and there are no outstanding awards under the Employee Plan.
vii) Co-Investment Plan
The Co-Investment Plan (the ‘Plan’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2005 and is currently utilised to hold 
shares awarded in respect of any bonus earned in excess of 100% of base salary. The Committee has the discretion to award matching shares against 
the deferred shares; however, no matching shares have been awarded to date. The Executive Directors also have the opportunity to voluntarily defer 
additional amounts of annual bonus up to a maximum of 25% of basic salary into the Plan. Further details are on page 66.
viii) Senior Management Incentive Scheme
In October 2012, the Board adopted the Barratt Developments Senior Management Incentive Scheme (the ‘SMIS’). Awards under the SMIS are at the 
discretion of the Group Chief Executive (or in his absence, the Chairman of the Board). Any awards under the SMIS must be held for a minimum of three 
years from the date of grant. Executive Directors and those individuals directly below this level are not eligible to participate in the SMIS. Any award granted 
under the SMIS is subject to performance conditions as set for the LTPP granted in the same financial year. Further details are on page 66.

for all schemes outstanding at the end of the year was 2.0 years (2013: 2.3 years).
d) Consolidated Income Statement charge
A charge to the Consolidated Income Statement has been made for the awards issued on or after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 1 January 2005 
in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’. 
i) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2014 was 102.6p (2013: 111.8p) per award. The awards have been valued using  
a Black-Scholes model.
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes model were as follows:
Grants 
2014 
Grants 
2013
Average share price 370p 274p
Average exercise price 349p 205p
Expected volatility 38.0% 46.6%
Expected life 3.3 years 3.7 years
Risk free interest rate 1.20% 0.44%
Expected dividends 3.30% 1.50%
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the 
options. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on the Directors’ best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
ii) Long Term Performance Plan
The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2014 was 327 .5p (2013: 160.6p). 
The awards have been valued using a Black-Scholes model for the earnings per share element of the scheme and a Monte Carlo model for the total 
shareholder return element of the scheme. 
The weighted average inputs to the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models were as follows:
Grants 
2014

31. Reserves
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of deferred fair value gains or losses on derivative financial instruments that have been 
designated as cash flow hedges by the Company, where the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur.
Transfers to the hedging reserve in the period equate to losses of £5.4m (2013: £1.9m). This loss comprises gains of £1.9m (2013: £2.6m loss) relating  
to interest rate swaps and losses of £7 .3m (2013: £0.7m gain) on foreign exchange swaps.
Transfers from the hedging reserve to the Consolidated Income Statement for the period are gains of £11.7m (2013: £6.7m). Transfers arose from 
continuing cash flow hedges of interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks where the hedged risk impacted profit or loss in the year. Of these gains, 
£5.8m (2013: £9.5m) related to hedged interest cash flows and £5.9m (2013: £2.8m loss) related to hedged foreign currency cash flows.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the non-statutory premium arising on shares issued as consideration for the acquisition of subsidiaries where merger relief 
under Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 applies.
Own shares reserve
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in Barratt Developments PLC purchased in the market and held by the EBT on behalf of the 
Company in order to satisfy options and awards under the Company’s incentive schemes. 
Share-based payments reserve
The share-based payments reserve represents the obligation of the Group in relation to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
Parent Company Income Statement
In accordance with the provisions of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been presented. 
The Company’s profit for the year was £165.4m (2013: £950.4m (restated (note 3))).

Strategic Report Directors’ Report Other Information Financial Statements
155 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 36. Related party transactions (continued)
e) Property purchase by a Director of Barratt Developments PLC
The Board and certain members of senior management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’ (‘IAS 24’) 
and the Board are related parties within the definition of Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules (‘Chapter 11’). There is no difference between transactions  
with key personnel of the Company and transactions with key personnel of the Group.
During the year, the Group entered into the following transaction which, for the purposes of IAS 24 is considered to be a ‘related party transaction’.
In August 2014, Mark Clare, Group Chief Executive, reserved an apartment (including a car parking space) from Fulham Wharf LLP , a joint venture 
partnership between BDW Trading Limited (the Company’s main trading subsidiary) and London and Quadrant Housing Trust (L&Q), at a purchase price 
of £1,692,350.  This purchase was conducted at a fair and reasonable market price based on four independent market valuations and similar comparable 
transactions at that time. An amount of £2,500 was paid on reservation. As at 9 September 2014, contracts had not been exchanged between the parties. 
A deposit will be payable on exchange of contracts and the remaining balance will become payable on legal completion, in accordance with the Group’s 
normal terms of trading.
In respect of the transaction between the son of Mark Clare and Alie Street LLP (another joint venture partnership between BDW and L&Q), which was 
disclosed in last year’s report, legal completion occurred on 20 February 2014 and any outstanding balances on that date were paid in full. Accordingly, 
there are no outstanding balances in respect of this transaction as at 30 June 2014.
Fulham Wharf LLP and Alie Street LLP are not controlled by and are not ‘subsidiary undertakings’ of the Company.
On notification by Mark Clare of the above transactions, the Board sought advice from its legal advisers and corporate brokers in respect of the application 
of Chapter 11 and Section 190 did not extend to LLPs and therefore the provisions of Chapter 11 and Section 190 did not apply to either of these 
transactions. Consequently, no shareholder approval was required for the transactions.
f) Property purchases by Directors of BDW Trading Limited
The Board and certain members of senior management are related parties within the definition of IAS 24 (Revised) ‘Related Party Disclosures’  
and Chapter 11 of the UK Listing Rules. There is no difference between transactions with key personnel of the Company and the Group.
There have been no ‘smaller related party transactions’ as defined in Listing Rule 11.1.10R for the year ending 30 June 2014.

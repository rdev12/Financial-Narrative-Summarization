Group Performance
ITE has again delivered record nancial 
results, despite 2012 eing the lesser 
 ear in its iennial pattern. Revenues 
o £172.3 million (2011: £155.5 million) 
have ielded headline pro ts e ore

and headline diluted earnings per share

pro t was £40.5 million (2011: £39.1 
million) and ull diluted earnings 
per share were 12.8p (2011: 12.6p). The 
Group nished the ear with positive 
net cash o £13.0 million (2011: £5.5 
million), a ter spending £19.5 million 
in the ear on ac uisitions and 
de erred consideration.
This ear has largel een one o 
internal consolidation ollowing the 
large ac uisitions made in 2011 as 
well as la ing the groundwor or the 
e pansion o its usiness into the Asian 
mar et. The Group has re uilt its cash 
position and ocused on integrating the 
new usinesses into ITE s structure. 
This process is alread re ected in 
the cost ase although most o the 
revenue ene ts will onl e realised in 
the uture. The Group has made some 
small olt on ac uisitions in the ear. 
Two event port olios have enhanced 
the usiness in U raine and two smaller 
regional ac uisitions have added scope 
to our usiness in India. The Group has 
announced toda the ac uisition o 
a minorit sta e in Asian Business 
E hi ition and Con erences ( ABEC ), 
the leading independent organiser 
in India. 
Board and Management
On 1 Fe ruar I oined the ITE Board, 
having alread een a Non e ecutive 
Director o ITE rom 2004 06. On 23 
March Iain Paterson stepped down 
 rom the Board a ter ten ears as 
Chairman, during which time he 
oversaw a period o su stantial growth 
in the si e o the Group s usiness, its 
revenues and its pro ts. On ehal o 
the Board, I would li e to ac nowledge 
the signi cant contri ution Iain made 
to the development o ITE during his 
tenure as Chairman. There have een 
no other changes to the composition 
o the Board during the ear. 
The Board has ta en positive steps this 
 ear to strengthen urther the e ecutive 
and senior management team in line 
with the growth o its usiness. ITE 
continues to prosper ecause o the 
e orts o its sta worldwide and I 
would again, on ehal o the Board li e 
to e press our than s and appreciation 
to all the emplo ees o ITE throughout 
our 28 o ces or their signi cant 
contri ution to another success ul ear. 
ITE s Board recognises that good 
corporate governance is in the 
long term interests o the Group and 
we are conscious o our responsi ilities 
 or setting values which underpin the 
Group culture. As Chairman, I am 
mind ul o m personal responsi ilit 
 or leading the Board and ensuring 
it operates e ectivel . The Board 
e ectiveness review carried out during 
the ear con rmed the Board and its 
committees continue to wor to 
achieve the desired results, and the 
insights gained rom this process have 
 een uilt into a clear action plan or 
the ear ahead. 
Dividend
The Board has a good record o 
maintaining a progressive dividend 
polic and this ear the interim 
dividend was increased rom 1.9p 
to 2.1p. The proposed nal dividend is 
4.4p, ma ing a ull dividend or the ear 
o 6.5p (2011: 6.1p), an increase o 7%. 
The nal dividend is proposed to e 
paid on 11 Fe ruar 2013.
Outlook
This ear, the Group has ene ted rom 
good trading conditions in most o its 
mar ets. These good results were o set 
 increased competitive activit in our 
largest mar et, Moscow. The e ects o 
this new competition have now een 
a sor ed into our results and the 
trading conditions in our principal 
mar ets continue to e uo ant. At 
30 Novem er revenues oo ed or the 
2013 nancial ear are £95 million, in 
line with the Board s e pectations and 
representing circa 53% o mar et 
e pectations or 2013 revenues. On a 
li e or li e asis revenues are circa 4% 
ahead o last ear, despite movements 
in e change rates (principall in Euro to 
Sterling) which have reduced average 
Sterling ields  circa 4% against this 
time last ear.
The Group s port olio o events 
are per orming well and operating 
in mar ets where growth prospects 
are good. Strong cash ow and an 
ungeared alance sheet places the 
Group in an e cellent position to 
continue with its strateg o growing 
its usiness oth organicall and 
through selective ac uisitions. The 
Board is ocused on the e ecution o

The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good nancial 
per ormance in its lesser iennial 
 ear which re ects a good trading 
per ormance in most o its mar ets 
together with a rst time contri ution 
 rom ac uisitions, ut o set  an 
increase in the cost ase o Mos uild 
which relocated to a new venue and 
 aced a new competitive threat. ITE 
has made a num er o smaller olt on 
ac uisitions in the ear in U raine 
and India, ut the main ocus o 
management has een to integrate 
properl and consolidate the large 
ac uisitions which the Group made 
during 2011. 
Revenues or the ear o £172 million 
represent an 11% increase over last 
 ear, and volume sales o 799,000m
2
 
represent growth o 24% over last ear. 
These results re ect growth in the core 
port olio and recent ac uisitions. On a 
li e or li e asis revenue growth o 3% 
was earned on volume sales growth o 
2%. Trading conditions in most o our 
mar ets were consistentl strong and 
most o our mar ets delivered revenue 
growth gures o more than 10%, 
although Moscow and the U were 
e ceptions to this. 
The ma or impact on our results 
this ear came rom ITE s premiere 
construction event Mos uild which 
represents one third o our e hi ition 
 usiness in Moscow. Following a 
decision  its host venue to launch 
its own competitive event in the 
construction sector, ITE had in 2011 
made the decision to relocate Mos uild 
to another venue which o ered more 
secure terms or its uture. The results 
this ear re ect the nancial impact 
o this upheaval ut also underpin the 
strength and resilience o this event. 
Mos uild in underl ing terms sta ed 
 roadl the same si e  despite acing 
the dual challenges o relocation and 
new competition. E hi ition sales 
achieved were 66,000m
2
 compared 
to 77,600m
2
 in 2011, the change mostl 
re ecting a iennial pattern within 
one o its sectors. However the cost 
 ase o the show increased  circa 
£3 million in the new venue, which in 
addition to the iennial e ect on the 
revenues negativel a ected ITE s 
2012 pro ts  circa £4.5 million. 
This one o step up in costs has now 
 een a sor ed and sales or the 2013 
event are, to date, progressing in line 
with e pectations. 
E cluding Mos uild, the li e or li e 
revenues rom the Russian e hi ition 
 usiness grew  4% this ear. Trading 
conditions in the Central Asia mar ets 
were strong and supported a 21% 
improvement in li e or li e revenues. 
In Southern and Eastern Europe, good 
trading conditions helped the region to 
deliver 6% li e or li e revenue growth, 
which together with a strong rst time 
contri ution rom Tur e uild and the 
new U rainian ac uisitions helped the 
region to its est ever result. Our U 
 usiness MODA also had a good ear 
with growth rom its minorit sta es in 
niche ashion usinesses and a solid 
per ormance rom its mainstream 
 ashion event. 
The main actors a ecting Group 
pro ta ilit this ear are summarised 
in the pro t ridge opposite.
Development of the business
ITE has ocused this ear on properl 
integrating the new usinesses it 
ac uired last ear, as well as la ing the 
groundwor or developing a usiness 
plat orm in Asia. Two o the larger 
ac uisitions in 2011 were in Russia 
(MV and rasnodar). The rasnodar 
 usiness made a ull ear contri ution 
with revenues o £8.4 million and a 
pro t contri ution o £2.4 million, oth 
 etter than our e pectations at time 
o ac uisition. The MV usiness in 
Moscow per ormed well in delivering 
revenues this ear o £14.8 million and 
a contri ution o £5.2 million, despite 
the competitive environment and the 
relocation o some o its events. 
Tur e uild, also ac uired last ear, 
made its rst contri ution to ITE s 
results and delivered its est ever 
result with revenues o £7.3 million 
and a contri ution o £3.2 million.
The Russian management team has 
 een consolidated into a regional 
management structure. The nancial 
and operating s stems o the our 
 usinesses are now managed on a 
common plat orm and the various 
show identities and rands are eing 
com ined. e have identi ed a num er 
o good opportunities to cross launch 
events rom one region to another and 
to cross sell etween events. Li ewise 
in Tur e there has een a change in 
management structure to a sor the 
newl ac uired Tur e uild. 
 e made some small complementar 
ac uisitions this ear which have helped 
to uild the pro le o ITE s usiness in 
U raine, India and the U . In Decem er 
2011 ITE completed the ac uisition o 
the Autoe po port olio o events in 
U raine, which rought a num er o 
complementar events (winter tourism, 
logistics) into the port olio, ut whose 
principal asset is the dominant motor 
show ta ing place in U raine. Later in 
the ear we ac uired two events in the 
 eaut sector (Beaute ), which is a 
new sector or ITE, ut o considera le 
growth potential in other regions where 
ITE operates. In India we made two 
small ac uisitions in the ear  one a 
port olio o engineering events ased in 
Mum ai and one o construction related 
events in Chennai. India s e hi ition 
 usiness is currentl regional with no 
single large e hi ition acilit , and the 
route to e pansion is through regional 
cloning. Having a regional capa ilit 
now provides the Group with a plat orm 
 or running events in Mum ai and 
Chennai. In the U , MODA increased 
the scope o its London ased ashion 
 usiness through the ac uisition o 
 ac et Re uired , a ast growing niche 
menswear event.
ITE s priorit in Russia and CIS over 
the ne t ear is to continue the organic 
growth initiatives started this ear. 
The Group will also continue to loo or 
opportunities to e pand the usiness 
model, oth in mar et and  uilding 
a coherent e hi ition usiness in Asia. Business Review

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW CONTINUED 
Having done much o the groundwor 
this ear we are well positioned to 
ma e good progress ne t ear. 
Announced toda was the ac uisition 
o a 28.3% minorit sta e in ABEC, the 
largest independent organiser in India. 
ITE plans to co operate with this new 
partner and ecome a ma orit owner 
within the ne t three ears. One o the 
e citing aspects o this partnership is 
that ITE now has ownership o the 
premier construction events in Russia, 
Tur e and India, three o the astest 
growing emerging mar ets.
The international exhibition business
The glo al e hi ition mar et was 
estimated to e worth circa 25 illion 
in 2011. The ollowing ta le sets out the 
distri ution o the world s e hi ition 
 usiness and shows that almost hal 
 value is in the USA, and circa 
three uarters is in developed mar ets. 
There is a road correlation etween 
the amount o e hi ition space in a 
countr and the si e o a countr s 
e hi ition industr . 
The emerging and developing mar et 
e hi ition usiness is small when 
compared to the developed world,

competitive advantage over other 
international organisers and a arrier 
to entr or new organisers wishing

o ce presence through investment 
in in rastructure and training its 
sta . There is a high level o e uit 
ownership in the Group with more 
than 51% o sta participating in 
e uit schemes o some description. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has esta lished long standing 
relationships with the venues that 
host its e hi itions. Historicall ITE has 
supported the development o venue 
 acilities which in turn has helped the 
Group s e hi itions to prosper. Through 
this ITE has esta lished rights to run its 
main e hi ition themes in its chosen 
venues at the time o its choice. ITE has 
continued to wor on maintaining and 
improving the venue relationships that 
underpin its usiness. Most o ITE s 
ma or events have agreements which 
provide or venue acilities or at least 
three ears ahead. This ear ITE has 
agreed outline terms or holding its 
shows in the new St Peters urg venue, 
which is due to e completed  2014. 
(ii) To expand the business model 
into new sectors and geographies 
where there is potential to develop 
strong market positions.
In e isting mar ets this strateg 
means targeting new sectors or 
regions in which to ac uire or develop 
 usinesses where there is potential 
 or the participation o international 
e hi itors. In new mar ets, ITE is 
targeting the development o 
e hi ition usinesses where there 
is clear opportunit or strong 
 uture growth. 
This ear the Group has e panded 
the industr sectors in its U rainian 
 usiness. Through its ac uisitions o 
Autoe po and Beaute the U rainian 
 usiness has gained e posure to the 
automotive and eaut cosmetics 
sectors. The eaut sector is new to 
ITE, and one we hope to e a le to 
replicate into other mar ets in the near 
 uture. The Group aims to increase 
its involvement in a roader range o 
sectors in India, and made two small 
ac uisitions this ear, one in the 
industrial machiner sector and 
one in the construction sector. 
(iii) To grow and improve its portfolio 
of international brands. 
The Group s management has een 
wor ing to improve the strength o 
ITE s e isting international rands and 
to improve international recognition o 
its local rands. As part o this, some 
industr vertical groupings have een 
esta lished to ensure consistenc o 
presentation and message across the 
Group. Developing the international 
recognition and strength o its rands 
improves the Group s a ilit to 
success ull clone its events into 
new geographies. 
(iv) To invest in the development 
of management talent in ITE.
The Group emplo s a management 
structure that encourages creativit , 
promotes responsi ilit and acilitates 
the change that is re uired to maintain 
and strengthen ITE s position as a 
mar et leader. This structure relies on 
e perienced and s illed managers who 
are either nurtured through the ITE 
s stem or recruited or their a ilit to 
contri ute towards the development 
o the usiness.
Over two decades, ITE has uilt a 
reputation or producing e ective 
and respected trade events in growing 
and developing mar ets. This has een 
achieved  setting standards that 
e ceed customer e pectations as 
well as the standards delivered  
rival organisers.
As competition naturall intensi es and 
e pectations grow, ITE has to meet the 
challenge o constant improvement. 
The Compan recognises that this 
doesn t happen  chance  it happens 
 ecause o the s ills, ualities and 
commitment o the Group s sta .
 e have made some good progress in 
developing the strength and depth o 
the management team in the ear as 
well as improving the communication 
 etween the di erent o ces. e have 
 urther developed our Group intranet as

FINANCE DIRECTOR’S
STATEMENT CONTINUED 
At 30 Septem er 2012, the Group had 
entered into orward contracts to sell 
Euros or Sterling etween Octo er 
2012 and Septem er 2015. The value 
o the contracts is 102.2 million at 
an average rate o 1.18:£1. These 
contracts are designated as 
hedging instruments.
The Group nances its operations 
through cash holdings and an ing 
 acilities. The o ective o the Group is 
to ma imise investment income and 
minimise interest costs, earing in 
mind its li uidit re uirements. 
During the ear the Group entered 
into currenc orrowing arrangements 
to minimise its e posure to oreign 
e change ris on trade receiva les. 
At 30 Septem er 2012 the Group had 
 orrowings o £13.3 million and US 3.3 
million through an overdra t acilit 
and 16.7 million through a term acilit 
with Barcla s Ban . 
Group borrowing facilities
The Group has long term orrowing 
 acilities provided  Barcla s Ban . 
The arrangements, which were 
e tended a ter the ear end, e tend 
until 30 une 2015 and consist o term 
and overdra t acilities totalling 
£30 million. 
For short term de t, such as overdra t 
 acilities or de t with a term o less 
than twelve months, ed or oating 
rates o interest are used. For de t 
with a term o greater than 12 months, 
when the orrowing is not covered  
e isting cash holdings, it is polic that 
at least 50% must have ed rates o 
interest so as to minimise the Group s 
e posure to interest rate movements. 
It is Group polic that its cash alances 
are not invested in instruments that 
would put the capital value at ris . 
All invested unds have a determina le 
rate o interest.
Liquidity risk
The Group polic is to ensure 
continuit o unding or operational 
needs through cash deposits and de t 
 acilities as appropriate. The e 
re uirement or the usiness is to 
maintain e i ilit to allow the Group 
to ta e advantage o opportunities that 
could arise over the short term. The 
needs o the usiness are determined 
on a rolling cash ow orecast asis, 
covering wee l , monthl and twelve 
monthl re uirements. Short term 
 e i ilit is maintained  holding cash 
in current accounts and high li uidit 
mone mar et unds. The Group has 
overdra t acilities in place oth to 
permit currenc orrowing as part o 
its oreign e change management and 
to allow e i ilit in where it holds its 
cash alances.
The Group is conscious o the ris s 
associated with holding deposits in 
 oreign domiciled an s. The territories 
in which ITE operates do not all have 
internationall recognised an s and 
the Group has relationships with a 
num er o domestic an s. The Group 
see s to use the territories leading 
 an s and to minimise the level o cash 
held in such an s. O the Group s total 
cash alance o £41.7 million as at 
30 Septem er 2012, 61% was held in 
institutions with a rating o grade A 
or a ove and 29% in B to BBB+.

RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES
Risks and Uncertainties
The Group identi es and monitors the e ris s and uncertainties a ecting the Group and runs the usiness in a wa that 
minimises the impact o such ris s where possi le.
Operational risks Potential impact Mitigation
Political uncertainty 
and regulatory risk
The Group s usiness is principall 
carried out in Russia, the CIS and 
Tur e . Changes in law or the 
regulator environment could 
have an e ect on some or all o 
the e hi itions o the Group. 
ITE has reduced the ris  esta lishing its usiness as 
independent Russian, CIS and Tur ish companies ull 
contri uting to the local econom , and the diversit o 
 usinesses across sectors and geograph provides protection 
 or the longer term prospects o the Group.
Economic instability 
reduces demand for 
exhibition space
Reduced demand or e hi ition 
space would reduce the pro ts 
o e hi itions.
ITE operates across a wide range o sectors and countries to 
minimise the e posure to an single mar et. ITE, through its 
relationships with venues and sta has a relativel e i le cost 
structure, allowing it to manage its event margins in the short 
and medium term. This was clearl evidenced during the 
compan s per ormance during the recent recession.
Commercial 
relationships
The Group has e commercial 
relationships with venues which 
secure the Group s rights to run its 
e hi itions in the uture.
These e relationships are regularl reviewed and the Group 
see s to maintain its e hi ition rights or up to least three 
 ears orward or signi cant e hi itions where possi le.
Venue availability Damage to or unavaila ilit o a 
particular venue could impact the 
Group s short term trading 
position. 
The Group carries usiness interruption insurance policies 
which protect pro ts on its largest events covering annual 
revenue o circa £120 million against such an event in the short 
term. In the longer term the Group see s to maintain good 
relationships with its principal venues to ensure the 
continuance o availa ilit .
Competitor risk Competition has e isted in ITE s 
mar ets or some ears. ITE aces 
competitive pressures on a 
mar et mar et asis.
In all o its overseas mar ets, ITE has a strong position as an 
international organiser, achieved through e ective use o its 
international sales networ and its esta lished rands or 
ma or events. A single e hi ition or sector in a mar et could 
have its prospects curtailed  a strong competitor launch 
however, the readth o ITE s port olio o events, with its 
geographic and sector diversit , reduce the ris o a 
competitive threat to the Group s overall usiness.
People ITE s emplo ees have long standing relationships with 
customers and a uni ue 
 nowledge o the e hi itions 
 usiness. Loss o e sta could 
impact the short term prospects 
o a speci c event or sector.
ITE has sought to uild lo alt in its sta  ensuring 
remuneration is competitive and through a wide distri ution 
o the Group s long term incentive plans. ITE has a good 
record o retaining its e sta through oth growth and 
recessionar times.
Financial risk – 
foreign currency risk 
The Group is e posed to 
movements in oreign e change 
rates against Sterling or oth

translation o overseas operations. 
The principal e posure is to the 
Euro and the Ru le which orm

Environment
As a media services compan , the

Compan is aware that this is an area 
o increasing concern to emplo ees,

The Compan does not manu acture

e (2011: 306 tonnes) which 
e uated to 2.4 tonnes o CO
2
e per

the Group considers and, where 
possi le, uses controlled source 
material with rec cled content.
 – The Group encourages sta to use 
pu lic transport through o ering 
season tic et loans or London sta .
 – The Group is ta ing advantage o 
recent e communications legislation

1 Headline diluted earnings per share is calculated using pro t before amortisation of ac uired intangibles, impairment of goodwill, pro ts or losses 
on disposal of Group undertakings, revaluation of nancial liabilities in relation to minority put options and direct costs relating to completed 
acquisitions and disposals.
For the Long-term PSP awards granted in June/August 2009 that are e ercisable from 31 December 2013 to 30 December 
2019, there are two performance targets applying. Half of the Award is sub ect to a Performance Target based on the 
Group s absolute earnings per share during the 2012/13 Financial ear as follows:
EPS for the 2012/2013 Financial ear Percentage of one half of award that vests
Below 14p Nil
14p 25%
Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight line basis.
17p or more 100%
The other half of the Award is sub ect to a Performance Target comparing the Company s Total Shareholder Return against 
the FTSE All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 2013. 25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE 
is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile performance. Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a 
straight line basis between 25% and 100% based on rankings plus interpolation between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the pro t and loss account for the year ending 30 September 2012 was £2.1 million 
(2011: £1.7 million). 
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit. This provision takes account of all potentially 
dilutive awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans. This is because (as with other London Stock E change 
companies) the Company does not operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an 
internal dilution limit of 5% in ten years for discretionary schemes. The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, 
which has been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a 
dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary/e ecutive schemes only. However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact 
of the share incentive schemes under regular view to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The ma imum number of additional (i.e. in addition to the e isting 4,436,160 in issue) new share issues possible under the 
ten year dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 20,450,180. Additionally the Employee s Share Trust ( ESOT ) can hold up 
to 5% of the Company s issued share capital against share awards.

the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the 
related notes 1 to 28. The nancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest e tent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As e plained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
group nancial statements and for being satis ed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and e press 
an opinion on the group nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(U and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the nancial statements suf cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the nancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed the reasonableness of signi cant accounting estimates made by the 
directors and the overall presentation of the nancial statements. In addition, we read all the nancial and non- nancial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited nancial statements. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on nancial statements
In our opinion the group nancial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the group s affairs as at 30 September 2012 and of its pro t for the year then ended – have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As e plained in the notes to the group nancial statements, the group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to 
apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group nancial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors Report for the nancial year for which the group nancial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group nancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – certain disclosures of directors remuneration speci ed by law are not made or
 – we have not received all the information and e planations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the directors statement, contained within the Finance Directors statement, in relation to going concern 
 – the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
U Corporate Governance Code speci ed for our review and
 – certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company nancial statements of ITE Group plc for the year ended 
30 September 2012 and on the information in the Directors Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

assessment of the impact of pronouncements on the consolidated results, nancial position or cash ows of the Group.
2 Basis of accounting
ITE Group plc is a U listed company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Group . 
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated nancial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group nancial statements comply with 
Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. In addition, the Group has complied with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board ( IASB ). 
The preparation of nancial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make udgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and income and e penses. These 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on past e perience and other factors considered applicable at the time 
and are used to make udgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from 
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to estimates and assumptions are 
re ected in the nancial statements in the period in which they are made. 
The nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will continue in 
operational e istence for the foreseeable future as disclosed in the Finance Directors statement on page 36. 
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, 
e cept for the revaluation of nancial instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.  Financial Statements

Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company 
drawn up to 30 September each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the nancial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any 
e cess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identi able net assets is recognised as goodwill. The interest of 
non-controlling shareholders is stated at the non-controlling interest s proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities 
recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in e cess of the non-controlling interest are 
allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, ad ustments are made to the nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in 
line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and e penses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identi ed separately from the Group s equity 
therein. Non-controlling interest consists of the amount of those interests as at the date of the original business 
combination and the non-controlling interest s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses 
applicable to the non-controlling interest in e cess of their interest in the subsidiaries equity are allocated against non-
controlling interest even if this results in a de cit balance, e cept to the e tent that the non-controlling interest has a 
binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of e change, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in e change for control of the acquiree. Any costs attributable to the business combination are 
e pensed directly to the Income Statement. The acquiree s identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet 
the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, e cept for non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) that are classi ed as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current assets held for sale 
and discontinued operations), which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the e cess of the cost 
of the business combination over the Group s interest in the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If the Group s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree s identi able assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities e ceeds the cost of the business combination, the e cess is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are ad usted 
against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period ad ustments. All other subsequent changes in the 
fair value of contingent consideration classi ed as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. 
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classi ed as equity are not recognised.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non-controlling interest s proportion of the 
net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. 
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the e cess of the cost of acquisition over the Group s interest in the fair value 
of the identi able assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement 
and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group s cash-generating units e pected to 
bene t from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested 
for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated rst to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t 
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous U GAAP amounts 
sub ect to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under U GAAP prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent pro t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as Sterling 
denominated assets.
Intangible assets
Computer software is initially measured at purchase cost. Customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases are measured at fair value. Computer software, customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor 
databases have a de nite useful life and are carried at cost or fair value less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives 
are typically between three and ten years for customer relationships, for some trademarks up to 20 years and for visitor 
databases between ve and eight years. Computer software is amortised over four years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication e ists, the recoverable amount of the 
asset is estimated in order to determine the e tent of the impairment (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash 
 ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an inde nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever 
there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that re ects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which estimates of future cash ows have not been ad usted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment is recognised 
immediately as an e pense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not e ceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in 
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on 
the following bases:
Leasehold improvements – term of lease
Plant and equipment – four to ten years
Assets held under nance leases are depreciated over their e pected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales 
proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to e ercise signi cant in uence, but not control or oint 
control, through participation in the nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Signi cant in uence is the 
power to participate in the nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or oint control over 
those policies. Financial Statements

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
2 Basis of accounting continued
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these nancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as ad usted by post acquisition changes 
in the Group s share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an 
associate in e cess of the Group s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form 
part of the Group s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the e tent that the Group has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any e cess of the cost of acquisition over the Group s share of the fair values of the identi able net assets of the associate 
at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment 
and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any de ciency of the cost of acquisition below the Group s share 
of the fair value of the identi able net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is 
credited in pro t or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, pro ts and losses are eliminated to the e tent of the 
Group s interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which 
case an appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances
Venue advances arise where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting 
against future venue hire or by cash repayment. Where the advance can be settled in cash, the loan balance is measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method where the impact of discounting is material. Appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in pro t or loss when there is ob ective evidence that the 
asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are 
recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an out ow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial Instruments
Classes of nancial instruments
The Group aggregates its nancial instruments into classes based on their nature and characteristics. The details of 
 nancial instruments by class are disclosed in note 21 to the accounts.
 inancial assets
The Group classi es its nancial assets into the following categories: cash and cash equivalents, loans and receivables and 
derivative assets at fair value through pro t or loss. The classi cation is determined by management upon initial 
recognition, and is based on the purpose for which the nancial assets were acquired.
Financial assets are recognised on the Group s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether its nancial assets are to be impaired. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement where there is ob ective evidence of impairment. Financial assets are derecognised (in 
full or partly) when the Group s rights to cash ows from the respective assets have e pired or have been transferred and 
the Group has neither e posure to the risks inherent in those assets nor entitlement to rewards from them.
Investments
Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that are classi ed as available-for-sale nancial 
assets and stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 21. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in the fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation 
reserve with the e ception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign 
e change gain and losses on monetary assets which are recognised directly in pro t or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments 
revaluation reserve is reclassi ed to pro t or loss.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in pro t or loss when the Group s right to receive the 
dividends is established.

Cash an cash e uivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and on demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are sub ect to an insigni cant risk of changes in value. Cash and 
cash equivalents are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition cash and cash 
equivalents are stated at fair value with all realised gains or losses recognised in the income statement.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group s cash management are included as 
a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
Loans an receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets with ed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. This category includes the following classes of nancial assets: trade and other receivables and venue advances.
Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is 
ob ective evidence that the asset is impaired. The estimates are based on speci c credit circumstances and the Group s 
historical bad receivables e perience. No interest is charged on the loans and receivables, due to either their short-term 
nature or speci c arrangements in place, and hence the effective interest rate method is not applied. 
 erivative assets
A derivative is a nancial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date. Derivative assets are classi ed as at fair value through pro t or 
loss. Derivative assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at 
each balance date with the resulting gains and losses recognised in the income statement. These derivatives are acquired in 
full compliance with the Group s risk management policies.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classi es its nancial liabilities into the following categories: written put options, bank borrowings, trade and 
other payables held at amortised cost and derivative liabilities through pro t or loss.
Financial liabilities are recognised on the Group s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
 ritten put options
Any contract with a single or multiple settlement option that contains an obligation for the Group to purchase equity in 
a subsidiary for cash gives rise to a nancial liability for the present value of the repurchase price. An amount equal to the 
liability is recorded in equity on initial recognition of a written put option. The liability is subsequently remeasured through 
the income statement.
Where considered signi cant, the Group s written put options are discounted to their appropriate value. The unwinding of 
the discount is charged through the income statement over the period to e ercise.
Bank borro ings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received. Finance charges are accounted for on 
an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the e tent that they 
are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where bank loans and overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Group s 
cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash ow statement. Loan and 
overdraft interest and associated costs that are considered to be nancing in nature are presented as nancing activities in 
the cash ow statement.
Tra e an other payables
Trade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade 
payables are derecognised in full when the Group is discharged from its obligation, it e pires, is cancelled or replaced by a 
new liability with substantially modi ed terms. Trade and other payables are short-term and there is no interest charged in 
connection with these, hence the effective interest method is not applied.
 erivative liabilities
A derivative is a nancial instrument that changes its value in response to changes in an underlying variable, requires no or 
little net initial investment and is settled at a future date.  Financial Statements

Derivative liabilities are classi ed as fair value through pro t or loss. Derivative liabilities are measured at initial recognition 
at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance date with the resulting gains and losses 
recognised in the income statement. 
These derivatives are acquired in full compliance with the Group s risk management policies.
 e ge accounting
The Group s activities e pose it to the nancial risks of changes in foreign currency e change rates. The Group uses 
derivative nancial instruments such as foreign e change forward contracts to hedge these e posures. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement 
immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in the income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its derivative 
 nancial instruments as cash ow hedges. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the 
remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not e pected to be realised or settled within twelve 
months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item, along with the risk management ob ectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. At the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a 
hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values of cash ows of the hedged item.
Derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are 
subsequently measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement, and is included in 
 Finance income/cost in the income statement. Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, in the same line of the income statement as the 
recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument e pires or is 
sold, terminated, or e ercised, or no longer quali es for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at 
that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in pro t or loss. When 
a forecast transaction is no longer e pected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
The Group s use of nancial derivatives is governed by the Group s nancial policies. Further details on these policies can 
be found in the Business review on pages 32 to 37. 
 air values
The fair value is de ned as the amount at which a nancial instrument could be e changed in an arm s length transaction 
between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The Group determines the fair value of its nancial instruments using market prices for quoted instruments and widely 
accepted valuation techniques for other instruments.
Valuation techniques include discounted cash ows, standard valuation models based on market parameters, dealer quotes 
for similar instruments and use of comparable arm s length transactions.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business 
net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related ta es.
Revenue is recognised on completion of an event. Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs 
relating to future events are deferred. The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income 
and prepaid event costs respectively. Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable.
Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.

Barter transactions
Where barter transactions occur between advertising and e hibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, 
revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement. 
Operating pro t
Operating pro t is stated after the share of results of associates and pro t or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and 
before investment income and nance costs. 
Taxation
The ta e pense represents the sum of ta currently payable and deferred ta .
The current ta is based on the ta able pro t for the year using the ta rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Ta able pro t differs from net pro t as reported in the income statement 
because it e cludes items of income or e pense that are ta able or deductible in other years and it further e cludes items 
that are never ta able or deductible.
Deferred ta is the ta e pected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the nancial statements and the corresponding ta bases used in the computation of ta able pro t, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred ta liabilities are generally recognised for all ta able 
temporary differences and deferred ta assets are recognised only to the e tent that it is probable that ta able pro ts will 
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the ta pro t or the accounting pro t.
Deferred ta liabilities are recognised for ta able temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates and interests in oint ventures, e cept where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred ta assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the e tent that it is no 
longer probable that suf cient ta able pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred ta is calculated at the ta rates that are e pected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. Deferred ta is charged or credited in the income statement, e cept where it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred ta is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred ta assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current ta assets against 
current ta liabilities and when they relate to income ta es levied by the same ta ation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current ta assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of e change at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate 
where applicable. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated 
at the rates of e change prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the 
date the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary 
items, are included in income for the period. E change differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried 
at fair value are included in income for the period e cept for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in 
respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any e change component of 
that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Group s accounting policies for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative 
 nancial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of e change during the period and 
their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and e pense items are translated at the average 
e change rates for the period, unless e change rates uctuate signi cantly during the period, in which case the e change 
rates at the date of transaction are used. E change differences arising are classi ed as equity and transferred to the Group s 
translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as e pense in the period in which the operation 
is disposed of.
Under the e emption permitted from IAS 21 (the effects of changes in foreign e change rates), cumulative translation 
differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as ero. Consequently, any gain or loss on 
disposal will e clude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004. Financial Statements

Goodwill and fair value ad ustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
Employee Share Trust
The nancial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ( ESOT ). Shares in the Company held 
by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to 
pro t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied IFRS 2 (share-based payment). IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 
November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value (e cluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is e pensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest and ad usted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The e pected life used in the model has been ad usted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, e ercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management s best estimate.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. Bene ts received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting udgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group s accounting policies, the following udgments and assumptions have been made by 
management and have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the nancial statements or have the most 
risk of causing a material ad ustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the ne t nancial year:
Impairment of goo ill an intangible assets
Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-
generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires an 
estimation of future cash ows e pected from the cash-generating unit to perpetuity and a suitable discount rate in order 
to calculate present value. The period used in the calculation is based on management s average e pectation of the period 
over which the value will be derived from the cash-generating units. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 
30 September 2012 is £76.3 million and £54.7 million respectively.
Ac uire intangible assets
The valuation of acquired intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future 
cash ows arising from customer relationships, trademarks and licences and visitor databases to determine the value of 
those intangible assets. This involves estimating the period over which these intangible assets affect future cash ows. 
Intangible asset useful economic lives
The life of an intangible asset is estimated by management based on the e pected period over which cash ows generated 
from that asset will arise. The amortisation charge re ected in the nancial statements is directly impacted by the 
estimation of useful lives by Management.
Share-base payments 
The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at their estimated fair value 
at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model. The fair value determined at the grant date is 
e pensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually 
vest. The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Group s share price 
volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and e pected option lives. Management regularly performs a true-up of 
the estimate of the number of shares that are e pected to vest this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.

Taxation 
Being a multinational Group with ta affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a ta structure which makes 
the degree of estimation and udgement more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the 
Group and is often dependent on the ef ciency of legal processes. Such issues can take several years to resolve. The Group 
takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the 
eventual resolution could differ signi cantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Group s results and 
future cash ows.

ITE s reportable segments are strategic business units that are based in different geographic locations, predominantly in 
the developing and emerging markets. Each business unit is managed separately and has a different marketing strategy as 
determined by the local management. The products and services offered by each business unit are identical across the Group. 
ITE Group evaluates performance on the basis of pro t or loss from operations before ta e pense not including 
non-recurring gains and losses and foreign e change gains and losses.
The revenue and pro t before ta ation are attributable to the Group s one principal activity, the organisation of trade

12 Goodwill acquired through business combinations
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units that are e pected to 
bene t from that business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2012 
£000
2011 
£000
U and Western Europe 7,692 14,920
Central Asia and Caucasus 6,680 7,583
Russia 41,446 37,505
Eastern and Southern Europe 18,296 9,505
Rest of the World 2,195 1,171
76,309 70,684
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and e pected changes to cash ows 
during the period. Management estimates discount rates that re ect the current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks speci c to the cash-generating units. The growth rates are based on management forecasts. The Group 
prepares cash ow forecasts based upon the most recent nancial plans approved by the Board and e trapolates the 
planned cash ows. Assumed growth rates based on GDP growth rates in the local markets and management udgements 
have been applied for the rst three years beyond the detailed plans and a rate of between 1% and 8% is applied thereafter. 
These rates do not e ceed the average long-term growth rate for the businesses in the relevant markets.
The pre-ta discount rates applied to the cash-generating units are between 15% and 18%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the discount rate and growth rates used. Management believes that no 
reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value to e ceed its recoverable 
amount.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions 
arising from a range of possible trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each 
Cash Generating Unit with the sensitivities summarised as follows:
 – An increase in the discount rate by 1%.
 – A decrease of 5% on forecast cash ows over the term for all Cash Generating Units.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in 
forecast cash ows.

12 Goodwill acquired through business combinations continued
The values used in accounting for the identi able assets and liabilities of these acquisitions are provisional in nature at the 
balance sheet date. If necessary, ad ustments will be made to these carrying values and the related goodwill, within twelve 
months of the acquisition date. The goodwill arising on acquisition of £0.6 million represents signi cant e pected synergies 
with other operations of the Group. The acquired business organises e hibitions in the United ingdom, predominantly in 
the fashion sector.
No recognised goodwill is e pected to be deductible for income ta purposes. Transaction costs relating to the above 
acquisition were £0.1 million. 
The acquired business contributed £0.2 million to Group revenue and £0.1 million to pro t before ta during the year. If the 
acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2011, the acquired business would have contributed £0.4 million to Group revenue 
and £0.2 million to pro t before ta . 
Contingent consideration will be based on a multiple of the results of Jacket Required for the years ended 31 May 2013 and 
31 May 2014. The payment will be made in two stages with the nal payment e pected to be paid by 31 July 2014. The Group s 
best estimate at date of acquisition was £0.5 million. The contingent consideration is based on show pro ts and is unlimited.
The fair value of the acquired receivables is equivalent to the gross contractual receivable and estimated future cash 
 ows arising. 
Other acquisitions
On 10 February 2012 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of E po. LLP for consideration of 650,000 
(£410,000), some of which was paid in April 2012. The assets acquired comprise a small number of trade events in 
 a akhstan. No goodwill arose on the acquisition of E po. LLP.
During the year the Group updated its provisional acquisition accounting on em Fuar to account for pre-acquisition 
liabilities not previously identi ed. This resulted in an increase in goodwill of £0.3 million.
On 7 August 2012, Newe Marketing Limited, a subsidiary of the Group purchased a further 12.5% of the share capital of 
Ekin for 1.15 million (£739,000), taking the Group s shareholding to 100%. This transaction has resulted in a decrease in the 
Group s non-controlling interest in Ekin as can be seen in note 24.

On 12 September 2011, the Group purchased 40% of Scoop International Fashion Limited for £100,000. This has been 
accounted for using the equity method, recognised initially at cost. The carrying amount is increased or decreased to 
recognise the ITE s share of the pro t or loss of the associate after the date of acquisition. ITE s share of the pro t or 
loss of the associate is recognised in the income statement. Distributions received from the associate also reduce the 
carrying amount of the investment. The Group has written a put option over the remaining 60% of Scoop International 
Fashion Limited. 
On 8 February 2011, the Group purchased a 10% share in Summit Trade Events Limited for £400,000. During the year 
the Group reviewed the accounting treatment for its investment in Summit Trade Events Limited and determined that it 
had signi cant in uence through a seat on the Board. As a result, the investment has been reclassi ed from investments 
to interests in associates and is accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount is increased or decreased 
to recognise the ITE s share of the pro t or loss of the associate after the date of acquisition. ITE s share of the pro t or

The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand. Of the total overdraft, £13.3 million (2011: £nil) is denominated in Sterling, 
£2.1 million (2011: £2.4 million) is denominated in US Dollars, and £nil (2011: £11.5 million) is denominated in Euros. The Euro 
and US Dollar overdraft are taken out to act as a partial hedge against U monetary assets in those currencies. The 
overdrafts have been secured by a guarantee between a number of Group companies. The Directors estimate the carrying 
value of the overdrafts appro imates their fair value. At 30 September 2012 the Group had £nil (2011: £2.1 million) of gross 
undrawn committed overdraft facilities. Following a re nancing of the Group s loan facilities on 19 November 2012, the 
Group s overdraft facilities were increased by £5 million to £20 million.
The borrowings are arranged at oating interest rates, thus e posing the Group to interest rate risk. During the year ended 
30 September 2012 the overdrafts attracted interest at the base rate plus a margin of 2.0%. The average interest rate on 
the bank overdrafts appro imated 2.1% throughout the year (2011: 2.5%). Following the re nancing of the Group s loan 
facilities on 19 November 2012, the margin on the overdraft was reduced to 1.75%. 
Bank loan
During the year ended 30 September 2012 the Group utilised a £15.0 million (2011: £15.0 million) multi-currency committed 
bank facility that provided revolving credit facilities through to 30 November 2012. Drawdowns bear interest at interbank 
rates of interest plus a margin of 2.5%. A number of Group companies acted as guarantors to this facility. At 30 September 
2012 the Group had £1.7 million (2011: £0.5 million) of gross undrawn committed loan facility.
On 19 November 2012 the Group re nanced its loan obligations under the e isting facility. The revised facility is a £10.0 
million multi-currency committed bank facility that provides revolving credit facilities through to 1 July 2015. Drawdowns 
bear interest at interbank rates of interest plus a margin of 2.0%. A number of Group companies continue to act as 
guarantors to this facility.

During the year the put option liabilities and reserves relating to Scoop and Summit (where the Group does not already own a 
ma ority stake) have been reversed. The put option liability remaining at year end relates entirely to the put option over the 
40% of em Fuar that the Group does not already own. The liability has been discounted at a rate of 5% and the undiscounted 
amount is £9.4 million. The equity option asset of £0.1 million relates to the fair value of the call option held over Summit, 
which is accounted for at fair value through pro t and loss. The options held in respect of Scoop are valued at £nil.  Financial Statements

Maturity of nancial instruments 
In 2012, £4.5 million of the em Fuar put option had a maturity of one year or less, with the remaining £4.5 million having a 
maturity of more than one year. Out of the total of £4.3 million of derivative nancial assets, £2.1 million had a maturity of 
one year or less and £2.2 million of one year or more.
In 2011, of the derivative nancial liabilities, Ekin Fuar put option (£0.7 million) and an element of the derivative nancial 
instruments (£0.2 million) had a maturity of one year or less. The remaining derivative nancial liabilities of £12.7 million had 
a maturity of one year or more. Out of the total of £0.3 million of derivative nancial assets, £0.2 million had a maturity of 
one year or less and £0.1 million of one year or more.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of nancial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the 
 nancial statements appro imate to their fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.

The Group seeks to minimise the effects of foreign currency risks by using derivative nancial instruments to hedge the risk 
e posures. The use of nancial derivatives is governed by the Group s policies approved by the Board. Compliance with 
policies and e posure limits is reviewed by the Board on a continuous basis. The Group does not enter into nancial 
instruments, including derivative nancial instruments, for speculative purposes.

Financial risk management
In the course of its business, the Group is e posed to a number of nancial risks: market risk (including foreign currency 
and interest rate), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. This note presents the Group s e posure to each of the above 
risks. The Group s ob ectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks can be found in the Business

The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group s risk management framework. The 
Board has established policies to identify and analyse risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls 
and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign e change rates and interest rates will affect the Group s income or the value 
of its holdings of nancial instruments. The ob ective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
e posures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group s activities e pose it primarily to the nancial risks of changes in foreign currency e change rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into derivative nancial instruments to manage its e posure to foreign currency risk. Market risk 
e posures are measured using sensitivity analysis.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, e posures to e change rate 
 uctuations arise. E change rate e posures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward-plus or 
forward foreign e change contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the

Forward foreign exchange contracts 
As at 30 September 2012 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that the Group has 
committed to amounted to £81.2 million (2011: £82.4 million). These arrangements are designed to address signi cant 
e change e posures for the ne t 36 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, sub ect to not committing 
the Group to less than si months or more than 36 months in the future.
At 30 September 2012, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a net asset of appro imately £4.2 million 
(2011: net liability of £0.7 million). These amounts are based on market valuations.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against 
certain currency trade receivable balances. These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by 
management. All foreign e change movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in 
the income statement.
Interest rate risk management
As the Group has no signi cant interest-bearing assets, other than cash, the Group s income and operating cash ows 
are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group is e posed to interest rate risk through its 
borrowings at oating interest rates. This risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate level of oating 
interest rate borrowings. The Group s e posures to interest rates on nancial assets and nancial liabilities are detailed in 
the liquidity risk section of this note.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the e posure to interest rates for nancial assets and nancial 
liabilities at the balance sheet date. With all other variables held constant the table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a 
1% change in interest rates applied to the ma or currencies of net variable rate asset/liabilities. 1% is the sensitivity rate that 
represents management s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.

Credit risk management
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its contractual obligations. The Group s principal nancial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, venue advances and derivative nancial instruments. 
These represent the Group s ma imum e posure to credit risk. The Group s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade 
and other receivables. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of 
mitigating the risk of nancial loss from defaults. The Group s ob ective is to ensure all customers have paid before any 
service is provided to them. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
The ageing pro le of the Group s trade receivables and the details of the Group s allowances for doubtful receivables can 
be seen below.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative nancial instruments arises due to where the liquid funds are held. The 
territories in which ITE operates do not always have banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating 
agencies such as Moody s and Fitch. The Group aims to minimise the e posure to credit risk by minimising the level of cash 
held in such banks. The Group s e posure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the 
aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved nancial institutions.

Management review debtors ageing on a contractual basis and also based on when an event has been held. The Group 
raise invoices on events using stage payments. Any overdue amounts, after the stage payment due date, are reviewed 
and chased. Management also review the debts due based on when an event has taken place, as this is typically when 
the service is provided. Both measures are included in the table above as both are used by management to manage 
outstanding debts.
The trade receivables amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by 
the Group s management based on prior e perience, speci c credit issues and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse industries and geographical 
areas and the Group s e posure to credit risk is in uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
demographics of the Group s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country, in which the customers 
operate, has less of an in uence on credit risk. 
The Group establishes an allowance for doubtful debts that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
receivables when there is ob ective evidence that the debt will not be collected in full. The allowance is recognised and 
measured as the difference between the asset s carrying amount and the present value of future cash ows. Where 
material, it is discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition. The main component of this 
allowance is a speci c loss component that relates to individually signi cant e posure on shows which have taken place 
but the debt has not been collected in full. This allowance is determined by reference to the speci c circumstances of 
each show and past e perience.
The details of the movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables are shown below.

Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as they fall due. Such risk may result from 
inadequate market depth or disruption or re nancing problems. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests 
with the Board of Directors. They have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of 
the Group s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring continuity of funding for operational needs through cash deposits and debt 
facilities as appropriate.

Deferred ta liabilities (14,414) (13,067)

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused ta losses of £3.5 million (2011: £3.0 million) available for offset against 
future pro ts. No deferred ta asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the 
unpredictability of future pro t streams. These losses may be carried forward inde nitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of 
subsidiaries for which deferred ta liabilities have not been recognised was £39.7 million (2011: £13.0 million). No liability has 
been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

23 Share capital continued
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to ed income. At the E traordinary General Meeting 
held on 17 November 1998, shareholders approved the establishment of the ITE Group Employee Share Ownership Trust 
( ESOT ). The terms of the ESOT allow the trustees to transfer shares to employees who e ercise options under the 
Company s Share Option Schemes, to grant options to employees and to accumulate shares by buying in the market or 
subscribing for shares at market value. The ESOT is capable of holding a ma imum of 5% of the Company s issued ordinary 
share capital. The ESOT reserve arises in connection with the ESOT. The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in 
arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the Company s shares purchased by the Trust which had not 
vested unconditionally in employees at the balance sheet date.
The ESOT held 5,366,722 shares in ITE Group plc at 30 September 2012 (2011: 8,102,687 shares). During the year 361,000 
share options and 1,063,000 nominal share options under the Employees Performance Share Plan were granted against 
ESOT held shares. The market value of the ordinary shares held by the ESOT at 30 September 2012 was £11.1 million 
(2011: £12.8 million).
The Company has agreed to make available to the ESOT an interest-free loan of up to £12.5 million for the purpose of 
buying shares. At 30 September 2012, the amount of the loan drawn down was £8.6 million. The ITE Group plc Company 
only pro t and loss account and balance sheet include the results of the ESOT for the year ended 30 September 2012. The 
trustees have waived their current and future rights to all dividend entitlement on the shares held by the ESOT. 2,735,965 
options were e ercised by ESOT during the year. The total consideration for the options e ercised by ESOT was £705,566. 
5,833,295 of outstanding options are to be settled by ESOT, so all shares held by the ESOT are under option as at 
30 September 2012. Details of the options in issue and their e ercise dates can be seen at note 26 to the accounts.

1 Basis of accounting
The separate nancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The nancial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 67.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and 
United ingdom Accounting Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and 
the preceding year.
Investments
Fi ed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets
Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a de nite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life. 
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that 
an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of 
the obligation.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and nancial liabilities are recognised on the Company s balance sheet when the Company becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Tra e ebtors an cre itors
Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value. Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borro ings
Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on an 
accrual basis to pro t or loss.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation
Current ta , including U corporation ta and foreign ta , is provided at amounts e pected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the ta rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred ta is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more ta in the future or a right to pay less ta in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group s ta able pro ts and 
its results as stated in the nancial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in ta assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in the nancial statements.
A net deferred ta asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the e tent that, on the basis of all 
available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable ta able pro ts from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred ta is not recognised when ed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding 
agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss e pected to arise on sale has been recognised in the nancial 
statements. Neither is deferred ta recognised when ed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the ta able gain 
will be rolled over, being charged to ta only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred ta is measured at the average ta rates that are e pected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
are e pected to reverse, based on ta rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of e change at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of e change prevailing at 
that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets are included in pro t or loss for the period.
Employee Share Trust
The nancial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ( ESOT ). Shares in the Company held 
by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity. The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to 
pro t or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the 
Company s equity holders.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value 
(e cluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based payments is e pensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Company s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and ad usted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model. The e pected life used in the model has been ad usted, for the effects 
of non-transferability, e ercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on management s best estimate.
2 Pro t for the year
The pro t after ta for the year ended 30 September 2012 was £21.0 million (2011: loss of £2.5 million). As permitted by 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no separate pro t and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.
The auditor s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated nancial statements.

Subsequent Events
• Energybuild admitted to AIM raising approximately £15 million in
August 2007 (£9.7 million net of loan repayments and expenses).
  This steady improvement has been made possible through the
efforts of Dan Stickel, President of ADC and his team. Dan has
assembled an experienced operating team which is focused on
increasing operating productivity while improving safety and
environmental standards. The Group took over all mining and
processing operations from contractors in July 2006 and had
assembled an operating workforce of 118 full time employees by
30 June 2007. All employees are now working under the
Group’s health and safety training programs and operating
standards, injury and accident rates are becoming consistent
with other established, large regional operators.
Management has also been active in building on its existing
asset base at Gauley Eagle with significant new property
acquisitions and by advancing permitting activities to allow for
an expanded production platform as additional markets are
developed. During the 2007 calendar year the Group acquired
approximately 2,760 acres of additional coal properties
adjacent to or synergistic with the Gauley Eagle property,
increasing the size of Atlantic Leaseco’s properties to
approximately 17,739 acres. 
As the Group has continued to establish itself as a reliable
supplier delivering consistently high quality products, it has
been able to expand its marketing efforts. Initial shipments were
marketed on the spot market and limited to customers that
could be supplied by truck. The Group has been focusing on
developing a range of transportation alternatives,
encompassing both rail and barge loading, which could greatly
Coal International’s third year since listing
on AIM was marked by significant
continued growth in its United States
operations as the Company established
itself as an important new coal producer
in West Virginia, located in the Central
Appalachian region of the United States.
West Virginia
Following the acquisition of three coal properties during the
previous reporting period the Company now has two principal
mining operations: Atlantic Leaseco and Maple Coal. The
Company operates through its wholly-owned US operating
subsidiary Atlantic Development and Capital LLC (“ADC”) and its
subsidiaries Atlantic Leaseco LLC and Maple Coal Co. During the
period, the Group substantially expanded operations at the
Atlantic Leaseco property and commenced development of its first
underground mine at the Maple Coal property. Coal production
and sales increased in each quarter and the Company reported
production of 561,192 tons of marketable coal and sales of
587,649 tons for the year ending 30 June 2007. 
The Atlantic Leaseco facility is now operating at a sustainable
rate of production of 750,000 tons per annum of marketable coal
with the current equipment and labour configurations. The Eagle
No. 1 underground mine at the Maple Coal operation
commenced production in June 2007 and is currently increasing
its operations with the goal of achieving a sustained production
rate of 720,000-750,000 marketable tons per annum. 
Chairman’s Statement
02 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007 both. Anglo and Hillsborough Resources Limited have agreed to
pay NEMI’s required contribution to the Joint Venture until the
end of December 2007 up to an amount of US$18million.
Thereafter, NEMI will be subject to joint venture capital calls and
potential dilution. 
In order to take a more active role in helping NEMI to bring
value to its shareholders, Coal International Directors W. Durand
Eppler and John Byrne joined the NEMI Board of Directors on
20 March 2007. The NEMI Board is reviewing a range of
strategic alternatives for the company.
Financial
In recognition of the rate of growth and development of the
Group, the Board was pleased to appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP
as the Company’s auditors in June 2007.
Following the identification of a number of misstatements and
missing disclosures in the financial statements for the year
ended 30 June 2006, the Board requested a review of the
financial controls of the Group including a review of the 2006
report and financial statements. These items have now been
corrected and the restated amounts are set out in the 2006
comparatives along with appropriate disclosures with full
explanation included in note 1 of the 2007 financial statements. 
The loss before tax for the year was £12.4 million (restated 2006:
£8.1 million). The loss for 2006 as previously reported was £5.4
million. £1.4 million of the £2.7 million increase is accounted for
by the adoption of FRS20 Share Based Payments. The balance of
£1.3 million relates primarily to a reassessment of mineral rights
and restoration provisions. The net assets at 30 June 2007 were
£58.6 million (restated 2006: £62.9 million). The net assets as
previously reported for 2006 were £55.1 million. The increase of
£7.7 million has arisen primarily from revisiting the fair value
accounting of acquisitions completed during that year.
The Board is satisfied that the internal controls across the
Group have been reviewed and the issues and areas requiring
improvement have been identified. Implementation of
strengthened financial controls at the Group and Company
level is an active process with ongoing development. The
Board receives monthly management accounts from both ADC
and Energybuild and believes the accounting functions within
ADC and Energybuild are effective. The Company has recently
recruited a dedicated financial controller and intends to recruit
a finance director. In the meantime, Cambrian Mining Plc’s
Finance Director continues to provide support to the Company’s
finance and accounting functions. Further, to strengthen the
governance of the Company, the Board intends to identify and
invite additional independent non-executive directors to assist
in overseeing the Company’s affairs.
The financing activities of the Group included the raising of
£8.1 million in cash, net of expenses, by the Company through a
placing in May 2007. ADC also finalised a US$7 million third
party equipment financing package with CIT Equipment Finance
in May 2007.
expand the potential marketing range for the Group’s coal
products. The Group is now negotiating medium term contract
business with a number of key customers which, if completed,
will represent an important milestone and demonstrate
recognition of the Group’s increasing stature in the market
place. In addition, with two coal preparation plants and
operations capable of producing coal from a number of
alternative seams, each with particular chemistry and
characteristics, as well as purchased third-party coal from
specific operations, the Group has begun utilising its production
capability to produce specific coal blends for customers. These
blended products enable the Group to earn an improved
margin and utilise its resource base more efficiently.
Investments
Energybuild Group Plc (“Energybuild”)
On 6 August 2007 (subsequent to the reporting period)
Energybuild was admitted to trading on AIM following the
raising of approximately £15.0 million (£9.7 million net of loan
repayments and expenses) to finance the Energybuild group’s
development and operations. Immediately prior to Energybuild’s
listing, Coal International held 50 per cent. of the issued capital
of Energybuild and, as a result of the placing, Coal
International’s holding has decreased to its current shareholding
of 23.08 per cent.. Coal International’s major shareholder,
Cambrian Mining Plc, currently holds a further 27.51 per cent. of
Energybuild. 
Energybuild has continued to develop its drift mine and
opencast activities in South Wales. With the increased price of
world coal, the main activity of Energybuild has been to
accelerate the mine development with a view to achieving
production of 440,000 saleable tonnes per annum within the
next three years and 770,000 saleable tonnes per annum within
the next six years.
A number of milestones were reached in pursuing this strategy,
including successfully accessing and recovering the old British
Coal intake and returns across the Pentreclwydau fault at the
Aberpergwm Colliery in September 2007. This allowed access to
the 18 foot landing where underground production will resume. 
NEMI Northern Energy & Mining Inc. (“NEMI”)
Coal International holds a 20.1 per cent. interest in NEMI, a
Vancouver based coal investment company. NEMI’s principal
asset is a 20 per cent. stake in the Peace River Coal Joint
Venture, managed by Anglo Coal Canada (“Anglo”) (60 per
cent.), which operates the Trend coal mine in northeastern
British Columbia, Canada and other development projects in the
region. The principal asset of the Peace River Coal Joint Venture
is a 50 per cent. stake in the Belcourt-Saxon Joint Venture with
Western Canadian Coal (50 per cent.), which is advancing a
major new metallurgical coal project through the permitting and
feasibility stage.
The Peace River Coal Joint Venture was entered into in
December 2006, with NEMI, Anglo and Hillsborough Resources
Limited each contributing properties or cash or a mixture of

Outlook
As at 30 June 2007, Coal International has invested
approximately £40.7 million (US$80.5 million) to develop its
West Virginia coal business. The Group has established itself
as a respected new entrant into the US coal industry with a
solid operating base and an impressive platform for future
growth. 
Looking forward to 2008, the Company intends to continue to
seek a permit to open the Eagle No. 2 mine, planned for late
in the 2008 calendar year, which will enable the installation of
a third mining unit in the Eagle seam. These activities are
intended to bring metallurgical coal production from Maple
Coal to approximately one million tons per annum by the end
of the 2009 financial year. Subject to permitting and
settlement of marketing contracts, the Company also hopes to
establish its first surface mining operating unit at the Maple
property during the 2008 calendar year.
At the Atlantic Leaseco property, we will continue operations at
the Silo Mains underground and Crooked Run surface mines
and will seek permits to open new surface and underground
mining operations to maintain production as reserves at the
current mines are exhausted. Simultaneously, we are
continuing to seek permits to establish surface and
underground operations in the Peerless seam reserve blocks
which were acquired in this reporting period. First production
from these reserve blocks is anticipated to occur in 2009.
The Company is closely following activities at Energybuild as it
looks to accelerate development of its first coal operations.
Management is also continuing to work with NEMI’s operating
team to explore new development opportunities.

As the business has expanded, we have worked hard to build
a solid operating team, starting with a small head office and
building a workforce for each of its operations. At the end of
June 2007 ADC had a total of 118 employees, which increased
to 151 employees as at the end of October 2007.
The average operating cost margins for thermal coal sales for
the period was negative and ADC was also carrying the cost
of keeping the Pageton property in care and maintenance as
well as Maple property overheads. Going forward,
strengthening coal prices and production at the Maple
property are expected to increase the sales price and
decrease the operating cost per ton. The negative margins
experienced during the reporting period were, in part,
attributable to higher unit costs associated with the ramp-up of
production during a period of weak prices for thermal coal. As
production has increased unit production costs have improved
and thermal coal prices have also rebounded. The
commencement of operations at Maple Coal, which produces
metallurgical grade coals which sell at significantly higher
prices than thermal coals, will continue to enhance operating
margins. Going forward, further strengthening of thermal coal
prices and commencement of metallurgical production at the
Maple property are expected to increase the sales revenue
per ton and improve the margin per ton. 
Atlantic Leaseco
Upon completion of refurbishment of a shuttered preparation
plant, we commenced mining operations at the Atlantic
Leaseco properties in March 2006 by opening the Silo Mains
underground mine and the Crooked Run surface mining
operation. Initial mining was carried out with third party mining
contractors at both the surface and underground operations.
By the end of July 2006, contract miners were replaced by
Group personnel and direct operating control was achieved for
all coal mining and washing operations. This move allowed
management to substantially improve mine planning,
productivity and equipment utilisation and has resulted in a
continuous improvement in operational performance at all
levels throughout the reporting period. Management believes
it has normalised current operations at Atlantic Leaseco at
a sustainable production rate of approximately 750,000
marketable tons per annum from captive operations, in
addition to third party coal which is purchased, washed,
marketed and sold by the Group. 
Atlantic Leaseco added significantly to its 14,970 acre
leaseholdings at the Gauley Eagle property during the period
by signing new leases covering 2,760 acres adjacent to or
with the potential to provide synergies with current holdings.
We are currently in negotiations for additional leases
covering over 2,500 acres of contiguous coal lands. These
acquisitions will facilitate long term surface and underground
mining operations at Atlantic Leaseco properties and also
provide the Group access to a reserve of Peerless seam coal,
a seam with high quality characteristics which is expected
to command a premium price in the industrial market. 
To date, substantially all of the production from Atlantic Leaseco
has been sold in the thermal coal market. Start up of the Maple
operations in June 2007 has created marketing synergies for
the Group based on coal blending from the two properties and
will enable Atlantic Leaseco to sell a portion of its production
into the metallurgical coal market, by blending Atlantic
Leaseco’s Kittanning seam coal together with Maple’s Eagle
seam coal. We are developing our marketing strategy for the
recently acquired Peerless seam reserves. 
To advance market opportunities, as well as to plan for
continued growth, we have continued to follow an aggressive
permitting strategy by working with State and Federal
authorities to enable the expansion of both surface and
underground operations at Atlantic Leaseco properties. 
Maple Coal
Building on our success at the Atlantic Leaseco properties, the
Group began the recommissioning of operations at the Maple
property. The Group controls approximately 21,214 acres
located in Fayette and Kanawha Counties, West Virginia that
had previously been mined but shuttered since the early 1990s.
The property contains substantial resources which can be
accessed via surface mining operations as well as significant
underground resources and has excellent potential for further

CEO’s Review
continued
exploration. One significant resource block is in the Eagle
seam, a premium high-volatile metallurgical coal. 
In January 2007, we commenced the rehabilitation of the
shuttered Katie coal preparation plant at Maple and received
permits to re-establish underground mining operations by
commissioning the Eagle No. 1 mine. First production from the
mine began at the end of June 2007, on schedule, and was
delivered to the re-commissioned plant. Initial efforts have
proceeded well and a second continuous miner was installed in
late calendar year 2007. The mine and plant are on a ramp-up
schedule to bring the mine and plant to a sustained operating
rate of 720,000 marketable tons per annum by the first calendar
quarter of 2008. 
We are well advanced in the permitting process for the opening of
a second mine in the Eagle seam as markets are developed, with
the goal of achieving annual production in excess of one million
tons of marketable metallurgical coal. Initial production from
Maple has been marketed into both the metallurgical and
thermal market until longer-term metallurgical sales are
established. Thermal production has been sold on orders already
held by Atlantic Leaseco. Metallurgical sales have primarily been
through test orders and blends to establish term business
(contracts in excess of one year) for the 2008 calendar year and
beyond. Between existing thermal business and test shipments to
potential longer-term metallurgical customers, the balance of
Maple’s 2007 calendar year production is fully committed. 
Pageton Property
The Pageton coal recovery operation was placed in care and
maintenance at the beginning of the 2007 calendar year due
to poor market conditions. We have continued to sell small
volumes of coal from inventory into the thermal market, but
have no current plans to restart the property and are currently
assessing disposal options. As at 30 June 2007, the book value
of the investment in Pageton after impairment is £671,088.
Environment, Health & Safety
Coal mining operations in the United States are subject to close
regulatory supervision from Federal and State regulators
concerned with workplace safety and environmental protection.
As a new industry participant, our West Virginia operations have
received multiple in-depth inspections and been reviewed by a
broad array of regulators. From January to July 2007 ADC group
facilities and operations have received 200 inspection shifts from
Federal and State inspectors (48 US Mine Safety and Health
Administration inspections, 50 West Virginia Mine Health and
Safety inspections 101 West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection inspections and 1 inspection by the
Office of Surface Mining), which resulted in a violation rate of
less than 1.0 per inspection, which is in line with our target for
West Virginia operations.
The Historical Safety Performance chart (on the right) indicates
our continued improvement in safety performance in West
Virginia when comparing the Non-Fatal Days Lost (“NFDL”) rate
in 2006 and 2007 calendar years. The NFDL rate is a key
performance indicator for the Group’s West Virginia operations
and is calculated as the incidence rate of the number of lost
time injuries per 200,000 man-hours worked. Following the first
full year of operations, management has had an opportunity to
train new employees under the Group’s safety policies and
procedures. The NFDL rate of 5.64 for the total man-hours
worked in the six month period ended 30 June 2007 compared
very favourably to the NFDL rate of 11.24 for the corresponding
period in 2006. As a reference, the NFDL national average for
the total man-hours worked in the six month period ended
30 June 2007 for all mining operations was reported as 3.16
while the average for all West Virginia operations was reported
as 3.25 for the same period. 
Our NFDL rate was above the national and West Virginia
average mainly due to the shortage of skilled, experienced
workers in West Virginia. We have had to train or retrain much
of our workforce and the benefits of that training have resulted
in the improvement of our safety performance. For the month of
October 2007, there were no lost time injuries in the West
Virginia operations, bringing the NFDL rate for the ten month
period to end of October 2007 down to 3.87. 
Ensuring workplace safety remains a core value for the Group
and management is committed to continuous improvement both
in workforce training and safety performance.
Marketing & Transportation
During the first full year of operation all of the Group’s West
Virginia production was sold into the thermal coal market via
short-term and spot business. A significant achievement, as a
new industry participant, has been to establish ourselves as a
reliable, new producer, capable of producing a consistent
product with consistent quality, in a very competitive market
place. This was a particular challenge as local and regional
coal markets were softening at the time the Group began first
production. In spite of the market softness the Group has been
successful in establishing a number of significant marketing
relationships. 
The Group has substantially sold its production for the 2007
calendar year and, as it has established itself as a credible
producer, it is negotiating longer-term contract business for the
2008 and 2009 calendar years.

Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec As new markets are developed, the Group has substantial
capacity to expand both surface and underground production
to meet market demand, subject to permits being obtained and
equipment financing. As operations are expanded at Maple
Coal, the Group’s marketing efforts will largely be focused on
establishing solid long-term markets for the Eagle seam
metallurgical coal production.
As a new producer, the Group’s first customers and markets
were based around those customers within trucking distance
of the operations. Management has made a clear priority of
expanding its customer base by developing a range of
transportation alternatives for marketing the Group’s production.
In addition to those customers within trucking distance, the
Group has established relationships with a number of barge
loading facilities on the Kanawha River, significantly expanding
the potential reach of the marketing programme. Management
is also negotiating throughput agreements to three different rail
road loading facilities. 
In October 2007 we finalised an agreement with a dock facility on
the Kanawha River that is centrally located between Maple and
Gauley Eagle to stockpile, size, blend and load barges for the
remainder of the 2007 calendar year. We are investigating longer
term options with that facility as well as another dock facility. 
We have secured access to a rail loading site located in Cowen,
West Virginia, near the Gauley Eagle property, which, if
developed, could provide access to new customers in the
northeastern United States and Atlantic coast that are serviced
by the CSX Railroad. The site is located on a short line railroad
that is an affiliate to the CSX Rail system. LA Gates Engineering
has been commissioned to permit the site and design a
conceptual engineering layout of the facility. We are also
finalising an agreement to toll load through an existing rail
loading facility on the NS Railroad until such time as the Cowen
facility may be permitted and constructed. Under the toll loading
agreement Gauley Eagle and Maple will be able to utilise the
facility beginning December 2007 to the end of December 2008. 
Growth in West Virginia
The Company’s principal mission has been to establish an
operating base that can serve as a platform for continued
growth. The Group currently has ten additional mining permits
in various stages of review between the Atlantic Leaseco and
Maple properties. The additional permits will enhance efficiency
and flexibility of operations. Management continues to pursue
new permits and engineering projects to enable development
of new reserves at both the Maple and Atlantic Leaseco
properties, to strategically position the properties for increased
production as markets are secured, as well as to provide
replacement production for the depletion of existing operations. 
The Group has applied for a second mining permit in the Eagle
seam for Eagle No. 2 mine that is under West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) technical
review. Eagle No. 2 mine will allow the addition of a third
continuous miner unit in the Eagle seam and could increase
metallurgical grade coal production capacity to over one million
09
tons annually from the Maple property by the end of the 2009
reporting period. The reconditioned Katie preparation plant will
be able to accommodate the increased throughput with
minimal additional investment.
The Group has also applied for a mining permit to establish the
Sycamore North surface mine from the Army Corp of Engineers.
Expansion of production at Atlantic Leaseco properties is
anticipated in the next reporting period with the addition of the
Muddlety South surface mine pending revision of a prior WVDEP
mining permit held by Island Creek. Based on current Crooked
Run productivity, annual production from Muddlety South is
estimated to be 300,000 tons.
Further expansion at Atlantic Leaseco includes development of
the Peerless seam coal reserves. The Group has applied for a
surface mine permit and an underground permit on the recently
acquired Peerless seam reserves. The underground mine
permit is at an advanced stage of the application process.
Peerless coal is planned to be marketed as a premium
industrial coal and as a metallurgical grade coal when blended
with the Kittanning coal mined at Atlantic Leaseco properties.
Investments
Energybuild Group Plc (Energybuild) (AIM:EBG)
As at 19 December 2007, Coal International owned 23.08 per
cent. of Energybuild, a coal producer based in South Wales.
Energybuild produces a range of anthracite coals predominantly
from the opencast operations of which 114,000 tonnes (95.8 per
cent. of its saleable coal) went into the power station market in
the reporting period with 5,000 tonnes (4.2 per cent.) going into
the domestic sized coal market. The overall average weighted
selling price was £40 per tonne for the reporting period. During
the reporting period, 106,000 tonnes of the saleable coal was
mined from Area 1 and 1A of the site at an average cost of
£32 per tonne.
The increase in the price achieved for coal into the power
station market is very much in line with the movement we are
currently witnessing in the global coal price. Sized coal prices
have also experienced similar increases which are forecast to
continue. When underground mining production resumes at the
Aberpergwm drift mine, it is expected that the Aberpergwm
sized coal will come onto the market at a premium price.
The opencast coal varies in quality from seam to seam and
although it is ideally suited for the power station market only
selected seams are suitable for the sized coal market. It is
expected that the average price of the company’s saleable coal
will increase as the drift mine comes into production during 2008
and a larger proportion of the overall production will go into the
sized market. In addition other markets such as the pulverised
coal injection market could open up to Energybuild.
In summary the key features of Energybuild are:
• The Aberpergwm mine and the adjacent Treforgan mine
have a defined economic resource of high quality anthracite
with a low sulphur and high calorific value, contained within 10 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
CEO’s Review
continued
a licence and option area encompassing some 1,526
hectares. Together they have proven and probable
recoverable reserves of 7.6 million tonnes with an inferred
recoverable resource of 36.2 million tonnes and an in situ
seam resource in excess of 110 million tonnes;
• The proven and probable coal reserves as at 6 August 2007
had an estimated net present value of £40 million and the
overall recoverable coal resource over an estimated
30 year life of mine had a net present value of £90 million.
The increase in the world price of coal since the year end
should strengthen the position of Energybuild;
• Considerable work has been done to re-establish
infrastructure at certain parts of the Aberpergwm mine
including dewatering, re-establishing ventilation and
undertaking mine roadway recovery and repairs to access
coal reserves on the west side of the main fault line;
• Development work at the Aberpergwm mine is eligible for
Department for Business, Enterprise & Regulatory Reform
grant aid under its coal investment aid scheme and to 30
June 2007 Energybuild has utilised approximately £2.2
million of a total £3.5 million of the awarded grant;
• Energybuild has a contract with RWE to supply 450,000
tonnes of coal over two years into the nearby Aberthaw
power station and also entered into a marketing agreement
with distributor EH Bennett & Company Limited in respect of
its sized coal.
Energybuild has a comprehensive written Health and Safety Policy
and an extensive health and safety management system in
place. Health and safety documents have been formulated and
implemented at both underground and surface mining
operations. The Company reported no fatal or major injury
accidents for both the 2006 calendar year and the 2007 calendar
year to date. The overall reportable injury rate (including
underground, mine surface and opencast operations) was 9.31
per 100,000 manshifts in the 2006 calendar year and 10.14 per
100,000 manshifts between 1 January and 20 November 2007.
The reportable injury rate for the underground mine only was
14.94 for 2006 and 13.82 for the 2007 period.
UK Coal Plc, a major coal producer in the UK, reported 30 major
injury accidents to the Health and Safety Executive and an overall
reportable injury rate of 27.8 per 100,000 manshifts worked for
the 2006 calendar year. Although UK Coal Plc’s operations are
on a much larger scale than Energybuild’s this is a useful
industry comparator. The Health and Safety Executive has not
published comparable statistics more recently than 2003/2004.
Energybuild has an environmental policy and environmental
management systems and was subject to regular audits from
the Environmental Agency of Wales during the year. The
company also conducts its own audits and has had no
enforcement actions from environmental bodies during the last
two calendar years. 
Recruitment and training is also seen as an essential part of
health and safety. The company strives to recruit the most highly
qualified employees available, with the right level of industry
experience and continues to train and update employees in
respect of their responsibilities under the Mines and Quarries
Act in relation to health and safety. With this in mind Energybuild
started an apprenticeship scheme in 2004 for craftsmen, with its
first five apprentices completing their third year in June 2007.
A further four apprentices commenced employment with
Energybuild in June 2007 ready for the academic year
commencing in September 2007. Energybuild intends to
continue this training commitment for the foreseeable future.
NEMI Northern Energy & Mining Inc. (NEMI) (TSX: NNE.A)
As at 19 December 2007, Coal International owns 20.1 per cent.
of NEMI, a Vancouver based company whose principal asset is
a 20 per cent. holding in the Peace River Coal Joint Venture (JV),
managed by Anglo Coal (60 per cent.). Hillsborough Resources,
Inc. holds the remaining 20 per cent. The Peace River Coal JV
consolidated the north eastern British Columbia coal holdings of
the three parties and manages the Trend mine, which is
anticipated to produce 1 million tonnes of hard coking coal in
2007, (recently authorised to expand to 2 million tonnes of
annual production). The Peace River Coal JV also has a 50 per
cent. interest in the Belcourt-Saxon Joint Venture, a significant
development asset in north eastern British Columbia for which a
bankable feasibility study is currently being completed. Western
Canadian Coal Corporation holds the other 50 per cent. of the
Belcourt-Saxon Joint Venture.
In an effort to take a more active role in advancing NEMI’s future
growth and enhance shareholder value, Coal International
requested representation on NEMI’s Board of Directors. On
20 March 2007, Coal International Directors W. Durand Eppler
and John Byrne joined NEMI’s Board, with W. Durand Eppler
serving as Non-Executive Chairman.
Outlook
The Board is pleased with the Group’s progress during the
reporting period and looks forward to another year of building
on its solid operating base. 
In West Virginia, the Group intends to continue to develop its
operating base at the Maple property with the goal of bringing
metallurgical coal production from Maple to approximately
one million tons per annum by the end of the 2009 financial
year and establishing its first surface mining operating unit in
2008. At the Atlantic Leaseco properties the Group will continue
permitting efforts to open new surface and underground mining
operations and to establish surface and underground
operations in the Peerless seam reserve blocks. 
The Company will continue to actively monitor the progress of
Energybuild and NEMI to help add value to its investments.

West Virginia Coal Reserves
The reserves set out in this Annual Report in relation to the Atlantic Leaseco,
LLC and Maple Coal Co reserves are estimated by Marshall Miller and
Associates Inc. in their reserve up-date report dated 9 November 2007 and
have been estimated and classified as “measured” and “indicated” following
guidelines established by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in
Circular 891 (1983). Definitions of key terms (sourced by Marshall Miller from
the SEC Industry Guide 7 and USGS Circular 891) are as follows:
• Reserve – Reserve is that part of a mineral deposit, which could be
economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve
determination. The determination of economic viability was beyond the
scope of authorised work by Marshall Miller. Thus, reserve status has not
been defined.
"Reserves," as strictly defined by the USGS, are those coal resources that
meet two overlapping criteria:
(1) geologic assurances of existence and continuity, and
(2) economic feasibility of recovery (Circular 891, p. 23)
Economic feasibility may be evaluated by interrelating coal thickness;
overburden thickness; coal quality; costs of mining, processing, and
transportation; and expected selling price, among other factors. The
reserve assessment provided herein does not address economic factors
as described above.
• Measured Reserves – Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from
dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings, or drill holes; grade
and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and
(b) the sites for inspections, sampling, and measurement are spaced so
closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape,
depth, and mineral content of reserves are well-established. Measured
reserves lie within a 
1
⁄ 4-mile arc around a coal measurement site.
• Indicated Reserves – Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or
quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven
(measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and
measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured)
reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of
observation. Indicated reserves lie more than 
1
⁄ 4 mile, but less than 
3
⁄ 4 of a
mile from a coal measurement site.
The information relating to Atlantic Leaseco, LLC and Maple Coal Co reserves
has been reviewed and approved by Philip L. Evans, Vice-President, Atlantic
Development and Capital LLC, BSC (West Virginia University), MBA (University
of West Virginia College of Graduate Studies).
Energybuild Coal Reserves
The reserves set out on in this Annual Report in relation to Energybuild Group
plc are as estimated by Wardell Armstrong LLP as set out in the Competent
Persons Report dated 6 July 2007 for the AIM admission of Energybuild
Group plc and is reported against the Australasian Code for Reporting of
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves – The JORC Code
(2004 Edition)
• Coal Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or
Indicated Coal Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for
losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate
assessments, which may include feasibility studies, have been carried
out, and include consideration of, and modification by, realistically
assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal,
environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments
demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction is justified. Coal
Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable
Coal Reserves and Proven Coal Reserves.
• Measured Coal Resource is that part of a Coal Resource for which
tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral
content can be estimated with a high level of confidence. It is based on
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are
spaced closely enough to confirm geological and grade continuity.
• Indicated Coal Resource is that part of a Coal Resource for which
tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral
content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is
based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops,
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or
inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or grade continuity but
are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
• Inferred Coal Resource is that part of a Coal Resource for which tonnage,
grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of
confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed, but not
verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which is limited or of
uncertain quality and reliability.
• Probable Coal Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated,
and in some cases a Measured Coal Resource. It includes diluting
materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material
is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out,
and include consideration of, and modification by realistically assumed
mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social
and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time
of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. 
• Proven Coal Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured
Coal Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses,
which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments
and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of, and
modification by, realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic,
marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These
assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could
reasonably be justified. 
• In-Situ Reserves/Resources represents the volume and tonnage of coal
estimated to be present vertically beneath a defined area. Volume is
derived from the measured plan area of the coal seam and the average
vertical thickness of coal/dirt partings, which is converted to tonnes by
specific gravity (SG) conversion factors (anthracite, 1.40 tonnes per cubic
metre). 
• Recoverable Reserves/Resources Estimates of recoverable opencast coal
is based on detailed open pit design, which in addition to allowances for
geological and abandoned mine workings losses, allows for deductions
due to stand off from physical features, batter losses and coal thickness
losses during mining. Estimates of recoverable coal by underground
working at Aberpergwm mine are based generally on provisional loss
factors, without specifying a particular mining method. Estimates of both
recoverable resources and reserves, which in addition for geological and
abandoned workings losses, allows for deductions due to stand-offs
from flooded mine workings and major roadways and area losses due
to mine layout (50 per cent. deduction). Due to the complex tectonic
structure, geological losses of between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent.
have been deducted along with the mining losses, which allows for
losses due to complex faulting, washout and thickness uncertainty.
The information relating to such reserves has been reviewed and approved
by Colin Stocks, Energybuild Director of Mining, who is an Incorporated
Engineer, Engineers Registration Board of the Engineering Council UK and an
Associate Member of the Institute of Mining Engineers.

Prior year adjustments (2006)
During the year, the Board requested a review of the financial
controls of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”)
including a review of the report and financial statements for the
year ended 30 June 2006. This resulted in a requirement for a
number of adjustments and the inclusion of additional
disclosures, plus FRS 20 Share Based Payments was adopted
resulting in a further prior year adjustment. The net effect to the
profit and loss account was an increase in loss before tax of
£2,689,000 from £5,391,000 to £8,080,000. The effect on net
assets was an increase of £7,739,000 from £55,126,000 to
£62,865,000. The adjustments are summarised below and are
set out in detail in Note 1 to the report and financial statements.

The adjustments arose primarily from the accounting for the
acquisitions of King-Coal Corporation Limited and Energybuild
Holdings Limited. Following adjustment to the acquisition
accounting, in accordance with the stated accounting policies,
including the recognition of intangible mineral rights on
acquisition, goodwill within the Group was reduced to nil from
£27,549,000, while the value of mineral rights was increased.
In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and
goodwill, the restated mining properties and mineral rights
carrying value was considered for impairment as at 30 June
2006. This resulted in a write-down to the value of the Pageton
asset of £534,000, reflecting the conditions at that time. Further
information relating to this adjustment is provided in the Loss
analysis below. The net effect on mineral rights was an increase
of £30,280,000 from £10,119,000 to £40,399,000.
A further adjustment has been made to the provisions for
restoration, specifically the provisions relating to the operations
in West Virginia (US). The original provision for ADC was based
on the value of bonds that were in place for each individual
mining property. The bond values represented the amount that
the local authorities believed would be necessary to restore and
rehabilitate each property. These provisions were not
discounted. Following a third party review by an independent
assessor it was determined that the provisions which were
previously based on governmental bond obligations were
understated. The Directors have concluded the need to restate
the provisions (including reflecting the effect of discounting) and
related restoration asset based on the output from this third
party assessment. The effect was to increase restoration assets
by £1,825,000 from £6,973,000 to £8,798,000 and provisions
by £922,000 from £6,770,000 to £7,692,000. 
Finally the Group has also adopted FRS 20 Share Based
Payments for the year ending 30 June 2006; the timing of
adoption is in line with other AIM listed companies. This resulted
in a charge of £1,412,000 being recognised in the 2006 profit
and loss account based on the fair value of options issued to
directors and employees and other share based payments
during the year.
Financial Review 13
The review also identified missing disclosures in the 2006
financial statements, primarily relating to acquisitions, and these
disclosures are incorporated in note 17.
The restated amounts are set out in the 2006 comparatives
along with appropriate disclosures. A detailed reconciliation
and full explanation of each adjustment is included in note 1. 
Loss analysis
The Group reported a loss before tax of £12,424,000 (2006:
restated loss of £8,080,000) and basic and diluted loss per
share from continuing operations of 17.42p (2006: restated loss
of 16.72p) for the year. 
A significant increase in operational activity in North America is
reflected within the increased turnover and a related increase in
cost of sales during the year. This follows the first ramping up of
production at the Group’s West Virginia operations.
Administration expenses have increased in line with the
increase in operational activities. However, also included within
these expenses is a charge of £45,000 and £1,412,000 for the
years ending 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 respectively,
resulting from the adoption of FRS 20 Share Based Payments.
The charge represents the fair value of options and other share
based payments. 
The net loss includes exceptional items totalling £3,522,000
(2006: restated £2,710,000). The first item is a provision against
fixed asset investment representing a decline in the value of
NEMI during the year amounting to £2,511,000 (2006: restated
£2,175,000). The provision reduces the investment value to that
which the directors consider supportable based upon various
considerations including NEMI’s share price, the value of its net
assets and future financing requirements. Further information
relating to this charge is provided in note 3 of the financial
statements. The second charge within exceptional items is the
impairment of mining properties and mineral rights of
£1,011,000 (2006: restated £534,000). This impairment relates
specifically to the Pageton property which is held by ADC. As the
property was put under care and maintenance in November
2006, the directors believe the carrying value was impaired at
30 June 2006 and further impaired in the current year. 
The consolidated profit and loss account as presented on
page 20 allocates both turnover and the Group operating loss
between continuing and discontinued operations. The
discontinued operations comprise the results of Energybuild. On
6 August 2007 Energybuild was admitted to AIM. Following the
admission, the Group’s 50 per cent. interest in Energybuild was
reduced to 23.08 per cent. As a result, for the year ended 30
June 2008, Energybuild will no longer be consolidated in the
Group results as a subsidiary, and it has been presented as a
discontinued operation for the year to 30 June 2007. 
Acquisition and Investment Activity
At 30 June 2006, the Company had a 55.6 per cent. interest in
Energybuild Holdings Ltd. On 14 July 2006 the Company sold its
direct interest in Energybuild Holdings Ltd via a share-for-share
exchange with Energybuild. In accordance with FRS 6
Acquisitions and Mergers the Group has applied merger
accounting to present consolidated information for the Group as
if the new legal structure had always existed. On 20 July 2006
the Company took part in a private placing of Energybuild
acquiring 2,500,000 ordinary shares of 10p each for 20p a
share. Following participation in the placing the Company’s
interest in Energybuild was reduced to 50 per cent..
On 27 November 2006, the Company increased its interest in
NEMI to 20.09 per cent., which remained the interest held at
30 June 2007. On 20 March 2007 Coal International Directors
W. Durand Eppler and John Byrne were elected to NEMI’s Board.
NEMI was accounted for as an associate from the date of the
directors’ appointment and as such a loss of £95,000 is
included in the consolidated profit and loss account
representing the Group’s share of NEMI’s loss for the period.
Financing Activity
On 1 September 2006 the Company entered into a two year
£8,200,000 loan facility with Cambrian Mining Plc to fund the
purchase of equipment and other project finance requirements.
On 13 November 2006 the Company increased the existing loan
facility agreement from £8,200,000 to £13,500,000 plus accrued
interest. The increased facility incorporates an option to convert
the total balance outstanding into ordinary shares of the
Company at 60p per share and is repayable on 13 November
2008 with an option for the Company to extend this to 7 January
2009. This option is considered to have a value of £379,000
which has been determined following the calculation of the fair
value of the loan of £13,933,000. This value has been included
within reserves. The loan has not been converted to date. 
In addition, the following facilities were agreed with Cambrian
Mining Plc during the year:
– Bridging loan for equipment finance of up to US$10,000,000.
This facility was not used by the Company, during the year to
30 June 2007.
– Working capital facility of up to US$12,500,000 to be used to
fund the Maple metallurgical coal project. The facility was
repaid during the year. 
Equity
The Company raised £8,132,000 in cash, net of share issues
expenses, from the issue of 30,334,932 ordinary shares of 10p
each at 28p per share.
Effective 31 May 2007 each shareholder’s existing shareholding
was converted from one existing ordinary share of 50p each to
one ordinary share of 10p each and 4 deferred shares of 10p
each. The deferred shares have no voting rights and are not
admitted to trading on AIM. 14 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007

Corporate Governance
A statement on Corporate Governance is set out on page 16.
Environmental Responsibility
The Company recognises that its role as a coal producer
requires it to have regard to the potential impact that it and its
subsidiary companies may have on the environment. The
Company ensures that its subsidiaries comply with the local
regulatory requirements with regard to the environment and
wherever possible, the Company encourages all related
companies to comply with local regulatory requirements as
well. 16 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
The Board recognises the importance of sound corporate governance commensurate with the size of the Company and the interests of
shareholders. The Company is not required to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial
Reporting Council. However as the Company grows, the Directors intend that it should develop policies and procedures which reflect the
Combined Code so far as is practicable, taking into account the size and nature of the Company.
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors currently comprises three members, two Non-Executive directors and one Executive director. The Directors have a
wealth of experience in the minerals industry. 
Board Meetings
The Board ordinarily meets no less than on a quarterly basis, providing effective leadership and overall management of the Group’s
affairs through the schedule of matters reserved for its decision. This includes the approval of the budget and business plan, major
capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals, risk management policies and the approval of the financial statements. Formal
agendas, papers and reports are sent to the Directors in a timely manner, prior to the board meetings. 
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company’s solicitors and the Company Secretary who is responsible for ensuring that all
Board procedures are followed. Any Director may take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the furtherance of
his duties. 
The Board has established an Audit Committee to provide a forum for reporting by the Company’s external auditors. The Committee is
responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters, including half-year and annual results before their submission to the Board, and for
monitoring the controls that are in force to ensure the integrity of information reported to shareholders. The Committee will advise the
Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration for both audit and non-audit work, and discuss the nature,
scope and results of the audit with the external auditors. The Committee will keep under review the cost effectiveness and the
independence and objectivity of the external auditors. The members of the Audit Committee are John Conlon and John Byrne. 
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee, consisting of John Byrne and John Conlon, who also chairs the committee. The
Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its cost. The Committee will determine the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for the executive
directors, including performance related bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation payments. The Board itself will determine
the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks facing the Group are set out below. Risk assessment and evaluation is an essential part of the Group’s planning and
an important aspect of the Group's internal control system.
General and economic risks:
• Contractions in the world economies or increases in the rate of inflation resulting from international conditions; movements in the
equity and share markets in the United States, United Kingdom and throughout the world. 
• Movements in global equity and share markets and changes in market sentiment towards the resource industry.
• Currency exchange rate fluctuations and, in particular, the relative prices of the US dollar and the UK pound. In particular, for
Energybuild’s operations, coal prices are linked to an index based on the US dollar whilst their costs are denominated in UK pounds.
The US operations are not exposed to this currency exchange rate risk as both their income and costs are denominated in US dollars.
• Exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
• Adverse changes in factors affecting the success of mining operations, such as increases in expenses, changes in government policy
and further regulation of the mining industry; unforeseen major failure, breakdowns or repairs required to key items of mining plant
and equipment or mine structure resulting in significant delays, notwithstanding regular programs of repair, maintenance and
upkeep; and unforeseen adverse geological, mining or prolonged weather conditions.
Funding risk:
• The Company may not be able to raise, either by debt or further equity, sufficient funds to enable completion of planned exploration,
investment and/or mine development projects.
Commodity risk:
• Commodities are subject to high levels of volatility in price and demand and the Group is particularly exposed to movements in coal
and oil prices. The price of commodities depends on a wide range of factors, most of which are outside the control of the Company.
Production costs depend on a wide range of factors, including commodity prices, capital and operating costs in relation to any
operational site. 
Corporate Governance 17
Mining exploration and development risks:
• Timely approval of mining permits and operating plans through the respective regulatory agencies can not be guaranteed. In West
Virginia in particular, increased pressure from the regulatory and approval agencies has resulted from accidents such as at the Sago
Mine (the fatal mining accident which occurred at Wolf Run Mining Company, Sago Mine, West Virginia in January 2006). Coal
producers must also address environmental issues prior to permit approvals. Although it is still possible to work within the guidelines
of the regulatory approval process it could create delays in permit and operating plan approvals necessary to bring on additional
production and planned expansion. 
• Mining exploration and development activity is subject to numerous risks, including failure to achieve estimated mineral resource,
recovery and production rates and capital and operating costs.
• Success in identifying economically recoverable reserves can never be guaranteed. The Company also cannot guarantee that it will
be able to obtain the necessary permits and approvals required for development of their projects.
• The Company may be required to undertake clean-up programmes resulting from any contamination from their operations or to
participate in mine rehabilitation programs which may vary from project to project. The Group follows all necessary laws and
regulations and is not aware of any present material issues in this regard.
• Availability of skilled workers is an ongoing challenge to management. The Company has been successful, to date, in securing
sufficient trained personnel to conduct its operations, although the pool of experienced workers is limited.
• Geology is always a potential risk in mining activities but ADC has implemented supplementary drilling programmes to gain
additional information for the areas planned to be mined in the business plan. The Energybuild mining plan is structured such that
faults will be mapped at the development stage to ensure that disruption once continuous mining or shortwall operations commence
will be kept to a minimum.
Market Risk
• The Company markets its production to a broad range of industrial and utility customers under contracts that range from spot terms
to multi-year contracts. The ability to continue to secure sufficient and profitable sales contracts to support its operations is a key
business risk.
Credit Risk
• As the Group moves toward longer term sales contracts, its credit risk will increase in relation to its contracts with customers.
Internal Controls
The Board recognises the importance of both financial and non-financial controls and has reviewed the Group’s control environment to
identify any areas requiring improvement during the period. This will be a continuing process of monitoring internal controls and
ensuring that control procedures are effective and that they operate efficiently.
Please see the Financial section of the Chairman’s Statement and the Financial Review for details of the financial controls of the Group.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to providing effective communication with the shareholders of the Company. Significant developments are
disseminated through stock exchange announcements. The Company regularly updates its website with developments and news. The
Board sees the Annual General Meeting as a forum for communication between the Company and its shareholders and encourages
their participation in its agenda. 18 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom
Accounting Standards and applicable law). The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
for the year ended 30 June 2007 25
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the
preceding year, other than as set out in note 1.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom accounting standards.
Comparative information
Comparative information has been restated. Please refer to note 1 for an explanation of the nature and impact of prior year
adjustments.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Coal International Plc and its subsidiary undertakings, drawn up to 30 June
2007. The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control
passed. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Revenue recognition
Revenue and the related trade accounts receivable arising from the production and sale of coal under the Group’s sales
contracts are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and title
has passed as specified in the respective contract. The cost of transportation including trucking is recorded as an expense in
the cost of mining.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and
requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
All operating lease payments are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. The
Group has no finance leases.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at
average monthly rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year-end are
translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of the
net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses. All other
exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and loss account.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the
exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the
period in which the operation is disposed of.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Included within Fixed Asset Investments are
reclamation bonds, including equity and debt securities, which are held in investment accounts by third party bonding
companies that provide reclamation bonds to the State of West Virginia.
Statement of Accounting Policies
for the year ended 30 June 2007 26 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control,
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the
associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at
the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair
values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit
or losses in the period of acquisition.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided
where it is necessary to reflect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the
asset to the Group. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated by the straight line method, other than as set out below,
and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are:
Plant & Machinery – between 5 per cent and 25 per cent
Office Equipment – between 15 per cent and 20 per cent
Motor Vehicles – between 5 per cent and 50 per cent
Mines & Surface Work – units of production
Restoration Assets/Rehabilitation Assets – units of production
Freehold Land – no depreciation
Freehold Buildings – 50 years
Mine development
Costs of developing new mines or significantly expanding the capacity of existing mines are capitalised until the mine begins
production at which point these assets are amortised on a units-of-production basis. Revenue generated from mining
production of properties being developed is offset against the costs of the new mines during development.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets as part of an acquisition of a
business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to
the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does
not create or increase any negative goodwill arising on the acquisition. Intangible assets created within the business are not
capitalised and expenditure is charged against profit in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible mining properties and mineral rights are amortised on a units of production basis. The carrying value of intangible
assets is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full year following acquisition and in other periods if events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Grants
Grants relate to funds received under the Coal Investment Aid Scheme in Wales. These grants were used to acquire fixed
assets and are held in the balance sheet as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the life of the
asset to which it relates. 
There exists the possibility of grants having to be repaid if all terms and conditions of the grant are not subsequently adhered
to. The directors have reviewed the level of grants received to date and believe that there are no grounds on which any such
repayment could occur, including grants awarded of approximately £105,000 where the expenditure was incurred by a
predecessor operator of the mine.

Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future
have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that,
at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in
future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions for liabilities
A provision has been recognised for the rehabilitation, restoration and dismantling obligations associated with the retirement
or disposal of mine site assets. Upon initial recognition of the provision, a corresponding amount is capitalised as part of the
carrying amount of a restoration asset. The provision is measured at the present value of the estimated future expenditure
with the corresponding adjustment going to the cost of the asset. The capitalised cost is amortised over the life of the
estimated mine reserves on a units of production basis and the provision is increased as further disturbance occurs, creating
a further obligation to rehabilitate. The unwinding of discount of the provision is included within ‘finance charges’.
The provision along with the mine life will be reconsidered annually.
Share based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS 20 (IFRS 2) Share-Based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of
grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes Model. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Coal royalties
Certain land lease agreements provide for the payment of minimum royalties which are recoupable from future coal
production. Minimum payments paid in advance are deferred and recorded within prepayments. These prepayments are
charged to the cost of coal sales as mining occurs or recorded as an expense at the earlier of the expiration of the
recoupment period or at the same time the current mining plans indicate that they will not be recoupable and therefore have
become impaired.
Stocks
Stocks consist of raw and clean stockpiles which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finance costs
Finance costs of financial liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a
constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of
those assets. The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being
incurred and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when
substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
Financial liabilities and equity
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. 28 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
Convertible loan notes
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar
non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned
to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in
equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar
non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest 
paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

1. Prior year adjustment
As described in the Financial Review on page 12, following the identification of a number of misstatements and missing
disclosures in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006, the Board requested a review of the financial
controls of the Group including a review of the 2006 report and statements. These misstatements have been corrected
and reflected as restated comparative amounts in these financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007. 
A reconciliation of the amounts originally stated to restated amounts for each primary statement is provided below.

Impact on Balance Sheet
(i) As described in note 17, during the year ended 30 June 2006 the company acquired the remaining interest in
King-Coal Corporation Limited (King-Coal) and a further interest in Energybuild Holdings Limited (Energybuild).
During the review process described above, management revisited the accounting treatment of both of these
acquisitions. Revised acquisition notes have been presented within note 17. These reflect both revised book
values of assets and liabilities acquired and, where applicable, fair value adjustments as these were not
reflected within the original acquisition accounting. 
It was concluded that the fair value of intangible mineral rights acquired as part of the acquisition of King-Coal
was £33,411,000 and therefore no goodwill arose on the transaction. This fair value uplift was based upon an
assessment of the future cash flows which were expected to be generated at the Gauley Eagle and Pageton
mining properties. There were no other fair value adjustments associated with the King-Coal acquisition.
(ii) Management concluded that the fair value of intangible mineral rights acquired as part of the acquisition of
Energybuild was £5,075,000 and therefore no goodwill arose on the transaction. This fair value was based on
an assessment of the future cash flows which were expected to be generated at the open-cast and
underground coal mines owned by Energybuild. An additional fair value adjustment relating to the acquisition
of Energybuild arose where it was concluded that there was a nil value attributable to grants previously received
under the Coal Investment Aid Scheme. The amount included as a liability at book value within Energybuild, was
in accordance with SSAP 4 and reflected the amount of deferred income remaining to be recognised over the
term of the grant (£1,475,000). However as the fixed assets acquired are recognised at fair value, there is no
similar liability to the Group on acquisition.  33
1. Prior year adjustment continued
(a) Adjustments to acquisition accounting continued
(iii) Following the above review, it was determined that a consistent treatment of goodwill and intangible assets
should be applied to previous acquisitions of the group. On the 12 December 2005, the Company acquired the
remaining interest in Maple Coal Corporation Limited, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of £2,545,000.
However, in accordance with the revised treatment of other acquisitions which took place in the year,
management believe ‘goodwill’ is more accurately classified as ‘mineral rights’ and as such have reclassified
this balance accordingly.
A reconciliation between opening mineral rights at 30 June 2005 and restated closing mineral rights is provided in the
table below reflecting the acquisition accounting adjustments described above as well as additional adjustments as noted:
£’000
At 30 June 2005 –
Recognised on acquisition of King-Coal Corporation Limited (i) 33,411
Recognised on acquisition of Energybuild Holdings Limited (ii) 5,075
Recognised on acquisition of Maple Coal Corporation Limited (iii) 2,545
Amortisation of mineral rights (b) (98)
Impairment write-down of mineral rights (e) (534)
Restated at 30 June 2006 40,399
Impact on profit and loss account
In addition to the matters described above, management also revised the pre-acquisition results previously
eliminated as part of the acquisition accounting, the correction of which had a net impact of (£83,000) as follows:
£’000
Increase in cost of sales (592)
Decrease in operating expenses 509
Adjustment of pre-acquisition result eliminated from consolidation (83)
Impact on statement of recognised gains and losses
The fair value adjustments described above resulted in the recognition of a revaluation reserve of £10,258,469. The
reserve represents the Group’s share of the increase in fair value of the net assets in King-Coal and Energybuild
between the dates each became an associate and the dates they became a subsidiary. 
Impact on equity
An additional adjustment related to the acquisition of Energybuild during the period was to the cost of acquisition,
which was adjusted to reflect the market price on the date of acquisition in order to calculate the fair value of shares
issued. As shares were issued at a premium, the adjustment to the acquisition cost is an adjustment of £848,000 to
the share premium account.
The effect of the above adjustments to the fair value of consideration and the fair value of assets and liabilities
acquired are reflected in the minority interest. 
(b) Amortisation of mineral rights
As a result of the recognition of additional mineral rights on the acquisition of King-Coal and Energybuild, additional
amortisation relating to the restated balance was calculated on a units-of-production basis, which amounted to £98,000. 
(c) Share-based payments
As described within the Statement of accounting policies and in note 32, the company has adopted FRS 20 (IFRS 2)
Share Based Payment for the year ended 30 June 2007 and management has decided to restate the results for the
year ended 30 June 2006 on a comparable basis. In accordance with FRS 20, management has classified the
options awarded to directors during the 2006 year as ‘equity-settled share-based payment transactions’.
Accordingly a charge of £1,411,800 has been recognised during the year based on the fair value of the options
issued. Information relating to options issued and the related charge is provided in note 32. 
(d) Share of associate result
As described in note 17, King-Coal was an associate of the company prior to the acquisition of the remaining interest
on 12 December 2005. The share of King-Coal’s profit for the period 1 July 2005 to 12 December 2005 has been
calculated and included within the profit and loss account.  34 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2007 continued
1. Prior year adjustment continued
(e) Impairment of mineral rights
As described in note 14, the directors have concluded that intangible mineral rights associated with the Pageton
property held by Atlantic Development and Capital LLC (ADC), a subsidiary of King-Coal, were impaired at both
30 June 2006 and further impaired at 30 June 2007. The 2006 write-down of £534,246 reflects conditions that
management believe were present at the original date of signing of the 2006 financial statements and therefore
provides a more prudent reflection of the underlying asset values at that time.
(f) Adjustment to provision for restoration
As shown in note 22, the provision for restoration is allocated between the US and the UK. 
The US provision relates to the ADC operations in West Virginia. The original provision for ADC was based on the
value of bonds that were in place for each individual mining property. The bond values represented the amount that
the local authorities believed would be necessary to restore and rehabilitate each property. These provisions were
not discounted. Following a third party review by an independent assessor it was determined that the provisions
which were previously based on governmental bond obligations were understated. The Directors have concluded
the need to restate the provisions (including reflecting the effect of discounting) and related restoration asset based
on the output from this third party assessment. 
The UK provision relates to the Energybuild operations in Wales. As the majority of restoration activity at Energybuild
for the surface mines was planned to take place in the near term, it was considered that discounting was not
appropriate. The restoration provision level for the drift mine has been reassessed and discounted to present day
value the net effect of which is no restatement of the UK provision balance at 30 June 2006. 
Impact on Balance Sheet
The net impact on the balance sheet at 30 June 2006 as a result of restating the provisions is as follows:
£’000
Increase in restoration asset 1,805
Increase in restoration provision (922)
Adjustment to costs of for restoration 883
Impact on Profit and loss account
The net impact on the profit and loss account as a result of restating the provisions is as follows:
£’000
Increase in interest expense: unwinding discount on provisions (541)
Increase in depreciation charge (84)
Adjustment to costs of restoration (625)
(g) Reclassification between intangible and tangible assets
The reclassification between intangible assets and tangible assets of £2,649,573 arose due to a difference in
presentation of ‘Construction in Progress’ and ‘Mine Development’ at the date of acquisition of King-Coal and at the
2006 year end. At the date of acquisition these assets were included within tangible assets however, at the year end
these assets were included within intangible assets. Management determined these assets were tangible in nature
and as such have amended the classification at 30 June 2006.
(h) Correction of foreign exchange translation differences on foreign currency net investments in subsidiaries
The correction of foreign exchange translation differences on foreign currency net investments in subsidiaries relates
to the foreign currency movement of a US-denominated loan to the group’s wholly-owned subsidiary Atlantic
Development and Capital, based in the USA. The original calculation of the exchange difference did not include an
additional advance provided to the subsidiary during the year under the terms of an existing facility. The inclusion of
this advance, resulted in a foreign currency loss of £1,778,200 which is included in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses as the loan is considered to be a net investment in a foreign operation. In addition, the opening
foreign currency translation reserve gain of £1,037,000 was reclassified from retained earnings to foreign currency
translation reserve. 35
1. Prior year adjustment continued
Cash flow statement
As a result of the restatements to the profit and loss account and balance sheet, a number of adjustments were made to
the presentation of the cash flow statement. The adjustments reflect the cash effect of the underlying transactions which
occurred during the year. As shown in the cash flow statement reconciliation above the cash flow statement as
presented showed a decrease in cash during the year of £16,791,000 whereas the restated cash flow statement shows a
decrease in cash of £16,167,000, despite there being no restatement of the net cash balances. This is the result of the
original cash flow including an increase in external debt of £624,863. The restated cash flow statement which excludes
this item shows the movement in cash as follows:
£’000
Net Cash at 1 July 2005 16,164

Exceptional items
(a) The impairment of mining properties and mineral rights arose in relation to the Pageton property held by Atlantic
Development & Capital LLC. This property was put under care and maintenance in November 2006 and is currently
being held with a view to sell. Refer to note 1(e) for additional information. 
(b) The provision against fixed asset investment at 30 June 2006 arose as the directors believed there was a permanent
reduction in the value of NEMI Northern Energy & Mining Inc (NEMI) due to the fact that in October 2006 NEMI
announced that it had voluntarily sought and obtained protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act
(CCAA) pursuant to an order of the Supreme Court of British Columbia Canada.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, NEMI concluded an agreement with Hillsborough Resources Limited and
Anglo Coal Canada Limited whereby the metallurgical coal assets of the three entities were consolidated into a new
entity, Peace River Coal Limited Partnership. Following completion of the asset combination transaction NEMI filed a  37

closing certificate with the Supreme Court of British Columbia which resulted in NEMI’s full emergence from CCAA
protection. However, given a further decline in market value of NEMI shares, the directors have determined that there
is a further permanent reduction in the value of the investment. The remaining investment value is considered
supportable based on the expected cash flows from the Peace River Coal Limited Partnership.

securities which are held in investment accounts by third party bonding companies that provide reclamation bonds to the

(c) During the year proceeds were received for the partial release of reclamation bonds.
(d) Investments are carried at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. The provisions for impairment
relate to the investment in NEMI. 
The provision against fixed asset investment at 30 June 2006 arose as the directors believed there was a permanent
reduction in the value of NEMI due to the fact that in October 2006 NEMI announced that it had voluntarily sought
and obtained protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) pursuant to an order of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia Canada.
During the year ended 30 June 2007, NEMI concluded an agreement with Hillsborough Resources Limited and
Anglo Coal Canada Limited whereby the metallurgical coal assets of the three entities were consolidated into a new
entity, Peace River Coal Limited Partnership. Following completion of the asset combination transaction NEMI filed a
closing certificate with the Supreme Court of British Columbia which resulted in NEMI’s full emergence from CCAA
protection. However, given a further decline in market value of NEMI shares, the directors determined that there is a
further permanent reduction in the value of the investment. The remaining investment value is considered
supportable based on the expected cash flows from the Peace River Coal Limited Partnership.
17. Acquisition of subsidiary undertakings 
Acquisition of Energybuild Group Plc
At 30 June 2006, the company had a 55.6 per cent. interest in Energybuild Holdings Ltd. On 14 July 2006 the company
sold their direct interest in Energybuild Holdings Ltd via a share-for-share exchange with Energybuild Group Plc whereby
Energybuild Group Plc issued 44,499,000 shares of 10p each in consideration for 100 per cent. interest in Energybuild
Holdings Ltd. In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 6 (FRS) “Acquisitions and Mergers” the Group has applied
merger accounting to present consolidated information for the Group as if the new legal structure had always existed.
The Company has taken advantage of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 and the investment has been recorded at
the nominal value of the shares issued.
On 20 July 2006 the Company took part in a private placing of Energybuild Group Plc acquiring 2,500,000 ordinary
shares of 10p each for 20p a share in consideration for waiving outstanding debt of £500,000. Following participation in
the placing the Company’s interest in Energybuild Group Plc was reduced to 50 per cent. 
On 6 August 2007, Energybuild Group Plc listed on AIM. Following the placing and admission of Energybuild Group Plc to
trading on AIM, the Group’s holding in the Energybuild Group Plc was 23.08 per cent. of the issued share capital and
total voting rights.

The fair value adjustment represents an uplift to intangible mineral rights to the value the Directors consider is
appropriate based on the underlying cash flows of the mining properties acquired. The fair value adjustment to deferred
grants received arose as it was concluded that there was a nil value attributable to grants previously received by
Energybuild under the Coal Investment Aid Scheme. The original amount included as a liability at book value within
Energybuild, was in accordance with SSAP 4 and reflected the amount of deferred income remaining to be recognised
over the term of the grant. However as the fixed assets of the Group are acquired at fair value, there is no similar liability
to the Group on acquisition. 47

assets. During the year, £12,624 was released to the profit and loss account to match the depreciation on related assets.
Long-term debt to banks includes bank and lender financing of equipment purchases secured on the related mine
machinery and equipment. Interest on these loans principally ranges from 6.75 per cent. to 9.57 per cent. at 30 June

loan facility. The loan is convertible at the discretion of the lender into ordinary shares in Coal International Plc at 60p per
share and is due for repayment on 13 November 2008, with an option by the Company to extend this to 7 January 2009.
The equity component of the loan, being the holders right to convert has been valued at £379,430 based on an effective
interest rate for the liability component of 8.5 per cent. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.5 per cent. Refer to note 34
for further information.
The 2006 loan for £1,989,000 is a US dollar loan with Cambrian Mining Plc, which incurred interest at the greater of 7.5%
or LIBOR plus 2.5%.

Provision for restoration – US
The provision for restoration in the US primarily consists of estimated spending related to reclaiming surface land and
support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as
defined by each mining permit. Obligations are incurred at the time development of a mine commences for
underground mines and surface facilities or for support facilities, refuse areas and slurry ponds when construction
begins. Current estimates are based on a third party review by Marshall Miller and Associates Inc which was completed
in May 2007. Marshall Miller and Associates Inc are Civil, Environmental, and Mining Engineering – Geology, Oil and Gas
Experts. Restoration costs are expected to be incurred between 2008 and 2033.
Provision for restoration – UK
The provision for restoration in the UK consists of the following:
Restoration and closure costs – Drift mines
Shaft treatment and pit top provisions are made to meet the liability to fill and cap all mine shafts and return pit top areas
to a condition consistent with the required planning permission. No transfer of economic benefits will arise until
decommissioning of each individual colliery. The current pit top provision reflects existing planning permissions that
require pit top areas to be restored to former use, usually agriculture. The provision level has been reassessed and the
current value represents the cost of the restoration obligations discounted to present day value.  50 Coal International Plc  Annual Report & Financial Statements 2007

22. Provisions for Liabilities continued
Restoration and closure costs – Surface mines
This provision relates to the total estimated costs of reinstatement of soil excavation and of surface restoration such as
topsoil replacement and landscaping. Restoration costs will be payable when individual sites are completed and
payments against aftercare liabilities will extend beyond the life of each contract. The costs accrued are expected to be
incurred during the next two years. The restoration liability is expected to be completed in the near term and therefore
discounting the provision is not required.

Stock Option Plan
On 30 May 2007, shareholders approved the company’s Stock Option Plan. This plan enables the Company to issue
options over its Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate number of 1.5 million shares to employees of the Atlantic
Development & Capital LLC (“ADC”) subsidiaries, based in the United States. The options granted pursuant to the Stock
Option Plan will have an exercise price being the market value of the Ordinary Shares as at the date of grant. The vesting
period of the options issued to existing employees will reflect the length of service of employees at the date the options
are granted. Future vesting will be conditional upon continued employment. New employees may be granted options
which will vest over a period of years with the first portion of their options expected to vest after at least one year.
The Stock Option Plan will be administered by a compensation committee of the board of the Company which will
include one director of ADC. This committee will have the discretion to set the vesting period for any options granted on
an individual basis taking into account the prevailing circumstances. No options had been issued under this plan as at
30 June 2007.

Mineral Extraction and Handling Limited (MEHL) has the benefit of an Option Agreement and agreement for lease dated
14 June 2006 between it and Rhidian Davies. By this Option Agreement MEHL granted to Rhidian Davies the right for the
period commencing on and including 14 June 2006 and ending at 5.00pm on 14 June 2008 to purchase six parcels of
freehold land at Crynant in Neath (the Treforgan Land). The Option Agreement requires that immediately following

payable to Rhidian Davies being (1) the sum of £750,000, less any advances paid to Rhidian Davies under the original
fee; and (2) a commission, payable quarterly in arrears for the duration of the term of the lease granted by Rhidian

services. The outstanding balance at 30 June 2007 was £9,313 (2006: nil).

On 13 November 2006 the Company entered into an agreement with Cambrian Mining Plc to increase the loan facility
agreement from £8,200,000 to £13,500,000 plus accrued interest, and provide for the conversion of the total balance
outstanding under the facility into equity. The loan is convertible into ordinary shares in Coal International at 60p, which,
at 30 June 2007, assuming principal and interest is converted at the end of term, would increase Cambrian’s
shareholding to 46 per cent. The loan has not yet been converted and bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.5 per cent. At 30
June 2007 the gross amount outstanding was £14,311,178 which has been allocated between an equity and debt
component. Interest of £786,186 was incurred on the loan during the year. Prior to this agreement the company had an
outstanding USD denominated loan with Cambrian as at 30 June 2006 for £1,988,764.
On 13 November 2006 the Company reached an agreement with Cambrian for the provision of a further bridging loan

had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4 per cent. The facility was repaid during the year including interest of £59,135.
Pursuant to a series of letters dated from 9 March 2006 to 5 July 2006, Cambrian lent an aggregate amount of £700,000
to Coal Internationals subsidiary Energybuild Group Plc on an unsecured and demand basis. On 1 March 2007 a loan
facility agreement was entered into to replace the aforementioned letters and to provide the terms on which the
aforementioned indebtedness would be governed. The facility agreement also provided the company via its immediate
holding company with a further facility of £500,000. Pursuant to the terms of the facility agreement, interest was charged
on the aggregate principal outstanding at the rate of LIBOR plus a variable margin, which is determined by Cambrian’s
banking facility with Investec Bank (UK) Limited. The principal amount of the loan is repayable on demand. Pursuant to a
letter dated 21 April 2007 Cambrian agreed to extend the loan facility provided under the facility agreement to
£1,900,000. Interest of £100,218 has been accrued making the balance at 30 June 2007 £2,000,218. (2006: £450,000).

guarantees.
35. Post balance sheet events
On 6 August 2007, Coal International’s 50 per cent. owned subsidiary Energybuild Group Plc listed on AIM having placed
75 million shares at 20p per share. Following the placing and admission of Energybuild Group Plc to trading on AIM, the
Group’s holding in Energybuild Group Plc was 30,000,000 ordinary shares, representing 23.08 per cent. of the issued
share capital and total voting rights. As a result, Energybuild Group Plc will become an associate of the Group and has
consequently been treated as a discontinued operation in these financial statements. The Group is in the process of
determining the financial effect of this transaction.
On 12 December 2007, Atlantic Leaseco LLC, a subsidiary of Atlantic Development and Capital LLC signed an offer to
lease with First National Capital Corporation (FNCC) for an amount of US$4,000,000, subject to final inspection and

Oil & Gas
New Build Jackup Drilling Rigs
Lamprell is firmly established as one  
of the world’s leading facilities for the 
construction of new build jackup  
drilling rigs.
With a highly sophisticated engineering 
capability and custom-built construction  
and load out facilities, Lamprell has 
gained a reputation as a reliable and 
professional builder of state-of-the-art 
drilling rigs. The Group has successfully 
delivered several LeTourneau 116E and 
Friede & Goldman Super Mod II jackup 
rigs to international and regional drilling 
operators.
New Build Offshore
Lamprell’s expertise in the new build 
offshore segment extends beyond jackup 
drilling rigs and covers a wide range of 
offshore vessels and structures. This 
includes the design and construction of 
process modules for floating production, 
storage and offloading units (“FPSOs”) 
and floating storage and regasification 
units (“FSRUs”|), tender assist drilling 
barges, mobile offshore production  
units (“MOPUs”), offshore drilling rig 
components and accessories, living 
quarters, turrets and other offshore 
fixed structures. 
Rig Refurbishment
Since 1990, Lamprell has completed 
over 300 rig refurbishment projects. 
The rig refurbishment scope varies with 
every project and can range from a 
simple repair to a major docking lasting 
several months for the upgrade or 
replacement of older and sometimes 
damaged equipment and machinery. 05 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
The Company has successfully 
completed numerous refurbishment 
projects for drilling contractors, including 
Noble Drilling, Ensco, Rowan, Saipem, 
Transocean, Nabors, National Drilling 
Company, Arabian Drilling Company 
and Japan Drilling Company.

vessels for Seajacks and Fred. Olsen 
Windcarrier; two major companies in 
this expanding marketplace.
The offshore wind sector provides 
Lamprell with the opportunity to utilise 
its engineering skills in a sector where 
there is a recognised lack of installation 
capacity. Having constructed two such

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 06 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Chairman’ s Statement
Jonathan Silver
USD 1 ,098m
New contract awards
2011 was a landmark year for Lamprell 
in a number of ways. The Group 
reported revenues of USD 1,148m, the 
largest annual revenue in the Group’s 
history, an increase of 128% on 2010 
and adjusted net profit of USD 73.8m, 
10.9% higher than the prior year; the 
Group secured contract awards 
totalling USD 1,098m, the second 
highest in the Group’s history; and the 
Group’s year-end order book, amounting 
to USD 1,215m, is a record. The Group 
continues to be committed to high 
quality and timely project execution.
The Group completed its first significant 
acquisition with the NOK 1,869m (USD 
338m) purchase of Maritime Industrial 
Services Co. Ltd. Inc. (“MIS”), a 
diversified engineering and contracting 
group focused on the energy sector with 
its principal operations based in Sharjah 
in the UAE. Despite the complexities of 
the transaction, the acquisition was 
completed (post the initial negotiations) 
in only 67 days. In the process, the 
Company launched its first ever rights 
issue, which achieved a 99.8% acceptance 
from shareholders and raised equity, 
debt and guarantee facilities totalling,  
in aggregate, USD 530m.
The acquisition of MIS has added 
complementary service businesses 
to the Group’s existing offering, a 
presence in a number of countries in 
the region including, most significantly, 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it has 
enhanced the Group’s in-house 
engineering capabilities and provided 
375,000m
2
 of additional yard and 
fabrication space. The combined 
Group now employs in excess of 
14,000 people, including labour supply 
personnel, working in multiple locations 
across eight countries. The process of 
integrating MIS and its subsidiaries 
into the Group has progressed more 
quickly than was anticipated and is 
expected to be completed prior to the 
first anniversary of the acquisition. 
Management is confident that the 
annual synergies that will be brought 
about following the acquisition will  
meet the target of USD 11m.
The Company formally opened its 
expanded Hamriyah facility at a 
ceremony marking the official launch  
of the Group’s main facility following 
over three years of construction and  
an investment of over USD 75m. The 
Company was extremely honoured to 
have His Highness Sheikh Sultan  
bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, Supreme 
Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, 
open the facility. With a surface area  
of 365,000m² and a quayside of over 
1.4km, the Hamriyah yard is one  
of the region’s foremost facilities for  
the manufacture of oil & gas assets, 
with capacity to accommodate more 
than 10 jackup rigs at the quayside 
simultaneously and multiple new build 
rigs in various stages of construction 
within the yard. The Hamriyah facility 
201 1 was a landmark year for Lamprell. 07 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011

Value of our order book at year end  
demonstrates the Group’s determination 
to build its business further and is 
already playing a key part in broadening 
the Group’s offering to its widening 
customer base.
The Group’s record year-end order 
book and strong bid pipeline reflect 
the high level of interest there is in 
Lamprell’s services, a point reinforced 
during 2011 by the multiple major 
contract awards with leading 
international clients including contracts 
to construct five new build jackups, 
a wellhead and production utility 
quarters platform for Nexen and two 
new build land rigs. The Nexen contract 
is a significant step for the Group in 
terms of developing the North Sea 
market and its increased scale.
That these achievements came against 
a backdrop of continuing economic 
volatility was particularly pleasing, 
demonstrating the strength of the 
Group’s offering even in more difficult 
times. We are, however, very watchful 
of any impact that continuing economic 
concerns may have on our principal 
markets and will continue to work hard 
to maintain both the quality of our work 
and the flexibility of our business model 
to seek to ensure that Lamprell can 
respond rapidly to any changes in the 
health of the industry supply chain.
In January of last year, Christopher 
Hand joined the Board as Chief 
Operating Officer and in October,  
we welcomed Jonathan Cooper as  
our Chief Financial Officer with his 
predecessor Scott Doak taking a new 
role within the Group. We are fortunate 
to add Jonathan’s undoubted skills in 
both the finance and oil sectors to 
our Board whilst retaining Scott’s 
knowledge of our business in an 
important new role. I am also delighted 
to welcome Deena Mattar to the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from the beginning of April 2012. Deena 
Mattar, who was formerly Group 
Finance Director of Kier Group plc and 
holds non-executive directorships at 
Invensys plc and RM plc, will assume 
the role of Chairman of the Audit 
Committee when Richard Raynaut 
retires in June of this year. We are 
extremely grateful to Richard for the 
significant contribution he has made to 
the Company during the last six years.
These are exciting times for the Group 
and I am pleased to announce that, 
having considered the current market 
conditions, profit earned and cash 
generated during the year ended 
31 December 2011, the Board is 
recommending a dividend of 8.00 
cents per share. If approved, this will be 
paid to shareholders on 22 June 2012 
provided they were on the register on 
25 May 2012.
I am confident that Lamprell’s 
reputation for quality, the safe execution 
of work, its technical capabilities, 
project execution and delivery, coupled 
with the dedication and expertise of 
Lamprell’s management and staff, will 
enable the Company to continue to 
deliver value for all its stakeholders.

Our strategy to achieve the Group’s objective: 09 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
This objective is at the core of the newly 
enlarged Group. The success of the 
MIS acquisition, and its subsequent 
integration, has broadened the Group’s 
capabilities and geographic reach to 
ensure that our clients can depend on 
our world class service throughout the 
life of their key assets. 
Our strategy of partnering with our 
clients not only enhances the service 
we provide, but also increases our 
ability to influence decision-making at 
the early stages of major projects, 
thereby ensuring quality and control of 
the product, as well as enhancing our 
project visibility and risk management.
In addition, we are continuing to develop 
a range of key strategic partnerships 
to ensure we move nearer to our goal 
of providing a seamless service that 
continues Lamprell’s reputation for 
delivery excellence and advances our 
geographic and sector reach. 
The Group has seen strong growth 
in our offshore new build sector, 
particularly jackup and wind farm 
projects, and our goal is to continue 
these successes and support our clients 
as they move towards larger and more 
complex assets. Our strategy over the 
last three years, of investing for the long 
term in our state of the art facilities, 
provides us with the capacity and 
strength to ensure we are in prime 
position to meet these goals. In addition, 
we are committed to the continued 
enhancement of our engineering 
capabilities to ensure we are leading 
major projects from inception to 
completion, and the newly combined 
Engineering Services group is the latest 
step in a strategy to move engineering to 
the forefront of the Group’s activities.
In parallel to this offshore-driven 
growth, we have substantially 
broadened our strategy for the onshore 
market following the integration of MIS’s 
key capabilities in this area. Through 
our newly combined onshore business,  
we are focused on providing the full 
range of services to major onshore 
clients, supporting them in the new 
build, refurbishment and upgrade 
phases of their operations and ensuring 
that our geographic expansion opens 
up substantial new opportunities for 
this exciting area of the business. 
We are also focused on the growth and 
development of our range of smaller 
complementary service businesses, 
as they extend their reach into key 
growth markets. Our inspection and 
H
2
S safety divisions are amongst the 
strongest in the Middle East region 
and continue to be valued partners 
to an increasing number of our clients. 
Our Operations & Maintenance 
business is a focus for the coming 
year as we look to enhance its 
capabilities and maximise our cross-
selling opportunities in this important 
service line.
This strategy gives a clear path for 
growth, one which builds on the core 
strengths and traditions of the Group 
to ensure that it continues to capitalise 
on sustainable growth opportunities 
and maximise client service levels, 
whilst ensuring the highest standards 
in health, safety, environment and 
staff welfare.

onshore and offshore industries and 
to provide it with an expanded 
regional presence.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 12 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
USD 333m
Contract award from National Drilling Company 
in Abu Dhabi 
2011 was a very positive year for the 
Company, with contract awards 
totalling USD 1.1bn together with a 
backlog of USD 1.2bn at the year-end. 
The transformational acquisition of 
Maritime Industrial Services Co. Ltd. 
Inc. (“MIS”) significantly contributed to 
consolidating our position as a market 
leader in the provision of contracting 
products and services in the oil & gas 
and renewables industry together with 
increasing our reach into new regional 
markets. Ongoing strength in the oil 
price has also helped to bolster a 
record bid pipeline and we ended the 
year with unprecedented levels of 
enquiries and bid activity. 
The results for the year were very pleasing 
with revenues totalling USD 1,148m, 
resulting in an adjusted net profit for  
the year of USD 73.8m (USD 63.3m 
after exceptional charges) reinforcing  
the firm commercial foundations of  
the business.
Our longstanding strategy of 
maintaining a strong balance sheet has 
continued to underpin our disciplined 
fiscal approach to our business even as 
markets became more active, and 
this rigorous control remains central 
to our activities.
We also continue to focus on delivering 
best in class execution of projects, and 
once again in 2011 we saw the benefits 
of this delivery-led strategy as repeat 
business contributed significantly to 
revenues. 
The Group maintains a substantial 
order book extending to Q2 2014 which 
at the end of 2011, was USD 1.2bn, 
comprising USD 914m from new build 
marine projects, USD 220m from 
offshore construction projects, 
including offshore wellhead platforms, 
floating production storage and 
offloading units and accommodation 
modules, USD 17m from Land Rig 
Services, USD 14m from Jackup Rig 
Refurbishment projects, and USD 50m 
from the Group’s other fabrication 
activities and subsidiary operating 
companies.
The Company continues to place great 
emphasis on the development and 
application of practices designed to 
provide a workplace that is both safe 
and which minimises environmental 
impact. We are proud of our safety 
record; in 2011 the lost-time injury 
frequency was 0.27 , significantly below 
the UK construction industry average 
for similar businesses.
There remains widespread uncertainty 
regarding the macro economic climate, 
although we have seen negligible 
impact on our business. Continued 
strength in the oil price has ensured 
that operator activity and investment

Value of our order book at year end  
from repeat customers
remains high, and sentiment 
throughout the industry supply chain is 
positive. However, we can never be 
complacent about this situation given 
the prevailing macro economic issues 
and we continue to keep a close watch 
on our costs and ability to remain 
flexible throughout the business.
The year was a very strong one for contract 
wins, with awards being boosted by 
contracts for New Build Jackup, New 
Build Offshore and Land Rig Services. 
Significant project milestones during 
the year included the contract award 
from Greatship Global Energy 
Services, Singapore, announced in 
February 2011. This award was an 
early indicator of the strength of the 
jackup rig market throughout the year; 
strength that was further demonstrated 
both by the exercise by the National 
Drilling Company, Abu Dhabi, of its 
option for the construction by Lamprell 
of two LeTourneau Super 116E Class 
jackup rigs valued at USD 333m, and 
the contract award by Jindal Pipes 
(Singapore) also for a LeTourneau 
Super 116E Class jackup rig. 
The USD 41m contract with Weatherford 
Drilling International, announced in 
March 2011, for the engineering, 
construction and delivery of two 3000 
HP land drilling rigs, was the largest 
yet for our Land Rig Services business, 
demonstrating the exciting opportunity 
to develop Lamprell’s offering in this 
emerging regional market. Delivery of 
the rigs is scheduled for Q1 2012 and 
construction is almost complete at our 
Jebel Ali facility.
We were also pleased to announce in 
November 2011 the award, by Nexen 
Petroleum U.K. Limited, of two platform 
deck construction contracts for the 
Golden Eagle Development in the UK 
North Sea. The offshore fixed platform 
market remains strong and the 
Company is well positioned to benefit 
from that strength both regionally and 
internationally.
Acquisition of MIS
The acquisition of MIS, for a total 
consideration of NOK 1,869m (USD 
338m), was completed on 13 July 2011, 
and was a transformational step for  
the Group. The acquisition expanded 
the breadth and depth of our service 
offering, our customer base, the 
geographical range of our operations 
and consolidated Lamprell’s position  
as a regional leader in the new build 
jackup rig market. Additionally, the 
significant increase in resources and 
expertise also further enhances our 
position for future profitable growth.
The acquisition of MIS was compelling 
both financially and operationally. We 
believe that this transaction will rapidly 
create value for our shareholders, and 
we anticipate that the transaction will 
be substantially earnings accretive in 
the first full year of ownership. As the 
enlarged Group moves forward we 
see both new business opportunities 
and operational and financial synergies, 
with cost synergies of USD 11m per 
year expected to be realised as 
planned. Lamprell now has over 
925,000m
2
 of yard space and 2.2km 
of quayside, making the Company 
one of the largest players within the 
Middle East region. 
 
The strong complementary fit between 
Lamprell and MIS has enhanced 
our in-house engineering capabilities, 
providing extra capacity and key 
resources and adding a number of 
established businesses in target 
geographies. Lamprell is now able 
to pursue new opportunities through 
its enhanced resource and 
technical competence. 
 
We see real competitive advantage in 
the Company’s newly combined 
engineering offering and our ability to 
offer a vertically integrated service to our 
clients through conceptual engineering, 
process design engineering and detailed

engineering. This will help increase 
margins by removing the need to 
outsource process design engineering, 
and the enlarged Group now has greater 
access to new business in the 
downstream and onshore sectors.
 
Management initiated a detailed 
integration plan with an integration 
committee appointed involving senior 
representatives from both Lamprell and 
MIS in order to identify and maximise 
synergies. Following meetings of the 
committee the organisational structure 
of the enlarged Group was finalised  
and savings identified. Integration of  
the two companies has been largely 
completed, with the operational 
structure finalised and in place. 
 
The physical relocation of the MIS 
management and finance teams has 
taken place and operationally the 
integration of yards is complete. 
Notably, the MIS facility in Sharjah has 
been integrated with the adjacent 
Lamprell yard. 
The acquisition added over 4,000 
people to our workforce which now 
totals 14,000 including labour supply 
personnel, and it is to the great credit of 
all our staff that the integration process 
has proceeded smoothly.
The Board
In April, Jonathan Cooper was 
appointed as Chief Financial Officer, 
bringing with him extensive experience 
in the oil and gas sector. Jonathan took 
up his position in October, and I am 
certain he will make a very valuable 
contribution in the coming years. I am 
pleased that Scott Doak, Jonathan’s 
predecessor, has decided to remain 
with the Company in the new role of 
Integration and Development Director.
We were delighted to welcome 
Christopher Hand, Chief Operating 
Officer, to the Board in January 2011. 
Market overview
The Company has a record bid pipeline 
which at the end of February 2012 
amounted to USD 5.2bn. The increase  
in activity levels in the new build jackup 
rig market that was seen in 2010 
continued into 2011, and that market 
segment remains buoyant. With eight 
jackup rigs currently under construction 
Lamprell has become one of the 
leading builders in the world. As  
the search for oil & gas becomes 
increasingly more technically 
demanding, rigs that can drill horizontal 
wells more cost effectively in deeper, 
harsh environment, waters, will demand 
higher day rates and hence will help 
drive the new build rig construction 
market. In this regard, the Company is 
actively looking to construct the next 
generation of much larger, higher 
specification, jackup rigs to meet these 
technological challenges.
As previously reported, we experienced a 
slowdown in the rig refurbishment market 
in the second half of 2010 but there are 
now encouraging signs of renewed 
activity triggered by a significant upturn  
in the Saudi Arabian market. We continue 
to see significant potential for Lamprell in 
the liftboat market for both the oil & gas 
and renewables sectors in the medium 
and longer terms and aim to build on our 
early leadership position in this part of  
our business. 
The Company is actively pursuing a 
number of exciting prospects for its 
Land Rig Services business including 
new build land rigs, refurbishment 
projects and equipment overhaul and  
is confident that new business for this 
segment can be secured in the  
coming months.
The current trend in high oil prices 
underpinned by persistent supply  
side concerns and exacerbated by 
geopolitical production constraints 
continues to support significant 
investment in offshore development 
projects internationally and particularly 
in the Middle East region. Lamprell, 
with its experience and well established 
track record in offshore process 
fabrication, is well positioned to take 
advantage of the opportunities that will 
arise in this sector.
Dividend
The Board of Directors is recommending 
a final dividend payment of 8.00 cents 
per ordinary share. This will be payable, 
when approved, on 22 June 2012 to 
eligible shareholders on the register at 
25 May 2012.
Outlook
We continue to see high levels of 
enquiries for our services in most 
sectors of our business. While 
remaining vigilant with regard to the 
risks posed by the volatile global 
economic climate, the Board remains 
optimistic that the long term prospects 
of the Group continue to be promising.
Chief Executive’s Review
continued 15 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
To underline our growth record it is 
worth highlighting that this is the first 
time in the Company’s history that  
the annual revenue has exceeded 
USD 1bn, in fact totalling USD 1.15bn. 
Ten years ago in 2002 the Company 
turned over USD 80m and in 2006, the 
year of our AIM listing, we turned over 
USD 330m; percentage increases of 
1,333% and 248% respectively. With 
the business opportunities currently 
available to us, we look forward to 
continued growth with confidence.
Finally, I would again like to take this 
opportunity to express my personal 
thanks, together with those of the Board 
of Directors, to all of our management, 
staff and employees for their hard work 
and dedication which they have given 
throughout the year. Following the 
acquisition of MIS, Lamprell now has 
over 14,000 employees including labour 
supply personnel, and everyone has 
played their part in the success of the 
Company. On a final note, I would like  
to thank, as ever, our founder and 
President, Steven Lamprell, for his 
continuing encouragement and support.

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Review of Operations
Christopher Hand
The successful acquisition of MIS in 
July and the large number of major 
project awards made 2011 a 
transformational year for Lamprell from 
an operating perspective. Post 
acquisition, the Group’s facility capacity 
increased by 68% to over 925,000m
2
 
including, 2.2km of quayside. In 
addition, the enlarged Group employs 
over 14,000 people, including labour 
supply personnel, management, 
administration, operational personnel 
and field staff. This enlarged capacity 
and increased resource enables the 
Group to improve operational efficiency 
and positions the Company for 
continued growth.
Lamprell continues to place the highest 
priority on maintaining high standards 
of project execution, with a particular 
emphasis on safety, high quality 
standards and delivering projects on 
time and on budget. 
This focus on project execution, as well 
as client satisfaction, both ensures that 
Lamprell maintains and strengthens 
relationships with existing customers 
and enables Lamprell to expand its 
customer base. 
Post the acquisition, a great deal of 
focus has been placed on the 
successful integration of the enlarged 
Group’s facilities and business. As well 
as the physical integration of the 
extended Sharjah facility, this process 
has focused on the organisation 
structure, the implementation of the 
Company’s management systems, 
marketing and business development, 
the extension of the ongoing ERP 
implementation programme and securing 
planned synergies. The integration 
process has proceeded extremely  
well and will be completed in 2012.

Wind Farm Installation Vessels
In October 2011, having substantially 
completed the detailed design phase  
of the fixed price wind farm installation 
vessel projects, two for Fred. Olsen 
Windcarrier and one for Seajacks 3  
Ltd (“Seajacks”), the Company made  
a provision amounting in aggregate to 
USD 14.3m based on a detailed cost  
to complete exercise. The prototype 
nature of these vessels and the 
resulting evolution of the design and 
detailed engineering was identified as 
the primary cause of the increased 
costs. This issue was restricted to 
these projects and similar issues do  
not affect other ongoing projects.
Fred. Olsen Windcarrier
Construction of the two GustoMSC 
NG-9000 design self-elevating and 
self-propelled offshore wind turbine 
installation vessels, ordered by Fred. 
Olsen Windcarrier in February 2010 
continued at the Jebel Ali facility 
throughout 2011. The first vessel “Brave 
Tern” was successfully loaded out in 
February 2012 and will be delivered in 
Q2 2012. The load out weight of 12,200 
tonnes is the heaviest vessel land move 
ever to take place in the Middle East 
and one of a few worldwide. The 
second vessel “Bold Tern” will be 
delivered in Q3 2012.
Seajacks 
Following the successful delivery on 
time and on budget in 2009 of the wind 
farm installation vessels, “Seajacks 
Kraken” and “Seajacks Leviathan”, 
Lamprell secured a USD 129.0m 
contract award in June 2010 from

Human resources
The enlarged Group employs over 
14,000 people, including management, 
administration, labour supply personnel, 
operational and field staff and the 
integration of over 4,000 MIS personnel 
was a key objective for Lamprell in 2011 
and remains an area of focus in 2012. 
Attracting, developing and retaining 
talented staff is of paramount 
importance to the success of Lamprell 
as a business. At Lamprell, we consider 
our employees to be an important 
asset and the continuous development 
and multi-skilling of our staff remains a 
focus for our success. The Human 
Resources (“HR”) department has 
developed policies and best practices 
for effective employee management 
enabling managers to capitalise on the 
strengths of the employees and their 
ability to contribute to the 
accomplishment of work. It is 
recognised that successful employee 
management helps employee 
motivation, development and retention.
We aim to provide a safe and 
supportive work environment to our 
employees, who are from diverse 
cultural backgrounds, and to do so in 
an environment that provides a 
competitive compensation programme 
that is affordable to the Company. We 
believe this continues to be a market 
differentiator and will strengthen our 
position as an employer of choice. 
Lamprell continues to provide  
purpose-built accommodation and 
transportation for the labour force and 
this enhances our ability to attract and 
retain our workforce, and dramatically 
improves the quality and work/life 
balance expectations of the employees.
The HR department continues to work 
closely with senior business leaders  
on strategy execution, in particular 
designing HR systems and processes 
that address strategic business issues, 
organisational and people capability-
building, as well as longer-term resource 
and succession management planning.

Operating facilities
The structured capital investment 
programme at all facilities continued 
throughout 2011. The primary aims of 
this investment include higher levels of 
safety and productivity, as well as 
improving the working environment for 
both operational and administrative 
personnel.
The acquisition of MIS substantially 
increased yard space capacity, adding 
375,000m
2
 of yard capacity and 400 
metres of quayside, with the enlarged 
Group now operating from 925,318m
2
 
of yard space and 2.2km of quayside.
The main facilities added by the 
acquisition are in Sharjah and Dubai. 
The 174,000m
2
 Sharjah facility has 
been integrated with Lamprell’s existing 
Sharjah facility, and is equipped with 
extensive open and covered fabrication 
areas, support facilities and workshops. 
The additional yard space provided  
by the acquisition is of material value  
to Lamprell as it would take a number 
of years and significant capital 
expenditure to develop such a facility 
organically. The 30,000m
2
 facility in 
Dubai Investment Park is currently used 
to service land drilling rig contracts. 
Improvements to the Hamriyah facility 
continued during 2011 and, following 
over three years of construction and an 
investment of over USD 75m, the facility 
was officially inaugurated in October. 
The event was attended by Lamprell’s 
customers, partners and dignitaries, 
including His Highness Sheikh Dr. 
Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qassimi, 
Supreme Council Member and Ruler  
of Sharjah and Mr. Steven Lamprell. 
With an area covering 365,000m²  
and a quayside of over 1.4km, the 
Hamriyah facility is one of the region’s 
foremost facilities for the manufacture 
of oil & gas assets, with capacity to 
accommodate more than 10 jackup 
rigs simultaneously at the quayside  
and multiple new build rigs and 
structures in various stages of 
construction within the yard itself. 
The facility will continue to focus on the 
construction of new build jackup rigs, 
wind farm installation vessels, liftboats 
and rig refurbishment projects. The 
facility is fully API-accredited and hosts 
a main administration building which 
accommodates over 700 administration 
staff, a client office, several workshops 
and warehouse space.

Risk Assessment
Identification & management
Category Risk Description
Business risks Counterparty credit risk The Company is subject to counterparty credit risk. Before entering 
into major contracts, the Company may undertake credit checks with 
a view to determining the risk of counterparty default; 
Availability of financing The Group’s growth in the longer-term may be dependent on the 
availability of financing both for its own future projects and for its 
customers;
Expenditure by oil & gas 
companies
Demand for the Company’s services may be adversely impacted by  
a fall in the levels of expenditure by oil & gas companies;
Lump sum contracts On certain projects, the Company operates on the basis of lump sum 
contracts and is therefore subject to financial risk if it fails to operate 
within budget. The Company may also be subject to liquidated 
damages payments if it fails to complete its contracts on time or to 
specification;
Small number of contracts The Company is dependent on a relatively small number of contracts 
at any given time, some of which are for the same customers;
Order book fluctuation The Company operates on a project-by-project basis for EPC 
contracts and it does not have long term commitments with the 
majority of its customers, which may cause its visible order book to 
fluctuate significantly;
Short refurbishment  
lead times
The Company’s visible order book for upgrade and refurbishment 
work is usually relatively short and can fluctuate significantly;
Inflation The Company may be adversely affected by inflation and rising labour 
costs;
Competitive industry The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and its ability 
to compete successfully depends on its ability to provide and service 
high quality products and systems;
Local and federal 
regulations
The Company is subject to a variety of local and federal regulations  
in the UAE, and operates in markets where legal systems are still 
developing and which do not offer the certainty or predictability of 
legal systems in mature markets; and 
Conflict, disorder Certain countries in which the Company’s customers operate have 
experienced armed conflict, terrorism or civil disorder.
Risk factors
As an oil & gas and renewable energy 
related business with current operations 
concentrated in the Middle East, the 
Company is, by virtue of the nature of 
its business and the regions in which  
it operates, subject to a variety of 
business risks. Outlined below is a 
description of the principal risk factors 
that may affect the Group’s business. 
Such risk factors are not intended to  
be presented in any assumed order  
of priority.
Any of the risks and uncertainties 
discussed in this document could  
have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s business. In addition, 
the risks set out below may not be 
exhaustive and additional risks and 
uncertainties, not presently known to 
the Company, or which the Company 
currently deems immaterial, may  
arise in the future. In particular, the 
Company’s performance might be 
affected by changes in market and/or 
economic conditions and in legal, 
regulatory and tax requirements.
The management conducts an annual 
risk assessment and review and, where 
practicable, deploys strategies to 
mitigate or transfer risks. Such 
strategies may include, for example, the 
purchase of insurance, the development 
of contractual mechanisms to limit 
liabilities, and the employment of 
expertise either in-house or externally 
sourced, tasked with identifying and 
managing potential hazards, whether 
operational, financial or legal. 27 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Category Risk Description
Human resources 
risks
Skilled personnel The Company faces significant challenges in attracting and retaining 
sufficient numbers of skilled personnel;
Senior management The Company depends on the performance of its President, 
Directors, Senior Managers and other essential employees and if it 
loses any of these key personnel, its business may be impaired; and
Labour problems The Company’s ability to perform its contractual obligations may be 
adversely affected by work stoppages and other labour problems.
In each case highlighted above, the Company seeks to mitigate the applicable risk by developing appropriate remuneration structures, and providing an appealing work 
environment conducive to development of individual skills and experience.
Liability risks Liability claims The Company could be subject to substantial liability claims due to 
the hazardous nature of its business, and liability to customers under 
warranties may materially and adversely affect the Company’s 
earnings. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks through the 
operation of working practices and processes designed to deliver 
high quality products and services, as well as seeking contractual 
limits to its liability, and maintaining an appropriate insurance programme;
Warranty claims and other 
liabilities
The Company’s business is subject to risks resulting from product 
defects, faulty workmanship or errors in design as well as warranty 
claims and other liabilities; and 
Health and safety The Company conducts its business within an increasingly strict 
environmental and health and safety regime and may be exposed to 
potential liabilities and increased compliance costs. The Company 
employs professionals dedicated to ensuring that it maintains high 
standards in these important areas.
Taxation risks Fiscal regime of the UAE Changes in the fiscal regime of the UAE and other countries in which 
it operates could adversely impact the financial condition of the Group.
Risks relating to the 
ordinary shares in  
the Company
Reporting currency The Company’s reporting currency is different to the currency in 
which dividends will be paid;
Principal shareholder Lamprell Holdings Ltd, the principal shareholder, whose interests may 
conflict with the interests of other shareholders and investors, holds a 
significant shareholding in the Company;
Issue of additional shares The Group may, in the longer-term, seek to raise further funds through 
the issue of additional shares or other securities. Any funds raised in 
this way may have a dilutive effect on existing shareholdings, 
particularly in circumstances in which a non-pre-emptive issue is 
made, or where shareholders do not take up their rights to subscribe 
for shares as part of pre-emptive issue; and
Pre-emptive rights may not be available to US holders.
Hazards Perils Hazards constitute perils such as fire and flood. Hazards are 
managed through prevention, mitigation, continuity planning and  
risk transfer through the purchase of insurance.
Financial risks Financial risks An analysis of the financial risks can be found on pages 71 to 74.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Group revenue increased to USD 1, 147 .9m  
largely driven by new build activity, upgrade  
and refurbishment and service business.
Results for the year from 
operations
Group revenue increased by 127 .8%  
to USD 1,147 .9m (2010: USD 503.8m) 
reflecting an increase in activity from  
the prior year. The increase was largely 
driven by a higher level of revenue 
generated from the new build activity, 
and to a lesser extent an increase in the 
revenues from upgrade and 
refurbishment activities and from its 
service business.
Revenue generated from new build 
projects increased by 282.3% to USD 
789.7m (2010: USD 206.6m). Revenue 
in 2011 largely reflects the ongoing work 
on eight new build jackups, three 
liftboats for the offshore wind farm 
installation sector and two land rigs. The 
contract award from PEMSA for the 
construction of Hull 108 in December 
2011 allowed the Group to transfer  
this asset from inventory to contract 
work-in-progress, and to recognise 
revenue and profit in line with the 
percentage of completion of the project. 
This revenue and profit had not been 
previously recognised, despite the high 
level of completion of the project, as Hull 
108 was not contracted to a customer. 
Revenue from jackup rig upgrade and 
refurbishment activity increased over 
the prior year, with a higher level of 
average expenditure per rig. 
Revenue from Land Rig Services, 
related to the refurbishment and 
construction of land rigs, reflected  
an increase over the prior year 
predominantly resulting from the 
ongoing work building two 3000HP 
land drilling rigs for Weatherford. Other 
revenue increased to USD 114.6m 
(2010: USD 16.5m) primarily due to the 
addition of the Group’s new revenue 
streams including E&C activities and 
service business.

Gross profit increased by 66.8% to USD 
132.9m (2010: USD 79.7m) resulting in  
a gross margin of 11.6% (2010: 15.8%). 
The decline in gross margin was 
primarily due to the performance of the 
Group’s three fixed price windfarm 
liftboat projects. A provision of USD 
14.3m was taken against these projects 
as previously announced. The gross 
margin on rig refurbishment was in line 
with the margin achieved in 2010. 
The adjusted operating profit for the 
year increased by 29.8% to USD 90.2m 
(2010: USD 69.5m), before exceptional 
charges of USD 10.5m. Exceptional 
charges in 2011 reflect certain 
transaction costs associated with  
the acquisition of MIS of USD 10.5m 
including financial advisory, due 
diligence and legal fees and a one-off 
post acquisition charge for the MIS 
employee share options that were 
bought out as part of the MIS 
acquisition. The 2011 adjusted 
operating profit margin was 7 .9% 
compared to the prior year margin of 
13.8%. This decline in year on year 
adjusted operating profit margin before 
exceptional charges largely due to the 
impact of the negative margin arising 
from the liftboat projects, an additional 
USD 3.8m of amortisation relating to  
the MIS intangible assets that were 
identified and fair valued post acquisition, 
and the inclusion of a one-off net gain in 
2010 related to the cancellation of the 
contract with Riginvest G.P . amounting  
to USD 20.4m. 
Adjusted EBITDA, before exceptional 
charges, increased to USD 100.8m 
(2010: USD 78.4m) a rise of 28.5% over 
the prior year. The adjusted EBITDA 
margin before exceptional charges 
declined from 15.6% to 8.8%  
in 2011 reflecting the operating 
performance of the business.
 
Adjusted net profit, before exceptional 
charges, increased by 10.8% to USD 
73.8m (2010: USD 66.6m) in line with 
the operating profit and also reflects 
increased net finance costs in the 
current year of USD 16.2m (2010: USD 
2.9m). These largely arise as a result of 
increased facility and interest charges 
related to the MIS acquisition facilities 
and increased facility and guarantee 
charges related to new contract awards 
in the year. The adjusted net profit 
margin, before exceptional charges,  
of 6.4% (2010: 13.2%) reflects the

increased net finance costs and the 
operational performance of the 
business.
Net profit for the year attributable to 
equity shareholders was USD 63.3m 
(2010: USD 65.2m), a decrease of 2.9%.
Interest income
Interest income of USD 1.8m (2010: 
USD 2.2m) relates mainly to bank 
interest earned on surplus funds, 
margin deposits and fixed deposits 
maintained against guarantees. The 
decrease reflects a lower level of 
average cash balances during the year 
when compared to 2010.  
Taxation
The tax charge of USD 0.2m arising in 
2011 is in respect of tax on the Group’s 
service operations in Kazakhstan and 
Qatar. The Group is not currently 
subject to income tax in respect of its 
operations carried out in the United 
Arab Emirates, and does not anticipate 
any liability to income tax arising on 
these operations in the foreseeable 
future. The Company, which is 
incorporated in the Isle of Man, has no 
income tax liability for the year ended 31 
December 2011 as it is taxable at 0% in 
line with local Isle of Man tax legislation.
Earnings per share
Fully diluted adjusted earnings per 
share, before exceptional charges, 
amounts to 30.88 cents for 2011 (2010: 
30.67 cents) reflecting the operational 
performance of the Group for the year. 
The comparative figures for earnings 
per ordinary share have been restated 
for the bonus element of the June 2011 
rights issue in line with IAS 33.
Operating cash flow and liquidity 
The Group’s net cash flow from 
operating activities for the year reflected 
a net outflow of USD 54.7m (2010:  
USD 232.8m net inflow). Prior to 
working capital movements the Group’s 
net cash inflow was USD 105.2m (2010: 
USD 65.9m). The negative working 
capital movement was largely driven  
by an increase in trade and other 
receivables, and was offset to a lesser 
extent by a decrease in trade and other 
payables and a reduction in inventory as 
a result of the contract award for Hull 
108. The significant increase in trade 
and other receivables largely arose from 
increased amounts due from customers 
at 31 December 2011 amounting to 
USD 386.2m (2010: USD 58.0m). This 
reflects the increase in the number of 
ongoing EPC projects at the year end 
and, in particular, two new build 
projects where the majority of the 
payment will be received upon delivery 
in 2012.
Net cash used in investing activities 
totaled USD 408.8m (2010: USD 
99.4m), primarily comprising the MIS 
purchase consideration (net of cash 
acquired) of USD 322.2m (2010: Nil), 
USD 55.5m (2010: USD 29.7m) of fixed 
asset additions, and USD 32.1m (2010: 
USD 63.8m) of margin deposits and 
deposits greater than three months. The 
fixed asset additions were mainly in 
relation to the ongoing development at 
the Hamriyah facility that was formally 
opened in October 2011, and the 
purchase of operating equipment.
Net cash generated from financing 
activities reflected an amount of USD 
371.1m (2010: USD 46.3m used in 
financing activities). This largely arose 
from net proceeds from the issue of 
share capital of USD 216.6m (2010: Nil) 
and an increase in borrowings of USD 
199.4m (2010: USD 22.5m decrease) 
both used to finance the MIS acquisition, 
increased finance costs of USD 18.0m 
(2010: USD 5.1m) largely arising as a 
result of facility and guarantee charges 
related to new contract awards in the 
year and dividend payments of USD 
29.3m (2010: USD 15.2m).
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment during the year 
amounted to USD 55.5m (2010: USD 
29.7m). The main area of expenditure 
was the investment In buildings and 
related infrastructure at Group facilities 
amounting to USD 26.0m (2010: USD 
20.2m), including capital work-in-
progress, with additional committed 
expenditure amounting to USD 18.7m, 
reflecting the development of the 
infrastructure of the Group at all facilities 
but primarily expenditure at the new 
Hamriyah facility. Further expenditure  
on operating equipment amounted to 
USD 9.9m (2010: USD 8.6m) to support 
the growth in activities experienced 
during the year and to replace hired 
equipment, where this was deemed 
cost effective, and to upgrade a 
semi-submersible barge acquired 
during the year.
Financial Review
continued 31 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Balance sheet
Total non-current assets increased to 
USD 417 .1m (2010: USD 125.1m), driven 
by a USD 62.1m increase in property, 
plant and equipment and a USD 
228.4m increase in identified intangible 
assets. The increase in intangible assets 
arose primarily on the MIS acquisition, 
of which goodwill accounts for USD 
180.5m and intangible assets represent 
USD 50.0m. Trade and other 
receivables increased to USD 668.8m 
(2010: USD 251.1m), this reflects the 
increase in the number of ongoing new 
build projects at the year end and, in 
particular, the two new build projects, 
Zaratan and Hull 108, where the 
majority of the payment will be received 
upon delivery in 2012. 
The year end net debt was USD 101.7m 
(2010: net cash USD 210.2m) arising as 
a result of the borrowings required to 
finance the MIS acquisition and the 
additional utilisation of facilities to fund 
the increased number of new build 
projects. Upon delivery of Zaratan and 
Hull 108, expected during 2012, the 
Group is required to use a proportion of 
the final payments to retire some of the 
MIS acquisition facilities.
Shareholders’ equity increased from 
USD 284.0m at 31 December 2010 to 
USD 533.9m at 31 December 2011. 
The movement arises as a result 
of total comprehensive income for 
the year of USD 61.4m (2010: USD 
65.8m) and total transactions with 
shareholders of USD 188.5m (2010: 
decrease of USD 16.6m), which 
mainly includes proceeds from shares 
issued of USD 216.6m, partly offset by 
dividend payments of USD 29.3m. 
Dividends
For the year ended 31 December 2011, 
the Board of Directors of the Group 
having duly considered the current 
market conditions, profit earned, cash 
generated during the year and taking 
note of the capital commitments for the 
year 2012, recommends a final dividend 
of 8.00 cents per share. If approved this 
will be paid to shareholders on 22 June 
2012 provided they were on the register 
on 25 May 2012.

Company. The Directors may appoint additional or 
replacement Directors, who shall serve until the next AGM of

number nearest to one third of the Directors are required to 
retire by rotation and they may stand for re-election. A Director 
may be removed from office at a general meeting by the 
passing of an Ordinary Resolution. At the Company’s 2012 
AGM all current executive and non-executive directors will retire

Christopher Hand (Appointed 26 January 2011)

Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in the Ordinary Shares of the Company 
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages  
42 to 50.
Capital structure and significant shareholders
Details of the authorised and issued share capital together  
with details of movements in share capital during the year are 
included in Note 27 to the financial statements. The Company 
has one class of share in issue, ordinary shares of 5 pence 
each, all of which are fully paid. Each ordinary share in issue 
carries equal rights including one vote per share on a poll  
at general meetings of the Company, subject to the terms  
of the Company’s Articles of Association and applicable  
laws. Votes may be exercised by shareholders attending or 
otherwise duly represented at general meetings. Deadlines  
for the exercise of voting rights by proxy on a poll at a general 
meeting are detailed in the notice of meeting and proxy cards 
issued in connection with the relevant meeting. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of shares.  35 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Details of employee share schemes are disclosed on pages 45 
to 46 of the Directors’ remuneration report and in Note 9 to the 
financial statements. During the year the following awards of 
ordinary shares of 5 pence were granted:

* Number reflects adjustment for the dilutive effect of the May 2011 rights issue.
The awards under the Lamprell plc Free Share Plan, the 
Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan and the Lamprell plc 
Performance Share Plan are granted at Nil price. 
Pursuant to the Company’s share schemes, the Employee 
Benefit Trust as at the year-end, held a total of 449,734 (2010: 
1,277,138) ordinary shares of 5 pence, representing 0.17% 
(2010: 0.64%) of the issued share capital. The voting rights 
attaching to these shares cannot be exercised directly by the 
employees, but can be exercised by the Trustees. However,  
in line with good practice, the Trustees do not exercise these 
voting rights. In the event of another company taking control  
of the Company, the employee share schemes operated by  
the Company have set change of control provisions. In short, 
awards may, in certain circumstances and in approved 
proportions, be allowed to vest early or be allowed to be 
exchanged for awards of equivalent value in the acquiring 
company.
The Company was given authority at the 2011 AGM to make 
market purchases of up to 20,000,000 ordinary shares of  
5 pence. This authority will expire at the 2012 AGM, where 
approval from shareholders will be sought to renew the authority. 
Approval from shareholders is also proposed to be sought to 
authorise the Directors to allot the Company’s unissued shares 
up to a maximum nominal amount of £3,900,000, representing 
approximately 30% of the Company’s current issued ordinary 
share capital (excluding treasury shares) and to issue equity 
securities of the Company for cash to persons other than 
existing shareholders, other than in connection with existing 
exemptions contained in the Company’s Articles of 
Association or in connection with a rights, scrip dividend,  
or other similar issue, up to an aggregate nominal value of 
£650,000 representing approximately 5% of the current issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company. Similar authorities  
were given by the shareholders at the AGM in 2011 and the 
authorities now sought, if granted, will expire on the earlier of 
the conclusion of the AGM of the Company next year and the 
date which is 15 months after the granting of the authorities.
As at 22 March 2012, being the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of this Annual Report, the significant interests in 
the voting rights of the Company’s issued Ordinary Shares as 
per notification received by the Company (at or above the 3% 
notification threshold) were as follows:

trade creditors.

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 36 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Directors’ Report (continued)
Auditors
As far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.  
In addition, each Director has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s Auditors are aware of that information. 
The auditor for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. PricewaterhouseCoopers has 
expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditor and  
a resolution to reappoint it will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider  
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
remain in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have 
been used and applied consistently. They also confirm that 
reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates have been 
made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and that applicable accounting standards 
have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis since the Directors have reasonable expectation 
that, firstly, the Company’s and the Group’s activities are 
sustainable and, secondly, that adequate resources are 
available to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company website. Your attention is drawn to the fact 
that legislation in the Isle of Man governing the preparation  
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from other 
jurisdictions and uncertainty regarding the legal requirements  
is compounded as information published on the internet is 
accessible in many countries with different legal requirements 
relating to the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements.

Statements.

Corporate Governance Report
The Company is incorporated in the Isle of Man, where there is no formal code covering corporate governance. However, as the 
shares of the Company are listed on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange and as the Board is strongly committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance, the Board applies the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
as if the Company was incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The Code seeks to ensure that the Company is run in a manner whereby the interests of shareholders are protected and as such 
the Code sets out principles of good corporate governance together with specific provisions. 
Statement of compliance with the provisions of good governance
The Directors consider that throughout 2011 and up to the date hereof, the Company has applied the principles and complied 
with the provisions of the Code, subject to exceptions identified in this report.
The Board
The Board plans to meet at least six times in a year. The role of the Board is to provide leadership of the Company, set values and 
standards, and to ensure that the Company’s obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are met. The Board has a 
formal schedule of matters reserved to itself for decision, including but not limited to, matters of a strategic nature, approval of the 
annual budget, approval of major acquisitions, investments and disposals, major changes to the Group’s capital structure, the 
preparation of financial statements, the recommendation or declaration of dividends, the entry into contracts which are deemed 
to be material strategically or by reason of size, succession planning and appointments to the Board, executive remuneration, 
ensuring the maintenance of a sound system of internal controls, reviewing its own and its Committees’ performance, and 
reviewing the Company’s overall corporate governance arrangements.
The current membership of the Board and the commitments of the Directors are stated on pages 32 to 33, which record the names 
of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and the Chief Executive Officer. The names of the Chairmen and members of 
each of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are detailed below under the respective Committee summaries. 
The Board met eight times during the year and one of these meetings was conducted by telephone via a conference call. This 
meeting was required to deal with a specific business matter which arose as part of the business of the Group and which needed 
to be addressed between scheduled Board meetings. In addition, the Board executes a number of resolutions in writing to 
conduct Company business. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have met without the executives present when 
necessary and the Executive Directors maintain frequent verbal and written contact with the Non-Executive Directors to discuss 
various issues affecting the Company and its business. The agenda and appropriate supporting Board papers are distributed by 
the Secretary to the Board on a timely basis.
 
Attendance by the Directors at the meetings of the Board and its Committees is summarised in the table below:

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 38 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Corporate Governance Report (continued)
The Group maintains Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance 
cover, the level of which is reviewed annually.
Chairman and Chief Executive
Section A.2.1 of the Code states that the roles of Chairman and 
Chief Executive should not be exercised by the same individual 
and responsibilities between these roles should be clearly 
established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The 
Chairman on appointment should meet the independence 
criteria set out in Section B.1.1 of the Code.
Nigel McCue is the Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Silver 
is the Non-Executive Chairman. Jonathan Silver is a partner of 
a firm that represents the Company as one of its legal advisers. 
Jonathan Silver was therefore not deemed independent on 
appointment as the Chairman of the Company. However, the 
Board and the Nomination Committee, considering his 
performance, experience and his detailed knowledge of the 
Company and the Middle East, believe that, despite his 
deemed lack of independence on appointment, Jonathan 
Silver’s role as the Chairman of the Company is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 
Board balance and independence
The Board currently has seven Directors, consisting of four 
Non-Executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The 
Board considers all the Non-Executive Directors, excluding the 
Chairman, Jonathan Silver, to be independent in accordance 
with the definition of the Code and their appointment to be in 
the best interests of the shareholders. To that end, half of the 
Board excluding the Chairman (as cited above), comprises 
Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board to be 
independent. The Directors believe that the extensive 
knowledge and experience of the Non-Executive Directors 
combined with the focus and experience of the Executive 
Directors, enable the Board to lead and give direction to the 
Group without any imbalance that may allow any individual or 
group of individuals to dominate its decision-making. Any 
Director having a concern in this or any other regard may raise 
this with the Chairman or the Senior Independent Director. 
Colin Goodall has been appointed as the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and is available to shareholders if they 
have any concerns for which contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or Chief 
Financial Officer cannot be resolved or for which such contact 
is inappropriate.
The Board considers that independence is a matter of 
judgment and therefore it believes that the Non-Executive 
Directors should be free from any business or other 
relationships that could materially interfere in the exercise of 
their independent judgment. It is the Board’s policy to provide 
its Non-Executive Directors with fair remuneration for the 
contribution they make with respect to the business and affairs 
of the Company and the responsibilities they undertake in 
performing their duties as Non-Executive Directors.
Appointments to the Board
All appointments to the Board are based on the recommendation 
of the Nomination Committee. The composition and working 
of the Nomination Committee are explained under “Principal 
Board Committees” on page 39. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the registered office of the Company during 
normal business hours and will be available at the AGM  
15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting.
Induction and professional development 
A formal induction programme is provided to new Directors 
on their appointment. The programme is designed to cover 
Companies Act requirements, dealing restrictions as outlined 
in the Disclosure Rules and the Model Code on Directors’ 
dealings in securities contained in the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom, Board and 
business-related matters, meetings with senior management, 
site visits and the opportunity to meet with major shareholders. 
The Company encourages Directors to refresh their knowledge 
and skills and to keep up-to-date with the latest developments 
in corporate governance, financial reporting, the industry and 
market conditions. The Company reimburses any expenses 
incurred in this regard. 
Major shareholders have had discussions with the Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director Colin Goodall 
and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Brian 
Fredrick. The Non-Executive Directors will be available at the 
AGM to meet with shareholders. 
The Directors are entitled to take independent professional 
advice, at the Company’s expense, if required. Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Secretary to 
the Board, who is responsible for ensuring that the Board 
procedures and applicable rules and regulations are observed, 
and for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on 
governance matters. The agenda for each Board and 
Committee meeting is considered by the relevant Chairman 
and papers for each scheduled formal Board and Committee 
meeting are provided beforehand. In addition, the Chairman 
maintains regular contact with the Executive Directors to 
discuss specific issues.
Directors are free to meet individual members of the senior 
management team and have done so during the year under 
review. The Board and its Committees receive briefings on 
legislative and regulatory developments and new accounting 
requirements as appropriate and believe that, given the 
experience and skills of its Directors, the identification of 
general training needs is best left to individual discretion.
No Director took independent professional advice during  
the year. 39 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Performance evaluation
A performance evaluation of the Chairman, the Board, its 
members and the Committees was conducted through a 
questionnaire-led interview with other members of the Board. 
The questionnaires included a review of the Directors’ 
attendance at Board meetings, the Board agenda, those areas 
on which the Board should focus during its meetings, the 
effectiveness of the roles of the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors, Board procedures and administration, and the 
operation of the Board’s Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The results were considered satisfactory by 
the Board.
The performance evaluation of the Board, its members and its 
Committees takes place on an annual basis.
Retirement and re-election 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all 
Directors are subject to election at the first AGM after their 
appointment and one third, or the number nearest to one third 
of the Board, shall retire from office at every Annual General 
Meeting. Any Director in office for more than three years at the 
start of an Annual General Meeting shall also retire. At the 
Company’s 2012 AGM all current Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors will retire. All the Executive Directors and Non-
Executive Directors will offer themselves for re-appointment in 
accordance with section B.7.1 of the Code, with the exception 
of Richard Raynaut who is retiring from the Board.
 
Directors’ remuneration
The principles and details of Directors’ remuneration are 
contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages  
42 to 50. The composition and working of the Remuneration 
Committee are explained under “Principal Board Committees”

The Board is assisted by the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees. A summary of the activities of each 
Committee is set out below. The Committees are constituted 
with appropriate written terms of reference, which are reviewed 
annually and are available on the Company’s website. The 
Committee terms of references did not require any material 
changes further to the annual review. The minutes of meetings 
and/or reports from the Chairmen of the Committees are made 
available to the Board for its next scheduled meeting following 
the Committee meeting in question, or as soon as practicable 
thereafter.
Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are Richard Raynaut, 
who acts as Chairman, Colin Goodall and Brian Fredrick. 
Others may be co-opted onto the Committee by the 
Committee members. The Board considers all the members of 
the Audit Committee who are Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgment and free from any 
relationship or circumstance which may, or could or would be 
likely to, or which appears to, affect their judgment. Richard 
Raynaut, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has relevant 
and recent financial experience having retired from his position 
as Chief Financial Officer in 2004. Other members of the Audit 
Committee also have relevant financial experience.
Meetings of the Audit Committee are held not less than three 
times a year. The Chief Financial Officer is invited to attend 
meetings, where appropriate, and the Company’s auditors are 
regularly invited to attend meetings, including once at the 
planning stage before the audit and once after the audit at the 
reporting stage. Other Board members may also be invited to 
attend, although at least once a year the Audit Committee 
meets the Company’s external auditors without management 
being present. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee 
include consideration of matters relating to the appointment  
of the Company’s auditors and the independence of the 
Company’s auditors, reviewing the integrity of the Company’s 
annual and interim reports, preliminary results’ announcements 
and any other formal announcement relating to its financial 
performance. The Audit Committee also reviews the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal audit, internal 
control and compliance procedures. 
The Audit Committee has established and monitors the 
Group’s policy in relation to non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor, with a view to ensuring objectivity, 
independence and cost effectiveness. 
The Audit Committee also monitors the procedure to ensure 
that employees may raise ethical concerns in confidence. The 
Audit Committee has designated the Chief Financial Officer as 
the Compliance Officer; employees also have access to the 
Audit Committee if the Compliance Officer has not dealt with 
their concerns satisfactorily.
The Company has adopted a code of conduct covering all 
employees including senior executives; the compliance with 
this code of conduct is monitored by the Human Resource 
department. 
 
In 2011 the Company adopted an Anti-Corruption and Bribery 
Policy. 
The Audit Committee met (including meetings by conference 
call) four times during the year and the attendance at its 
meetings is reported on page 37.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
Nomination Committee
The current members of the Nomination Committee are Colin 
Goodall, who acts as Chairman, Richard Raynaut, Brian 
Fredrick and Jonathan Silver. The Nomination Committee’s 
terms of reference are to periodically review the structure, size 
and composition, including the skills, knowledge and 
experience required of the Board compared to its current 
position and make its recommendations to the Board with 
regard to any changes. The Nomination Committee also 
considers the future composition of the Board, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the Company, 
and skills and expertise needed on the Board. The Nomination 
Committee also makes recommendations to the Board about 
the membership of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
On 30 October 2011, Jonathan Cooper was appointed to the 
Board based on the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee. 
Deena Mattar has been appointed to the Board with effect 
from 1 April 2012 based on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee.
The Nomination Committee met (including meetings by 
conference calls) five times during the year and the attendance 
at its meetings is reported on page 37.
Remuneration Committee
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Brian 
Fredrick, who acts as Chairman, Colin Goodall and Richard 
Raynaut. Brian Fredrick took over the Chairmanship of the 
Committee from Richard Raynaut in June 2009. The terms of 
reference of the Remuneration Committee provide for it to 
determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad 
policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, other Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and 
other such members of the executive management as it is 
designated to consider. The remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors is a matter for the Executive Directors. No Director or 
manager may be involved in any decisions as to his own 
remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met (including meetings by 
conference call) six times during the year. The attendance at its 
meetings is reported on page 37.
Accountability and Audit
The Board plays a direct role in the development of the Group’s 
internal controls and risk management systems in addition to 
overseeing controls and risk management procedures via the 
Audit Committee. However, the primary responsibility for 
developing and implementing internal control and risk 
management procedures covering strategic, commercial, 
operational and financial aspects of the business, lies with the 
management. 
 
Financial reporting
The statement on the responsibilities of the Directors in relation 
to the preparation of the accounts and the Directors’ evaluation 
of the business as a going concern is contained in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 36.
Internal audit
In March 2010, as per the Company’s long term plan, an 
independent internal audit function was established within the 
organisation. The Audit Committee evaluated the performance 
of the internal audit function from the quality of reports received 
from the Group’s internal auditors, feedback from 
management, and an assessment of work planned and 
undertaken. 
Internal control
The control environment, risk management system and 
assurance processes, being the three key elements leading to 
a robust system of internal control in the Group, are described 
below.
There exists a clear organisational structure for the control and 
monitoring of the Group’s businesses, including defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority. The business follows 
policies and procedures which amongst other matters, include 
policies for the Company and its employees on health and 
safety, security, the environment, corporate social responsibility 
and areas of legal compliance.
The Group has an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This 
has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of this Annual Report and is in accordance with the Revised 
Turnbull Guidance. The Directors are aware that the Group’s 
risk management systems cannot completely eliminate risks 
and thus there can never be an absolute assurance against the 
Group failing to achieve its objectives or a material loss arising. 
In the Board’s regular review of the Group’s strategic plans, 
consideration is given to those risks which have been identified 
as potential impediments to achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives. The Board receives regular formal updates from 
management on the key risks and the related controls in 
relation to the Group’s existing business and, if appropriate, on 
potential new business. Management thoroughly considers 
risks associated with undertaking new business. 41 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
The Directors receive assurances from the following internal 
and external controls:
 > annual self assessment of agreed internal controls by 
process owners and review of such results by the internal 
auditors;
 > regular executive reports from management in areas 
covering key issues, performance, business outlook, human 
resources and health, safety and environment;
 > financial performance reports including analyses of 
significant variances regularly reported by the management; 
 > external audit reports, presentations and management 
letters from the Group’s auditors;
 > reports from the internal audit function;
 > reports from internal quality audits; and
 > reports from the Audit Committee.
The Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management systems. 
Where material weaknesses have been identified, safeguards 
are implemented and monitored.
Audit Committee and Auditors
The composition and working of the Audit Committee are 
explained under “Principal Board committees” on page 39.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the performance of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the external auditors, who retire at 
the end of the AGM and recommends their reappointment. The 
Board concurs with the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee.
During the year, the external auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
were also engaged to provide tax advice in connection with the 
formation of a branch office in Russia, related to the execution 
of the EDC project, and as reporting accountant in connection 
with the acquisition of Maritime Industrial Services Co. Ltd. Inc. 
The Audit Committee, in accordance with the Policy on Auditor 
Independence adopted by the Group, and having considered 
the nature of work carried out believes that, whilst being cost 
effective, the appointment of the external auditors to provide 
this advice did not affect the objectivity, or the independence, 
of the external auditors. 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have 
regular meetings with major shareholders and research 
analysts. The Board receives regular feedback from analysts 
and major shareholders, compiled by the Company’s brokers 
and financial public relations consultants, in particular, following 
presentations and meetings after the publication of financial 
results. The principal method of communicating with the 
majority of shareholders is via the Annual Report and Accounts 
and the Company’s website, which contains details of financial 
presentations to analysts, press releases and other information 
about the Group. All shareholders have the opportunity to 
attend the Annual General Meeting. All Directors were present 
at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and all Directors intend to 
be present at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to answer 
shareholders’ questions.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board uses the AGM as an occasion to communicate with 
all shareholders, including private investors, who are provided 
with the opportunity to question the Directors. At the AGM the 
total number of proxy votes lodged on each resolution 
categorised as for, against, and votes withheld will be made 
available both at the meeting and subsequently on the 
Company’s website. Each separate issue is presented as a 
separate Resolution and the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees will be available to answer 
questions from shareholders.
The Notice of the AGM, and related papers containing the text 
of resolutions to be proposed at the AGM, and explanatory 
notes, where necessary, will be posted to the shareholders  
at least 20 working days before the AGM. The interim and 
preliminary results of the Company, along with all other  
press releases, are posted on the Company’s website,  
www.lamprell.com, as soon as they are announced and  
are available for download.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, the Remuneration Committee’s report 
on our Board Directors’ remuneration for the financial year 2011.
We believe it is important to continue to foster shareholder confidence in the integrity of our remuneration decisions and, therefore, 
in 2011 we remained in dialogue with major shareholders regarding the remuneration packages offered to Executive Directors, 
seeking as in previous years to maintain executive remuneration which:
 > is in the best interests of the Company;
 > takes account of pay in the rest of the business;
 > is reasonable and in line with shareholder guidelines; and
 > will be applied consistently for the future.
The Remuneration Committee has continued to work with and been advised by Mercer Ltd. on Executive Remuneration related 
matters and consulted them for advice on market trends, incentive design questions and other relevant matters.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) determine the policy for the remuneration of Lamprell’s 
Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of senior management as it is designated to consider. 
There have been some minor amendments to the terms of reference since the last Remuneration Report and the full terms of 
reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website – www.lamprell.com.
Members of the Remuneration Committee in 2011 have been Brian Fredrick, Colin Goodall and Richard Raynaut. Members  
have attended all Remuneration Committee meetings. In addition, the Company Chairman, Jonathan Silver and the Chief 
Executive Officer, Nigel McCue attended meetings by invitation but were at no stage present when elements of their own 
remuneration were discussed.
The following pages provide a more detailed description of current Lamprell Executive Remuneration including changes that have 
been agreed upon during 2011.
Brian Fredrick
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  43 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Executive remuneration policy and pay principles
Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors gives consideration to remuneration policy and levels for the wider employee 
population and is designed to enable the recruitment, retention and motivation of Executive Directors and senior managers of the 
highest calibre. Our remuneration policy aims to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value through offering 
remuneration packages to our senior management that are appropriately balanced between base salary and variable 
compensation and taking into account policy and practice in the UAE.
Our key remuneration principles are:
 > base salaries should be competitive and bonuses should reflect both collective financial performance and personal 
performance. Personal performance will be determined based on stretching, quantitative and qualitative targets set individually 
at the beginning of each year;
 > the individual performance targets for the Executive Directors are recommended by the Company Chairman and approved by 
the Remuneration Committee. Individual performance targets for the Vice Presidents are recommended by the Chief Executive 
Officer;
 > maintaining the highest possible health and safety standards is of paramount importance to the Company and its business and 
is the collective responsibility of all Executive Directors, Vice Presidents and Employees. Any fatality that takes place in a facility 
operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be taken into account when considering whether to pay the whole or 
part of the personal performance bonus; and
 > performance shares are awarded in order to align the interests of senior staff and shareholders and to encourage the recipients 
to remain with the Company. 
The Remuneration Committee met six times during this financial year. Items covered in the meetings included:
 > investor consultation; 
 > variable pay;
 > consideration of the ABI Guidelines; 
 > review of PSP awards; and
 > review and agreement of financial targets for the annual bonus plan.
 
Main elements of remuneration
Total remuneration, in line with our remuneration policy, is made up of a balance of fixed and variable compensation. The current 
executive remuneration packages for Lamprell executives and senior managers are structured as follows:
Component Objective Performance period Performance measure Delivery vehicle

OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 44 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Each element is described in further detail in separate sections below. The Committee considers all elements of the pay structure 
to be important in supporting the Company’s remuneration policy.
Pay mix
In 2011, the remuneration mix for Lamprell Executive Directors, including long term and short-term incentives (“LTI” and “STI” 
respectively) was as follows:
CEO
COO
CFO*
0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%
Basic Salary
Actual STI
LTI expected value
* Scott Doak retired from the Board of Directors with effect from 30 October 2011. 
Elements of remuneration
Base salary
Provide a market competitive base salary that reflects the role, skills, experience and contribution of the individual
In 2011, following the 2010 review of base salaries, the Committee decided to continue to position base salaries to recognise  
the following:
 > Lamprell positions pay at levels to reflect the size and performance of the Company;
 > the results of the benchmarking exercises undertaken by Mercer in both 2009 and 2010 had indicated anomalies between the 
base salaries and bonus amounts paid by the Company, and that of its comparator group, with base salaries significantly lower 
and variable pay through bonus significantly higher than the comparator group; and
 > the Committee considered that too high a level of variable pay (i.e. pay which is “at risk”) could lead to the loss of key Executive 
Directors in difficult economic circumstances when continuity is most important.
The table below shows the base salaries of each current Executive Director effective as at 1 January 2011, and those that will 
apply from 1 January 2012.
Name Position

1 January 2011

***  Christopher Hand was appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 26 January 2011.
In line with market practice in the U.A.E., the Executive Directors also receive other benefits including car allowances, housing 
allowances, utilities for housing, school fees for children up to the age of 18 years old, annual airline tickets, medical and life 
insurance, petrol costs and club memberships. The cash value of the benefits received by each Executive Director in 2011 is 
shown in the summary annual remuneration table on page 48.
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 45 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Annual bonus
Focus and motivate Executive Directors to achieve annual 
performance targets
Performance measures
The Committee establishes performance measures and  
targets under the annual bonus plan for Executive Directors. 
Performance measures used are designed to reward the 
delivery of key priorities for the year. In the 2011 plan year, 
payout of two thirds of the bonus was based on financial 
targets, with the remaining one third following dialogue with 
major shareholders, dependent on the achievement of 
personal objectives, representing a change from the previous 
60/40 respective ratio. In setting financial targets, the Board 
focuses on key annual strategic objectives. For 2011, financial 
metrics were based upon achievement of a net profit target, 
and the Committee determined that in order to achieve the 
maximum payout in respect of the portion of the bonus 
dependent upon the achievement of financial targets, such 
targets would be required to be exceeded by at least 20%. 
In setting the personal objectives for the Executive Directors, 
the Board focuses on the Company’s strategic plan and taking 
into account the Company’s corporate values. Personal 
objectives cover a variety of financial and operational targets 
that contribute to the achievement of goals in the strategic  
plan and in 2011 included, amongst other matters, enhancing  
HSES procedures and developing the senior staff team.  
The Committee evaluates executive performance against the 
individual bonus criteria in determining the level of bonus award 
to be made.
Bonus opportunities
In reviewing total remuneration arrangements, the Committee 
decided in 2009 to reduce the bonus opportunity for Executive 
Directors from a maximum of 200% of base salary to a 
maximum of 100% of base salary.
For 2011, there was no change to the annual maximum bonus 
opportunity for Executive Directors with bonus opportunities 
capped at a maximum of 100% of base salary. The annual 
bonus plan is discretionary and the Committee reserves the 
right to make adjustments to payouts if it believes exceptional 
circumstances warrant doing so. In particular, the Committee 
has an overriding discretion to consider, if deemed necessary, 
performance on environmental, social and governance issues 
when determining the annual bonus payments for the 
Executive Directors. In accordance with the applicable policy, 
bonuses for 2011 were reduced as a result of a yard fatality 
which took place in December 2011.
 
2011 performance
In view of the Company’s financial performance during 2011 
the Committee has determined that the following bonuses will 
be paid:

Jonathan Cooper 100% 67.1%*
Christopher Hand 100% 67.1%
*pro rata from date of appointment.
Long-term incentives
Reward and motivate executives for achievement of longer 
term value creation and align executive and shareholder 
interests
Long term incentives are provided to eligible employees  
under the provisions of three different share-based plans:  
The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan, the Lamprell plc 
Retention Share Plan and the Lamprell plc 2008 Performance 
Share Plan. The 2008 Performance Share Plan is intended  
to be the Company’s primary long term incentive vehicle  
for Executive Directors and senior management. 
Executive Directors will not receive regular grants of options 
under the Executive Share Option Plan or receive regular 
awards under the Retention Share Plan. Awards under these 
two plans will only be used in exceptional circumstances.  
The Committee regularly reviews both the overall suitability of 
the Company’s share-based remuneration, the level of awards 
made under the plan operated and the performance conditions 
attached to those awards. Any value earned under the 
Company’s long term incentive plans is not pensionable.
The Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
In 2008, the PSP was agreed to be the primary long term 
incentive vehicle for Executive Directors. Executive Directors 
and other key individuals may participate in this plan that offers 
performance contingent awards of Lamprell shares on an 
annual basis. The awards will take the form of a promise to 
deliver free shares, but may be structured in an economically 
equivalent form subject to an assessment of local tax and 
regulatory issues. Annual awards are capped at 100% of base 
salary (150% of base salary in exceptional circumstances).
Performance shares will normally vest on the third anniversary 
of the date of grant of the award, subject to any applicable 
performance conditions having been satisfied. In addition, the 
Committee will have an overriding discretion, in exceptional 
circumstances (relating to either the Company or a particular 
participant) to reduce the number of shares that vest (or to 
provide that no shares vest).
 
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 46 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
PSP performance measures
The Committee believes that the performance conditions  
for vesting of PSP awards should strike a balance between 
achieving alignment with shareholder returns and reward  
for delivery of strong underlying performance.
The Committee has determined that awards made in 2011  
will vest subject to achieving predefined Earnings Per Share 
(“EPS”) growth over a three-year period. The Committee 
considers EPS to be one of the key measures of the 
Company’s success, particularly because it incentivises strong 
earnings growth over a sustained period which is in line with 
the generation of future shareholder value.
For the PSP awards, EPS growth is calculated using the 
point-to-point method. This method compares the adjusted 
EPS in the Company’s accounts for the financial year ended 
prior to the date of grant with the adjusted EPS for the financial 
year ending three years later and calculates the total growth 
over the three-year period.
The EPS targets for awards made in 2011 and their associated 
vesting levels are illustrated in the table below (straight-line 
vesting applies between the hurdles). The EPS growth hurdles 
have been set taking into account the long term strategic plans 
of the Company but also the cyclical nature of the business in 
which Company operates.
EPS growth over three-year period
Percentage 
of award 
vesting
Less than 15% 0%
15% 25%
45% or more 100%
The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan
The plan provides for options over Lamprell shares to be 
granted at market value to eligible employees. The options  
will normally vest after three years and be exercisable up to the 
tenth anniversary of the date of grant. No awards were made to 
Executive Directors under this plan in 2011. 
The Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan
The plan provides for the conditional allocation of shares to 
eligible employees selected by the Board. Awards will normally 
vest and the shares be released with any accumulated 
dividends, if determined by the Board, two years after the date 
of grant. No awards were made to Executive Directors under 
this plan in 2011. 
 
Retirement benefits
Provide retirement benefits in line with local market practice
Under employment law in the United Arab Emirates, the 
Executive Directors participate in a terminal gratuity scheme 
operated by the Company as a pension equivalent. This is 
operated as a cash payment based on the length of service 
and final salary of the Executive Director and the value of these 
cash provisions is c. 8% of base salary per annum.
Under the terms of the local UAE labour law the terminal 
gratuity accrues benefit to an employee as follows:
 > 21 days per annum for the first five years of employment; and
 > 30 days per annum for the remainder of their employment.
The benefit accrues for incomplete years on a pro rata basis, is 
calculated using the current base salary and has a maximum 
benefit amounting to two years of the annual base salary. 
Directors’ contracts
The policy set out below provides the framework for contracts 
for the Executive Directors. It is the Company’s policy that 
Executive Directors should have contracts with a rolling term. 
Maximum notice period is one year.
Aspect of contract Policy
Notice period (both parties) Twelve calendar months
Termination payment Up to one times annual basic 
salary, plus benefits but 
excluding bonus. The 
Company may elect to pay 
sums in lieu of notice in three 
separate tranches: 50% within 
seven working days of the 
termination date; 25% three 
months after the termination 
date; and 25% six months after 
the termination date
Vesting of long term incentive 
scheme awards
In line with the rules of the 
relevant equity incentive 
scheme – generally pro-rated 
for time and performance for 
good leavers
Pension Based on existing 
arrangements and terms of the 
UAE Labour Law with respect 
to terminal gratuity
The general policy on termination is that the Company does 
not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, i.e. no 
ex-gratia payments are made. 
The Committee will seek to ensure that there have been no 
unjustified payments for failure, and as such none of the 
Executive Directors’ contracts provides for liquidated damages, 
longer periods of notice on a change of control of the 
Company, or additional compensation on an Executive 
Director’s cessation of employment. 
 
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors’ 
service contracts:

Non-Executive Directors’ fees and contracts
The Company aims to provide Non-Executive Directors with 
fees that are competitive with other companies of a similar size 
and complexity. The Company reviewed the Non-Executive fee 
structure during 2011, such fees having last been reviewed in 
2008, and determined to operate a fee structure with basic 
fees and additional fees for chairing a Committee of the Board, 
and the fees were increased in order to maintain a competitive 
market position. The table below sets out the annual fees 
payable in respect of different roles and responsibilities:
Fee Category £
Non-Executive Chairman 164,000
Senior Independent Director 82,500
Basic Member Fee 42,225
Committee Chair Fee  
(Excluding Nominations Committee) 7,000
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of 
the Company’s incentive schemes.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, 
but instead have specific letters of appointment which are 
available upon request and which include amongst other 
matters, an indication of the time commitment expected from 
each Non-Executive Director. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for an initial term of three years, terminable by either 
the Company or the Non-Executive Director at will. In normal 
circumstances, and subject to performance and re-election at 
the Annual General Meeting, the Non-Executive Directors can 
be asked to serve additional three-year terms. Upon 
termination or resignation, Non-Executive Directors are not 
entitled to compensation and no fee is payable in respect of 
the unexpired portion of the term of appointment.
The following table shows the date of the letter of appointment 
for each Non-Executive Director:

In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations 
at 31 December 2011 and 2010, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable 
under the UAE Labour Law. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an employee’s expected service life with the 
Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. Management has assumed average increment/promotion 
costs of 5% (2010: 5%). The expected liability at the date of leaving the service has been discounted to its net present value using 
a discount rate of 4.25% (2010: 5.25%).

Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 51 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Corporate Social Responsibility
At Lamprell, we recognise the value of fulfilling our 
responsibilities as a corporate citizen, believing that by doing 
so we will bring benefits to all our stakeholders. Having been 
based in Dubai since 1977, the Company is rooted in a 
community within which it has worked for over 30 years and it 
has both benefited from, and been a contributor to, that 
community’s development during that period. As a result of 
both this history and the international nature of our business, 
we believe we are fortunate to have a local business with a 
genuinely global perspective, and a rich variety of cultures and 
backgrounds from which to draw expertise and experience.
Our principles
Our commitment to act as a responsible corporate player has 
long been reflected throughout the entire organisation, and the 
Group has a formalised set of policies that state the principles 
by which we seek to manage our operational activities, work 
with our staff and host communities, and minimise our impact 
on the environment. Our business, the provision of 
construction services to the oil and gas and renewables 
industry, requires the highest standards of engineering skill and 
Health, Safety and Environment awareness. Our fundamental 
principle is to carry out these activities in a way that delivers the 
best possible product to our customers whilst minimising risks 
and maximising rewards to our wider stakeholders. 
Accordingly, when we make all our investment and operational 
decisions, we take account of the social and environmental 
impacts that they may have, and minimising these is a central 
part of our decision-making process. As a publicly-listed 
company our aim is to ensure that our reporting meets all the 
requisite levels of scrutiny for a business of our size and areas 
of activity. Maintaining our reputation by aligning our 
commercial goals with our ethical standards is an essential 
part of achieving this aim.
Social initiatives
In 2011, we continued to work closely with local communities, 
business partners and regulatory authorities to make a positive 
difference within the localities where we operate. In particular, 
Lamprell is aware of the cultural mix of our employees with 
some 80% originating from India. Don Bosco Snehalaya is a 
project focused on the street children and youth, living in the 
city of Vadodara. With Lamprell’s support, the basic objective 
of Snehalaya is to provide shelter to the young living on the 
railway platforms and in the streets, and other vulnerable 
children who are in need of care and protection. Snehalaya 
provides food, clothes, medicines, recreational facilities, 
counseling, job placement, contact with their families, and 
training in trades according to their capacities, and individual 
circumstances. They are given opportunities to interact with 
the public, to express their potential and their talents. This 
helps them to develop their self confidence and the awareness 
that they too can contribute something to society. Ultimately, 
Snehalaya aims at enabling these street children to return to a 
decent life within mainstream society.
Charity
Each year we donate a cheque to a worthy establishment, with 
the recipients this year being Medécins Sans Frontierès (“MSF”). 
 
People
Attracting, developing and retaining talented staff is a major 
challenge for the oil and gas industry and at Lamprell we are 
fortunate to have high quality people across the whole range of 
our services. It is therefore vital for our continued success that 
we encourage our staff’s personal development and career 
progression, and treat our people with respect, maturity and 
openness. We also invest significantly in building their skill sets. 
We are confident that this approach is the one most likely to 
enable us to achieve our business objectives by providing 
quality, continuity and growth. Our policy is to ensure equal 
opportunity in career development, promotion, training and 
reward for all of our employees. We aim to ensure that all our 
employees understand our business goals and our business 
principles through ongoing communications programmes. With 
a diverse range of nationalities working within the group, we 
also respect and recognise the value of different cultures.
Trade staff accommodation
Due to the rising cost and shortage of residential 
accommodation in the UAE, and to comply with local laws, 
Lamprell decided to provide purpose built community 
accommodation for its core trade workforce. This 
accommodation provides a secure and clean environment for 
our employees. These facilities provide all amenities including 
an in-house laundry service, restaurants, cinema, recreational 
equipment, communal rooms with full access to internet, 
satellite TV and a medical centre. Lamprell provides transport 
between the accommodation facilities and its workplaces with 
additional scheduled transport provided for airport and 
shopping trips etc.
Medical and life insurance
In addition to the in-house medical team, Lamprell provides 
private medical cover and life insurance for its workforce 
enabling them to take advantage of locally available high quality 
medical facilities, whilst giving peace of mind to family 
dependants.
Health, safety, environment and security summary 
(“HSES ”)
Given the nature and demands of our business, ensuring a 
high level of performance in health, safety, environment and 
security is absolutely essential, and Lamprell has a strong track 
record in these areas. We are very conscious though that there 
is no room for complacency in HSES and we seek to 
continually improve our performance.
Health and safety
Internal measures for health and safety performance are very 
important to ensure focus on this area of our business. Our 
objective for 2011 was to maintain and improve the developed 
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 52 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
“safety culture” within the organisation, with all staff 
encouraged to report any activities they perceive as not 
conforming to best practice through the incentive linked 
in-house Safety Observation Audit Programme, so that any 
areas of oversight can be rectified and brought up to the 
highest possible standard as quickly as possible.
 
A contributory factor again this year was the continued use of 
the centralised reporting system for leading indicators under a 
Total Recordable Incident Ratio. This ratio facilitates the 
analysis of First Aid Cases, Medical Treatment Cases and 
Restricted Work Cases as well as Lost Time Incidents (“LTI”) 
and allows management to identify trends and take the 
appropriate action. As a result of this approach, we have 
maintained a strong track record in the area of safety. Lamprell 
has established a safety record which is exceptional for the oil 
and gas construction industry. In line with our standardise and 
centralise programme, the Lamprell Group of companies 
achieved an overall performance LTI Frequency Rate of 0.27. 
However, whilst our own measurement of our safety 
performance is essential, we also recognise the importance of 
external analysis of our methods and have achieved relevant 
accreditation by third parties of our capabilities. In 2011 
Lamprell maintained the accreditation with the management 
system certificate ISO 14001: 2004 and the updated 
Occupational, Health and Safety Assessment Series, OHSAS 
18001: 2007.
Environment
Across all our activities we seek to minimise the mark we leave 
on the sites at which we work. A good example is at Hamriyah 
where, as we expand our existing facility, we are seeking ways 
to minimise our impact on the local environment and increase 
our energy efficiency and recycling capability. By delivering 
the best possible product to our customers and utilising the 
most up to date technologies, we also have a direct impact 
on the environmental performance of the rigs we refurbish 
by improving their systems and ensuring they conform to all 
relevant international legislation. Our policy is to strive to 
achieve continual improvement in environmental performance. 
We are committed to preventing pollution and reducing the 
overall impact of our operations on the environment. In 
addition, we maintain an internal management structure for 
the management of environmental issues which includes 
clearly defined responsibilities for environmental management 
capable of delivering this policy commitment. At all times 
Lamprell aims to comply with, and where possible exceed, 
applicable legal and other requirements relating to the 
organisation. We are also committed to monitoring and 
reporting of our environmental performance, setting objectives 
and targets for improvement and at all times provide 
appropriate training and awareness programmes for our staff. 
Waste management policy
All businesses affect the environment through the use of 
resources and discharge of waste products. Our Waste 
Management Policy is therefore consistent with our broader 
Environmental Policy, which includes a stated commitment to 
minimise the environmental impacts of our operations and 
prevent pollution. Our aim is to limit our discharge of waste 
material wherever we can and the policy lays out how we seek 
to achieve this goal. 
Security
During 2011, Lamprell maintained a high level of internal and 
external security controls of its assets on behalf of all 
stakeholders. These controls were in the form of security 
procedures, a corporate wide security access system and 
continued physical security presence. 
 
Quality
Lamprell aims to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and 
quality of product. In the pursuit of this objective the Company 
will comply with all national and international standards and 
requirements with respect to quality assurance. Lamprell will 
also strive to optimise resources and reduce wastage in the 
development of our facilities and training of personnel. Whilst 
aiming to meet these objectives the Company ensures cost 
effective jobs and services, and delivery on time. Lamprell 
meets these objectives by understanding customer 
requirements, working together with our customers to meet 
those requirements, understanding our processes well and 
monitoring and measuring our activities. Ultimately the 
Company strives continually to improve the Quality 
Management Systems and operations. 
Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) 53 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and parent 
company financial statements (‘the financial statements’) of 
Lamprell plc and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise 
the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 
December 2011 and the consolidated income statement, 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
consolidated and company statements of changes in equity 
and consolidated and company cash flow statements for the 
year then ended and a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory notes.
Directors’ responsibility for the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
applicable Isle of Man law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and 
for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated and 
parent company financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audit. This report, including the 
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the company’s 
members as a body in accordance with Section 15 of the Isle 
of Man Companies Act 1982 and for no other purpose. We 
do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this 
report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing. Those Standards require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 201 1
1 Legal status and activities
Lamprell plc (“the Company/the parent company”) was incorporated and registered on 4 July 2006 in the Isle of Man as a public 
company limited by shares under the Isle of Man Companies Acts with the registered number 117101C. The Company acquired 
100% of the legal and beneficial ownership in Lamprell Energy Limited (“LEL ”) from Lamprell Investments Holdings Limited (“LHL ”), 
under a share for share exchange agreement dated 25 September 2006 and this transaction was accounted for in the 
consolidated financial statements using the uniting of interests method (Note 30). The Company was admitted to the Alternative 
Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange with effect from 16 October 2006. From 6 November 2008, the 
Company moved from AIM and was admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) plc’s main market for listed 
securities. The address of the registered office of the Company is Fort Anne, Douglas, Isle of Man and the Company is managed 
from the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”). The address of the principal place of the business is PO Box 33455, Dubai, UAE. 
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) are: the upgrade and 
refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs; fabrication; assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewable 
sector, including jackup rigs and liftboats; Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (“FPSO”) and other offshore and onshore 
structures; and oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs. 
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in Maritime Industrial Services Company Ltd Inc (“MIS”) through its wholly 
owned subsidiary Lamprell Investments Holding Limited. MIS is registered in Panama and has operations in the Middle East and 
Kazakhstan. The principal activities of MIS are the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs; fabrication, assembly and 
new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector; engineering and construction; safety and training services and other 
operating and maintenance services. At the time of acquisition, MIS was listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange and was 
subsequently delisted in September 2011.

* The remaining balance of 51% in each case is registered in the name of a Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) National/entity owned by a GCC National that has assigned all 
the economic benefits attached to their shareholdings to the Group entity. The Group has the power to exercise control over the financial and operating policies of the entities 
incorporated in the UAE through management agreements and accordingly, these entities are consolidated as wholly owned subsidiaries in these consolidated financial 
statements. These shareholders receive sponsorship fees/commission from the Group (Note 25).
† The beneficiaries of the EBT are the employees of the Group. 
+ A UAE free zone company (“FZCO”) is required to have a minimum of two shareholders and consequently, the balance of 10% is held by an employee of LEL in trust for the 
beneficial interest of the Group.
++ A Thailand registered company is required to have a minimum of three shareholders and consequently, of the total 867,000 shares, two shares are held by employees of the 
Group in trust for the beneficial interest of the Group and the balance of 866,998 shares is held by LE FZCO. 63 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
2 Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and parent company financial statements are 
set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and the Isle of Man 
Companies Acts 1931-2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982, the Company has not 
presented its own statement of comprehensive income. After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention, except as disclosed in the accounting polices below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated and 
parent company financial statements are disclosed in Note 4. 
(a)  New and amended standards adopted by the Group
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 
2011 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
(b)  New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 
2011 and not early adopted
IAS 19, “Employee benefits” was amended in June 2011. The impact of this amendment will be as follows: to eliminate the corridor 
approach and recognise all actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as they occur; to immediately 
recognise all past service costs; and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is 
calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability/(asset). This amendment has no impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
IFRS 9, “Financial instruments”, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial 
liabilities. IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010. It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification 
and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: 
those measured at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The 
classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standards retain most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is 
that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk 
is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The 
Group is yet to reassess IFRS 9’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 
1 January 2015 (subject to EU endorsement).
IFRS 10, “Consolidated financial statements” builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining 
factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. The standard 
provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 10’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12, “Disclosures of interests in other entities” includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, 
including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 12’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13, “Fair value measurement”, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value 
and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely 
aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be 
applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The Group is yet to assess  
IFRS 13’s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2012.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 201 1
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.2 Revenue recognition
(a)  Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. When the outcome of the contract can be reliably 
estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated costs up to the year end bear to the estimated 
total costs of the contract. When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is 
recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount 
of revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount can be measured reliably.
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated 
losses, including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen.
The aggregate of the costs incurred and the profit/loss recognised on each contract is compared against progress billings at the 
year end. Where the sum of the costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss exceeds the progress billings, the balance 
is shown under trade and other receivables as amounts recoverable on contracts. Where the progress billings exceed the sum of 
costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables as amounts due to 
customers on contracts.
In determining contract costs incurred up to the year end, any amounts incurred including advances paid to suppliers and 
advance billings received from sub-contractors relating to future activity on a contract are excluded and are presented as contract 
work-in-progress.
(b) Inspection services
Revenue from inspection services is recognised when the services have been rendered, the customer has accepted the service 
and the collectability of the related receivable are reasonably assured.
(c) Product and services 
Revenue from sale of products and services is recognised in the accounting period in which the product is sold or the service is 
rendered. 
(d) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest rate method.
2.3 Consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. The Group also assesses existence of control where it does not have more than 50% of the voting power but is 
able to govern the financial and operating policies by virtue of defacto control. Defacto control may arise in circumstances where 
the size of the Group’s voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of other shareholders give the Group the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies, etc.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the 
date that control ceases. 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the 
Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. On an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 65 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
The excess of the consideration transferred over the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-
date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets 
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a 
bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Business combinations involving entities under common control do not fall within the scope of IFRS 3. Consequently, the Directors 
have a responsibility to determine a suitable accounting policy. The Directors have decided to follow the uniting of interests 
method for accounting for business combinations involving entities under common control.
Under the uniting of interests method, there is no requirement to fair value the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities and 
hence no goodwill is recorded as balances remain at book value. Consolidated financial statements include the profit or loss and 
cash flows for the entire year (pre- and post-merger) as if the subsidiary had always been part of the Group. The aim is to show 
the combination as if it had always been combined.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed or adjustments have been made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, where necessary, to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity jointly controlled by two or more parties by means of contractual arrangement. The results of operations, 
assets and liabilities of the Group’s joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting except when classified as held for sale. Under the equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities 
are carried at cost plus subsequent changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity, net of any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the jointly controlled entity (based on the equity 
method). Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that joint venture are not recognised unless the Group has a 
legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
(c) Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to 
recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in 
associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to  
the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal  
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount  
of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to “share of profit/(loss) of an associate” in the income 
statement.
2.4 Investment in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate financial statements, the investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost less provision for impairment.  
Cost is the amount of cash paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment. Income from such 
investments is recognised only to the extent that the Company receives distributions from accumulated profits of the investee 
company arising after the date of acquisition. Distributions received in excess of such profit i.e. from pre-acquisition reserves are 
regarded as a recovery of investment and are recognised as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

2.5 Foreign currency translation 
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The Group’s activities are primarily carried out from the UAE, 
whose currency, the UAE Dirham, is pegged to the US Dollar and is the functional currency of all the entities in the Group (except 
LAL whose functional currency is the Thailand Baht, MISCLP whose functional currency is the Omani Riyal, MISQWLL whose 
functional currency is the Qatari Riyal, MIS Kazakh Branch whose functional currency is the Kazakh Tenge and EBT whose 
functional currency is the British Pound). The consolidated and parent company financial statements are presented in US Dollars.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement, except when deferred into other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated 
income statement within “finance income or costs”. All other foreign exchange gain and losses are presented in the consolidated 
income statement within “other gains/(losses) – net”.
(c) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that 
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
 > assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
 > income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and
 > all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, are taken to other 
comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in 
equity are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is the 
purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the 
expected useful economic lives of the assets as follows:
Years
Buildings and infrastructure 3 – 25
Operating equipment 3 – 10
Fixtures and office equipment 3 – 5
Motor vehicles 4 – 5
The assets’ residual values, if significant, and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred.
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, capital work-in-progress is transferred to property, plant and 
equipment and depreciated in accordance with Group policies.
Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount (Note 2.21). 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within 
“Other (losses)/gains – net” in the income statement. 67 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.7 Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration transferred 
over Lamprell plc’s interest in the net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and 
the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Cash Generating 
Units (“CGUs”) or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units 
to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level. 
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential 
impairment. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair 
value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Trade name
A trade name acquired as part of a business combination is capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the date of 
acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life of 10 
years. The useful life of a trade name is reviewed on an annual basis.
(c) Customer relationships
Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised, separately from goodwill, at fair value at the 
date of acquisition if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line method to allocate the fair value at acquisition over their estimated useful life of four 
years. The useful life of customer relationships is reviewed on an annual basis.
(d) Operating lease rights
Intangible assets representing operating leasehold rights are carried at cost (being the fair value on the date of acquisition where 
intangibles are acquired in a business combination) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the leasehold right over its estimated useful life (17 years). 
(e) Computer software
Work-in-progress is stated at cost. When commissioned, work-in-progress is transferred to software and amortised in accordance 
with Group policies.
2.8 Inventories
Inventories comprise raw materials and consumables which are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. 
Cost is determined on the weighted average basis and comprises direct purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the 
inventories to their present location and condition.
2.9 Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts receivable from customers for billing in the ordinary course of business for construction contracts, 
rig refurbishment and inspection services performed. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current 
assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective 
interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in 
the consolidated income statement within “general and administrative expenses”. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is 
written off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against “general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated income statement.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.10 Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented 
as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
2.11 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable 
that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the 
amount of the obligation can be made. 
2.12 Employee benefits
(a) Provision for staff benefits 
A provision is made for the estimated liability for employees’ entitlements to annual leave and related benefits as a result of services 
rendered by the employees up to the balance sheet date. Provision is also made, using actuarial techniques, for the end of service 
benefits due to employees in accordance with the labour laws applicable in the countries in which the Group operates, for their 
periods of service up to the balance sheet date. The provision relating to annual leave and leave passage is disclosed as a current 
liability and included in trade and other payables, while that relating to end of service benefits is disclosed as a non-current liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in assumptions are charged or credited in the consolidated income statement in 
the period in which they arise.
(b) Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the shares/options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares/options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of shares/options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the 
number of shares/options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the 
income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.
The Company has granted rights to its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary companies conditional upon the 
completion of continuing service with the Group for a specified period. The total amount of the grant over the vesting period is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and is recognised in each period as an increase in the 
investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding credit to retained earnings. In the separate financial statements of the 
subsidiary, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity instruments of the Company (i.e. 
parent) is recognised as an expense with a corresponding credit to equity.
2.13 Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the consolidated 
income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current accounts with banks less margin deposits, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings 
in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 
2.15 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the repayment value is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The Group capitalises borrowing costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.  69 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
2.16 Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the Group’s consolidated and parent company financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders.
2.17 Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and accessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors that make strategic decisions. 
2.18 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It 
establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax 
liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net 
basis.
2.19 Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and 
held-to-maturity. Currently, the Group does not have any available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the 
purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial 
recognition.
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category 
if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they 
are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in 
the consolidated income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments 
have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” category are 
presented in the consolidated income statement within “other gains/(losses) – net” in the period in which they arise.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 201 1
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are 
classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade receivables (Note 2.9), other receivables 
(excluding prepayments), receivables from related parties and cash and cash equivalents (Note 2.14) in the Group balance sheet 
and amounts due from receivables from related parties (Note 25) and cash at bank (Note 26) in the Company balance sheet.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost less 
provision for impairment. The amortised cost is computed using the effective interest method. 
Loans and receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the counterparty have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of the ownership.
(c) Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that 
the Group’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. If the Group were to sell other than an 
insignificant amount of held-to-maturity financial assets, the whole category would be tainted and reclassified as available for sale. 
Held-to-maturity financial assets are included in non-current assets, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the 
end of the reporting period, which are classified as current assets. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there 
is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
(d) Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a 
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of 
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.
2.20 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a 
particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as  
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 32. The full fair value of a 
hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more than 12 months,  
and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised 
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement within “other gains/(losses) – net”.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the item affects profit or loss (for example, 
when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement within “other gains/(losses) – net”. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results 
in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, contracts work in progress or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously 
deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of contracts work in progress or in depreciation in the case  
of fixed assets. 71 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised  
in the consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that 
was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement within “other gains/(losses) – net”.
2.21 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use – are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised 
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that suffered impairment 
are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Any material impairment loss is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement and separately disclosed.
2.22 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The excess of proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs over the par value of the shares are credit to the share premium.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders 
until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any 
directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the 
Company’s equity holders.
2.23 Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further 
understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown 
separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
3 Financial risk management 
3.1 Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate 
risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis to assess and manage critical 
exposures. The Group’s liquidity and market risks are managed as part of the Group’s treasury activities. Treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of established policies and procedures. 
(a) Market risk – foreign exchange risk
The Group has foreign exchange risk primarily with respect to commitments in Euro with certain suppliers. To manage the foreign 
exchange risk exposure arising from future commercial transactions and recognised liabilities, the Group uses forward exchange 
contracts (Note 32). 
(b) Market risk – cash flow interest rate risk
The Group holds its surplus funds in short-term bank deposits. During the year ended 31 December 2011, if interest rates on 
deposits had been 0.5% higher/lower, the interest income would have been higher/lower by USD 483,000 (2010: USD 527,000).
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. During the year ended 31 December 2011, if interest  
rates on borrowings had been 0.5% higher/lower, the interest expense would have been higher/lower by USD 668,000  
(2010: USD Nil).
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is detailed in Notes 16, 21, 23, 24, 26 and 32. The Group has a policy for dealing with 
customers with an appropriate credit history. The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial 
institution.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 201 1
3 Financial risk management (continued)
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks, held-to-maturity 
investment, financial asset carried at fair value through profit or loss, trade and other receivables and derivative financial 
instruments. The Group has a formal procedure of monitoring and follow up of customers for outstanding receivables. For banks 
and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘B’ are accepted. The Group assesses 
internally the credit quality of each customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had a significant concentration of credit risk with nine of its largest customer balances 
accounting for 58% (2010: 72%) of trade receivables outstanding at that date. Management believes that this concentration of 
credit risk is mitigated as the Group has long-standing relationships with these customers.

The counterparties in 2011 are not necessarily the same counterparties in 2010.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
(d) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate amount 
of committed credit facilities. Due to the nature of the underlying business and through progress billings, the Group maintains 
adequate bank balances to fund its operations.
Management monitors the forecast of the Group’s liquidity position on the basis of expected cash flow. 
The Group’s liquidity risk on derivative financial instruments is disclosed in Note 32. 73 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011

3.2 Capital risk management
As a result of the borrowings during the year, the Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, or issue 
new shares to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the balance sheet) less cash and bank 
balances. Total capital is calculated as “equity” as shown in the balance sheet plus net debt. The net debt to total capital at the 
balance sheet date was as follows:

3.3 Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as 
follows:
a. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.  
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity 
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.  
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
a. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments; and
b.  Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial 
instruments.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,  
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Revenue recognition 
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for its contract revenue. Use of the percentage-of-
completion method requires the Group to estimate the stage of completion of the contract to date as a proportion of the total 
contract work to be performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.2. As a result, the Group is required  
to estimate the total cost to completion of all outstanding projects at each period end. The application of a 10% sensitivity to 
management estimates of the total costs to completion of all outstanding projects at the year end would result in the revenue and 
profit increasing by USD 32.9m (2010: USD 12.1m) if the total costs to complete are decreased by 10% and the revenue and profit 
decreasing by USD 24.3m (2010: USD 10.7m) if the total costs to complete are increased by 10%. 75 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
Employees’ end of service benefits
The rate used for discounting the employees’ post-employment defined benefit obligation should be based on market yields on 
high quality corporate bonds. In countries where there is no deep market for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds 
should be used. In the UAE, there is no deep market either for corporate or government bonds and therefore, the discount rate 
has been estimated using the US AA-rated corporate bond market as a proxy. On this basis, the discount rate applied was 4.25% 
(2010: 5.25%). If the discount rate used was to differ by 0.5 points from management’s estimates, the carrying amount of the 
employee’s end of the service benefits provision at the balance sheet date would be an estimated USD 1.4m (2010: USD 0.6m) 
lower or USD 1.5m (2010: USD 0.7m) higher. 
5 Segment information
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Directors who make strategic decisions. The 
Executive Directors review the Group’s internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management has 
determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The Executive Directors consider the business mainly on the basis of the facilities from where the services are rendered. 
Management considers the performance of the business from Sharjah (“SHJ”), Hamriyah (“HAM”) and Jebel Ali (“JBA”) in addition 
to the performance of Land Rig Services (“LRS”) and International Inspection Services Limited (“INSPEC”).
SHJ, HAM, JBA and LRS meet all the aggregation criteria required by IFRS 8 and are reported as a single segment (Segment A). 
Services provided from Inspec do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, and the results of these operations are 
included in the “all other segments” column. 
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, fabrication, 
assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas and renewables sectors, including FPSO and other offshore and 
onshore structures, oilfield engineering services, including the upgrade and refurbishment of land rigs.
Inspec derives its revenue from various services such as non-destructive pipeline testing, ultrasonic testing and heat treatment. 
During the year, the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LIH, acquired MIS (Note 35). The revenue of MIS is mainly 
derived from the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs; fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the 
offshore oil and gas sector, engineering and construction. The Executive Directors consider these services to be similar to the 
services provided by Lamprell from SHJ, HAM, JBA and LRS and hence been considered under the reporting segment (Segment 
A). Additionally, MIS also provides safety and training services and other Operating and Maintenance services (“O&M”). As 
services provided by Sunbelt and O&M do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, the results of these operations 
are included in the “all other segments” column.

Free share plan
The Company awarded shares to selected Directors, key management personnel and employees under the free share plan that 
provides an entitlement to receive these shares at no cost. These free shares are conditional on the Directors/key management 
personnel/employee completing a specified period of service (the “vesting period”). The award does not have any performance 
conditions and does not entitle participants to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The fair value of the share awards 
made under this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the 
vesting period. The details of the shares granted under this scheme are as follows:

corresponding credit to the consolidated retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the income statement of the 
Company with a corresponding credit to retained earnings of USD 83,000 (2010: USD 155,000).
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to settle the free share awards in cash.

Executive share option plan
Share options are granted by the Company to certain employees under the executive share option plan. This option plan does not 
entitle the employees to dividends. These options are conditional on the employee completing three years of service (the vesting 
period) and hence the options are exercisable starting three years from the grant date and have a contracted option term of 10 
years. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash. 79 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011

Vested but not exercised 3.22 (50,531)
At 31 December 2011 0.57 550,000
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2009 determined using a binomial valuation model was £0.28 per 
option. The significant inputs into the model were an average share price for a period of one year immediately preceding the grant 
date of £2.91, an exercise price of £0.57, volatility of 50%, dividend yield of 3.31%, an expected option term of 10 years, an annual 
risk-free interest rate of 3.28% and a withdrawal rate of 5% per annum. The risk-free rate is derived from the yield on United 
Kingdom (UK) Government Bonds as detailed by the Bank of England, using a 10 year maturity in line with the life of the option. 
The volatility assumption is based on an analysis of the historic daily share price volatility of the Company since its listing date, 
capped at 50%. A charge of USD 62,000 (2010: USD 92,000) is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year with 
a corresponding credit to the consolidated retained earnings. This includes a charge recognised in the income statement of the 
Company with a corresponding credit to retained earnings of USD 62,000 (2010: USD 73,000).
Performance share plan
The Company granted share awards to Directors, key management personnel and selected employees that give them an 
entitlement to receive a certain number of shares subject to the satisfaction of a performance target and continued employment. 
The performance target related to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share. The fair value of the share awards made under 
this plan is based on the share price at the date of the grant less the value of the dividends foregone during the vesting period.

14 Earnings per share
(a) Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as 
treasury shares (Note 27).
(b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. For the free share awards, options under executive share option plan and 
performance share plan, a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value 
(determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to outstanding share awards/options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of 
shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share awards/options.

Basic 26.56c 30.21c
Diluted 26.47c 30.03c
On 19 May 2011, the Company announced a rights issue of three shares for every 10 shares held at a discounted price of 232 
pence per share resulting in the issue of 60,083,792 new ordinary shares. The calculation of the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares for the current year was affected by the issue of the new ordinary shares. The Group has treated the discount 
element of the rights issue as if it was a bonus issue, using the theoretical ex-rights price of 324 pence per share. The effect of this 
is to increase the weighted average number of shares reported in the prior year, with a resulting reduction in the reported basic 
and diluted earnings per share for the previous year. The adjustment factor, to effect the increase in the weighted average number 
of shares, has been calculated by dividing the share price immediately before the shares were quoted ex-rights (351.3 pence) with 
the theoretical ex-rights price (323.77 pence), giving an adjustment factor of 1.085. These adjustments to the comparative earnings 
per share calculations do not impact the previously reported consolidated income statement or consolidated balance sheet.

Trade name represents the expected future economic benefit to be derived from the continued use of the MIS trade name 
acquired on acquisition of MIS. 
Customer relationships represent the expected future economic benefits to be derived from the existing relationship with key 
customers resulting in recurring revenue from these customers in the future. 
Leasehold right represents a favourable operating right acquired upon the acquisition of JIL and LE FZCO in 2008. This also 
includes the leasehold rights acquired on acquisition of MIS and existing lease hold rights in the books of MIS on acquisition of  
Rig Metals LLC in 2008. The value of the intangible assets have been determined by calculating the present value of the expected 
future economic benefits to arise from the favourable lease terms (five to 17 years). 
Work-in-progress represents the cost incurred towards the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning software. 
Management reviews the business performance based on the type of business (Note 5). Goodwill is monitored by the 
management at the operating segment level. Goodwill of USD 180.5m arising due to the acquisition of MIS (Note 35) has been 
allocated to the CGU within Segment A.
The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax 
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. Cash flows beyond the 
three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rate of 4.3% for Segment A. A discount rate of 9% has been used 
to discount the pre-tax cash flows projection to the present value. The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth 
rate for the business in which the CGU operates.

31 Provision for employees’ end of service benefits 
In accordance with the provisions of IAS 19, management has carried out an exercise to assess the present value of its obligations 
at 31 December 2011 and 2010, using the projected unit credit method, in respect of employees’ end of service benefits payable 
under the labour laws of the countries in which the Group operates. Under this method, an assessment has been made of an 
employee’s expected service life with the Group and the expected basic salary at the date of leaving the service. The obligation for 
end of service benefit is not funded. 
The movement in the employees’ end of service benefit liability over the year is as follows:

During 2010, the Group entered into three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure with respect to certain 
supplier commitments in Euros. The notional principal amount at the date of inception of these contracts was Euro 142m.  
These contracts mature in 2012.
The hedged highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during 
the next six months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on 
forward foreign exchange contracts as of 31 December 2011 are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period or 
periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the consolidated income statement. 
During 2011, the Group entered into three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on expected NOK payments 
with respect to the acquisition of MIS. The notional principal amount at the date of inception of these contracts was NOK 1,864m. 
These contracts matured 1 September 2011.
A profit of USD 13,083,000 (2010: loss of USD 304,000) was recorded in equity and a profit of USD 3,963,000 (2010: loss of USD 
170,000) was recycled from equity to consolidated income statement. A profit of USD 10,166,000 (2010: USD Nil), representing the 
gain in relation to the three forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure with respect to NOK payments made to the 
shareholders of MIS was recorded as a basis adjustment to the purchase consideration (Note 35). The net movement in the fair 
value reserve during the year was a loss of USD 1,046,000 (2010: loss of USD 134,000).
During 2011, prior to being acquired by the Group (Note 35), MIS entered into a forward contract to sell Euros for AED. This 
derivative did not qualify for hedge accounting and is carried at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value at the 31 December 
2011 was USD 272,000. 
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the 
contracts and the liquidity of the market. To control the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties, using the 
same techniques as for other counterparties.
The derivative financial instruments are gross settled and the maturity profile based on the year end rates of the expected

Acquisition of MIS
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in MIS. MIS is registered in the Republic of Panama and has operations  
in the Middle East and Kazakhstan. The principal activities of MIS are the upgrade and refurbishment of offshore jackup rigs, 
fabrication, assembly and new build construction for the offshore oil and gas sector, engineering and construction, safety and 
training services and other operating and maintenance services. MIS was listed on the Norwegian Stock Exchange. LIH made a 
voluntary offer to the shareholders of MIS on 19 May 2011 for a consideration of NOK 38 per share. LIH received acceptance from 
99.76% of the shareholders of MIS before expiry of the offer on 29 June 2011 and announced that the offer was successful on  
30 June 2011. Further, LIH also issued a cash cancellation offer to the option holders of MIS for cancellation of the options held  
by them and received acceptances from the majority of the option holders before expiry of the cash cancellation offer on  
29 June 2011. 
LIH settled in cash the consideration payable to the shareholders and option holders of MIS who accepted the voluntary offer and 
cash cancellation offer respectively on 13 July 2011. Further, LIH extended the mandatory offer in August 2011 to the remaining 
shareholders of MIS (0.24%) who did not accept the voluntary offer. 
Control of MIS transferred to LIH on 13 July 2011. The consideration for transfer of shares of MIS and cancellation of options  
(Note 9) amounted to approximately USD 337.9m. Management has completed the purchase price allocation in accordance  
with IFRS 3 (revised) “Business Combinations”. 
As a result of the acquisition, the Group is expected to reduce competition and increase its presence in new markets. It also 
expects to reduce costs through economies of scale and synergies. The goodwill of USD 180.5m arising from the acquisition  
is attributable to acquired customer base, work force and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the 
legacy Group and MIS.

Acquisition-related costs of USD 10.5m have been charged to general and administrative expenses (Note 10) in the consolidated 
income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The acquired MIS businesses have been comprehensively integrated with the Group’s existing businesses. It is therefore 
impracticable to determine the contribution that the MIS acquisition has made to revenue and profit since the date of acquisition. 
Similarly, it is impracticable to determine the contribution it could have made had it been consolidated with effect from 1 January 
2011.
36 Profit of the Company
The profit of USD 3m (2010: USD 19m) in respect of the Company has been included in these consolidated financial statements.
37 Dividends 
During the year (on 25 March 2011 and 26 August 2011), the Board of Directors of the Company approved dividends of  
USD 29.3m comprising USD 19m (post-rights issue US cents 8.7 per share: pre-rights issue US cents 9.5 per share relating to 
2010) and an interim dividend of USD 10.3m for 2011 relating to 2011 (US cents 4 per share). At 31 December 2011, unpaid 
dividends amounted to USD 12,000 (Note 33) and were in relation to the shares held by EBT.
During 2010 (on 26 March 2010 and 20 August 2010), the Board of Directors of the Company approved dividends of  
USD 15.2m comprising USD 7.6m (US cents 3.8 per share) relating to 2009 and an interim dividend of USD 7.6m (US cents 3.8 
per share) for 2010. At 31 December 2010, unpaid dividends amounted to USD 51,000 (Note 33) and were in relation to the shares 
held by EBT.

guarantees are secured by cash margins, assignments of receivables from some customers and, in respect of guarantees 
provided by banks to the Group companies, they have been secured by parent Company and certain Group company 
guarantees. In the opinion of the Directors, the above bank guarantees are unlikely to result in any liability to the Group. 99 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011

(a) Fire incident
Hull 107, a rig built by MIS and delivered to KSAM2 in 2010, suffered a major incident in January 2012 involving a fire and explosion 
whilst operating offshore in West Africa resulting in a total loss. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation. The 
Company, through MIS, holds a 10% equity interest in KSAM2, the owner of the rig. At the time of the incident the rig was on a 
bareboat charter by KSAM2 to a third party. KSAM2 carries hull and machinery insurance for the full market value of the rig and 
the Company is confident that recovery will be made pursuant to this insurance.
(b) Dividend
The Board of Directors of LEL has proposed a dividend of USD 425 per share amounting to USD 20.8m at a meeting held on  
23 March 2012. In accordance with the accounting policy under IFRS set out at Note 2.16, this dividend has not been accrued  
at 31 December 2011. This is in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies (Amendment) Act 2010 which required that such 
proposed dividends should not be recognised until paid or approved by the shareholders.
Following the dividend from LEL, the Board of Directors of the Company has proposed a dividend of 8.0 US cents per share 
amounting to USD 20.8m at a meeting held on 23 March 2012. In accordance with the accounting policy under IFRS set out at

on 25 March 2011 was not accrued at 31 December 2010). This is in accordance with the Isle of Man Companies (Amendment) Act 
2010 which required that such proposed dividends should not be recognised until paid or approved by the shareholders.

DELIVERING CHANGE  
BUILDING RESILIENCE
FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
In 2016, Anglo American articulated its objective of creating  
a more resilient business, by materially strengthening its 
balance sheet through sustainably improving cash flows  
and focusing its portfolio around its highest quality assets. 
Delivering that objective – through cost and productivity 
improvements, disciplined capital allocation and applying 
strict value thresholds to those assets that we chose to divest, 
and others that we considered divesting – has significantly 
strengthened Anglo American’s financial position. Upon the 
completion of other agreed asset sale transactions during 
2017 , in addition to continued material operational progress, 
Anglo American will be well advanced towards embedding  
the financial, operational and commercial resilience that  
will ensure the sustainable creation of value for all our 
stakeholders – building the foundations for the future.
Throughout the Strategic Report we use a range of 
financial and non-financial measures to assess our 
performance. A number of the financial measures, 
including underlying earnings, underlying EBIT, 
underlying EBITDA, underlying earnings per share,  
net debt, attributable return on capital employed 
(ROCE) and attributable free cash flow are not  
defined under IFRS, so they are termed ‘Alternative 
Performance Measures’ (APMs). 
Management uses these measures to monitor the 
Group’s financial performance alongside IFRS 
measures because they help illustrate the underlying 
financial performance and position of the Group.  
We have defined and explained the purpose of each  
of these measures on pages 188 to 190, where we 
provide more detail, including reconciliations to the 
closest equivalent measure under IFRS.
These APMs should be considered in addition to, and 
not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of 
financial performance, financial position or cash flows 
reported in accordance with IFRS. APMs are not 
uniformly defined by all companies, including those  
in the Group’s industry. Accordingly, APMs may not  
be comparable with similarly titled measures and 
disclosures by other companies.
‘Tonnes’ are metric tons, ‘Mt’ denotes million tonnes,  
‘kt’ denotes thousand tonnes and ‘koz’ denotes 
thousand ounces; ‘$’ and ‘dollars’ denote US dollars  
and ‘cents’ denotes US cents.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
RESPONSIVE THROUGH THE DOWNTURN, 
AND IN SHAPE FOR THE FUTURE
Although we maintained a high level of liquidity, with cash 
and undrawn facilities of around $16 billion, the imperative  
to restore the balance sheet meant, regrettably, that 
dividends remained suspended. With the company now  
in a much healthier state than a year ago, however, and 
prospects for prices a little more positive, the Board is 
targeting reinstatement of the dividend for the end of 2017 
(payable in 2018). When the dividend resumes, we will move 
to a payout ratio-based policy, the details of which we will 
define at that time.
ASSET FOCUS AND OPTIONALITY
In February 2016, when, as it turned out, prices for mining 
products were around their lowest point in the current 
commodities downturn, we announced that we would be 
concentrating our capital on our portfolio of diamond, 
platinum group metals (PGMs) and copper interests, and 
that we intended to explore the sale of many of our coal  
and iron ore assets. 
As the benefits of our own cost and productivity improvements 
started to come through, and as we successfully divested a 
number of coal and platinum assets, in addition to the niobium 
and phosphates business, with prices also firming for a 
majority of our products during the second half – all of those 
factors served to accelerate the repair of our financial position. 
The pressures on us to divest further major assets have 
therefore diminished considerably. 
Although we still believe that the top-tier asset positions we 
hold in De Beers, PGMs and Copper form the bedrock of a 
financially stronger and more competitive Anglo American, 
we continue to benefit from the much improved operational 
performance of a number of other high quality iron ore, coal 
and nickel assets. As a result, we now have a much greater 
degree of optionality with regard to asset retentions, and to 
our geographic balance.
SAFETY AND HEALTH
Throughout Anglo American, safety is our paramount 
consideration. In 2016, we experienced a better total 
recordable injuries performance, with a 24% reduction 
in recordable injury rates compared with 2015. It is 
distressing, however, to record a steep rise in fatal injuries, 
with 1 1 lives lost at the Group’s operations, including  
seven in deep mines, of which four were in mines we have 
subsequently sold. This was clearly against the trend  
of recent years, and all the more surprising given the 
heightened focus on safety throughout the Group, including 
an increasing emphasis on critical controls and more 
thoroughgoing safety initiatives such as our Global Safety 
Day campaign. Any loss of life in the workplace is a tragic 
event – and is quite unacceptable – and a deeply  
saddening aspect is that several of the fatal incidents  
were eminently preventable, arising, as they did, from 
front-line operational practice not being aligned with  
our stringent safety policies. We must reverse this 
performance, and the Board, and particularly its 
Sustainability Committee under the chairmanship  
of Jack Thompson, an experienced miner, has been  
engaging closely with chief executive Mark Cutifani  
and his management team to address this challenge.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Since the start of the mining commodities crisis some  
three years ago, Anglo American has reduced its number  
of operating assets by 26. Crucially though, we were 
determined not to sell assets below their inherent value –  
not even during the dark days of late 2015 and early 2016, 
after the slump in mining stocks had accelerated, abetted  
by the aggressive ‘shorting’ actions of certain hedge  
funds, which at one stage accounted for about 20%  
of our share register. 
Accordingly, in the first six months of the year, the only major 
asset we agreed to sell was our niobium and phosphates 
business in Brazil, for which we received $1.5 billion – well 
above market expectations. 
Later in the second half, however, market sentiment 
improved on the back of substantially strengthening prices 
for iron ore and both metallurgical and thermal coal. We also 
disposed of a number of minor assets as we continued to 
tidy up our portfolio so that total proceeds for disposals 
amounted to $1.8 billion
(1)
 for the year. 
We delivered a profit for the financial year attributable to 
equity shareholders of $1.6 billion and underlying EBITDA  
of $6.1 billion. At the same time, continued capital discipline 
resulted in capital expenditure
(2)
 declining from $4.0 billion 
to $2.5 billion, while no new major projects were approved. 
The performance was bolstered by an across-the-business 
improvement in productivity of 18% as we progressively 
rolled out our Operating Model and sold a number of less 
productive assets, with copper equivalent unit costs 
declining by 9% in dollar terms.
Net debt was reduced by $4.4 billion, from $12.9 billion  
to $8.5 billion, considerably below our year-end target  
of $10 billion, with net debt to EBITDA of 1.4 times. We 
continue to plan for somewhat lower debt levels, given  
the continued volatility in the mining industry.
Sir John Parker
During a year of continued slow global economic 
recovery and low commodity prices on average, 
Anglo American executed significant cost and 
productivity improvements, and in the second 
half benefited from sharply increasing prices  
for several of its products. This combination 
enabled a remarkable sector-leading recovery 
for Anglo American.
(1) 
Proceeds from 
disposals of  
$1.8 billion were 
received in 2016.  
Total nominal cash 
inflows are expected 
to reach $2.0 billion 
over time, subject  
to prices.
(2) 
Excluding capitalised 
operating cash flows.
04 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Our Sustainability Committee is heavily involved in 
searching inquiry into all major accidents and fatal incidents, 
and in assessing operational risks across the business. This 
includes significant attention to all our 90 tailings storage 
facilities. Although we have confidence in the integrity  
of the dams, and our tailings dam monitoring exceeds 
legal-compliance requirements, we have nonetheless 
increased our degree of surveillance, inspection monitoring 
and risk assurance.
I am pleased that a landmark step has been taken on 
resolving the silicosis issue in South Africa. In March 2016, 
Anglo American South Africa and AngloGold Ashanti 
concluded an agreement which resolves fully and finally 
4,400 stand-alone silicosis claims. We believe that the 
agreement to settle this litigation is in the best interests  
of the plaintiffs, their families, our company and its  
wider stakeholders. 
CLIMATE CHANGE
We continue to work in partnership and consultation with  
all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, to help 
address the causes and impacts of climate change. As part 
of this outreach, we have been consulting with the ‘Aiming 
for A’ coalition, which was established in 2012 by a group  
of investors, including some of our largest shareholders, to 
enhance extractive companies’ reporting commitment to 
address climate change, including how they manage its 
impacts on their business. 
OUR CULTURE AND VALUES
At Anglo American, each one of us, in our daily lives, makes  
a contribution as we seek to earn the trust that gives us our 
licence to operate. 
Trust is integral to our deep-seated reputation for doing the 
right thing, including acting with integrity and displaying care 
and respect for the rights and livelihoods of our colleagues, 
communities and the natural environments in which we  
work. To assist us in this, we have recently revised, and are 
continuing to roll out to all employees in the Group, our Code 
of Conduct – an initiative in which the Board was directly 
involved. Intended to be a single point of reference, the Code 
makes very clear what standards of behaviour the company 
expects. It has at its core our shared values which describe 
what we should be doing to protect Anglo American’s good 
name, and to make a positive difference. 
GOVERNANCE 
The role of the board in leading an organisation, and in 
leading by example, is especially important in times of 
corporate stress and difficulty. As I mention in my Statement 
on page 65 of this Report, the non-executive directors 
worked closely with management through the deepening 
commodity crisis in the latter months of 2015 and early 2016 
to help steer the company through this period. 
Executive remuneration
As you know, at the AGM held in April 2016, we received a 
substantially lower percentage of support from shareholders 
than that achieved in previous years. Although there is no 
perfect remuneration system, the Board believes that at 
Anglo American there is a relatively good correlation 
between profitability and levels of variable remuneration,  
and that our remuneration system is fair, performance-based 
and peer-comparable. Following further consultation with 
shareholders, we will be presenting a revised remuneration 
policy at the forthcoming AGM, which we hope you will 
support, and which you can read on pages 84 to 109 in  
this Annual Report.
Board composition
During the year, sadly, we saw the departure of non-
executives Ray O’Rourke and Judy Dlamini. Ray joined the 
Board in 2009 and stepped down to concentrate on his 
business commitments as chairman and chief executive  
of Laing O’Rourke. His wise counsel and experience of 
complex projects, safety and innovation were of great value 
to us. Judy joined us in January 2014 and left to devote  
more time to her business commitments as chair of Mbekani 
Group in South Africa; her contributions to the Board and  
its Committees, drawing on her experiences across a range  
of geographies and sectors, including mining, were greatly 
appreciated by her colleagues. We are now nearing the  
end of the process to recruit replacement non-executive 
directors with similar skills and experience, and will 
announce one or more appointments in the near future.
After an exhaustive international search, we appointed 
Stephen Pearce as our new finance director following  
René Médori’s decision to retire. René has rendered great 
professional service to the Group for 12 years, for which  
we thank him, and we wish him all success in the future. 
Stephen, who comes to us from Fortescue Metals Group  
in Australia, joined us at the end of January and will succeed 
René at the conclusion of the AGM in April. René will remain 
with us until the end of the year to provide continuity in the 
transition and focus on specific projects. 
Chairman succession
In February 2017, I informed the Nomination Committee 
that I believed the time was right for the Board to seek a 
successor. I will have served some eight years and have 
seen Anglo American emerge in a strong position following 
the mining commodities crisis. I am honoured to have 
served as chairman of such a great company and I will leave 
behind not only a highly competent Board but a world class 
management team.
MY THANKS
I am grateful to my fellow directors for their wise counsel  
and support during a most challenging few years, and I 
particularly wish to acknowledge the substantial additional 
time and effort they spent on building the company’s 
resilience in the face of the crisis in the mining industry.  
On behalf of the Board, I also wish to thank Mark Cutifani 
and his executive team, who are delivering value in so  
many ways. I also would like to express my gratitude in  
this, our centenary year, to everyone who is working for 
Anglo American during this turbulent period, which has 
meant considerable restructuring in our business.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT MARKETPLACE REVIEW
MARKETPLACE 
REVIEW
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
The advanced economies also recorded low levels of 
growth, moving up by only 1.6% year-on-year, with the  
US recording a figure of 1.6% and Japan and South Korea 
0.5% and 2.7%, respectively. In spite of the UK voting to 
leave the EU, the country grew at an estimated 1.8%, 
compared with the Eurozone (1.7%), and Germany (1.7%), 
France (1.3%) and Italy (0.8%).
With the US Federal Reserve increasing interest rates in 
December 2016, despite US growth being lower than the 
average over the past 15 years, there seems to be greater 
acceptance of the ‘new normal’ of lower global economic 
growth. What this means for global trade and demand for 
commodities remains uncertain, with a high likelihood of 
volatility as globalisation takes a new, more populist turn. 
For mining commodities, however, with millions of people 
joining the ranks of the middle classes, the expectation is for 
commodity demand growth to be focused in the higher-end, 
fast-growing consumer sectors of the global economy. 
UNCERTAINTY BECOMES  
THE WATCHWORD
For the fourth year in a row, the world economy in 2016 
continued to languish, with the IMF progressively lowering 
its growth forecasts for the year, and also for 2017. Global 
GDP growth was 3.1% for 2016, according to the latest 
estimates from the IMF , considerably lower than its  
original forecast. 
China, however, surprised on the upside, with fiscal  
stimulus there appearing to have bought the country  
time for a more controlled economic rebalancing towards 
consumption. The US, too, continued to sustain its slow 
recovery; though elsewhere, the story was generally one  
of only lacklustre growth.
Some sectors of the mining commodities market, however, 
notably both metallurgical and thermal coal, experienced 
spectacular changes in fortune, helping to lift mining 
companies off their extreme lows experienced early in  
the year – albeit in a price and demand environment that 
continues to be characterised by considerable volatility.
CHINA’S SLOWDOWN
While concerns continue to be raised around China and its 
debt-fuelled economy, the country is still in the process of 
slowing down, with growth declining to 6.6% against 6.9%  
in 2015, though this growth rate remains stronger than was 
expected. This reflects the ongoing moves by the authorities 
to rebalance the economy away from investment towards 
consumption, including a housing stimulus that managed to 
shore up the housing sector and its associated commodity 
demand. However, despite China appearing to be prepared 
to manage the economy down gradually, there remain 
concerns around whether the country has reached the end 
of the investment boom, with a diminishing potential for 
‘catch-up’ growth, a shrinking workforce and a significant 
debt overhang in the corporate sector.
The Indian economy under Narendra Modi was expected  
to perform well at an annualised 7.6% GDP growth for 2016, 
until money supply issues were encountered as a result of 
the withdrawing of old-currency banknotes in November. 
While near term impacts have been severe, the move is  
still seen as directionally positive, opening the potential  
for enhanced contributions to the fiscus and sustained 
future growth.

06 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 POLICY CHANGES MAKING AN IMPACT
While there has been significant economic uncertainty in  
the wake of global developments, gloomy global growth 
expectations for 2016 have, at least, been deferred. The 
resilience of the Chinese economy, and particularly its 
housing sector, resulted in higher than expected demand  
for steelmaking materials, boosting bulk commodity prices 
in the year. Coal prices saw an additional benefit as China 
reduced its domestic coal output in response to new state 
energy and environmental policies. In other metals and in 
diamonds, there was limited price recovery, with supply 
generally higher than anticipated for most of the year, and 
lacklustre demand outside of China. 
Diamonds
Sustained diamond jewellery demand growth in the US  
and marginally positive growth for the full year in China  
(in local currency, though declining slightly in US dollar 
terms) contrasted with weakening demand in the other  
main diamond markets. In India, a month-long jewellers’ 
strike in March and the government’s surprise 
demonetisation programme had a considerable negative 
impact on demand. For the full year, global consumer 
demand, in US dollars, is estimated to be in line with 2015. 
Additional marketing in the US, China, India and Japan in  
the final quarter of the year, the main selling season, had a 
positive impact. Looking ahead, some significant downside 
risks remain owing to foreign exchange volatility and 
macro-economic and geopolitical factors.
Precious metals 
Platinum supply in 2016 declined by 1.7%, following  
lower sales of stock from South Africa and Russia.  
Supply
 
from recycling increased by around 10%, with 
Chinese jewellery recycling up by 53%, though supply  
from autocatalyst recycling continued to underperform  
in the low-price environment.
Higher platinum offtake
(1)
 by the autocatalyst (+2%)  
and industrial (+ 10%) sectors was largely offset by a  
15% decrease in demand from the jewellery sector. 
Platinum jewellery demand in China remained subdued, 
with a third consecutive year of decline. Meanwhile,  
demand for platinum climbed across a range of industrial 
sectors, including the chemical, glass and electrical 
industries. Investment demand is estimated to have  
been broadly in line with 2015, with platinum bar and  
coin sales in Japan remaining robust. 
The net effect of maintained production and demand, with  
a marginally higher supply from recycling, led to a reduced 
deficit in 2016 in comparison with both the previous year 
and earlier forecasts. 
Palladium mine supply was broadly in line with 2015, with 
outflows from Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) slowing  
and recycling flows growing slightly. This was not sufficient, 
however, to offset growing demand from the automotive 
sector; consequently, there was a greater deficit than in 
2015, contributing to a rally in the price of the metal as the 
year progressed.
In the near future, platinum markets are expected to  
remain balanced, with limited potential for demand growth 
or upside for mine output from South Africa or elsewhere. 
Palladium is expected to remain in deficit for the foreseeable 
future as gasoline engine automotive demand continues its 
upward trend, with limited opportunity for an increase in 
primary production.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT MARKETPLACE REVIEW
Bulk commodities
After a weak 2015, global steel demand was broadly flat in 
2016, supported by better than expected Chinese steel 
consumption. This was driven by a government-led credit 
stimulus which saw a recovery in housing and construction 
markets. In addition, Chinese light-duty vehicle production 
was 7% higher, supported by a temporary sales tax cut  
on light vehicles. As a result, global demand for both 
metallurgical coal and iron ore remained fairly stable.
Despite such relative stability in demand, seaborne thermal 
and metallurgical coal prices soared in the second half 
owing to various supply-side drivers, the most significant 
being the imposition of production controls on Chinese coal 
mines. An increased focus on safety and permitting, along 
with a reduction of working days from 330 to 276 per  
year, reduced domestic supply and boosted demand for 
seaborne imports. Seaborne producers, however, were not 
able to quickly fill the gap, and prices in the second half rose 
spectacularly – 130% in the case of metallurgical coal and 
45% for thermal coal. A subsequent partial relaxation of 
production controls (for those mines producing higher 
quality coal with the best safety records) has alleviated  
some of the tightness in the coal markets. 
Iron ore prices also fared better than in 2015, but with 
significant volatility during the year. Around 35 Mt of 
low-cost (mainly Australian) supply was estimated to  
have been added to the market, however, Chinese  
imports hit record levels, partly on the back of the country’s 
displacement of marginal domestic iron ore tonnages. The 
closure of steel capacity in China, including scrap-based 
furnaces, as part of capacity rationalisation and an 
environmental improvement drive, supported both steel  
and iron ore prices. In addition, a depreciation of the 
renminbi against the dollar and the higher incentive  
prices of Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers supported prices  
above expectations. 
A CAUTIOUS AND VOLATILE OUTLOOK
Despite the uptick in near term economic performance 
spilling over into some commodity markets and prices,  
the key question is how long the global economy, and 
particularly the Asian economies, can maintain current 
growth rates and associated commodity demand before 
moving to lower, and more sustainable, long term levels. 
Given the continued high macro-economic and political 
uncertainty, we expect ongoing commodity price volatility.
Base metals
After an uninspiring 2015, global refined copper 
consumption growth of 2% beat market expectations, 
mainly as a result of stronger construction and infrastructure 
activity, such as power grid investment, in China. 
Despite robust demand, copper prices underperformed 
other base metals for most of the year. This was partly the 
result of stronger than expected ramp-up of new mine 
supply and fewer project-related and weather disruptions  
at existing operations. Copper prices only started to show 
sustained increases in the fourth quarter of the year, 
breaking above $5,650/tonne in December, compared  
with an average for the first nine months of around  
$4,725/tonne, as sentiment towards the Chinese economy 
improved and disruptions on the supply side reverted to 
more normal levels. 
Over the long term, supply is still expected to struggle  
to meet the growing demand for primary copper, given  
the difficulty of finding new deposits of scale, a limited 
project pipeline, declining grades and more challenging 
mining conditions.

MARKETPLACE REVIEW continued
Nickel demand was 6% higher in 2016, this strong 
performance being driven primarily by increases in Chinese 
stainless steel output from new capacity additions. Refined 
production fell as the low nickel prices of 2015 and early 
2016 finally led to price-related cutbacks. In the Philippines, 
mine depletion and price- and weather-related cutbacks 
constrained ore exports to China, reducing nickel pig iron 
production there. The decline in offtake by China, however, 
was more than offset by the ramp-up of new pig iron 
production in Indonesia. 
Overall, the nickel market saw its first deficit in five years. 
Despite LME stocks remaining at high levels, and prices 
recovering by 16% since the start of 2016, the average  
price for the year was around 19% lower than for 2015.
08 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT OUR BUSINESS MODEL
OUR BUSINESS 
MODEL
The mining industry continues to face considerable 
external pressures as global economic and political 
uncertainties prevail. We responded decisively by 
sustainably improving cash flow generation, materially 
strengthening our balance sheet through selective 
asset disposals and actively managing our diversified 
portfolio to focus on our differentiated asset and 
product mix.
The high quality assets across our De Beers, platinum  
group metals (PGMs) and Copper businesses underpin  
our positions in those respective markets and are the 
cornerstone of a more resilient and competitive business, 
through the economic and commodity price cycle. In 
addition, Anglo American also benefits from the 
performance of a number of other high quality, individual 
assets across the bulk commodities and other minerals, 
including iron ore, coal and nickel, which are optimised 
operationally to continue to contribute cash and returns, 
while ensuring appropriate capital investment to both 
preserve and enhance value. The value from our mineral 
resources and market positions is optimised by our 
dedicated Marketing business, driving appropriate 
commercial decisions across the value chain.
In summary, our ambition is to create a resilient business 
that delivers robust profitability and sustainable, positive 
cash flows through the cycle. 
We have a clearly defined approach for how we will  
achieve this:
Vision: To be partners in the future.
It is our belief that Anglo American, and mining as an 
industry, has both the potential and responsibility to act as  
a development partner, for the long term benefit of society.
Mission: Together, we create sustainable value that 
makes a real difference.
We cannot meet our ultimate objective on our own. We  
will work together with our diverse range of stakeholders  
to ensure we deliver value on a sustainable basis that  
makes a positive and lasting difference.
VALUES AT THE CORE
We are creating an organisation where all our people  
are treated in such a way that they willingly give their best. 
Acting according to our values – Safety, Care and respect, 
Integrity, Accountability, Collaboration and Innovation – 
defines our culture as an organisation, underpinning our 
reputation and the promise we make to all our stakeholders: 
Real Mining. Real People. Real Difference.
WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT: BUILDING STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE
Across De Beers, PGMs and Copper, our assets are characterised  
by having world class orebodies, competitive industry cost positions,  
long reserve lives and significant resource potential, offering 
considerable organic growth opportunities, thereby representing three 
businesses in which we have leading competitive positions. These are 
complemented by a number of other high quality, individual assets 
across iron ore, coal and nickel. Underpinning our uniquely diversified 
portfolio of differentiated assets is Anglo American’s expertise  
across a number of core processes – exploration, innovation, project 
development and sustainability – while our Marketing business 
optimises value from our resources and market positions. The benefits 
of a systematically embedded Operating Model and the functional 
governance structure of the Organisation Model combine to create 
optimal and sustainable value.
DIFFERENTIATED ASSETS IN A UNIQUELY DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO:
De Beers 
De Beers has a global leadership 
position in diamonds, producing 
and selling around one-third of 
the world’s rough diamonds by 
value. Our major diamond mining 
assets have large, long life and 
scalable resource bases and  
we have well-established 
partnerships in South Africa  
and with the governments of 
Botswana and Namibia.
PGMs
We are the world’s leading  
PGMs producer, with positions  
in the world’s two largest PGM 
deposits – the Bushveld Complex 
in South Africa and the Great Dyke 
in Zimbabwe. We operate the 
world’s highest margin platinum 
mine at Mogalakwena – a long life, 
scalable open pit operation that 
has the potential to lift production 
significantly as market demand 
requires. 
Copper
Anglo American has a world  
class position in copper, with  
the potential to establish a global 
leadership position built around 
its interests in two of the world’s 
largest copper mines – Los Bronces 
and Collahuasi – and its feasibility 
phase Quellaveco project in 
southern Peru. The mineral 
endowments of these assets 
underpin our organic copper 
growth opportunities, in  
addition to a number of future  
potential projects. 
Bulk commodities  
and other minerals 
Anglo American also benefits 
from a number of other high 
quality assets across the bulk 
commodities of iron ore and coal, 
as well as nickel.
These assets are optimised 
operationally to continue to 
contribute cash and returns,  
while being allocated capital to 
preserve and enhance value,  
as appropriate.
DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL MARKETING
De Beers’ leading position is 
further enhanced by its rough 
diamond sales operation selling  
to term customers, accredited 
buyers and auction sales 
customers. It also has a presence 
in the downstream through 
Forevermark™ and De Beers 
Diamond Jewellers.
The value from our mineral resources and market positions is optimised by our dedicated Marketing 
business. Built on direct customer relationships, Marketing creates value across the entire value chain from 
mine to market through appropriate commercial decisions aligned to our customers’ specific requirements 
– including product specification, volume and timing. In addition, Marketing proactively develops new 
markets for our products through, for example, investing in new technologies that are expected to drive new 
sources of demand for PGMs – such as fuel cell electric vehicles – and building consumer awareness in 
emerging platinum jewellery markets, such as India.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
DECISIVE ACTIONS  
STRENGTHENED FOUNDATIONS
Mark Cutifani
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
I regularly state that creating a platform of operational 
excellence is fundamental to delivering the full potential 
from our asset base, independent of the market’s external 
influences. In fact, weaker or more volatile markets 
emphasise a greater need for operating discipline, to  
ensure that we are operating to deliver optimal cash  
flows while preserving the assets’ longer term integrity.
The actions we have taken to improve the quality of our 
asset portfolio as a whole, and to lift operating performance 
at the asset level through the implementation of our 
Operating Model, is driving materially stronger results.
Compared with 2012, we produced in aggregate in 2016, 
8% more physical product from one-third fewer assets  
and at a 31% lower unit cost, on a copper equivalent basis, 
together representing a 41% increase in productivity
  
over that four year period. This performance is the clearest 
illustration of the fundamental changes we have made to  
the way we run the business and the progress we have  
made to increase the quality of the portfolio. In dollar  
terms, we delivered $1.5 billion of cost and volume 
improvements, net of such headwinds as the snowfall  
and strikes at Los Bronces and the smelter run-out in our 
Platinum business.
In 2017, we are aiming to deliver an incremental $1 billion  
of net cost and volume improvements, 75% of which has 
already been identified.
REFINING THE PORTFOLIO
The transformation of our portfolio is well advanced,  
moving from 68 assets in 2013 to 42 at the end of 2016.
In 2016, we received $1.8 billion
(1)
 from disposal 
transactions, largely from the $1.5 billion sale of our niobium 
and phosphates business in Brazil to China Molybdenum  
Co. Ltd., which completed in September 2016.
During the year, we also completed the divestments of  
the Callide and Foxleigh coal mines in Australia, and our 
9.7% interest in Exxaro in South Africa; and in November, 
following the receipt of all regulatory approvals, we 
completed the sale of our Rustenburg platinum operations 
in South Africa to Sibanye.
We will continue to refine our asset portfolio on an  
ongoing basis in order to ensure that our capital is  
deployed effectively to generate enhanced returns  
for our shareholders.
THE NEW ANGLO AMERICAN
Our business strategy is based on the quality of the assets in 
our portfolio and, in certain product areas, the aggregation 
of those assets to create leading market positions. The 
assets are further enhanced by the marketing, technical  
and other critical, value-adding core processes that are 
delivered by the Group.
The high quality assets across our De Beers, PGMs  
and Copper businesses underpin our positions in those 
respective markets and are the cornerstone of a  
The decisive and wide-ranging operational, cost, capital  
and portfolio actions we set out in 2016 – to sustainably 
improve cash flows and strengthen the balance sheet –  
have enabled us to reduce net debt by 34% to $8.5 billion, 
significantly below our $10 billion target. 
While the prices for many of our products recovered during 
the second half of 2016 – including a particularly sharp 
increase for metallurgical coal in the fourth quarter – the 
average price for our basket of products for the year as a 
whole remained marginally below that for the prior year, 
reminding us of the scale of the price decreases that the 
industry incurred during late 2015. 
Against that backdrop, and with our continued sharp  
focus on operational costs and productivity, we delivered  
a $3.5 billion increase in attributable free cash flow, a  
25% increase in underlying EBITDA to $6.1 billion and  
grew our underlying EBITDA margin by five percentage 
points to 26%. Profit for the financial year attributable to 
equity shareholders increased to $1.6 billion, compared 
with a $5.6 billion loss in 2015. Following a 20% increase 
in copper equivalent productivity between 2012 and 2015, 
we delivered an additional 18% productivity increase 
during 2016. 
The $1.5 billion sale of the niobium and phosphates 
business further supported our balance sheet recovery  
goal and, combined with the sale of a number of coal and 
platinum assets during the year, we received $1.8 billion
(1)
  
of disposal proceeds in 2016.
Keeping our people safe at work has always been an 
absolute priority. In 2016, we reported a 24% reduction  
in recordable case frequency rates, but an increase in fatal 
incidents. Tragically, we lost 1 1 colleagues during the year, 
largely due to failures around our critical safety risk areas. 
We can never accept even one serious injury and our efforts 
are concentrated around those major risk areas. We are 
determined that our goal of zero harm is achievable and  
we are working with every employee to get there.
In terms of environmental performance, there is no  
doubt that improved work planning and a greater focus  
on risk assessment has delivered a further reduction in  
the number of incidents, now 85% fewer than in 2013.
The actions we took across the business to  
drive free cash flow and further refine our

12 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 more resilient and competitive Anglo American, through  
the economic and commodity price cycle. In addition, we 
continue to benefit from the performance of a number of 
other world class assets across the bulk commodities of  
iron ore and coal, as well as nickel. We will continue to 
pursue opportunities to improve returns across each of  
our assets and product suites.
During 2016 and into 201 7 , we have continued to increase  
the overall quality of the portfolio through the completed or 
announced divestments of a number of assets, including the 
Rustenburg and Union platinum operations in South Africa and 
several of our smaller coal assets in Australia, amongst others.
In addition, and in response to the need to strengthen our 
financial position in light of the sharp falls in commodity 
prices in late 2015, we also decided to sell our niobium  
and phosphates business in Brazil. Through an extensive 
and competitive sale process, we agreed to sell those 
businesses to China Molybdenum, generating cash 
proceeds considerably higher than market expectations.
While we saw strong interest in a number of the major  
assets for which we also held sale processes during 2016  
to further strengthen our financial position, we adhered to 
our strict value thresholds and chose not to transact. We  
will continue to upgrade our portfolio as a matter of course, 
although asset disposals for the purposes of deleveraging  
are no longer required. We therefore retain the world class 
Moranbah and Grosvenor metallurgical coal assets in 
Australia and our much upgraded nickel assets in Brazil, 
ensuring that they continue to be optimised operationally  
to contribute cash and returns, while being allocated capital 
to both protect and enhance value.
In South Africa, we continue to work through all the potential 
options for our export thermal coal and iron ore interests, 
recognising the high quality and performance of these 
businesses and ensuring that value is optimised for all our 
shareholders. The retention of these assets remains a viable 
position given our recent improvements and our focus on 
continuing improvements as we go forward.
Despite our significant progress, it is critical that the lessons 
of recent years are applied and, although there is confidence 
in the long term outlook for our products, the balance sheet 
must be able to withstand expected price volatility in the 
short to medium term. Our priority in 2017 is to deliver 
further productivity improvements while maintaining capital 
and cost discipline in order to be in a position to resume 
dividend payments for the end of 2017, and to restore an 
investment grade credit rating. 
In 2017, capital expenditure
(2)
 will be maintained at 
$2.5 billion, with stay-in-business capital increased to 
$1.2 billion. Capital will be appropriately prioritised, with  
care taken to ensure that we protect the long term value  
of our assets. We retain a number of attractive organic 
options, particularly in our Copper business, which we  
will continue to progress appropriately and assess in  
light of our overall capital structure and the prevailing  
macro environment.
Our portfolio constitutes a highly attractive, competitive  
and well balanced business, with the leverage of scale, 
technical and marketing expertise and mineral  
endowment options, which offer considerable upside 
potential over the long term. 
PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE
Developing and maintaining positive relationships with  
host communities continues to be a priority. We made good 
progress in rolling out the updated Social Way, our rigorous 
management standard for community issues. During 2016, 
we eliminated serious non-compliances for the first time  
and almost halved moderate non-compliances. Overall 
compliance reached 84% (2015: 66%). 
An innovative and low cost SMS-based community survey 
mechanism was piloted in 2016 with positive results. The 
surveys highlighted the importance to host communities  
of high quality stakeholder engagement and a sense of 
fairness in our dealings with communities, in particular for 
the handling of complaints, managing negative impacts and 
generating widespread benefits from our operations. The 
surveys were also able to provide near real-time feedback 
on community sentiment and concerns, greatly aiding the 
ability of sites to respond to local priorities. Survey findings 
were also successfully combined with local social media 
activity to create new channels for stakeholder engagement. 
We will be rolling out the SMS surveys at priority sites as an 
ongoing programme through 2017. 
We continued to drive the implementation of our innovative 
economic development model at a number of our 
operations. The model focuses on leveraging the value 
chains and skills within the business, and prioritises actions 
such as local procurement, enterprise development and 
skills-based employee volunteering. It was particularly 
gratifying to see our approach supported by the Inter-
American Development Bank, which has contributed  
$2 million of co-funding to enhance our supplier and 
enterprise development programmes across Latin America. 
We have also piloted an innovative spatial development 
planning approach in Limpopo, South Africa. This has 
identified a wide range of near term economic development 
opportunities that we are now discussing with government 
and other stakeholders. 
Our approach at community level continues to be informed 
by broader stakeholder engagement at national and 
international level. We have continued to be a progressive 
voice in dialogues with governments, faith groups and  
NGOs on topics such as the Sustainable Development 
Goals, revenue transparency and ethical value chains in  
the mining sector.
In 2016, the engagement between leaders in the mining 
sector and faith groups grew and was formalised as the 
Mining and Faith Reflections Initiative. An independent 
secretariat was established to support the initiative and 
there were new dialogues established in Zambia and Peru. 
In South Africa, where discussions are most advanced,  
the focus for 2016 was on exploring how the faith group-
industry collaboration can bring meaningful benefits to 
communities in mining areas, with a particular emphasis on 
health and economic development. We are very hopeful of 
seeing the first results from these efforts in 2017.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
THANK YOU
In this, Anglo American’s centenary year, and on behalf  
of my colleagues on the Group Management Committee,  
I would like to thank all our people across the business for 
their hard work and commitment in what was a year of 
significant change and market volatility, and also thank  
our widespread and diverse stakeholders for their 
understanding and support.
As a result of our decisive actions in 2016, and the  
results delivered by our people across the company,  
Anglo American is now more robust, with a stronger  
balance sheet and more competitive cost structure  
around a world class and uniquely diversified asset base. 
Anglo American’s strategic direction is clear and we have  
a highly motivated team that understands how we create 
sustainable value through the way we run the business.
OUTLOOK
In 2016, we have seen how unpredictable the economic  
and political environment is, emphasising the importance  
of asset quality, balance sheet strength, operational 
excellence and overall resilience. And, as we look ahead,  
we do expect ongoing price volatility for many of our 
products. However, with supply generally more constrained 
following a number of years of low capital investment and  
a generally more cautious approach across the industry, 
coupled with still growing demand as China seeks to balance 
its economy via both stimulus and a managed slowdown,  
the fundamental picture is sound. The world’s consuming 
and aspirational middle class continues to grow in size at  
a considerable rate, further supporting demand for our 
products that are more skewed to the later stages of the 
development cycle.
OUR MISSION: 
Together, we create 
sustainable value 
that makes a real 
difference

BUILDING RESILIENCE
REMUNERATION
Anglo American’s directors’ remuneration policy, which will be 
put to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM, is designed  
to encourage delivery of the Group’s strategy and creation of 
stakeholder value in a responsible and sustainable manner.  
The main elements of the remuneration package are basic 
salary, annual bonus and long term incentive plan (LTIP).
ANNUAL BONUS 
     
Annual bonus performance measures include:
 • 50% on underlying earnings per share (EPS). EPS is one of the 
Group’s key financial measures of performance and is set on 
an annual basis to ensure targets are demanding yet realistic
 • The remaining measures are non-financial and include project 
delivery, business improvement, stakeholder engagement and 
talent management

safety targets are met. 
 • To help ensure sustainable long term performance, 60% of 
any annual bonus is deferred into shares for a minimum of 
three years and is subject to clawback.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
   
The LTIP performance measures are aligned to our strategic 
objectives over a three-year performance period. Vested  
LTIP awards are subject to clawback and must be held for  
an additional two years to encourage alignment of executive  
and shareholder interests.
The proposed LTIP performance measures and weightings are:
 • 70% subject to Group Total Shareholder Return (TSR), with 
two-thirds relative to the Euromoney Global Mining Index  
and one-third relative to the constituent of the FTSE 100 index
 • 30% subject to a balanced scorecard of financial and  
strategic objectives
Full details are set out in the directors’  
remuneration report on pages 84-109.

GAHCHO KUÉ – DELIVERING THE LARGEST 
NEW DIAMOND MINE IN MORE THAN A DECADE
Gahcho Kué, the world’s largest new diamond mine in the last 13 years, officially 
opened in September 2016, ahead of schedule and in line with the projected  
C$1 billion (US$0.9 billion) capital budget. The mine, a joint venture between De Beers 
(51%) and Mountain Province Diamonds (49%), is expected to produce approximately 
53 million carats of rough diamonds, from around 34 million tonnes of material, over its 
projected 12-year life, from 201 7.
A fly-in/fly-out remote mine site, where winter temperatures can regularly plunge as 
low as minus 40⁰C or colder, Gahcho Kué lies 280 kilometres north-east of Yellowknife 
in Canada’s Northwest Territories (NWT). The mine, which was commissioned in 
August 2016, is on track to reach full commercial operation in the first quarter of 201 7. 
It will mine three open pits, and will employ a total of 530 employees and long term 
contractors. In 2016, Gahcho Kué supported a total of 2,050 direct and indirect full 
time equivalent (FTE) jobs, with an induced employment impact of 660 FTE’s
(1)
.
Over the life of the mine, Gahcho Kué is expected to contribute a total of C$5.7 billion 
into the economy of NWT, which derives more than half of its gross domestic product 
from mining activities. Partnering with local indigenous communities, which have a  
say on the use of resources in their ancestral lands, has ensured that the majority of 
workers during both the construction phase and the ongoing operation of the mine  
are drawn from the local community.
Production from Gahcho Kué will more than compensate for the loss of output 
following the placement of Snap Lake onto extended care and maintenance at the  
end of 2015. The mine will make an important contribution to rough diamond supply  
in an environment characterised by a steady rise in consumer demand from the 
growing middle classes in emerging markets, and from millennials, combined with 
supply constraints as economically viable kimberlite resource discoveries continue  
to be rare events.
The high quality assets across our De Beers, platinum group metals (PGMs) and 
Copper businesses underpin our position in those respective markets and are the 
cornerstone of a more resilient and competitive Anglo American. In addition, we 
continue to benefit from the performance of a number of other world class assets 
across the bulk commodities of iron ore and coal, as well as nickel.

16 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 As the mining industry continues to recover from  
the sharp price decreases of late 2015 and the early 
months of 2016, Anglo American has materially 
strengthened its balance sheet by generating 
significantly improved free cash flows and by 
completing the sale of a number of assets. Greater 
project, operating capital and cost discipline, combined 
with a 41% increase in productivity since 2012, are 
restoring our competitive advantage. We are building 
strong foundations for a more resilient Anglo American, 
more attuned to changing market dynamics, and well 
positioned to deliver robust profitability and cash flows 
through the cycle. 
BUILDING STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE 
The primary source of competitive advantage in the mining 
industry is to own high quality, low cost, long life assets of 
scale, with positions that can be further enhanced if those 
assets deliver products into structurally attractive markets. 
In assessing our asset portfolio, we consider:
 • The stand-alone quality of individual assets, including their 
relative cost position and resource and growth potential;
 • Our global competitive position within the individual 
product groups; and
 • The additional value potential generated through our 
dedicated marketing expertise.
De Beers
De Beers has a global leadership position in diamonds, 
producing around a third of the world’s rough diamonds,  
by value. Within its portfolio, De Beers (Anglo American: 
85% interest), in partnership with the Government of the 
Republic of Botswana, has one of the largest diamond 
resources, by volume, in the world at Orapa and one of the 
richest diamond mines, by value, at Jwaneng. The recently 
commissioned Gahcho Kué mine, in Canada’s Northwest 
Territories, will add an additional 53 million carats of rough 
diamonds over its projected 12-year life, from 2017.
Our major diamond mining assets have large, long life and 
scalable resources and we are continuing to invest in our 
existing operations to extend our mining activities. The 
‘Cut-8’ expansion of Jwaneng will increase the depth of the 
mine from 400 metres to 650 metres, while, in South Africa, 
Venetia is being extended underground, extending the life  
of mine to 2046
(1)
.
The lack of any significant economic kimberlite discoveries 
over many years, combined with the ongoing growth in 
consumer demand for diamond jewellery in both mature 
and developing markets, points to strong prospects for  
the diamond business.
Through its differentiated rough diamond distribution 
model, which comprises term contract sightholders, 
accredited buyers and auction sales customers, De Beers 
has a range of insights into its customers’ demand patterns. 
De Beers seeks to stimulate consumer demand for 
diamonds through its Forevermark™ brand and De Beers 
Diamond Jewellers, a retail joint venture with LVMH Moët 
Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)
Our Platinum business (held through a 78% interest in 
Anglo American Platinum) is the world’s leading PGM 
producer. It occupies the pre-eminent position, in terms of 
production, mining, processing and refining assets and the 
quality and size of its resource base in the world’s largest 
PGM deposit – the Bushveld Complex in South Africa –  
and has a significant stake in the world’s No. 2 PGM deposit 
on the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe. Our flagship platinum  
mine, Mogalakwena, is the highest-margin producer in the 
industry and, as the only large open pit PGM mine globally,  
is at the centre of a more flexible, competitive and lower  
risk business.
Platinum is continuing its ongoing repositioning around a 
leaner, best in class operating footprint at the Mogalakwena 
and Amandelbult mines in South Africa, and Unki in 
Zimbabwe, alongside its joint venture interests in the 
Bafokeng-Rasimone, Mototolo and Modikwa mines in 
South Africa.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE
FOCUS THE PORTFOLIO continued
Demand for PGMs is forecast to increase over time,  
given the ongoing trend towards cleaner emission vehicles, 
driven by increasingly stringent global emissions legislation. 
Increasing demand by the automotive industry is likely to  
be augmented by growing opportunities for emerging new 
applications, including hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell electric 
vehicles, while emerging countries such as India offer the 
potential of developing, from a relatively low base, into 
significant platinum jewellery markets.
Our business is well positioned to proactively shape  
demand for platinum, including through targeted campaigns 
in emerging jewellery markets, creating new investment 
demand for the metal as a store of value and through direct 
investment in a number of companies developing new 
technologies that are expected to drive industrial demand 
for PGMs, such as fuel cells for electric vehicles.
Copper
Anglo American has a world class asset position in copper, 
with the potential to establish a leading position built around 
its interests in two of the world’s largest copper mines – 
Los Bronces (a 50.1% owned subsidiary) and Collahuasi 
(44% owned), with Reserve Lives of 24 years and 69 years, 
respectively. The resource base of these assets underpins 
our future brownfield opportunities, in addition to a number 
of future potential projects, including our feasibility phase 
Quellaveco project in southern Peru – one of the world’s 
largest untapped copper orebodies – and the polymetallic 
Sakatti deposit in Finland.
The copper market, although expected to be broadly 
balanced in the medium term, is expected to struggle to 
meet longer term demand growth as declining grades 
and more challenging physical and environmental 
conditions, along with tougher licensing and permitting 
requirements, will all affect the industry’s ability to deliver 
new copper supply to the market.
Bulk commodities and other minerals
Anglo American also benefits from a number of other high 
quality individual assets across the bulk commodities of  
iron ore, metallurgical and thermal coal, as well as nickel.
Anglo American’s iron ore operations provide customers 
with niche, high iron content ore, a large percentage  
of which is direct-charge product for blast furnaces.  
In South Africa, we have a majority share (c. 70%) in  
Kumba Iron Ore, where the Sishen and Kolomela mines 
produce leading quality lump ore and also a premium fine 
ore. In Brazil, we have developed the integrated Minas-Rio 
operation (100% ownership), consisting of an open pit  
mine and beneficiation plant in Minas Gerais, which 
produces pellet feed. The iron ore produced is transported 
through a 529 kilometre pipeline to the Ferroport iron ore  
handling and shipping facilities at the port of Açu, in  
which Anglo American has a 50% shareholding. 
PGMs – FUELLING THE FUTURE
For years, PGMs have not only been essential in curbing 
noxious emissions in both petrol- and diesel-fuelled 
vehicles, but have been vital to the fields of medicine, 
electronics and jewellery, as well as an array of industrial 
applications. Today, PGMs are playing an increasing part 
in helping create a cleaner, more sustainable future.
As the contribution of burning fossil fuels to global 
warming continues to cause concern, and governments 
impose increasingly stringent vehicle emissions  
targets, the world needs to identify viable and  
economic renewable technologies for powering cars. 
Anglo American believes that PGM-containing fuel  
cell technologies provide one proven response to this  
global challenge.
With refuelling taking just a few minutes and with a  
range similar to petrol or diesel vehicles, fuel cell electric 
vehicles, or FCEVs, employ platinum as the principal 
catalyst to cleanly and efficiently convert energy from 
hydrogen into electrical power in an electrochemical 
process whose only emission is water. 
With fuel cells expected to result in annual platinum 
demand of several hundred thousand ounces by  
2025, the industry presents a major opportunity for  
the platinum mining industry. At Anglo American, we  
are working with partners around the world to promote  
fuel cell technology in a number of applications. In  
South Africa, we have partnered with Ballard to  
deploy the world’s first off-grid, fuel cell mini-grid to 
provide primary power to a rural community. In the UK, 
we are leasing a Hyundai ix35 fuel cell-powered car for 
four years as part of the London Hydrogen Network 
Expansion project. We are also working closely with Fuel 
Cell Hydrogen and Energy Association (in the US) and 
Hydrogen Europe to promote and advocate FCEVs and 
hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.
Anglo American believes that PGM-containing fuel cell technologies provide  
a proven response to the global challenge of cleaner transportation and is 
leasing this Hyundai ix35 fuel cell-powered car as part of its visible commitment 
to encouraging the development of the hydrogen economy.
18 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Our Tier 1 coal assets include the Moranbah North  
(88% ownership) and Grosvenor (100% ownership) 
metallurgical coal mines, both located in Queensland, 
Australia. The mines are underground longwall operations 
and produce hard coking coal. In Colombia, Anglo American, 
BHP Billiton and Glencore each have a one-third 
shareholding in Cerrejón, the country’s largest thermal  
coal exporter.
Our Barro Alto nickel operation (100% ownership) produces 
ferronickel and is based in Goiás, Brazil. 
In South Africa, we continue to work through all the potential 
options for our export thermal coal and iron ore interests, 
including retention, recognising the high quality and 
performance of these businesses and ensuring that value  
is optimised for all our shareholders.
Our Bulk commodities and other minerals assets have been 
optimised operationally to ensure ongoing and sustainable 
cash generation and returns, while being allocated capital to 
both preserve and enhance value, as appropriate.
We will continue to refine and upgrade our asset portfolio  
on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that our capital is 
deployed effectively to generate enhanced returns for  
our shareholders.
Portfolio restructuring in the year
The disposal of a number of assets completed to date,  
has contributed to the substantial $4.4 billion reduction  
of net debt during 2016. By year end, net debt stood at  
$8.5 billion, significantly below the targeted level of  
$10 billion. 
Disposals announced and completed in 2016
During 2016, we received $1.8 billion
(1)
 of disposal proceeds, 
including the $1.5 billion sale of our niobium and phosphates 
business in Brazil to China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. 
We completed the disposal of two coal assets in 
Queensland, Australia in the year; a 70% interest in the 
Foxleigh metallurgical coal mine, and the sale of our 100% 
interest in the Callide thermal coal mine. The terms of both 
transactions remain confidential.
The disposal of the Rustenburg platinum mines to  
Sibanye Gold, announced in 2015, was completed in  
2016. Anglo American also sold its 9.7% interest in  
Exxaro Resources Limited.
Sales have also been agreed for the Dartbrook coal  
mine in Australia and the Pandora platinum joint venture  
in South Africa, subject to a number of conditions. The 
disposal of the remaining interests in Tarmac operations 
located in the Middle East was completed in 2016.
Other portfolio changes
The Group has ceased, or is ceasing, production at a 
number of operations. Operations that have been closed  
or placed onto care and maintenance since 2015 include: 
Snap Lake (diamonds) in Canada; Damtshaa (diamonds, 
temporary care and maintenance) in Botswana;  
Drayton coal mine in Australia; and Twickenham platinum 
mine and Thabazimbi (iron ore), both in South Africa.
In February 2017, we agreed the sale of our 85%  
interest in the Union platinum mine in South Africa  
to Siyanda Resources.

DRIVE CONSISTENT DELIVERY
SISHEN – COMING THROUGH THE DOWNTURN, 
PREPARED FOR THE UPTURN
During 201 5, confronted by steadily declining prices as iron ore markets continued  
to deteriorate, Kumba Iron Ore took bold action to ensure that South Africa’s premier 
iron ore producer remained profitable.
In a series of moves in response to the worsening price environment, the huge open  
pit at Sishen mine was progressively redesigned, with a final pit design achieved in late 
201 5. This design called for considerably less waste rock stripping, which would allow 
Sishen to operate at a reduced cash break even price. More generally, it enabled a more 
flexible and responsive approach to mining operations, with lower execution risk.
The ramifications of the reconfiguration of pit design and change in mining approach, 
however, were to be felt far more widely – and it would take a multi-disciplinary team 
effort if Kumba was to successfully deliver on its plans.
On the operational side, the mine and the Group’s technical and financial teams worked 
closely together on a series of business improvement projects, with additional support 
provided by the ongoing implementation of Anglo American’s Operating Model. 
Two areas of the business merited particular focus: operating hours and mining fleet 
utilisation had to increase materially – by as much as 30%; and substantial changes 
needed to be made to the shift-roster system. The first was largely achieved by the 
fourth quarter as a new rigour was applied to seeking greater efficiencies. Secondly, 
new rosters enabled a more effective handover between shifts and reduced break 
times, leading to a 10% increase in productivity in this area.
In many ways, however, the impact on people’s lives was even more challenging. The 
changes meant that some 1,500 employees, along with 1,000 contractors, would have 
to leave the operation. Through a comprehensive process of engagement, at all levels  
of the organisation, with affected stakeholders, Kumba was able to undertake the 
largest restructure in its history while avoiding industrial action.
As global economic and political uncertainty continues and commodity prices remain 
generally volatile, it is important to continue driving improvements through our business. 
In this challenging environment, we are committed to managing what is in our control; 
achieving cost and productivity improvements; to enhance cash flows through the cycle; 
and further strengthen our balance sheet.

The introduction of Anglo American’s operating model at Kumba’s Sishen iron ore mine in South Africa, in tandem with 
progressive redesign of the huge open pit in light of a worsening price environment, has led to a more resilient operation able 
to operate at a reduced cash break even price.

20 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 We are continuing to implement Anglo American’s 
Operating Model in order to deliver ongoing 
productivity improvements, lower operating costs  
and to carry out work safely. Leveraging the Group’s 
considerable technical expertise, the Operating Model 
provides the structure and discipline to optimise the 
operation of our world class assets and provides the 
foundation for improvements across the business. 
These operational improvements, our rigorous 
approach to capital allocation, and the proceeds 
received from asset disposals in the year have 
improved free cash flows, reducing net debt to 
significantly below $10 billion and materially 
strengthening the Group’s balance sheet.
BUILDING A STABLE OPERATIONAL PLATFORM 
Delivery of the Operating Model is leading to greater 
confidence in our ability to deliver to our plans and improve 
work management, as work is now planned, scheduled  
and resourced well ahead of execution. The Operating 
Model also provides greater role clarity, with distinct 
accountabilities and responsibilities, enabling sustainable 
and stable processes that deliver the expected outcomes. 
Although there are three components to the Operating 
Model, which address operational strategy, work 
management, and continuous improvement, the focus  
to date has been on work management execution. By the 
end of 2016, various components of the Operating Model 
had been fully or partially implemented at nine sites. 
At Kolomela, implementation of the Operating Model in  
the plant area has seen a marked improvement in work 
execution, with scheduled work completion now in excess  
of 95%. Screening-tonnes throughput improved by 18% 
during the ‘go-live’ phase, and a further 18% during the 
stabilisation phase. The plant’s process stability has also 
improved significantly. 
At Sishen, initial mining work management implementation 
resulted in significant improvements in the amount of ore 
and waste moved. The restructuring of the business, 
however, and the resultant lower production and waste 
removal targets for the year, has reduced the extent of 
operational improvements compared with previous 
roll-outs. Work management for the reconfigured mining 
set-up is now under way. 
At Jwaneng, the Operating Model went live in September, 
and is currently in the stabilisation phase, with early 
indications showing promising results. The model’s work 
management component is now being implemented at  
the Letlhakane Tailings Retreatment plant. 
At De Beers’ Venetia mine, implementation of the  
Operating Model is in the project set-up phase while at 
Gahcho Kué, the implementation of the Operating Model  
is more advanced.
Delivery of the Operating Model continued at 
Mogalakwena (production and maintenance) at the  
South Concentrator, while implementation at the North 
concentrator was completed earlier in the year.  
The improvement in work performance indicators has 
already led to an increase of approximately 10% in daily 
milling output. 
A significant improvement has also been realised in work 
execution performance at Minas-Rio, with scheduled work 
completion currently standing at 85%. 
At both Los Bronces’ processing operations, milling  
circuit availability has increased, while there has been a 
reduction in process variability. Implementation of the work 
management component in the mining operations went  
live at the end of 2016. All remaining work at Los Bronces  
is scheduled to be completed in 2017. 
During 2017, the main focus of the Operating Model’s work 
management component will be on the Platinum business, 
with Amandelbult scheduled to go live towards the end of 
the year. Additional projects will also be carried out 
concurrently at the Rustenburg Base Metal Refinery. 
ENHANCING PERFORMANCE  
AT MOGALAKWENA
Anglo American’s Operating Model is aimed at getting 
the best out of the company’s assets – and particularly 
assets such as Mogalakwena in South Africa. 
At the mine’s North Concentrator, where PGM-bearing 
ore is processed into high-grade PGM-bearing 
concentrate, we are unlocking value through continually 
modernising processing technologies and through 
maximising efficiencies in processing. 
Key initiatives to enhance concentrator productivity  
and profitability include: measures to enhance flotation 
kinetic response; the optimisation of fine grinding 
techniques in order to mitigate metal losses of locked 
minerals; modifications to the configuration of  
the flotation circuit; and taking a hard look at  
equipment constraints. 
Such measures have led to improved nominal 
throughput rates, which have assisted in increasing 
metal production while also lowering unit costs.
New processing technologies being adopted at Mogalakwena, following the 
implementation there of Anglo American’s Operating Model, are leading to 
higher ore-milling rates and increased plant throughput. Here, control room 
operators Priscilla Tsheole (left) and Maggy Botsanara monitor the stability  
of operations at the North Concentrator.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION
Effective capital allocation throughout the cycle is 
critical to delivering value, given the long term and 
capital intensive nature of our business. The Group 
applies a dynamic capital allocation process, while 
maintaining a strong focus on capital discipline. 
In the near term, the focus remains on further  
strengthening the balance sheet and to restore an 
investment grade credit rating, while continuing to allocate 
the capital expenditure needed, across our portfolio of 
assets, to both sustain our business and to protect value.  
We aim to reinstate dividend payments as soon as possible 
and expect to do so by the end of 2017. The Group will 
continue to seek to upgrade the quality of its portfolio  
of assets, including through ensuring an appropriate 
geographic balance. Excess capital will be returned to 
shareholders unless there are compelling value-accretive 
opportunities for investment. 
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS
Anglo American seeks to improve operating free cash 
flow through five key levers: improving productivity  
and lowering input costs across all operations  
(including through deployment of the Operating Model); 
reducing overhead expenditure (including through 
implementation of the Functional Model); timely delivery 
of new projects (primarily Grosvenor and Barro Alto 
during 2016); maximising revenue (including through 
improvement in our marketing activities); and optimising 
our investment in working capital.
During 2016, cash flows from operations increased to  
$5.8 billion (2015: $4.2 billion), driven by the delivery of cost 
and volume improvements of $1.5 billion, which included a 
recovery in sales volumes at De Beers, contributions from 
recently completed projects, and cost reductions across the 
Group. Working capital cash inflows improved by $0.4 billion 
following improvement initiatives across all areas. The 
recently completed Grosvenor (Coal Australia) and Barro 
Alto (Nickel) projects both ramped up during 2016, together 
contributing $0.2 billion to cash flow from operations. 
Results from Gahcho Kué (De Beers) are expected to  
cease to be capitalised in the first quarter of 2017, and from 
Minas-Rio (Iron Ore Brazil) with effect from January 2017, 
after which these assets will also contribute to cash flow 
from operations.
SUSTAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
We continue to focus on capital discipline and  
stay-in-business capital efficiency, while maintaining 
the operational integrity of all our assets. A sustainable 
level of total capital expenditure for the current 
portfolio of assets, excluding growth projects, is 
approximately $2.5 billion per year.
Stay-in-business capital expenditure decreased to  
$1.0 billion (2015: $1.4 billion), primarily due to a focus  
on capital discipline and the continued roll-out of the 
Operating Model across our assets. 
Development and stripping capital expenditure decreased 
to $0.6 billion (2015: $0.7 billion), primarily as a result of the 
redesign of the pit at Kumba’s Sishen iron ore operation, 
where the transition was made to a lower strip ratio and 
operational cost position.
During 2016, continued progress was made on our ongoing 
expansion projects, including the construction of De Beers’ 
Venetia underground mine in South Africa, where the 
decline advanced to more than 2,000 metres. The project  
is now 26% complete, with the underground operation 
expected to be the mine’s principal source of ore from 2023.
BALANCE SHEET FLEXIBILITY
Consistent with our objective to restore an investment 
grade credit rating, our near term objective is to 
continue to reduce net debt and ensure the Group’s  
net debt/EBITDA ratio remains below 1.5. 
Net debt at 31 December 2016 was $8.5 billion, significantly 
lower than the year-end target of $10 billion, resulting in a 
net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.4. The $4.4 billion reduction in 
net debt since 31 December 2015 was primarily driven by 
strong operating cash inflows of $5.8 billion, capital 
expenditure of $2.5 billion
(1)
 and cash proceeds from 
disposals, before tax, of $1.8 billion
(2)
.
BASE DIVIDEND
The commitment to a sustainable dividend remains a 
critical part of the overall capital allocation approach. 
Given the need to conserve cash and reduce debt, dividend 
payments remained suspended for 2016. The Board has 
recommended that, upon reinstatement, Anglo American 
should adopt a payout ratio in order to provide shareholders 
with exposure to improvements in commodity prices, while 
retaining cash flow flexibility during periods of weaker 
pricing. It is currently expected that dividend payments will 
be reinstated for the end of 2017 (payable in 2018).

PORTFOLIO UPGRADE
We remain focused on upgrading the portfolio, through 
improving asset quality, maintaining future optionality 
and seeking the appropriate geographic balance. 
During 2016, we received $1.8 billion
(1)
 from divestment 
transactions. The sale of the niobium and phosphates 
business in Brazil to China Molybdenum Co. Ltd ($1.5 billion) 
supported our balance sheet recovery goal, while we also 
continued to upgrade the portfolio through the divestment 
of a number of other assets: the Rustenburg platinum mines 
to Sibanye Gold; our 9.7% interest in Exxaro Resources;  
and our interests in the Callide and Foxleigh coal mines in 
Australia. The disposal of Dartbrook (Coal Australia) was 
agreed in 2015, and is expected to complete in the first half 
of 2017. The disposal of the remaining interests in Tarmac 
operations located in the Middle East was completed in 
2016. Twickenham (Platinum) was placed onto care and 
maintenance during the year. In February 2017, we agreed 
the sale of our 85% interest in the Union platinum mine in 
South Africa to Siyanda Resources. We will continue to 
refine the portfolio in this way, ensuring that capital is 
deployed to generate enhanced returns through the cycle.
FUTURE PROJECT OPTIONS
Strict value criteria are applied to the assessment  
of future options. Where appropriate, we will seek 
partners on major greenfield projects, and are likely  
to not commit to more than one major project at  
any given time. No major new project approvals  
are planned until dividend payments are resumed.  
The Group will continue to maintain optionality to  
progress with value-accretive projects, should  
market conditions and capital availability permit. 
We continue to retain and advance select studies, 
maintaining our established social commitments and 
managing the costs of maintaining these options 
appropriately. Our approach to studies and evaluation has  
a strong emphasis on assessing a broad range of options 
early on in the study phase, so that we can mitigate risk, 
identify opportunities and minimise sunk costs. This position 
is enhanced by the application of innovative concepts and 
new technologies stemming from our FutureSmart™ mining 
(FutureSmart™) programme in order to build and maintain a 
portfolio of high-value replacement and organic options.
Our 81.9% investment in the open-cut Quellaveco copper 
project in Peru remains one such key option for the Group, 
with feasibility costs of $0.1 billion spent in 2016. At the 
Gahcho Kué diamond mine in Canada, which accounted  
for capital expenditure of $0.2 billion in 2016, production  
has commenced and ramp-up is nearing completion.
Evaluation expenditure reduced to $105 million in 2016 
(2015: $145 million) and expenditure on exploration 
activities decreased by 31% to $107 million  
(2015: $154 million).

DEVELOP CORE  
BUSINESS PROCESSES
THE CONCENTRATED MINE 
One of the greatest challenges facing the mining industry today is how to develop and 
implement step-change innovations in order to drive improved productivity and cost 
performance, while minimising a mine’s total physical and environmental footprint. 
Concentrate the Mine™ is an integrated mining-systems approach pioneered by 
Anglo American. It integrates three enabling technologies:
 • Advanced mine-to-mill uses new blasting technologies to increase plant throughput 
and minimise processing costs
 • Coarse particle recovery (CPR) is designed to augment advanced mine-to-mill 
technologies to coarsen the grinding and to reduce energy and water consumption 
while maintaining, or potentially improving, recovery
 • Early-stage gangue rejection separates ore from waste before ore enters the 
crushing and grinding phase. By rejecting the worthless waste rock earlier in the 
process, we effectively increase the grade, while reducing processing costs as well 
as water and energy consumption.
The potential benefits of these Concentrate the Mine™ techniques and technologies 
are significant, with broad application across our copper, platinum and diamond 
businesses. Together, they have the potential to deliver a step-change increase in 
output, without incurring a similar increase in operating and capital costs, in tandem 
with the prospect of greatly reduced energy and water use.
The Concentrate the Mine™ concept is being developed at the Los Bronces copper 
mine in Chile. First-phase trials will be completed in the first half of 2017, and early 
indications are promising. For example, even with only part-implementation of 
advanced mine-to-mill technologies, we are already achieving a 7% increase in  
plant throughput and an 84% reduction in blast vibrations.
At Anglo American, our core business processes refer to the fundamentals of our work 
across our entire value chain – from exploration and discovery to delivering our products 
to our customers. With innovation and outstanding delivery at the forefront of how we 
deliver value, the business processes we are implementing are vital to the success of 
our core activities and achieving best practice across the Group.

24 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 We are starting to see tangible benefits from the 
roll-out of our Operating Model across our major 
assets; a more stable and predictable operating 
performance is leading to improved productivity  
and costs, fewer environmental incidents and a fuller 
understanding of our mine-to-market value chain. 
Working together with all our stakeholders, we are 
beginning to deliver on the full potential of our  
portfolio and enhance the sustainable value we  
can create for all our stakeholders. 
DELIVERING VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION
By accelerating the implementation of the Operating  
Model, we have made good progress at a number of our 
major assets, and we now have clear foundations in place  
for how we do our work. 
Operating excellence remains a focus for our technical 
function and we aim to continually improve our operating 
standards which, in turn, helps to boost cash generation.  
For example, at the Los Bronces molybdenum plant in Chile, 
metal recovery has increased by more than 10 percentage 
points. This performance reflected a range of technical 
improvements, including improved understanding of the 
mineralogy and orebody, and processing optimisation that 
builds on a solid knowledge of plant capacity, allowing 
stable, maximum feed through the plant.
It is essential that we continually focus on, and invest in, 
innovation and technology development if we are to  
find more productive, efficient and sustainable ways of 
extracting value from the minerals we mine and deliver  
to our customers. 
Traditional means of innovating are translating into new 
approaches that are more collaborative and inclusive. 
Anglo American’s FutureSmart™ approach to innovation 
includes bringing together stakeholders with different 
perspectives to reframe challenges, produce rough 
prototypes to quickly test ideas and co-create user-centred 
solutions that can be adopted faster. 
During 2015 and 2016, we convened FutureSmart™ Open 
Forums covering four major challenges – Sustainability, 
Processing, Mining, and Energy. We have also formulated  
a disciplined approach to innovation implementation which 
combines the exploration of long term possibilities with 
pragmatic implementation activities that realise short term 
value. Our unique innovation process, named ‘SmartPath’, 
allows us to move quickly from new ideas to new knowledge. 
It does so through a process of continuous assessment, with 
the aim of achieving relatively low cost, high reward capital 
expansions that can improve our position on the cost curve. 
This is essential in a prevailing environment of economic 
uncertainty, water scarcity and energy shortages, declining 
ore grades, and a productivity decline of around one-third in 
the mining industry over the past decade.
The most aspirational element of FutureSmart™ is our 
ambition to make dry tailings a normal operating practice. 
Water sent to tailings disposal often represents the largest 
water loss at a mine. Fine particle slurries are particularly 
difficult to dewater and current dry disposal options have 
prohibitive capital and operating costs. We are examining 
how we can reduce the cost of dewatering and are looking  
at the physical and chemical properties of the fine ore 
particles to understand why they cling so resolutely to  
water. If successful, we have the potential to significantly 
limit how much fresh water we draw, while also gaining 
access to orebodies in water-stressed areas that are  
critical to supplying the world’s ongoing demand for  
metals and minerals.
MARKETING PRODUCTS FOR FULL VALUE
During 2016, our Marketing business made good progress 
with marketing activities designed to create maximum  
value across the entire value chain – from mine to customer. 
These activities are designed to contribute value to the 
Group in a number of ways: improving EBIT ; enhancing  
cash flow through tighter working capital management; 
better risk- and control-management; and stimulating 
sustainable demand for PGMs through a structured market 
development programme.
Focusing on our principal strategic ‘levers’ to generate 
additional EBIT across the Group, we continue to deliver 
value through:
 • Marketing excellence: continuing to build direct customer 
relationships and obtain full value for our products. 
Through our dedicated sales and marketing hubs in 
Singapore and London, we continue to strengthen 
customer focus and build on our strong relationships. 
Throughout the year we sold all our equity volume 
available while managing supply challenges through 
proactive action such as the purchase of third party 
material. Close customer relationships have seen us 
explore and develop innovative propositions that have 
delivered shared benefits and additional value. Marketing 
excellence activities have continued to generate a large 
proportion of Marketing’s value for the Group. 
 • Value chain optimisation: integrated sales and operations 
planning (ISOP) capability to ensure we make the most  
of our mineral resource in light of market conditions; 
ensuring customers get the right products, at the right 
time; and leveraging our logistics capabilities and  
shipping services.
Our approach to planning and execution through our  
ISOP activities is now established across the majority of 
our commodities. This has realised specific benefits in 
higher throughput, lower logistics costs, and improved 
margins on qualities and quantities shipped. 
 25
Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE
DEVELOP CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES continued
During the year, several other value chain optimisation 
activities created additional earnings, including the further 
expansion of our shipping portfolio, with linked freight 
trades that yielded cost advantages and benefits relative to 
stand-alone routes. It was a year when we shipped record 
volumes across our bulk commodities on a CFR basis. 
 • Customer value proposition: through creating our own 
capability to access financial and third party physical 
markets, broadening the offer we make to customers. 
Thermal coal trading continues to perform well and  
we are therefore now active in related areas, including 
price-risk management in other commodity groups. 
Good progress has also been made with our PGMs market 
development activities. Short term demand drivers include 
the jewellery and investment sectors; while in the longer 
term, we are investing in new technologies that are expected 
to drive new sources of demand for PGMs – such as fuel cell 
electric vehicles.
All Marketing activities are executed in an increasingly 
sophisticated risk-management environment. Ensuring  
the risk factors which affect marketing – including price, 
credit, operational, and regulatory risks – are transparent 
and comprehensively managed remains a key priority, 
helping to maximise value for the Group.
Throughout the year, in addition to progress against our 
levers, we made good progress on a number of enabling 
projects to improve our effectiveness and efficiency, and 
more importantly, set us up for future growth. These 
included improving our sales operation processes and 
supporting our IT systems globally.
MANAGING OUR IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES  
AND THE ENVIRONMENT
As a responsible miner, our social and legal licences to 
operate stem largely from our ability to demonstrate 
compliance with permitting requirements, responsible 
environmental management and the equitable distribution 
of the economic value generated by our operations. Our  
aim is to have a net positive lasting impact on our host 
communities through forming mutually beneficial 
partnerships, as reflected in our vision: ‘partners in  
the future’. 
The principal environmental and social risks facing our 
business are associated with socio-economic development, 
water quality and security, climate change and extreme 
weather, and mine closure. We report extensively on our 
approach and performance related to these and other 
material sustainability issues in our Sustainability Report.

EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE 
INTERFACE BETWEEN PRODUCTION 
AND MARKETING
ISOP is a core element of Anglo American’s Operating 
Model that is now established across the majority of our 
commodities. ISOP is Marketing’s process for planning 
the movement of product from the mines’ finished-goods 
stockpiles to end-customer delivery. Through the ISOP 
process, marketing and mine production plans are 
reconciled to maximise the value of product delivery into 
the market within the constraint of our supply capacity.
ISOP provides a structured framework for planning, 
scheduling and execution from mine to market across 
two time horizons: an 18-month Sales & Operations 
(S&OP) planning horizon; and an eight-week Tactical 
Planning horizon. 
ISOP in action at Copper 
ISOP was introduced in Copper in January 201 6. The 
S&OP process allowed us to assess potential risks and 
opportunities beyond the two-month T actical Planning 
horizon. For example, the S&OP process typically aligns 
operation and maintenance plans between our mines, 
smelter and port. This year, when operations and 
maintenance plans at the Chagres smelter could not be 
aligned with Los Bronces’ and El Soldado’s, ISOP identified 
an opportunity to source third party concentrate, thereby 
optimising the smelter’s feed and financial performance.
The shorter Tactical Planning process has provided 
increased visibility of the production forecast which has, 
in turn, led to an improved shipping schedule, and a 37% 
reduction in demurrage costs.
ISOP in action at Thermal Coal 
ISOP was introduced in Thermal Coal operations in 2013. 
In early 2016, the market anticipated high demand for 
lower calorific value (CV) product by India. ISOP provided 
the agility to react to this trend and maximise the value 
presented by the recently negotiated extra rail capacity. 
Through integrating production, logistics and demand 
plans, ISOP enabled four South African coal mines to 
supply the Indian market with low CV coal at higher yields, 
realising significant additional value for our Coal business.
The Richards Bay Coal Terminal (23.2% interest held) achieved its best ever 
shipping performance in 2016, while export sales at Coal South Africa were the 
second highest ever recorded.
26 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
The past three years have shown a steady decline in the 
number of environmental incidents reported, indicating 
continued improvement in the management of 
environmental controls across operations. In both 2015  
and 2016, no Level 4 or Level 5 incidents (high impact)  
were reported. During 2016, four Level 3 (medium impact) 
environmental incidents were reported that resulted in no 
lasting harm to the environment (2015: six Level 3). 
Water
Water management is of great significance to our business 
activities, given that a large proportion of our current 
portfolio is located in regions with high levels of water risk. 
The water related challenges faced by our sites typically  
fall into three categories: water security; managing highly 
variable rainfall; and mitigating the impact of mining 
activities on water quality and the rights of other users. 
In line with International Council on Mining and Metals 
(ICMM) guidance, we have developed a new water 
management standard in partnership with our regional 
stakeholders, which has a more focused and structured 
approach to managing basin-wide water risks. We are 
working towards more ambitious water savings targets  
for 2020, which include reducing our absolute freshwater 
intake by 20% and recycling/re-using water for 75% of  
our water requirements.
Water security across the Group has improved, with eight 
sites reporting water shortages during 2016, down from  
1 1 sites in 2015. Continued drought conditions and water 
restrictions in South Africa and possible shortages in  
Minas Gerais State in Brazil, however, may increase water 
scarcity risk in the future. 
In South Africa, our Platinum business has started modelling 
water supply scenarios for the next 20 years for each of its 
water stressed operations, where there are rapidly growing 
demands for water to support agricultural, mining, industrial 
and domestic consumption. In Limpopo province, the 
business has developed a bulk-water strategy and 
infrastructure plan to safeguard long term water availability 
for its operations and surrounding communities. Since a 
high number of our assets are in southern Africa, we have 
developed a collaborative water strategy for the region, 
which will be launched in 2017. 
In Chile, our Los Bronces copper mine continues to  
mitigate water supply challenges by implementing technical 
solutions that promote water efficiency and water resilience. 
The site has reduced its water consumption by 20% from 
0.69 m
3
/tonne of ore to around 0.54 m
3
/tonne. During 2016, 
additional technical solutions were identified that could 
reduce operational water consumption further. 
Water saving projects saved the Group a further  
23 million m
3
 of water in 2016 (2015: 25 million m

). 
Anglo American’s total new-water consumption decreased 
by 14% from 222 million m
3
 in 2015 to 191 million m

 in 
2016. The decrease was primarily due to divestments and 
efficiency measures.

Climate change and energy
In April 2016, the Board supported a special resolution 
proposed by a group of shareholders that was then passed 
by shareholders at the AGM, in support of strategic climate 
resilience for 2035 and beyond. The resolution was 
prepared by the ‘Aiming for A’ coalition of institutional 
investors, and seeks a step change in companies’ disclosure 
to investors on how they measure and manage climate 
change risks and opportunities to their businesses. Further 
information on our response to the resolution is available in 
the Anglo American Sustainability Report. 
Our climate change strategy is designed to safeguard the 
business and host communities against climate change 
risks, and to contribute to mitigating global greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. We expect that climate change will affect 
our business in three principal ways: climate regulation and 
taxation will have a financial impact; demand for PGMs and 
copper – critical products in enabling alternative energy 
technologies – will increase, while demand for thermal coal 
will decrease over the long term; and the physical and social 
impacts of a changing climate may affect our operations and 
host communities. 
We anticipate a range of carbon pricing and offset/ 
incentive policies to emerge in all our operating 
geographies. Carbon pricing scenarios are factored into 
project investment decisions and climate change risk  
and adaptation assessments have been conducted at 
vulnerable operations.
Progress on operational energy and carbon performance  
is driven through our energy- and carbon-management 
programme, ECO
2
MAN. In 2015, the Group set new 
reduction targets for 2020, including: 8% for energy and 
22% for GHG emissions, with 2015 set as the base year. 
These were agreed in the context of capital constraints and 
market complexities and uncertainties, and are subject to 
divestments and significant business changes.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE
DEVELOP CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES continued
In 2016, our ECO
2
MAN energy- and GHG-reduction 
programme prevented 4.5 million tonnes of CO
2
-equivalent 
(MtCO
2
e) emissions from entering the atmosphere. By year 
end, a total of 320 ECO
2
MAN and business improvement 
projects had accounted for estimated energy savings of 
5.8 million GJ, representing energy cost savings of 
approximately $90 million. Performance is driven through 
the implementation of discrete projects that reduce energy 
and emissions intensity at the operations concerned. 
In 2016, Anglo American operations were responsible for  
17.8 Mt CO
2
e (2015: 18.3 Mt CO
2
e). The Group’s total 
energy consumption was 105 million GJ (2015: 106 million 
GJ). Total energy used decreased slightly (1%), while GHG 
emissions fell by 3% when compared with 2015. A large 
increase in energy consumption at Barro Alto in Brazil 
following the furnaces’ rebuild (around 7 million GJ) was 
offset by lower consumption across most other businesses 
owing to divestments, efficiency measures and operational 
changes. The reduction in GHG emissions was a result  
of divestments, lower electricity emissions factors in  
Brazil and South Africa, and GHG mitigation projects.
Tailings storage facilities
Tailings storage facilities are classified as one of our  
top 10 major risks and are subject to a rigorous risk 
management programme.
In February 2014, we began implementing a new mineral 
residue management technical standard, to be fully 
implemented by the end of 2017, for tailings and water 
retaining dams. Most businesses are phasing in the new 
standard and its requirements ahead of schedule.
During 2016, we completed a comprehensive inventory  
of, and updated risk tables for, all the containment facilities  
in Anglo American (90 tailings storage facilities and  
213 water containment structures). Critical controls at 
facilities are audited internally on a rotational basis and each 
of the businesses is addressing identified priority issues. 
External technical review panels are being established for 
our mineral residue facilities to undertake independent 
reviews, and are already in place at several of our operations.
PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE
As a major mining company, with the great majority of our 
operations in developing markets, we are committed to 
supporting our host governments to achieve social 
development goals. We endeavour to design and execute 
our projects according to the highest social standards, and 
to ensure our presence in host countries leaves a positive 
lasting legacy. 
Our drive to manage social impacts and enhance positive 
benefits to communities is influenced significantly by 
growing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as  
by evolving societal and stakeholder expectations. This  
has highlighted the growing strategic significance of 
environmental, social and governance issues, and 
emphasised the important business benefits in building 
trusted and constructive relationships across stakeholder 
groups. This is essential to effectively manage social risks, 
maintain and strengthen our socio-political licence to 
operate, and support business milestones to achieve our 
vision of becoming ‘partners in the future’. 
Managing our social impacts
Inclusive stakeholder engagement underpins our approach 
to respecting human rights and to responding to legitimate 
stakeholder aspirations and concerns. 
Our Social Way defines Anglo American’s governing 
framework for social performance. It provides clear 
requirements for all Anglo American-managed sites to 
ensure that policies and systems are in place to engage  
with affected communities; to avoid, prevent and mitigate 
adverse social impacts; and to optimise development 
opportunities. Each site is assessed annually against the 
Social Way requirements and is required to implement  
an improvement plan for requirements that are not met  
in full; progress is monitored at executive level on a  
quarterly basis.

28 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Our industry-leading Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox 
(SEAT) is used to improve operations’ understanding of 
their positive and negative socio-economic effects,  
enhance stakeholder dialogue and the management of 
social issues, build our ability to support local socio-
economic development, and foster greater transparency 
and accountability. 
Through our responsible sourcing programme, we aim to 
ensure that the goods and services we procure do not cause 
harm to individuals or the natural environment. 
Social instability leading to community unrest remains a 
particular challenge in South Africa, and particularly for  
our operations in Limpopo province. To address this, we 
continue to seek to engage and work collaboratively with 
employees, trade unions and the South African government, 
and with communities around our mines. We have placed a 
particular strategic focus on mitigating social conflict and 
promoting socio-economic development across Limpopo.
Optimising the benefits of mining
Our strategic focus is on improving the productivity of local 
markets and public institutions to support sustainable job 
creation and effective public service delivery. Our integrated 
approach is concentrated on promoting local and 
preferential procurement, enterprise development and 
workforce development, working with local institutions to 
strengthen their capacity, maximise the socio-economic 
benefits from our own infrastructure, and deliver social 
investment that supports those most in need.
This approach is most advanced at our South American 
operations, where we believe that our leading socio-
economic development initiatives are a driver of competitive 
advantage. This is recognised in the $2 million of grant 
funding secured from the Inter-American Development 
Bank to expand our integrated enterprise and supplier 
development programmes in the region.
Our focus on leveraging our core business activities and 
skills in collaboration with expert partners, enables us to 
have a significantly greater positive impact on host 
communities at a much lower cost than conventional  
social investment-led approaches. 
In 2016, 23% ($2.0 billion) of supplier expenditure was  
with host communities (2015: $1.8 billion, 17%), while our 
enterprise development programmes in Botswana, Brazil, 
Chile, South Africa and Peru supported 62,447 businesses 
and created/sustained 1 16,298 jobs. 
In 2016, Anglo American’s corporate social investment  
(CSI) expenditure in local communities, including by the 
Anglo American Chairman’s Fund and Zimele, totalled  
$84.1 million (2015: $124.1 million). This figure represents 
2.5% of underlying EBIT, less underlying EBIT of associates 
and joint ventures. 
Responsible mine closure and divestment
We design, plan and operate our mines with closure in  
mind, and plan for ‘post-closure’ long term sustainability in 
consultation with communities and other stakeholders. In 
doing so, we aim to reduce long term risks and liabilities to 
our business from an environmental and socio-economic 
perspective, and to ensure that we leave a positive legacy 
when our mines conclude their operational lives.
Our Mine Closure Toolbox provides a structured approach 
to closure planning and management. It is aimed at ensuring 
that the full spectrum of opportunities, risks and liabilities is 
effectively identified, that plans are fully costed, and that 
financial provision is made for premature closure. 
When operations are divested or placed onto care and 
maintenance (C&M) there are impacts on employees, 
communities and the environment. Our aim is to divest 
businesses responsibly by ensuring that new owners are 
credible and ethical, that liabilities are fully transparent,  
and that our legal and other social and environmental 
commitments are honoured. Efforts around mitigating  
the effects of C&M focus on stakeholder engagement, 
mitigating job losses and wider social impacts, and ongoing 
environmental care and monitoring.

Anglo American’s Centre for Experiential Learning in Johannesburg offers a unique adult-learning business environment 
designed to drive business improvement throughout the Group.
CENTRE FOR EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
Anglo American’s Centre for Experiential Learning (CEL) is a state of the art facility  
in Johannesburg, focused on embedding business improvement across the Group. 
The CEL delivers programmes comprised of business improvement processes,  
tools and techniques that aim to achieve stable and capable processes that reduce 
variability and waste; and in coaching and facilitation skills to improve project 
execution. The courses are designed to support the roll-out of Anglo American’s 
Operating Model and are aligned with technical and safety training initiatives to 
improve efficiency and effectiveness of individual and team development. 
Both areas of work play a vital role in the delivery of Anglo American’s strategy, 
helping to develop core business processes and deliver a high performance culture. 
Learning is achieved through experiential activities related to the particular 
improvement initiative the delegate is working on. Participants are expected to reflect 
on the activity, develop a theory and then conduct experiments to test the theory’s 
validity before attempting to initiate a solution, i.e. doing, reflecting, investigating, 
validating and then practising to enhance performance, with the assistance of an 
experienced business improvement coach. This approach provides employees with 
tangible skills and outcomes which can be effectively applied to real work processes 
and individual and team development.
In 2016, the CEL continued to support the Group in the delivery of its strategy and 
development of our people. In total, business improvement training – including 
inter-personal skills and Operating Model training – was conducted with more than 
1,500 employees. These employees attended more than 90 events, representing 
teams from across the business – in both functional and operational areas – totalling 
more than 3,000 training days. 
The focus for the CEL in 201 7 will be to continue to support the roll-out of the Operating 
Model and collaborate with sites on leading business improvement practices.

30 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 As Anglo American’s portfolio evolves, we continue  
to create a leaner and more effective business that is 
built around strong, product-focused operating units,  
supported by functions that provide value-adding 
expert leadership, improve business performance  
and ensure effective governance. 
ORGANISATION DESIGN THAT ENHANCES 
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
During 2016, we continued the review of our organisation  
to structure work more effectively, establish clear 
accountabilities and authorities, and remove role 
duplication. The review has taken place in line with the 
principles of the Operating Model, which has been rolled  
out at nine of our operations. As we implement the 
Operating Model, we are adapting our operational 
structures in order to derive maximum benefit from its 
design. We are also reshaping our corporate functions to 
maximise the value of the relationships that exist between 
functions and operations, while reducing costs. 
The resultant design, known as the Functional Model, 
intends functions to become more cohesive, for their work 
to become more integrated and for functions to have a 
higher level of accountability for business outcomes. 
In practice, this means that, rather than having support  
staff based within, and supporting, individual business  
units or operations, each function is accountable for 
providing the Group with the most effective support  
and delivering it in the most cost-effective manner.
This new Functional Model is delivering benefits through  
our ability to: 
 • better promote the sharing of resources and the 
dissemination of best practice 
 • bring consistency and the highest level of functional 
expertise to all business units and their operations
 • support the development and retention of highly capable 
people by creating career paths and opportunities that go 
beyond the boundaries of a single site or business unit. 
While the primary focus has been on designing our functions 
to maximise the value they can provide, the streamlining of 
the Group’s portfolio has also required the size of corporate 
structures and overheads to be reviewed to ensure they 
remain fit for purpose. 
At year end, Anglo American’s total headcount was 95,000, 
a reduction of 32,500 people from 2015. This was largely 
driven by the divestment of the Rustenburg platinum 
operations, the niobium and phosphates business, 
De Beers’ Kimberley Mines and the Foxleigh and Callide 
coal assets in Australia, in addition to staff reductions across 
the entire portfolio. The number of people working in 
indirect roles (that is, not directly involved in production) 
across the Group reduced from 1 1,500 to 8,700, as our 
support functions were rightsized in line with asset 
divestments. We will continue to review the size of our 
support structures as the portfolio evolves over time.
MANAGING TALENT AND DEVELOPING SKILLS
Building capability
Equipping Anglo American with an engaged and productive 
workforce is essential for our success. In assessing 
capability, we consider technical skills and knowledge that 
have been acquired through experience and practice; mental 
processing ability; social process skills; and application  
(the degree of drive and commitment a person displays). 
We continue to invest in developing a pipeline of future 
talent. As part of that process, we provide development  
and training opportunities to our managers and workforce, 
which are vital in encouraging our people to grow in their 
work. We have a range of external and internal development 
programmes in use across the Group, investing more  
than $73 million on training in 2016. In an increasingly 
competitive market for skills, we continue to invest in 
developing a pipeline of future talent through our support  
of 2,700 graduates, bursars, apprentices and trainees.
Anglo American has numerous initiatives focused on 
supporting education and development, from schools 
through to tertiary institutions, as well as programmes 
targeted at building skill and leadership capability. In 
South Africa, the 2016 South African Graduate Employers 
Association (SAGEA) survey recognised Anglo American as 
the Employer of Choice in the South African Mining Sector 
for the fifth consecutive year. 
Diversity
Anglo American embraces diversity. We seek a workforce 
that represents the regions within which we operate and we 
provide opportunities for broader development within those 
regions. A diverse workforce brings greater diversity of 
thought to tackle the challenges we face. We continually 
develop our workforce so that we will have this diversity 
among our leaders of the future. By year end, women made 
up 18% of our overall workforce (2015: 18%) and 25% of 
managers (2015: 25%). 
In our South African operations, we continue to promote 
transformation. By year end, 62% of our management 
comprised historically disadvantaged South Africans  
(2015: 60%).
Encouraging sound industrial relations
Approximately 75% of our current permanent workforce  
is represented by works councils, trade unions or other  
similar bodies, and covered by collective bargaining 
agreements. We continue to seek to improve relations with 
our employees and their representative bodies, and have 
consulted widely with unions throughout our restructuring 
process. In total, in 2016, there were four instances of 
industrial action lasting longer than a week.

DELIVER A HIGH PERFORMANCE CULTURE continued
Supporting labour rights
As expressed in our Human Rights Policy, and as  
signatories to the United Nations Global Compact, we  
are committed to the labour rights principles set out in  
the International Labour Organization core conventions, 
including the right to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, the eradication of child and forced labour  
and non-discrimination. Observance of these rights is  
required of all our operations, irrespective of location,  
as well as for suppliers. 
REWARD STRUCTURES WHICH  
DIFFERENTIATE PERFORMANCE
A high performance organisation hinges on strong 
leadership from line managers and a culture centred  
on rewarding successful business outcomes. It is critical  
that we provide appropriate remuneration to attract,  
retain and motivate the right calibre of employee,  
wherever we operate. 
We implement a performance management and 
remuneration framework that is designed to reward our 
people on the basis of their performance, giving equal 
emphasis to delivery and behaviour through short term 
incentives. Our structured performance management  
and appraisal process is geared to support a values-driven, 
high performance culture.
Senior leaders within the organisation are incentivised  
with longer term awards which are provided upon meeting 
predetermined objectives that are in line with those of 
shareholders. 
In total, 15% of employees receive formal performance  
and development reviews. 
Code of conduct
In 2016, Anglo American launched a new Code of Conduct, 
which encapsulates what we stand for as a company. While 
we focus on building a results-focused culture (the ‘what’), 
we will not be compromised on our values in doing this (the 
‘how’). The Code of Conduct explains the boundaries within 
which we must work every day and brings together in one 
place our material ethical principles and policies. It has at  
its core our shared values, which describe how we must 
behave consistently to continue to earn the trust that gives 
us our licence to operate. 
EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH
Protecting the safety and health of employees and 
contractors at work is one of the most fundamental  
human rights issues facing Anglo American and other 
mining companies. While protecting our workforce from 
harm is a moral imperative for us, our focus on ‘zero harm’ 
also constitutes a direct investment in the productivity of  
the business. A safe and healthy workforce contributes to  
an engaged, motivated and productive workforce that 
prevents operational stoppages, and reduces potential  
legal liabilities.
Ensuring a safe working environment
The safety, health and well-being of our employees are a  
top priority and a core value at Anglo American. We strive to 
achieve our goal of zero harm by managing our activities in  
a way that eliminates incidents, minimises risk and promotes 
excellence in the performance of our operations. 
The Group’s safety performance is at the front end of the 
agenda at every Board meeting. Safety performance 
measures form part of the incentive-based remuneration  
for all senior executives.
In 2016, we regret to report that 1 1 employees and 
contractors lost their lives in work-related activities at 
operations managed by Anglo American. Seven of the 
fatalities were at our Platinum operations in South Africa.  
Eleven fatalities represents a very disappointing increase 
compared with the six lives lost in 2015. 
Any loss of life is unacceptable and we remain unwavering  
in our commitment to achieving our vision of zero harm. 
Throughout 2016, we strengthened our control 
improvement programme by placing an emphasis on the 
effective management and use of critical controls. The 
programme is supported by the work management 
elements of our Operating Model. This work will continue 
during 2017, with the aim of achieving a consistent approach 
and standard across all our sites. 
Our ongoing focus on ensuring safety in the workplace  
was positively reflected by a 24% decrease in our total 
recordable case frequency rate, compared with 2015. While 
there was a decrease in the number of regulatory stoppages 
at Platinum, the extent of those was wider and resulted in an 
increase in production losses. 
For each incident resulting in loss of life or a critical injury, an 
independent investigation is conducted to understand the 
causes and remedial actions required. The lessons learnt 
from each are shared via our Group Learning from Incidents 
process and discussed at Board Sustainability Committee, 
executive and site management levels. Particular emphasis 
is placed on ensuring that actions relating to critical controls 
are implemented in a timely manner to prevent repeats.
Our operations continue to increase and improve reporting 
of, and learning from, high potential incidents (HPIs) as a 
preventative tool to improve safety performance. This has 
now been extended to include high potential hazards, as  
this allows gaps or control failures to be identified, and 
addressed, before an incident occurs. Transportation, falls  
of ground, moving machinery and isolation/lock-out remain 
the main areas where HPIs occur. 
Our safety strategy and management approach is risk-
based and concentrates on integrating safe working 
practices into every aspect of what we do. It is founded on 
three key principles: a mindset of zero harm; no repeats;  
and the application of simple, non-negotiable standards. 
During 2016, we added further impetus to critical control 
management and strengthening Visible Felt Leadership 
across the Group. These will remain priorities in 2017 and 
will be supported by additional programmes to further 
strengthen leadership and accountability for safety at  
every level. 
32 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Promoting health and well-being
Effective management of health risks protects our people, 
enhances productivity and is essential in minimising 
potential long term liabilities, as well as being critical in 
maintaining our licence to operate. Extending our health 
promotion activities to the broader community also  
supports our internal health drive in line with our values  
of care and respect
In 2016, the number of employees reported to be working  
in environments with noise levels in excess of the eight-hour 
exposure limit of 85 dB(A) reduced considerably to 26,280 
(2015: 40,869) following the divestment of Platinum’s 
Rustenburg mines. The number of employees reported to 
be working in environments where they were potentially at 
risk of exposure to inhalable hazards at levels in excess of 
the relevant occupational exposure limits also decreased to 
3,705 (2015: 5,225).
While we have intensive programmes in place to ensure that 
employees and contractors working in such environments 
are trained to use personal protective equipment, our focus 
is on addressing the source of occupational health risk. 
Our overall approach to occupational hygiene is aligned with 
the Anglo American Operational Risk Management (ORM) 
process, which requires that operations identify health risks, 
implement controls to mitigate those risks, monitor the 
effectiveness of controls, and learn from incidents in order 
to prevent repeats. We continue to focus on rolling out our 
health-critical control management process to facilitate 
proactive engineering and operational control solutions. 
Targets for the implementation of the ORM influence the 
performance-based remuneration of senior executives.
In 2016, the number of reported health incidents, which 
signify failing controls of health-hazard management 
systems, decreased significantly across all levels,  
indicating good progress in health-hazard prevention  
and control measures. 
The number of new cases of occupational disease  
reported was 1 1 1 (2015: 163). The reduction in absolute 
numbers was largely a result of continuing progress  
towards eliminating noise-induced hearing loss.
Anglo American has recorded no cases of silicosis owing  
to exposure at our operations since 201 1. However, despite 
the significant year-on-year decrease last year, we continue 
to report cases of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis. Such 
cases are thoroughly investigated to better understand  
their causes, including the past and current occupational 
exposure profiles of those who become ill, as well as the 
potential sources of coal dust in the workplace. Our Coal 
business has set an objective with respect to exposure  
to coal dust of zero instances exceeding the permitted 
occupational exposure limit, and is introducing a number  
of initiatives in the year to help achieve this objective. 
Through the industry work group that was formed by 
Anglo American and other South African mining peers, we 
continue to address issues relating to compensation and 
medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold 
mining industry in South Africa.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW
Operating profit of $1.7 billion increased  
by $5.8 billion (2015: $4. 1 billion loss)  
while underlying EBITDA increased by  
25% to $6. 1 billion.
productivity improvement initiatives. Excluding the impact  
of divestments, Australian coal production decreased by  
4% following cessation of production at Drayton. 
In total, four projects commenced or continued to ramp-up, 
or reached nameplate capacity during 2016. Iron ore 
production from Minas-Rio increased by 76% as the 
ramp-up progressed, while Grosvenor produced its first 
longwall metallurgical coal in May, seven months ahead of 
schedule, and entered commercial production during the 
third quarter. Gahcho Kué, a diamond project in Canada,  
was commissioned in August, and at Barro Alto in Brazil,  
the furnace rebuild was completed. Production at Barro Alto 
is now close to nameplate capacity, with nickel output 
increasing by 47% year-on-year. 
The Group achieved a favourable cost performance in  
2016, primarily as a consequence of cost-reduction initiatives 
and the benefits of weaker producer country currencies. Unit 
cash costs at De Beers decreased by 19% as a result of cost 
savings, favourable exchange rate movements and a change 
in production mix following portfolio changes. Unit costs  
at Coal Australia decreased by 7%, following significant 
cost-reduction initiatives, particularly in the open cut 
operations, while on-mine local currency unit costs at Coal 
South Africa decreased by 2%, reflecting the benefit of 
increased production at the export mines, driven by 
productivity improvements across all operations. At Copper, 
unit costs decreased by 1 1%, reflecting cost-reduction 
initiatives and benefits resulting from the divestment of  
Anglo American Norte; these more than compensated for 
the effects of lower output. FOB cash costs at Kumba were 
13% lower. This was attributable to savings in operating 
costs, mainly from the reduced mining profile at Sishen mine 
following restructuring, as well as productivity gains in mining 
and processing operations, and the benefit of the weaker  
South African rand. At Platinum, unit costs also decreased  
by 12%, owing mainly to a weaker South African rand  
and cost containment. Nickel unit costs declined by 19%,  
chiefly attributable to increased production volumes from 
Barro Alto, as well as favourable exchange rates and lower 
energy and consumable costs.
Anglo American reported a profit for the financial year 
attributable to equity shareholders of $1.6 billion (2015: 
$5.6 billion loss) with underlying earnings of $2.2 billion 
(2015: $0.8 billion). Net debt decreased by $4.4 billion 
to $8.5 billion (2015: $12.9 billion). During 2016, the 
company did not pay a dividend (2015: $0.32 per share). 
Although average prices decreased by 3%, realised prices 
were comparable with 2015. Metallurgical coal and Kumba’s 
iron ore prices increased by 24% and 21%, respectively, but 
were offset by a 10% decrease in the average realised rough 
diamond price and an 8% decrease in the platinum US dollar 
basket price. Weaker producer country currencies favourably 
contributed to earnings ($0.7 billion impact), driven 
principally by a 15% weakening of the South African rand 
against the dollar. 
Higher sales volumes at De Beers, following a weaker 2015, 
materially benefited underlying EBITDA, as did the ramp-up 
at Grosvenor following the start of commercial production 
during the third quarter, and a strong plant performance  
at Collahuasi. This was partially offset by expected lower 
volumes at Kumba Iron Ore following the pit reconfiguration 
at Sishen, and lower volumes at Los Bronces owing to 
expected lower grades and the adverse weather conditions 
during the year. 
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE 
Overall, operational performance was maintained  
across the business. Total platinum production (metal  
in concentrate) was 2% higher, driven by a continued  
strong performance at Mogalakwena and Amandelbult  
in South Africa and at Unki in Zimbabwe. Rough diamond 
production decreased by 5%, reflecting the decision taken  
in 2015 to reduce production in response to prevailing 
trading conditions. In South Africa, iron ore production at 
Sishen decreased by 10%, in line with the mine’s lower-cost 
pit configuration. Production was affected by restructuring, 
as well as a higher number of rainfall and safety stoppages. 
Production in the second half showed considerable 
improvement as the benefits attributable to improved mining 
productivity, as well as access to low strip ratio ore and  
higher plant yields, started to be realised. In Chile, copper 
production at Los Bronces was 24% lower as the operation 
faced a number of challenges, driven by significantly lower 
expected grades, adverse weather conditions and illegal 
industrial action by contractor unions. In contrast, both 
Collahuasi and El Soldado had strong performances,  
with attributable production increasing by 1 1% and 31%, 
respectively, as a consequence of operational improvements 
and higher grades. Total production from Coal South Africa’s 
Export mines increased by 9% as a result of various

were $209 million (2015: $458 million). The decrease  
was driven by a net foreign exchange gain on cash and 
borrowings of $84 million (2015: $180 million loss) 
principally due to a strengthening in the Brazilian real  
and South African rand during the year.
For further details on net finance costs, see note 7 to the 
Consolidated financial statements on page 130. 
Tax 
The underlying effective tax rate
◊
 was 24.6% (2015: 31.0%).  
The decreased rate in 2016 was due to a benefit received  
in relation to the reassessment of withholding tax provisions, 
including in respect of Chile (4.7%), and the utilisation of 
losses and similar tax attributes not previously recognised, 
primarily in Australia (3.9%), partially offset by the impact of 
enhanced tax depreciation, primarily in Chile (2.5%), and 
other items, including prior year adjustments (0.7%). For 
further details on the effective tax rate, see note 8 to the 
Consolidated financial statements on page 131. 
The tax charge for the year, before special items and 
remeasurements, was $742 million (2015: $435 million).
Special items and remeasurements
Special items and remeasurements include impairment 
charges of $1.5 billion relating to Coal and Copper, gains  
on the disposals of Callide ($0.6 billion) and the niobium  
and phosphates business ($0.5 billion), and a provision in 
respect of a tax matter in Kumba ($0.1 billion). Full details  
of the special items and remeasurements recorded in the 
year are included in note 6 to the Consolidated financial 
statements on pages 128- 129.
ROCE
◊
ROCE increased to 1 1% in 2016 (2015: 5%), primarily as  
a consequence of higher sales volumes at De Beers, the 
ramp-up of production at Grosvenor mine in Australia and 
ongoing delivery of cost savings across the portfolio. The 
Group also benefited from weaker producer country 
currencies. Average attributable capital employed was lower 
at $27.4 billion (2015: $32.6 billion) owing to ongoing asset 
depreciation and a number of asset divestments completed 
in the year, and selected asset impairments taken in the  
first half of 2016. This was partially offset by ongoing  
capital expenditure.
ROCE is the primary return measure used in the Group and  
is a significant Alternative Performance Measure (APM) 
used across the business. A full description of the measure 
is available on page 189 of this Annual Report.
38 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 BALANCE SHEET
Net assets of the Group increased by $3.0 billion to  
$24.3 billion (2015: $21.3 billion). This reflected the 
reduction in net debt and foreign exchange gains relating  
to operations with Australian dollar and South African rand 
functional currencies. These factors were partially offset  
by the impairment of Coal and Copper operations and the 
impact of disposals. Capital expenditure
◊
 of $2.4 billion  
was largely offset by depreciation. 
NET DEBT
Net debt (including related hedges) of $8.5 billion was  
$4.4 billion lower than at 31 December 2015, representing 
gearing of 25.9% (2015: 37.7%). Net debt is made up of 
cash and cash equivalents of $6.0 billion (2015: $6.9 billion) 
and gross debt, including related derivatives, of $14.5 billion 
(2015: $19.8 billion). The reduction in net debt was driven  
by strong operating cash inflows, a decrease in capital 
expenditure and proceeds from disposals.
Anglo American received gross proceeds from disposals  
of $1.8 billion
(1)
 (2015: $1.7 billion), primarily from the sale  
of the niobium and phosphates business, which contributed 
$1.5 billion, and the sale of its 9.7% stake in Exxaro 
Resources, contributing $0.2 billion. The post-tax proceeds 
on disposals was $1.6 billion (2015: $1.7 billion).
CASH FLOW
Cash flows from operations
Cash flows from operations increased by $1.6 billion to  
$5.8 billion (2015: $4.2 billion). The 25% increase in 
underlying EBITDA was supported by a focus on cost 
savings, an increase in sales volumes at De Beers, and 
weakening foreign exchange rates. Cash inflows on 
operating working capital were $0.4 billion (2015: inflows  
of $25 million), primarily reflecting a reduction in inventories 
at De Beers of $0.3 billion and an increase in operating 
payables at Platinum of $0.4 billion, half of which relates  
to a key customer advancing pre-payment for future 
guaranteed delivery of metal, with the remainder due to an 
increase in purchase of concentrate following the sale of 
Rustenburg. These inflows were offset by an increase in 
operating receivables of $0.4 billion, driven by higher prices 
in Coal and Iron Ore and Manganese.
Attributable free cash flow
Attributable free cash flow increased by $3.5 billion to an 
inflow of $2.6 billion (2015: outflow of $1.0 billion). The 
improvement was driven by an increase in cash flows from 
operations of $1.6 billion and a $1.8 billion reduction in 
capital expenditure to $2.4 billion (2015: $4.2 billion). 
The reduction in capital expenditure was driven by a 50% 
decline in expansionary capital expenditure, chiefly as a 
result of the ramp-up of the Minas-Rio iron ore operation  
in Brazil and the Grosvenor metallurgical coal operation  
in Australia, and a 25% decrease in stay-in-business 
expenditure as a result of lower expenditure at Kumba Iron 
Ore, De Beers and Coal. A full reconciliation is shown in note 
22 to the Consolidated financial statements on page 142.  
For more detail on our capital expenditure programme,  
see pages 22-23.
LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING
At 31 December 2016, the Group had undrawn committed 
bank facilities of $9.7 billion and cash of $6.0 billion. The 
Group’s liquidity position was maintained in the year, while 
gross debt, including related derivatives, decreased  
by $5.3 billion to $14.5 billion (2015: $19.8 billion) primarily 
owing to a $1.8 billion bond buyback transaction, the full 
repayment of BNDES loans in Brazil ($1.7 billion, including 
related derivatives) and $1.4 billion of bond maturities. In 
January 2017, the Group retired the $1.05 billion Club facility 
which was entered into in 2016 in the context of the bond 
buyback transaction. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading 
performance, indicate the Group’s ability to operate within 
the level of its current facilities. The Group has certain 
financial covenants in place in relation to external debt which 
are not expected to be breached in the foreseeable future.
(1) 
Proceeds from 
disposals of  
$1.8 billion were 
received in 2016.  
Total nominal cash 
inflows are expected 
to reach $2.0 billion 
over time, subject  
to prices.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY
MANAGING RISK 
EFFECTIVELY
Anglo American recognises that risk is inherent 
in all its business activities. Our risks can have a 
financial, operational or reputational impact. The 
volatility in commodity markets over the past few 
years provides a good illustration of risk inherent 
in our business. As understanding our risks and 
developing appropriate responses are critical  
to our future success, we are committed to an 
effective, robust system of risk identification,  
and an effective response to such risks, in order 
to support the achievement of our objectives.
HOW DOES RISK RELATE TO OUR  
STRATEGIC ELEMENTS?
Risks can arise from events outside of our control or  
from operational matters. Each of the risks described 
on the following pages can have an impact on our  
ability to achieve our strategic elements:
 • Where we compete: optimising and streamlining  
our portfolio
 • How we win: maximising our performance
 • Critical core skills: creating a capable organisation.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
Context
An understanding of our business model and strategy is  
key to assessment of our prospects. Our ambition is to 
create a resilient business that delivers robust profitability 
and sustainable, positive cash flows through the cycle. 
Details of our business model are provided on pages 9- 1 1.
While the mining industry has seen some recovery from  
the sharp decreases in commodity prices in 2015 and  
early 2016, current geopolitical and macro-economic 
uncertainties are expected to cause continued commodity 
price volatility. Such volatility is further exacerbated in a 
commodity pricing environment that is now almost entirely 
spot priced, compared to the quarterly and longer term 
contract pricing mechanisms that used to be the norm,  
and with the accompanying very significant non-physical 
trading activity. Against that background, the Board has  
low appetite for risk in major new projects and investments 
unless they are world class orebodies with competitive  
cost positions and long reserve lives. New greenfield 
projects are likely to be syndicated with other investors  
to reduce our risk profile and capital requirements. 
The assessment process and key assumptions
Assessment of the Group’s prospects is based upon  
the Group’s strategy, its financial plan and principal risks.  
The Group’s strategy during 2016 has focused on  
improving cash flow generation and executing selective 
asset disposals to strengthen the balance sheet and  
focus our portfolio to create sustainable value.
Byron 
Grote 
Chairman, 
Audit 
Committee
1. Identifying risks 
A robust methodology is used to identify key risks across the 
Group; at business units, operations and projects. This is being 
applied consistently through the development and ongoing 
implementation of a Group integrated risk management 
framework and associated guidelines.
2. Analysing risks and controls to manage  
identified risks 
Once identified, the process will evaluate identified risks to 
establish root causes, financial and non-financial impacts, and 
likelihood of occurrence. Consideration of risk treatments is  
taken into account to enable the creation of a prioritised register 
and in determining which of the risks should be considered as a  
principal risk.
3. Determining management actions required
The effectiveness and adequacy of controls are assessed.  
If additional controls are required, these will be identified  
and responsibilities assigned.
4. Reporting and monitoring
Management is responsible for monitoring progress of actions  
to mitigate key risks and to determine if any such risk falls outside 
the limits of our risk appetite. Management is supported through 
the Group’ s internal audit programme, which evaluates the  
design and effectiveness of controls. The risk management  
process is continuous; key risks are reported to the Audit 
Committee, with sustainability risks also being reported to the 
Sustainability Committee.

40 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 A financial forecast covering the next three years is prepared 
based on the context of the strategic plan and is reviewed on 
a regular basis to reflect changes in circumstances. The 
financial forecast is based on a number of key assumptions, 
the most important of which include commodity prices and 
foreign exchange rates.
The principal risks are those that we believe could prevent the 
Group from delivering its strategic objectives. A number of 
these risks are deemed catastrophic to the Group’s prospects 
and have been considered as part of the Group’s viability.
Assessment of viability 
The assessment of the Group’s prospects have been made 
with reference to the Group’s current position and expected 
performance over a three year period, using budgeted 
commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Financial 
performance and cash flows have then been subjected to 
stress and sensitivity analysis over the three year period 
using a range of severe but plausible scenarios. The 
scenarios tested include:
 • Commodity price reductions of 10% from budget prices 
over three years with no offsetting foreign exchange  
rate improvement
 • Operational incidents that have a significant impact  
on production at key sites in the Group
 • Technology developments impacting demand  
for diamonds 
 • Our ability to supply products due to infrastructure 
constraints
 • Failure to achieve budgeted level of financial performance 
due to cost inflation and interest expense increases. 
Viability statement
The directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for the next three years. This  
period has been selected for the following reasons:
 • The Group’s strategy and budgeting process is aligned 
with a three-year view
 • The volatility in commodity markets in recent years  
makes confidence in a longer assessment of prospects 
highly challenging
 • The Group will be managing the reduction of net debt  
over this period.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
We define a principal risk as a risk or combination of  
risks that would threaten the business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity of Anglo American.  
In addition to these principal risks, we continue to be 
exposed to other risks related to currency, inflation, 
information and cyber security, community relations, 
environment, infrastructure and human resources. These 
risks are subject to our normal procedures to identify, 
implement and oversee appropriate mitigation actions.
Principal risks 1-8 on pages 42-44
CATASTROPHIC RISKS
We also face certain risks that we deem catastrophic risks. 
These are very high severity, very low likelihood events that 
could result in multiple fatalities or injuries, an unplanned 
fundamental change to strategy or the way we operate, and 
have significant financial consequences. We do not consider 
likelihood when assessing these risks as the potential 
impacts mean these risks must be treated as a priority. 
Catastrophic risks are included as principal risks.
Catastrophic risks 9-12 on pages 44-45
RISK APPETITE
We define risk appetite as ‘the nature and extent of risk 
Anglo American is willing to accept in relation to the pursuit 
of its objectives’. We look at risk appetite from the context of 
severity of the consequences should the risk materialise, 
any relevant internal or external factors influencing the risk, 
and the status of management actions to mitigate the risk.  
A scale is used to help determine the limit of appetite for 
each risk, recognising that risk appetite will change over time. 
If a risk exceeds appetite, it will threaten the achievement of 
objectives and may require a change to strategy. Risks that 
are approaching the limit of the Group’s risk appetite may 
require management actions to be accelerated or enhanced 
in order to ensure the risks remain within appetite levels.
Further details on the risk management and internal control systems  
and the review of their effectiveness are provided on pages 82-83
SUMMARY
Our risk profile has changed during the course of 2016,  
as the external economic and political environment has 
evolved and progress has been made in the mitigation of  
our risks. We no longer consider ‘Organisation change’ and 
‘Portfolio restructuring’ as principal risks, but we have added 
‘Future demand for diamonds’, ‘Future demand for platinum 
group metals (PGMs)’ and ‘Delivery of cash targets’ as new 
principal risks.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY
MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY continued
1. COMMODITY PRICES Pillars of value:  This risk has decreased since 2015
Global macro-economic conditions 
leading to sustained low commodity 
prices and/or volatility.
Root cause: The most significant factors 
contributing to this risk at present are a 
continued slowdown in growth in China and 
other emerging markets, low growth rates in 
developed economies and an oversupply of 
commodities into the market. Other factors 
such as weak regional economies, fiscal crises 
and conflict can also influence the economic 
environment and contribute to weak 
commodity prices. 
Impact: Low commodity prices can result  
in lower levels of cash flow, profitability and 
valuation. Debt costs may rise owing to rating 
agency downgrades and the possibility of 
restricted access to funding. The Group may be 
unable to complete its divestment programme 
within the desired timescales or achieve 
expected values. The capacity to invest in 
growth projects is constrained during periods  
of low commodity prices – which may, in turn, 
affect future performance.
Mitigation: High levels of liquidity will be 
maintained during the current cycle. An 
organisation change programme incorporating 
cost reductions has been implemented, while 
the roll-out of the Operating Model, reductions in 
capital expenditure and the divestment of certain 
assets for value are continuing. The Board 
regularly monitors progress of these actions.
This risk has reduced over the course of 2016, 
owing to improving commodity prices and 
progress in implementing management actions.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: The target  
of reducing net debt to below  
$10 billion by the end of 2016  
was achieved, which has improved 
our resilience to this risk.
2. POLITICAL AND REGULATORY Pillars of value:  
   
No change in risk
Uncertainty and adverse changes to 
mining industry regulation, legislation  
or tax rates can occur in any country in 
which we operate. 
Root cause: The Group has no control  
over political acts or changes in local tax rates. 
Our licence to operate through mining rights is 
dependent on a number of factors, including 
compliance with regulations.
Impact: Uncertainty over future business 
conditions leads to a lack of confidence in 
making investment decisions, which can 
influence future financial performance. 
Increased costs can be incurred through 
additional regulations or resource taxes, while 
the ability to execute strategic initiatives that 
reduce costs or divest assets may also be 
restricted, all of which may reduce profitability 
and affect future performance. Political stability 
can also result in civil unrest or nullification of 
existing agreements, mining permits or leases. 
These may adversely affect the Group’s 
operations or performance of those operations.
Mitigation: Anglo American has an active 
engagement strategy with the governments  
and regulators within the countries in which we 
operate or plan to operate. We assess portfolio 
capital investments against political risks and 
avoid or minimise exposure to jurisdictions with 
unacceptable risk levels. We actively monitor 
regulatory and political developments on a 
continuous basis.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Current global 
economic conditions have a 
significant impact on countries 
whose economies are exposed  
to the downturn in commodities, 
placing greater pressure on 
governments to find alternative 
means of raising revenues, and 
increase the risk of social and  
labour unrest. These factors could 
increase the political risks faced  
by the Group.

42 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 4. FUTURE DEMAND FOR PGMs Pillars of value:  
  
A new principal risk
Demand for PGMs is impacted by 
fundamental shifts in market forces.
Root cause: Future demand is at risk from 
declining combustion engine manufacturing 
and a switch to battery operated vehicles 
instead of fuel cell electric vehicles, which 
continue to use higher volumes of PGMs.
Impact: A negative impact on revenue,  
cash flow, profitability and valuation.
Mitigation: Anglo American Platinum has  
a strategy to grow PGMs demand in industrial 
and jewellery sectors through marketing and 
investment initiatives in research, product 
development and market development 
opportunities.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: While this is a new 
principal risk, we see this as a longer 
term threat to the business.
5. MINAS-RIO Pillars of value:  
    
No change in risk
Delay in obtaining the operating  
licence extension.
Root cause: Increased regulatory scrutiny 
for the licence extension can be expected  
as a result of a major tailings dam incident 
involving loss of life at a competitor facility in 
Brazil in 2015. There is also the continuing 
need to manage community issues. This may 
delay completion of the civil works associated 
with the mine’s development, while delays in 
obtaining licences would cause operational 
constraints. The licence process is complex, 
with multiple stakeholders involved in the 
approval process at federal, state and local 
community levels.
Impact: Inability to achieve planned production 
and revenues and/or reductions in the cost of 
production. This may also result in loss of 
investor confidence and reputational damage.
Mitigation: A comprehensive stakeholder 
engagement plan is in place to manage the 
licence extension and actions are being taken  
to address the ramp-up risks identified.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: An extension to the 
operating licence has been granted 
which takes projected production to 
the second half of 2018. The process 
to obtain the Step 3 licences to allow 
the mine to reach its nameplate 
capacity of 26.5 Mtpa (wet basis)  
has also started and is expected to 
be secured in late 2018.
3. FUTURE DEMAND FOR DIAMONDS Pillars of value:  
  
A new principal risk
Demand for diamonds reduces as a result 
of developments in the synthetic industry. 
Root cause: Technological developments 
are making the production of man-made gem 
synthetics commercially viable and there are 
increased distribution sources. The marketing 
of synthetics seeks to place them as being 
environmentally or socially superior.
Impact: Potential loss of polished and rough 
diamond sales leading to a negative impact  
on revenue, cash flow, profitability and value.
Mitigation: De Beers has a mitigation  
strategy based on a number of measures, 
including differentiation of diamonds from 
synthetics, and the technology to detect  
all synthetics.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: This is a new 
principal risk.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 STRATEGIC REPORT MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY
MANAGING RISK EFFECTIVELY continued
9. TAILINGS DAM FAILURE Pillars of value:  
       
No change in risk
A release of waste material leading  
to loss of life, injuries, environmental 
damage, reputational damage, financial 
costs and production impacts. 
Root cause: Tailings dam failures can result 
from over-topping, poor operating practices, 
instability of pit slopes, inadequate design and 
construction, or seismic events.
Impact: Potential for multiple fatalities  
and injuries, at the mine site and in local 
communities, long term environmental  
damage, significant reputational damage  
and loss of licence to operate. The financial 
impact associated with clean-up costs and  
legal liability claims could be substantial.
Mitigation: Anglo American employs  
technical standards that provide minimum 
design criteria and operational performance 
requirements; all of which are regularly 
inspected by technical experts. Assurance work 
is conducted to monitor the controls associated 
with management of tailings dam facilities. 
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Tailings dam failure 
is considered a catastrophic risk –  
i.e. a very high severity but very low 
frequency event that must be treated 
with the highest priority.
8. SAFETY Pillars of value:  
    
This risk has increased since 2015
Failure to deliver a sustained improvement 
in safety performance.
Root cause: Inability to deliver a sustained 
improvement in safety performance will result 
from management interventions and training 
initiatives failing to translate into behavioural 
change by all employees and contractors. 
Non-compliance with critical controls is a 
common failure in safety incidents.
Impact: Loss of life, workplace injuries and 
safety-related stoppages all immediately affect 
production, while, over the longer term, such 
factors are also a threat to our licence to operate.
Mitigation: A continued, relentless focus  
on safety improvement and safety risk 
management is adopted by executive 
management. Operating standards and 
guidelines are in place to mitigate safety  
risk, supported by a robust risk management 
and risk assurance processes. 
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: During 2016 there 
were 1 1 fatalities compared with  
six in 2015. Although the total 
recordable case frequency rate 
(TRCFR) reduced from 0.93 to  
0.71 per 200,000 hours worked, 
management has increased the  
risk rating to ensure an appropriate 
response to the increase in fatalities. 
6. SOUTH AFRICA POWER Pillars of value:  
    
No change in risk
Electricity supply not able to meet the 
country’s demands, leading to unplanned 
outages and failure of the national grid.
Root cause: Anglo American is a significant 
consumer of power owing to the extent of our 
operations in South Africa. The risk is created 
through lack of investment in generating 
capacity due to funding challenges and a 
maintenance backlog in some generating 
facilities, leading to unplanned outages.
Impact: Unplanned and short-notice power 
supply outages can lead to production shortfalls, 
with a negative effect on revenue, costs and 
productivity. There are potential safety 
implications, particularly for underground mines 
and process activities. Loss of critical computing 
systems can interrupt normal business activities.
Mitigation: A central electricity monitoring 
system enables measurement and analysis of 
site level power consumption. Business units 
have emergency generation capability for 
deep-level shafts and procedures are in place to 
minimise disruption. Regular interactions are held 
with management of the state-owned power 
supplier to understand operational challenges.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Reduced industrial 
demand has improved the position, 
but new generation capacity has not 
yet been delivered to the extent 
required. A complete failure of the 
national grid is considered to be a 
very low likelihood event.
7. DELIVERY OF CASH TARGETS Pillars of value:  
 
A new principal risk
Inability to deliver the EBIT improvement 
targets of $1 billion in 2017. 
Root cause: Unplanned and unexpected 
operational issues will affect delivery of the 
target. Delivery will require the support of joint 
venture partners for non-wholly-owned 
operations.
Impact: Inability to deliver required levels  
of cash flow and loss of investor confidence.
Mitigation: A number of initiatives are under 
way and regular tracking and monitoring 
mechanisms are in place. Implementation of  
our Operating Model is one of the key initiatives 
that mitigates this risk. 
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: This is a new 
principal risk for 2016.
44 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 10. SLOPE WALL FAILURE Pillars of value:  
      
No change in risk
A sudden and unexpected failure of a 
slope causing landslides and inrush to pit 
or other asset (such as a pipeline), leading 
to loss of life, injuries, environmental 
damage, reputational damage, financial 
costs and production impacts. 
Root cause: Slope wall failure can result 
from inadequate design, unexpected adverse 
geological conditions, shortcomings in the 
mining process, or natural events such as 
seismic activity or excessive rainfall.
Impact: Potential for multiple fatalities or 
injuries, significant production impact and 
damage to assets. Financial costs associated 
with recovery and legal claims may be extensive. 
Regulatory issues may result and community 
relations may be affected.
Mitigation: Technical standards exist that 
provide minimum criteria for slope stability 
design and operation. Monitoring of slope 
movement is conducted at all open pit 
operations. Inspections and training and 
awareness programmes are provided by 
technical experts, and assurance work is 
conducted to assess the effectiveness  
of controls. 
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Slope wall failure  
is considered a catastrophic risk –  
i.e. a very high severity but very low 
frequency event that must be treated 
with the highest priority.
11. MINESHAFT FAILURE Pillars of value:  
     
No change in risk
A sudden and unexpected failure of  
a mineshaft.
Root cause: Mineshaft failure can occur  
as a result of rope failure, fire and explosion  
in a shaft, flooding, power failure, mud rush, 
conveyance failure or structural failure.
Impact: Multiple fatalities and injuries, damage 
to assets, production loss and reputational 
damage. Financial costs associated with 
recovery and liability claims may be significant.
Mitigation: Technical standards exist that 
provide minimum criteria for mineshaft 
management. Inspections are carried out  
by technical experts and assurance work  
is conducted to assess the effectiveness  
of controls.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Mineshaft failure  
is considered a catastrophic risk –  
i.e. a very high severity but very low 
frequency event that must be treated 
with the highest priority. The sale  
of the Rustenburg operations has 
reduced the number of vertical 
shafts in the Group and the exposure 
to this risk.
12. FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION Pillars of value:  
      
No change in risk
Fire and explosion risks are present  
at all mining operations, and processing 
facilities such as smelters and refineries,  
in our Platinum, Copper and Nickel 
businesses.
Root cause: The combined presence of  
fuel, heat and oxygen, as well as conditions 
that can lead to the concentration and 
confinement of these elements, can  
cause an explosion – including gas, coal  
dust (particularly in underground mines), 
sulphide dust or furnace gas explosions.
Impact: Multiple fatalities and injuries, damage 
to assets, loss of production, reputation damage 
and loss of licence to operate. Financial costs 
associated with recovery and liability claims  
may be significant.
Mitigation: Technical standards exist that 
provide minimum criteria for prevention of 
underground explosions and fire. Inspections 
are carried out by technical experts and 
assurance work is conducted to assess the 
effectiveness of controls. Third-party reviews  
of fire risk are conducted at each location  
where significant risk is present.
Risk appetite: Operating within  
the limits of our appetite.
Commentary: Fire and explosion  
is considered a catastrophic risk –  
i.e. a very high severity but very low

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
INTRODUCTION
De Beers and its partners produce about a third  
of the world’s rough diamonds by value, with the 
majority sold via De Beers Global Sightholder Sales  
to term contract customers (Sightholders) and 
accredited buyers, and the remainder via De Beers 
Auction Sales to auction customers. Downstream 
assets include the De Beers Diamond Jewellers  
joint venture and the Forevermark™ brand, which  
now features in 2,010 outlets in 25 key consumer 
markets around the world. Finally, Element Six  
sells synthetic diamonds for industrial diamond 
supermaterials applications. 
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 42% to $1,406 million 
(2015: $990 million). This was the result of higher revenues 
from stronger rough diamond demand, which led to reduced 
inventory levels, reflecting improved trading conditions 
compared with those experienced in the second half of 
2015. Results also benefited from cost-saving programmes, 
portfolio changes, and the impact of favourable exchange 
rates. Unit costs decreased by 19% from $83/carat to  
$67/carat.
Total revenue increased by 30% to $6.1 billion  
(2015: $4.7 billion), driven by higher rough diamond sales, 
which increased by 37% to $5.6 billion. This was attributable 
to a 50% increase in consolidated sales volumes to  
30.0 million carats (2015: 19.9 million carats), partly offset  
by a 10% decrease in the average realised rough diamond 
price to $187 /carat (2015: $207 /carat), reflecting the 13% 
lower average rough price index, offset to some extent by  
an improved sales mix.
MARKETS
Sustained diamond jewellery demand growth in the US  
and marginally positive growth for the full year in China  
(in local currency, though declining slightly in US dollars) 
contrasted with weakening demand in the other main 
diamond markets. In India, a month-long jewellers’ strike  
in March, and the government’s surprise demonetisation 
programme which started in November, had a considerable 
negative impact on demand. For the full year, global 
consumer demand, in US dollar terms, is estimated to be  
in line with 2015. Additional marketing in the US, China,  
India and Japan in the final quarter of the year, the main 
selling season, had a positive impact.
Producers destocked during 2016, as sentiment in the 
midstream improved and rough and polished inventories 
normalised, supported by a series of initiatives put in place 
by De Beers, starting in the second half of 2015. These 
included lowering rough prices, providing flexibility  
to Sightholders for their purchase arrangements and 
increased marketing activity to drive consumer demand.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Mining and manufacturing
Rough diamond production decreased by 5% to  
27.3 million carats (2015: 28.7 million carats), reflecting  
the decision, taken in 2015, to reduce production in 
response to prevailing trading conditions.
Debswana maintained production at close to the  
previous year’s levels, with output of 20.5 million carats 
(2015: 20.4 million carats). Jwaneng’s production increased 
by 23%; driven by higher tonnes treated, largely offset  
by Orapa, where production was 20% lower. By year end, 
85% of the 500 million tonnes (Mt) of waste stripping 
required to expose the ore had been mined at Jwaneng 
Cut-8. The first Cut-8 ore to the processing plant remains 
scheduled for the first half of 2017, with Cut-8 becoming  
the main source of ore from 2018. Damtshaa (a satellite 
operation of Orapa) was placed onto temporary care and 
maintenance from 1 January 2016.
Production at Namdeb Holdings decreased by 1 1% to  
1.6 million carats (2015: 1.8 million carats), with reduced 
output at Debmarine Namibia (as a result of the Mafuta 
vessel undergoing extended planned in-port maintenance) 
and lower grades at Namdeb’s land operations. Debmarine 
Namibia’s new sampling vessel, the SS Nujoma, was 
completed three months ahead of schedule and within 
budget, and sea trials commenced in November. The  
vessel is expected to become operational during 2017.
In South Africa, production declined by 9% to 4.2 million 
carats (2015: 4.7 million carats), mainly due to the early 
completion of the sale of Kimberley Mines in January  
2016, partly offset by an increase of 12% at Venetia owing  
to the processing of higher grades. Construction of the 
Venetia Underground mine continues to progress, with the 
underground operation expected to become the mine’s 
principal source of ore from 2023.
In Canada, production declined by 45% to 1.0 million  
carats (2015: 1.9 million carats) owing to Snap Lake being 
placed onto care and maintenance in December 2015. In  
July 2016, approval was granted to flood the underground 
workings, which will reduce the costs of care and 
maintenance while preserving the long term viability of  
the orebody. Following conclusion of an unsuccessful 
process to gauge interest in an acquisition of Snap Lake, 
flooding commenced in January 2017. Production at Victor 
decreased by 7% to 0.6 million carats. Development of the 
Gahcho Kué project was completed on schedule, with the 
ramp-up to commercial production expected to be reached 
during the first quarter of 2017.
Owing to continuing depressed markets in key industrial 
sectors (principally oil and gas), Element Six, the industrial 
diamonds business, experienced a challenging year.  
The reduction in contribution arising from lower sales  
has been largely offset through a comprehensive  
cost-reduction programme.
Brands
Forevermark™ (the diamond brand of the De Beers Group 
of Companies) continues to expand its retailer network and 
is available in 2,010 outlets (a 14% increase) in 25 markets, 
including the new markets of Hungary, Thailand and now 
South Korea. In June 2016, Forevermark™ launched the 
Black Label collection (an innovative collection of fancy-
shape diamonds) and, in the final quarter of the year, 
launched a US national television campaign featuring the 
Ever Us™
(1)
 two-stone diamond collection. In the first half  
of 2016, De Beers also invested in category marketing 
campaigns to stimulate diamond jewellery demand during 
key gifting periods in both China and Hong Kong, as well as 
India (the latter in partnership with the Gem and Jewellery 
Export Promotion Council, commencing in the second half 
of 2016). In the third quarter, The Diamond Producers 
Association, co-funded by De Beers and other leading 
producers, launched “Real is Rare”, a new marketing 
platform targeting millennial consumers in the US. 
De Beers Diamond Jewellers (a joint venture between 
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and De Beers) 
maintained its focus on fast-growing markets, with  
34 stores in 17 key consumer markets around the world.  
The significant growth in mainland China sales helped  
to offset the impact of lower Chinese tourist levels in France 
and Hong Kong, while the highlight of the year was the 
successful relocation in November of the New York flagship 
store to a new location on Madison Avenue, completing the 
repositioning of the brand in the US.
Namibia sales agreement
In May 2016, the Government of the Republic of Namibia 
and De Beers signed a new 10-year sales agreement  
for the sorting, valuing and sale of Namdeb Holdings’ 
diamonds. This represents the longest sales agreement 
ever concluded between the parties.
OUTLOOK
Macro-economic conditions underpinning consumer 
demand for diamonds remain broadly stable in aggregate, 
with the US expected to continue to be the main driver of 
global growth in 2017. The extent of global growth will, 
however, be dependent upon a number of macro-economic 
factors, including the new administration in the US, the 
strength of the US dollar impacting consumer demand, 
economic performance in China, the effects of Indian 
demonetisation, and sentiment following the main  
US and Chinese New Year retail season. 
With midstream stocks having returned to more typical 
levels in 2016, rough diamond demand is expected to 
normalise in 2017, reflecting underlying consumer and  
retail demand. While producers continue destocking, 
forecast diamond production (on a 100% basis, except 
Gahcho Kué on an attributable 51% basis) for 2017 is 
expected to be in the range of 31-33 million carats,  
subject to trading conditions.

6%. Average palladium and rhodium dollar prices also 
decreased, notwithstanding their strong price rally during 
the year. Global supply of platinum group metals (PGMs) 
was little changed, despite a modest reduction in sales  
by South African producers. Although the rate of PGM 
recovery from recycled autocatalysts increased towards  
the end of the year, there was only limited growth in PGM 
supplies from the secondary recycling sector. 
Platinum demand declined by 1%, with a 15% decrease in 
demand from the jewellery sector largely offset by a 10% 
increase in purchases for industrial applications. Demand 
for platinum in the automotive sector increased by 2%, 
supported by the introduction of Euro 6b emissions 
regulations in September 2015, and consequent higher 
catalyst loadings. Strong sales growth in the European car 
market saw an increase in the number of diesel cars being 
manufactured, though diesel’s share of the new car market 
decreased slightly. The platinum market remained in deficit 
in 2016.
In contrast, palladium offtake increased by 2%, with strong 
growth in the predominantly petrol-engined Chinese car 
market supporting automotive demand, which increased by 
3% to 7.8 million ounces. Despite continued net liquidation 
of palladium investments, the palladium market remained in 
deficit in 2016, contributing to a rally in the price of the metal 
as the year progressed.

INTRODUCTION
Anglo American Platinum continues to optimise  
and reconfigure its portfolio. Once complete, Platinum  
will have a best in class operating footprint at the 
Mogalakwena and Amandelbult mines in South Africa 
and Unki in Zimbabwe, alongside its joint venture 
interests in Bafokeng-Rasimone, the Mototolo  
mine and Modikwa mine in South Africa. Also in  
South Africa, Platinum owns smelting and refining 
operations which treat concentrates, not only from  
its wholly owned mines, but also from joint venture 
partners and third parties.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Underlying EBITDA decreased by 26% to $532 million 
(2015: $718 million). Lower sales volumes of platinum, 
palladium, rhodium and minor metals, weakening dollar 
metal prices and the effects of inflation were partially offset 
by a weaker South African rand and cost improvements.
Unit costs decreased by 12% to $1,330 per ounce, owing 
primarily to the softer rand and cost improvements.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Total platinum production (metal in concentrate) increased 
by 2% to 2,382,000 ounces (2015: 2,337,000 ounces). 
Production increases at Mogalakwena, Amandelbult,  
Unki, Union and independently managed operations were 
partly offset by lower output from Rustenburg and Bokoni. 
Putting Twickenham onto care and maintenance removed 
approximately 10,000 ounces of unprofitable platinum, 
while a contractual agreement with a third party for 
concentrate ended in 2015, which led to a reduction in 
purchase of concentrate of 1 1,000 ounces compared  
with 2015. 
Mogalakwena mine increased production by 5% to  
412,000 ounces (2015: 392,000 ounces), including  
31,000 ounces (2015: 24,000 ounces) processed at the  
Baobab concentrator. Mogalakwena had a strong mining 
performance, with an 8% increase in tonnes milled.
At Amandelbult mine, despite a loss of 20,000 ounces 
following a fatal incident in which two employees lost their 
lives, and the subsequent Section 54 safety stoppage, 
production increased by 7%, reaching 467,000 ounces 
(2015: 437,000 ounces). The majority of the increase came 
from a continued strong performance at the opencast area, 
which produced 41,000 ounces. 
Production from Unki mine in Zimbabwe increased by  
12%
(1)
 to 75,000 ounces (2015: 66,000 ounces), driven 
mainly by an improvement in recovered grade through 
better mining reef cut, which reduced waste mining, 
resulting in more higher grade ore being delivered to  
the concentrator. As a result, the 4E built-up head grade 
increased to 3.46g/t from 3.22g/t.
Total production from Rustenburg mine, including the 
Western Limb Tailings Retreatment plant, decreased by 4%  
to 460,000 ounces (2015: 478,000 ounces)
(2)
. Lower output 
was attributable to four fatal incidents, Section 54 safety 
stoppages and other incidents, as well as other operational 
challenges. The sale of the Rustenburg operations was 
completed on 1 November 2016; from this date, Rustenburg 
production is being treated as a purchase of concentrate 
rather than own mined ounces.
Union mine increased platinum production by 7% to 
151,000 ounces (2015: 141,000 ounces). This was  
the mine’s best performance since 2013, following 
implementation of the optimised mine plan that was 
completed in June 2016, which resulted in a significant 
reduction in labour.
Platinum production from independently managed 
operations, inclusive of both mined and purchased output, 
increased by 2% to 785,000 ounces (2015: 768,000 
ounces). All mines showed year-on-year improvements, 
with the exception of Bokoni, where production decreased 
by 21% owing to the closures of two shafts in the fourth 
quarter of 2015, which removed 26,000 ounces of 
unprofitable platinum.
Refined platinum production decreased by 5% to 2,335,000 
ounces (2015: 2,459,000 ounces), mainly as a result of the 
run-out at Waterval in September 2016, which had the effect 
of reducing refined production by 65,000 ounces. 
Platinum sales volumes decreased by 2% to 2,416,000 
platinum ounces (2015: 2,471,000 ounces), reflecting the 
decrease in refined platinum production. Sales were higher 
than refined production and were supplemented by a 
drawdown in refined inventory.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Platinum production guidance (metal in concentrate) is 
2.35-2.4 million ounces for 2017 (previously 2.4 million- 
2.5 million ounces), largely driven by an increase in purchase 
of concentrate from third parties. Year-on-year production 
from own-managed mines is expected to remain flat at 
around 960,000 ounces.

OPERATING MODEL CONTINUES TO BE ROLLED OUT  
AT LOS BRONCES
The Anglo American Operating Model has now been in place at the  
Los Bronces plant for a full year, delivering improvements in planning 
and work management, reliability and plant performance. The 
Operating Model went live at the mine at the end of 201 6 and is expected 
to support capital productivity, improve asset management and mine 
planning, with a resultant improvement in planning and lower costs. 
CASH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMME
As part of the Group’s continued focus on cash, 2016 saw the Copper 
business launch a programme to further improve cash generation in 
the low price environment, and rebuild a culture of cost awareness in 
the business. As a result, cash generation increased by more than 
$200 million compared with 2015, despite an 1 1% fall in the average 
LME copper price, through cost-reduction efforts at the operations 
and corporate office, including capital expenditure prioritisation and 
optimising working capital.

Underlying EBITDA decreased by 4% to $903 million, driven by a 
decrease in the average LME copper price and an 18% decline in 
sales volumes (reflecting in part the sale of Anglo American Norte  
in September 2015), partly offset by a significant reduction in  
cash costs. Results benefited from cost-reduction initiatives and 
productivity improvements across all operations, as well as from  
the implementation, at the start of 2016, of an optimised mine plan  
at El Soldado. At 31 December 2016, 1 13,204 tonnes of copper  
were provisionally priced at 251 c/lb. Provisional pricing of copper 
sales resulted in an underlying EBITDA gain of $144 million  
(2015: loss of $366 million), bringing the realised copper price  
to 225 c/lb for the period, 1% lower than in 2015.

The average LME copper price was 1 1% lower at 221 c/lb. 
Although the average price was lower than in 2015, prices 
started 2015 at higher levels and were subsequently 
impacted by bearish fund positioning, influenced by negative 
macro-economic sentiment. This precipitated sharp price 
falls towards the end of 2015, and into January 2016. Prices 
were relatively stable during the year, before rising strongly in 
the latter stages. Sentiment towards the metal showed signs 
of improvement as China’s economy displayed evidence of 
stability, leading to increased investment flows into copper. 
Key copper-consuming sectors in China contributed to the 
improved offtake, including stronger construction and 
infrastructure activity, such as power grid investment.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The Los Bronces operation faced a number of challenges 
during the year. Production decreased by 24% to 307,200 
tonnes (2015: 401,700 tonnes), driven by expected 
significantly lower grades (2016: 0.67% vs. 2015: 0.92%). 
The mine returned to processing lower average grades than 
in 2015, when it had prioritised the processing of higher 
grade areas in order to offset the impact of water shortages. 
In 2016, in contrast, a series of unusual weather events 
resulted in the operations having to cope with excess water. 
Snowfall late in 2015, and its subsequent melting, caused 
dewatering problems in the pit, while significant snowfall in 
2016 (when more than 10 metres was recorded, 30% higher 
than average) interrupted ore extraction, particularly from 
the mine’s higher altitude and higher grade areas, which 
affected the ability to feed high grade ore to the plants.  
In addition, a seven-day strike affected production in 
September, and there were disruptions in November and 
December owing to illegal industrial action by contractor 
unions. In spite of the production challenges, unit costs were 
only 5% higher than in 2015, at 156 c/lb (2015: 148 c/lb),  
as cost-reduction initiatives across all areas of the operation 
partly compensated for the lower output.
Record concentrate production was achieved at Collahuasi; 
Anglo American’s attributable production increased by  
1 1% to 222,900 tonnes (2015: 200,300 tonnes). Strong, 
sustained plant performance, following rectification work 
undertaken in 2015, was supported by higher grades  
(2016: 1.22% vs. 2015: 1.15%). This was offset by reduced 
cathode production following the closure of the higher cost 
oxide plant at the end of 2015. Unit costs decreased by  
19% to 1 1 1 c/lb (2015: 137 c/lb), benefiting from the higher 
production as well as from an ongoing focus on reducing 
costs at the operation.
Production at El Soldado increased by 31% to 47,000 tonnes 
(2015: 36,000 tonnes) as a result of improved throughput 
and higher grades. Unit costs declined by 19% to 184 c/lb 
(2015: 228 c/lb), reflecting the benefits of both the higher 
production and the implementation of the optimised mine 
plan from the start of the year. In July 2016, the unionised 
workforce at El Soldado went on a 13-day strike before 
agreement was reached with the company on a new 
remuneration offer. Management continued to optimise  
the mine plan following changes made to sequencing in 
response to low prices during 2016. The redesigned mine 
plan for El Soldado is yet to receive permitting approval and 
therefore we decided, in February 201 7, to temporarily 
suspend mining operations, pending appeal to the regulator 
and/or amendments being made to the mine plan. Work 
continues with Sernageomin (Chile’s National Geology and 
Mining Service) on securing appropriate licences for this 
revised mine plan.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK
Production in 201 7 is expected to be in line with that in 2016. 
Higher throughput at Collahuasi is expected to be offset by 
lower grades. At Los Bronces, recovery from the weather- 
and strike-related stoppages in 2016 is likely to be affected 
by increasing ore hardness, thereby constraining plant 
performance. Production guidance for 201 7 remains 
unchanged at 570,000-600,000 tonnes.
In the next two years it will be necessary to replace the  
stator motors on each of the two ball mills on the key  
Line 3 at Collahuasi (responsible for around 60% of plant 
throughput). This work is planned for 2018 and 2019; 
however, this may be brought forward for operational 
reasons (estimated impact of each change on attributable 
production of 20,000-25,000 tonnes).

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
The sale of the niobium and phosphates business  
to China Molybdenum Co Ltd. was completed on  
30 September 2016.
Nickel
Nickel’s underlying EBITDA was $57 million, reflecting  
lower cash costs and higher volumes following the 
successful rebuild of Barro Alto’s furnaces, with the 
operation reaching nameplate capacity in the third quarter 
of 2016, as well as the favourable impact of the weaker 
Brazilian real. These benefits were partly offset by a decline 
in the average nickel price for the year, cost inflation and 
lower energy surplus sales. Barro Alto’s operating results 
were capitalised until October 2015, when the project began 
commercial production.
Nickel unit costs decreased by 19% to 350 c/lb  
(2015: 431 c/lb), mainly attributable to increased production 
volumes from Barro Alto, favourable exchange rates, lower 
energy costs and consumables, partially offset by inflation.
Niobium
Underlying EBITDA was flat year-on-year at $41 million 
(2015: $40 million), with higher sales volumes from  
Boa Vista Fresh Rock (BVFR) and lower cash costs 
offsetting lower prices and the impact of the sale of the 
business. Underlying EBITDA from BVFR was capitalised 
during January and February 2016, with commercial 
production being achieved in March 2016. 
Phosphates
Underlying EBITDA of $80 million decreased by 28%  
(2015: $1 1 1 million), driven primarily by the sale of the 
business, as well as lower sales pricing and inflation, partially 
offset by a reduction in operating costs.

Nickel
The average LME nickel cash settlement price decreased by 
19% to 436 c/lb (2015: 536 c/lb). 
Concerns about global economic growth put significant 
downward pressure on metal prices, particularly through  
the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. Despite 
these concerns, nickel demand improved strongly during  
the year, while supply contracted for the second consecutive 
year, resulting in a market deficit. Demand, which had grown 
by 1.2% in 2015, increased by 8.3% in 2016, supported by 
strong growth in global stainless steel production, which rose 
by 5.3% (2015: 0.2%). With Chinese nickel pig iron (NPI) 
production declining, price-led cutbacks at other nickel 
producers and lower availability of nickel-bearing stainless 
steel scrap, the nickel market tightened, while a shortage of 
nickel-iron units (ferronickel, NPI and stainless steel scrap) 
led to ferronickel, which had traded at a discount to the LME 
price, starting to command a premium to the LME price.
Niobium
Worldwide demand for ferroniobium decreased in 2016. 
Demand from the key markets of China and North America 
was particularly muted at the beginning of the year, 
attributable to overcapacity in steel production, and the 
effect of the weaker oil and gas sector. 
Phosphates
The average MAP CFR Brazil price was $354/tonne, 26% 
lower than for the equivalent period in 2015 ($479/tonne),  
as a result of increased global supply and weaker than 
expected demand in the major markets – the US, China and 
India. In Brazil, demand for phosphate fertilisers from January 
to September 2016 was around 10.2 million tonnes, a 6.5% 
increase. This strong demand was driven by favourable 
weather conditions, lower fertiliser prices, an attractive barter 
ratio, the weaker Brazilian real (which supported farmers’ 
earnings) and increased availability of funding to farmers.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Nickel
Nickel output increased by 47% to 44,500 tonnes  
(2015: 30,300 tonnes) following the successful rebuild of 
the Barro Alto furnaces, which are now producing at close  
to nameplate capacity. Codemin’s production of metal was 
in line with the previous year at approximately 9,000 tonnes.
Niobium
At the point of disposal, production was in line with the  
prior year at 4,700 tonnes (Q3 2015: 4,700 tonnes;  
FY 2015: 6,300 tonnes). This was despite two shutdowns; 
the first in the first quarter to reduce stock levels and 
facilitate site maintenance and work on residue disposal; 
and the second, a planned stoppage in May in order to 
implement the downstream metallurgy project. Following 
the project’s implementation, plant performance was strong, 
with an all-time production record achieved in July. 
Phosphates
At the time of disposal in the third quarter, fertiliser 
production was 0.9 million tonnes (Q3 2015: 0.8 million 
tonnes; FY 2015: 1.1 million tonnes), with the increase being 
attributable to strong granulation plant performance at both 
sites and favourable operational conditions, which allowed 
two separate planned maintenance stoppages (scheduled 
for January and March 2016) to be combined. Phosphoric 
acid production was also boosted as a result of increased 
plant stability and higher equipment availability at both sites. 
Dicalcium phosphate production was higher because of 
improved plant performance (principally lower idle time at 
Cubatão and a reduction in time spent on tank maintenance 
at Catalão), as well as higher phosphoric acid availability.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Nickel
Production guidance for 2017 is approximately 45,000

STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE AND MANGANESE
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
Kumba
Underlying EBITDA increased by 33% to $1,347 million 
(2015: $1,01 1 million), mainly due to a 21% increase in the 
average realised FOB export iron ore price from $53/tonne 
to $64/tonne, partially offset by lower sales volumes. 
Lump- and ore-quality benefits resulted in the average 
realised iron ore price of $64/tonne being higher than the 
average iron ore benchmark price of $58/tonne. Unit costs 
decreased by 13% to $27 /tonne (2015: $31 /tonne), driven 
by the pit reconfiguration at Sishen to a lower cost shell, 
which included restructuring the operation, and the benefit 
of the weaker South African rand. The pit reconfiguration 
resulted in lower volumes, partially offset by productivity 
gains in mining and processing operations. The average 
CFR break-even price achieved was $29/tonne in 2016.
Sales volumes decreased by 1 1% to 42.5 Mt (2015: 47.8 Mt), 
reflecting the 10% decline in production volumes at Sishen. 
Total finished product stock reduced to 3.5 Mt (2015: 4.7 Mt), 
in line with the optimum level of around 3 Mt. 
Iron Ore Brazil
Iron Ore Brazil’s underlying EBITDA loss was $6 million 
(2015: $20 million loss). Minas-Rio continued to capitalise 
its operating results in 2016, as the asset remained in the 
ramp-up phase throughout the year. Iron Ore Brazil’s 
capitalised operating EBITDA amounted to $269 million 
(2015: $239 million loss), reflecting higher total sales 
volumes and an improvement in realised iron ore prices, as 
well as lower unit costs. Minas-Rio’s average FOB realised 
price in 2016 was $54 per wet metric tonne (equivalent to 
$59 per dry metric tonne). Operating results ceased to be 
capitalised from January 2017.
Samancor
Underlying EBITDA increased by $154 million to  
$258 million (2015: $104 million), driven by a recovery  
in manganese ore prices, a 6% increase in ore sales, and 
lower costs partly attributable to the restructuring of  
the South African manganese operations.
The restructuring of the South African manganese 
operations was completed in the first quarter of the year. 
This reduced the operating cost base and increased 
production flexibility in response to the sharp decline in  
the manganese index ore price in 2015, which carried 
through into the first half of 2016. During the second six 
months, however, the price staged a dramatic recovery  
from its lows.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Iron ore prices fared better than in 2015, but with  
significant volatility through the year. The IODEX 62%  
Fe CFR China spot price increased by 4% to an average of 
$58/tonne, trading in a yearly range of $40-$84/tonne. The 
improvement in downstream demand in China, combined 
with steel capacity closures as part of the country’s 
supply-side reforms and environmental improvement drive, 
supported both steel and iron ore prices. This positive 
demand environment and improved mill margins have 
driven an increase in Chinese crude steel production, while 
the progressive withdrawal of marginal domestic iron ore 
supply has boosted demand for seaborne iron ore materials. 
Rallying metallurgical coal prices have also been supportive 
of demand for high grade ores, with quality price premiums 
increasing through most of the second half of 2016.

Manganese
Following a 57% reduction in the index ore price during 
2015, the index ore price increased by 341% during 2016, 
closing at $9.01 /dmtu (44% Mn CIF China). The price 
recovery was driven by demand from China, where strong 
government-led infrastructure spending has resulted  
in higher steel prices.

(2015: 31.4 Mt), consistent with the mine’s lower-cost  
pit configuration. Waste mined reduced to 137.1 Mt  
(2015: 222.2 Mt), in line with lower production. Run rates  
for the year were affected by the restructuring; higher levels 
of rainfall and safety stoppages in the first six months also  
had an adverse impact on production. Following successful 
completion of the restructuring, the second half of the  
year showed a considerable improvement as benefits 
attributable to improved mining productivity, as well as 
access to low strip ratio ore and higher plant yields, started 
to come through.
Implementation of the mining work management element  
of the Operating Model at Sishen resulted in significant 
improvements in the amount of ore and waste mined.  
Work management for the reconfigured mining set-up is 
now under way.
Kolomela mine produced a record 12.7 Mt, 6% more  
than the 12.1 Mt produced in 2015, mainly owing to 
debottlenecking and optimisation of the plant. Waste  
mining increased by 10% to 50.2 Mt, in line with higher 
production levels. 
At Kolomela, implementation of the Operating Model in  
the plant area has seen a marked improvement in work 
execution, with scheduled work completion now in excess  
of 95%. Screening-tonnes throughput improved by 18% 
during the go-live phase, and a further 18% during the 
stabilisation phase. The plant’s process stability has also 
improved significantly.
Mining activities at Thabazimbi ceased on 30 September 
2015, and processing activities on 31 March 2016. Closure 
of the mine has proceeded according to plan. Sishen Iron 
Ore Company Proprietary Limited, a subsidiary of Kumba, 
and ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited (AMSA) have signed 
an agreement for the transfer of the Thabazimbi mine, 
including all remaining assets and liabilities, to AMSA, which 
will become effective once all the conditions precedent have 
been met. 
The Dingleton project is substantially complete, with only a 
small number of households still to be relocated.
Iron Ore Brazil
Iron ore production from Minas-Rio
(1)
 increased by 76%  
to 16.1 Mt (2015: 9.2 Mt), as the operation continues its 
ramp-up. There has been an improved operational 
performance since July 2016, when a licence was granted  
to access the Step 2 area.
Samancor
Manganese ore production was broadly in line with the  
prior year at 3.1 Mt (attributable basis). Production from the 
Australian operations was 2% lower owing to certain ore 
feed constraints. This was offset by a 5% increase from the 
South African operations following the drawdown of the 
Wessels concentrate stockpiles in response to higher 
market prices.
Production of manganese alloys decreased by 35% to 
137,800 tonnes (attributable basis). This was due to power 
shortages in Tasmania, which resulted in a five month 
suspension of production at two of the four furnaces. The 
furnaces were subsequently brought back on line, with  
a return to full production rates during September. In  
South Africa, manganese alloy production declined by  
46% following the decision in May 2015 to temporarily  
close three of the four furnaces there.

Trucks transporting iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine to the nearby beneficiation plant, both located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The mine continued its 
ramp-up during 2016, and is expected to reach nameplate capacity of 26.5 Mtpa after the Step 3 licences are secured, expected to be in late 2018.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Kumba
Production guidance for Sishen is 27-28 Mt for 2017, with  
a waste movement target of 150- 160 Mt. The restructuring 
is expected to contribute to annual cost savings for 2017.  
In the medium term, the mine will continue to explore 
opportunities to fill any spare plant capacity through the use 
of low grade stockpiles. Further improvements in equipment 
efficiencies are expected over the medium term.  
At Kolomela, annual production is expected to be 13- 14 Mt  
for 2017. Waste removal is expected to increase to around 
50-55 Mt in support of the increased annual output. 
Kumba has a target unit cost of c. $30/tonne. Full-year  
total sales volume guidance for 2017 is 40-42 Mt. 
Iron Ore Brazil
Iron Ore Brazil continues to focus on operational stability 
and on obtaining the Step 3 licences required for the 
operation to access the full range of run-of-mine grades  
and reach its nameplate capacity of 26.5 Mt (wet basis). 
Approval of the Step 2 licences, which had been expected  
in the first half of 2016, was provisionally granted in July 
2016, with final approval in October 2016. The Step 2 area  
is expected to yield c. 45 million saleable tonnes (wet basis) 
of ore, most of which is anticipated to be mined by the  
time the licences for Step 3 (which had originally been  
expected in early 2018, and are now forecast for late  
2018) are secured.
As a result of these licensing delays, production guidance  
for 2017 has been lowered to 16- 18 Mt (previously  
19-21 Mt), and for 2018 to 15- 18 Mt (previously 22-24 Mt), 
subject to the timing of the Step 3 licences approval. After 
the Step 3 licences have been secured, the operation is 
expected to be in a position to ramp-up to produce at its 
nameplate capacity rate of 26.5 Mt per year.
In 2017, unit costs are expected to be approximately  
$27 /tonne (wet basis, at 2016 average FX rate). 
Samancor
Australian manganese ore production guidance of  
2.1 Mwmt remains unchanged, albeit with an increased 
proportion of Premium Concentrate ore (PCO2) in the 
product mix. The PCO2 fines product has a manganese 
content of approximately 40%, which leads to both grade 
and product-type discounts when referenced to the high 
grade 44% manganese lump ore index. 
South Africa Manganese ore production will remain 
configured for an optimised production rate of 2.9 Mwmt pa 
(100% basis), although the business will continue to act 
opportunistically when market fundamentals are supportive.
LEGAL
Residual mining rights
On 12 October 2016, South Africa’s Department of Mineral 
Resources (DMR) granted the residual 21.4% undivided 
share of the mining right for the Sishen mine to Sishen Iron 
Ore Company Proprietary Limited (SIOC). As a result of the 
grant of the residual 21.4% undivided share, SIOC is now the 
sole and exclusive holder of the right to mine iron ore and 
quartzite at the Sishen mine. This residual mining right will 
be incorporated into the 78.6% Sishen mining right that 
SIOC successfully converted in 2009.
Tax matters
On 3 February 2017, the South African Revenue Services 
and Sishen Iron Ore Company Proprietary Limited agreed 
on a R2.5 billion (approximately $185 million) settlement  
of a tax matter relating to the period covering 2006 to 2015 
inclusive. The Group had previously provided for R1.5 billion 
and an additional R1.0 billion was provided for in 2016.  61

STRATEGIC REPORT COAL
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
Australia and Canada
Underlying EBITDA increased by 70% to $996 million, 
reflecting a 24% increase in the metallurgical coal realised 
price, and cost reductions across the business. Underlying 
EBITDA further benefited from an increase in the proportion 
of hard coking coal (HCC) production to 65% of total export 
production (2015: 60%). Although total production declined 
following a number of divestments, unit costs decreased by 
7% in US dollar terms (7% in local currency) following the 
implementation of significant cost-reduction initiatives, 
particularly at the open cut operations, and a corporate 
restructure. Local currency (Australian dollar) unit costs 
were the lowest since 2006. 
Excluding the impact of divestments, total coal production 
was 4% lower than in 2015. The decrease was attributable 
to a reduction in export thermal production at Drayton, 
where mining activities ceased in October, following the 
New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission 
decision not to support approval of the Drayton South 
project. Excluding the divestment of Foxleigh (completed  
on 29 August 2016), metallurgical coal production was in 
line with the prior year.
The divestment of Callide was completed on  
31 October 2016.
Grosvenor produced its first longwall coal in May 2016, 
seven months ahead of schedule and more than  
$100 million under its total capital budget. While all 
equipment has been fully commissioned, ramp-up to  
normal production is currently being hampered by 
challenging geological conditions.
South Africa
Underlying EBITDA increased by 37% to $473 million.  
This was mainly attributable to a 9% increase in the  
export thermal coal price, notwithstanding 4% lower export 
sales volumes as a result of planned destocking in 2015 
(which was not repeated in 2016), facilitated by accessing  
additional rail and port capacity. Despite continued 
inflationary pressure in South Africa, unit costs reduced  
by 13% to $34/tonne owing to the weaker rand and a  
2% reduction in on-mine rand unit costs. On-mine local 
currency costs have now reduced in line with those reported 
in 2013, as a result of the business’s cost-saving and 
productivity initiatives. 
Production increased by 7%, with a 9% increase from  
the Export mines following implementation of productivity 
improvement initiatives, and a 7% increase at the Eskom-
tied mines, due largely to the recommissioning of the third 
dragline at New Vaal following a maintenance shutdown.
Colombia
Underlying EBITDA increased by 40% to $235 million, 
attributable mainly to stronger prices and lower costs 
following planned lower production to remove the  
highest cost capacity, and by the sustained benefits of 
significant cost-reduction programmes implemented  
in 2015.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Metallurgical coal prices started to recover in the first six 
months, in a balanced market. In the second half, China’s 
imposition of safety, environmental and working time 
controls on its domestic mines, along with supply disruptions 
arising from geological difficulties encountered at several 
mines in Australia, caused significant market tightness, 
resulting in a sharp increase in both spot and contract prices. 
The spot metallurgical coal price averaged $199/tonne  
(TSI Premium HCC FOB Australia East Coast Port $/tonne) 
in the second half, 134% higher than in the first six months, 
with the premium for high grade material increasing owing 
to tightness in the premium HCC market. Supply controls on 
domestic production in China were relaxed towards the end 
of the year, while exports from the US slowly increased in the 
second half as some mines there came out of bankruptcy 
protection. Australian supply, however, remained broadly 
stable throughout the year, with producers taking a cautious 
view on capital investment.

Thermal coal price and realised price will differ according to timing and  
quality differences.
Chinese domestic supply rationalisation led to rises in the 
domestic thermal coal price, thereby incentivising imports. 
Consequently, Chinese import demand increased in the 
second half of the year, lifting global thermal coal prices. In 
the Pacific, the globalCOAL Newcastle 6,000 kcal/kg FOB 
Australia index increased by 12% to $66/tonne. This uplift  
in demand and subsequent increase in price helped pull up 
both the South African (API4) and Colombian (API10) 
indices by 12%. On the supply side, supply from Australia 
and Indonesia decreased slightly, while Russian exports  
into the Pacific were marginally higher on the back  
of increased Chinese import demand.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Australia and Canada
Excluding the impact of divestments, production from  
the Australian mines decreased by 4% owing to the 
cessation of mining activities at Drayton (thermal coal). 
Production from the remaining operations was flat 
year-on-year as geological issues at Capcoal’s Grasstree 
operation, and a planned reduction at Capcoal’s open cut, 
which moved to a five-day operation, were offset by the 
ramp-up of Grosvenor, productivity improvements at 
Dawson and Jellinbah, as well as another record year  
at Moranbah. 
Excluding the divestment of Foxleigh, Australian export 
metallurgical coal production was in line with 2015. HCC 
production increased by 2%, owing to the ramp-up of 
Grosvenor (benchmark HCC producer), productivity gains 
and a change in mix to higher value metallurgical coal 
production at Dawson.
South Africa
Total production from the export operations increased by 
9% to 24.6 million tonnes following the implementation of 
various productivity improvement initiatives at all managed 
sites, the introduction of enhanced shift systems at 
Goedehoop and Zibulo, and plant innovations at Kleinkopje 
and Goedehoop that have delivered incremental saleable 
production from previously discarded material. 
Export sales at 19.1 Mt were the second highest ever 
recorded, albeit 4% below 2015, when prior year sales 
volumes benefited from a planned 1 Mt drawdown  
of inventory.
Eskom mine production increased by 7%, with New Vaal’s 
third dragline back in production following maintenance  
in the second half of 2015, and an improved performance  
at Kriel’s underground operations.
Colombia
Anglo American’s attributable output from its 33.3% 
shareholding in Cerrejón decreased by 4% to 10.7 Mt, 
following heavy rainfall in May and June, and ongoing 
planned reductions to remove the highest-cost capacity.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK
Australia and Canada
Metallurgical coal production in 2017 is expected to be 
19-21 Mt. This is below previous guidance owing to the 
divestment of Foxleigh, the restructuring of Dawson and 
Capcoal open cut to lower cost, lower volume operations, 
and current geological issues at Grosvenor.
Export thermal coal
In 2017, export production guidance from South Africa  
and Colombia has increased to 29-31 Mt (previously  
28-30 Mt). 64 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE AND OTHER
CORPORATE AND OTHER
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
Corporate and Other reported an underlying EBITDA  
loss of $123 million (2015: $1 1 million loss).
Other Mining and Industrial
Underlying EBITDA from Other Mining and Industrial fell 
from a contribution of $1 10 million to a loss of $2 million 
following the disposal of Anglo American’s interest in the 
Lafarge Tarmac joint venture in July 2015.
Exploration
Exploration expenditure decreased to $107 million  
(2015: $152 million), reflecting general reductions across  
all commodities. The decreases were mainly attributable  
to an overall reduction in drilling activities.
Corporate activities and unallocated costs
Underlying EBITDA amounted to a $14 million loss  
(2015: $31 million gain), driven primarily by a year-on-year 
loss of $62 million that was recognised in the Group’s 
self-insurance entity, reflecting lower premium income  
and higher net claims and settlements during 2016.
This was offset to some extent by an 1 1% decrease  
in corporate costs ($57 million), of which $56 million 
represented a foreign exchange gain compared with  
2015. The reduction in corporate costs was mitigated  
by a 10% decrease in the recharge and allocation of 
corporate costs to business units of $40 million, reflecting 
the lower corporate cost base.

GOVERNANCE
BOARD VISITS TO OPERATIONS
In order that directors have a good understanding of  
the business and have the opportunity to interact with 
employees from a range of backgrounds and seniority, we 
encourage them to visit the Group’s operations. In addition 
to the site visits (described on page 75) and the Board and 
committee meetings, the non-executives interact with 
management throughout the year. This is helpful to them to 
understand the culture and morale of employees, and to the 
employees themselves to learn more about the role of the 
directors and how they contribute to the Group’s success.
BOARD EVALUATION
At least every three years the Board and its committees  
are evaluated by an external third party who interviews  
the directors and senior management to form an objective 
opinion on the performance of the Board and its members. 
Every board and every individual can benefit and improve 
from the receipt of constructive feedback and this Board 
and its directors are no exception. The areas highlighted  
for attention, and the actions we took to address the points 
raised in the 2015 external review, are described on page 77. 
An internal review has been carried out for 2016.
COMMITTEE GOVERNANCE
Starting on page 78, each of the Board committee  
chairmen presents a report on the activities of their 
committees during 2016. Each of these committees fulfils  
a vital role in safeguarding the effective governance of the 
Group and in ensuring that matters of material importance 
are fully considered and debated. The committee chairmen 
report to subsequent Board meetings on their deliberations, 
highlighting any matters that the Board as a whole should be 
aware of or which need further consideration. This helps to 
ensure that subjects raised at a committee meeting which 
may have a bearing on another committee’s responsibilities 
are brought to everyone’s attention. 
This year we are presenting our remuneration policy to 
shareholders for approval, together with our remuneration 
report which is the subject of an advisory only vote. Details 
of payments received by Board members under the existing 
policy, and the proposed new policy, are provided in the 
report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 84- 109.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE

full with the UK Corporate Governance Code and I hope  
you find this report useful and informative.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
As I mention in my Statement on pages 4-5 of this Report,  
the rapid deepening of the commodity crisis in the last  
few months of 2015 and at the start of 2016 necessitated  
an urgent but measured response from the Company. The 
Board established a committee of non-executive directors 
to meet regularly with our chief executive and management 
to approve our strategic approach to the crisis. This 
committee ensured that we achieved fast decision-making, 
and good alignment and cohesion between the Board and 
management, especially in the first six weeks of the year. 
BOARD COMPOSITION
As a result of the resignations of Ray O’Rourke and Judy 
Dlamini in July and August 2016 respectively, the size of  
the Board was reduced to 1 0 directors, but given the need  
to tighten control of costs and to approach any search 
processes in a considered and appropriate way, we delayed 
commencing the recruitment of additional non-executives 
until later in the year. We are now nearing the end of those 
processes and the new appointments to the Board will 
ensure that we maintain a minimum of 25% women on the 
Board and ethnic diversity in our broad mix of attributes.  
We have now appointed a new finance director following 
René Médori’s decision to retire at the end of 2017 after  
12 years in post. Although the process for appointing new 
directors is led by the Nomination Committee, other Board 
members are given the opportunity to meet candidates  
and recommend or otherwise their appointment. The  
work carried out by the Committee in 2016 is described  
on page 79.

70 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
GOVERNANCE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE
The Board supports the principles and provisions of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) issued by  
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The Company  
has complied throughout the year with the Code, which is 
available on the FRC’s website (www.frc.org.uk). Details  
of how the Code has been applied are detailed below.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board is collectively responsible for the governance  
of the Company and this role is particularly important  
when the Company finds itself under stress and operating  
in difficult economic conditions. At times such as this, 
shareholders and other stakeholders expect the Board  
to respond effectively and appropriately and to take the 
actions necessary to ensure and safeguard the Company’s 
long term success. 
As noted in the Chairman’s introduction on page 65, the 
Board established a committee to revise and refine the 
Company’s strategic response. This was presented to, and 
agreed by, the Board as a whole at its meeting in February 
2016. The agreed strategy was outlined in the 2015 Annual 
Report and its progress to date is described elsewhere in 
this document. 
Throughout 2016, the Board monitored business 
performance against that strategy, paying particular attention 
to the effects it had on employees and other stakeholders. 
The external evaluation gave the Board an opportunity to 
receive an objective assessment of its performance and 
effectiveness at a time when, more than ever, its role was 
crucial to the Company and its long term viability. The results 
of the evaluation are described on page 77. 
As always, the Board was supported in meeting its 
commitments by a number of committees to which it 
delegates certain of its responsibilities. Some of those 
committees were established at specific times to allow 
closer attention and analysis of key aspects of the 
Company’s business, such as the committee described 
above, or to finalise matters already discussed in detail by 
the entire Board. Other committees are more permanent  
in nature and are required to ensure the Company  
correctly applies the principles of the Code, and the roles, 
membership and activities during the year of these are 
summarised on pages 78- 109. Some decisions are 
sufficiently material that they can only be made by the  
Board as a whole. The schedule of ‘Matters Reserved for  
the Anglo American plc Board’, and the committees’ terms 
of reference, explain which matters are delegated and  
which are retained for Board approval, and these 
documents can be found online.

THE BOARD IN 2016 
Governance
 71 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
GOVERNANCE THE BOARD IN 2016 BOARD COMPOSITION
The Code requires that there is a clear division of 
responsibilities at the head of the Company between  
the running of the Board (one of the chairman’s key 
responsibilities) and the executive responsibility for the 
running of the Company’s business (the responsibility  
of the chief executive, Mark Cutifani). The chairman  
(Sir John Parker) is also responsible for leadership of the 
Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its 
role. The Code also recommends that there is a senior 
independent director to provide a sounding board for the 
chairman and to serve as an intermediary for the other 
directors when necessary. The senior independent director 
(Sir Philip Hampton) is available to shareholders if they  
have concerns when communications through the normal 
channels have failed to resolve the matter or when such 
contact is inappropriate. 
In addition to the roles outlined above, the Board currently 
comprises a further two executive directors and five 
additional independent non-executive directors, making  
a total of 10 directors. 
In 2016, two non-executive directors resigned, and one  
of these resignations (that of Judy Dlamini at the end of 
August) resulted in the Board’s composition falling below 
the Davies Report target of 25% female membership. 
Recruitment processes have been under way since late 
2016 resulting in the nomination of an additional female 
director for shareholders to vote on at the AGM in April.  
This appointment will ensure that the Board returns to  
having at least 25% female membership and retains  
two ethnically diverse directors. A separate process is 
targeting the recruitment of a non-executive director  
with project management and large construction skills 
alongside significant mining experience to further 
strengthen our Board. 
In respect of other measures of diversity, the Board has 
directors from Australia, France, Ireland, Lesotho, the UK, 
and the USA, with a broad range of professional experience 
as set out in the table below. 
In 2017, René Médori will retire from the Board and as 
finance director. Stephen Pearce is proposed for election  
at the AGM in April to succeed him. Stephen joined  
Anglo American as finance director designate and as a 
member of the GMC on 30 January 2017. His biography 
appears on page 70.
Following Sir John Parker’s decision to step down as 
chairman during the course of 2017, Sir Philip Hampton  
is leading the Nomination Committee’s process to identify  
a successor to the chairmanship. Sir John will continue to 
chair the Board until a successor is appointed.

 75 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 BOARD EVALUATION
In accordance with the Code, Independent Board Evaluation 
(IBE), an external consultancy with no other connection to 
the Company, conducted an external evaluation exercise  
at the end of 2015, the results of which are shown on the 
following page. A comprehensive brief was provided to  
IBE, together with supporting materials, prior to their 
attending Board and committee meetings. Detailed 
interviews were conducted with each of the directors, 
certain senior executives and representatives of the Group’s 
auditor, Deloitte. Feedback was provided to the chairman 
and the committee chairs and a report on the chairman was 
presented to the senior independent director. Overall, the 
Board was considered to be generally effective and well 
balanced, with some areas for improvement, including 
induction and risk management. The chairman conducted 
one-to-one interviews with each of the non-executive 
directors following the evaluation.
At the end of 2016, Board and committee members 
completed an online, questionnaire-based, internal 
evaluation of performance. The results of this evaluation  
will be reported in the 2017 Annual Report.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
The Company maintains an active engagement with its key 
financial audiences, including institutional shareholders and 
buy and sell-side analysts, as well as potential shareholders. 
The investor relations department manages the interaction 
with these audiences and regular presentations take place

the rest of the year. An active programme of communication 
with potential shareholders is also maintained. Any 
significant concerns raised by a shareholder in relation to  
the Company and its affairs are communicated to the Board. 
The Board is briefed on a regular basis by the investor 
relations department and analysts’ reports are circulated  
to the directors. Feedback from meetings held between 
executive management or the investor relations 
department, and institutional shareholders, is also 
communicated to the Board. 
During the year there were regular presentations to, and 
meetings with, institutional investors in the UK, South Africa, 
continental Europe and North America to communicate  
the strategy and performance of Anglo American, and an 
investor visit to the Jwaneng diamond mine in Botswana. 
Executive directors and key executives, including business 
unit heads, host such presentations, which include seminars 
for investors and analysts and one-on-one meetings. 
Throughout the year, executive management also presents  
at industry conferences that are mainly organised by 
investment banks for their institutional investor base. 
The Company’s website provides the latest news and 
historical financial information, details about forthcoming 
events for shareholders and analysts, and other information 
regarding Anglo American.

GOVERNANCE THE BOARD IN 2016 2015/16 BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE EVALUATION – ACTION PLAN
BOARD AND COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
AREAS IDENTIFIED FOR ACTION
Risk management processes should be reviewed to 
incorporate best practices from other sectors, including involving  
the Board in stress testing the combination of key risks, as per the 
preparation of the viability statement.  
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS IN 2016
The Audit and Sustainability Committees reviewed their  
respective risk management systems and recommended 
improvements to the Board. 
The use of more external input to strategy discussions 
as a way of sense-checking the data the Board is given and 
challenging assumptions should be considered.
The Board received external briefings on the macro-economic 
environment and on external perceptions of the Group’s strategy 
from its advisers. The views expressed were debated with the 
presenters, further considered by the Board and informed  
and influenced the decisions which were taken subsequently. 
Tracking of strategy execution was needed for the  
cost reduction programme and disposals plan by allocating 
accountability for the individual programmes, tracking key 
milestones, and reviewing progress regularly at Board meetings.
Tracking of cost-reduction targets and disposals was a regular 
agenda item for the Board in 2016, with designated executives 
attending to update the Board on progress of each workstream.  
This process will continue for the life of the items.
Contact between Board and business unit employees
should further improve, including the scheduling of ‘deep dives’ on  
key issues at Sustainability Committee, Audit Committee and 
Board meetings.
Board, Sustainability Committee and Audit Committee meetings  
are attended by employees from around the business, and Board 
members are invited to visit Group operations and are encouraged 
to meet with employees without management being present. The 
Board as a whole visit one operation each year, and these visits 
provide an opportunity for the Board to meet and interact with  
local management and other employees, both in meetings and at 
Board dinners. Additional meetings and visits outside of those 
scheduled are arranged if the directors think it would be useful to 
meet either specific individuals or employees in general. 
Communication of decisions to management and employees, 
especially those adversely affected by the cost reduction and 
disposals programme could be improved.  
The Group director – people and organisation briefed the Board on 
messaging and communication processes and messaging was  
kept under review to ensure that it was appropriate and respectful.
Director induction and onboarding could be enhanced, 
especially for new Board members who have not previously 
served on the board of a UK listed company. All Board members 
should have an individual, tailored induction plan.  
For new directors, the chairman and company secretary will  
work together to improve the tailored induction plan and monitor 
progress more frequently with the director concerned, adjusting  
the programme itself, and future programmes, to reflect any  
lessons learned. 
Review the Board skills matrix to ensure that the Board’s 
composition is appropriate and identify any skills gaps.
The skills matrix is used to identify areas in which aggregate  
Board experience could be improved and is used as part of the 
recruitment process for new Board members and non-executive 
succession planning. 
The Board and committee paper format should be used 
more widely to help with the effective management of meetings 
and decision making.
Without being overly prescriptive, standard templates are used  
to help authors and presenters structure their papers and 
presentations in a way that is helpful for the audience. This helps 
ensure that time allocated to individual items is used efficiently,  
and that the meeting focuses on the key areas for discussion or 
decision making.
Information flows from the Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees to the Board could be further improved with 
directors who do not serve on those committees receiving more 
information about their work.
The non-executive directors’ sessions (held after each Board 
meeting) are used to share confidential information and directors 
are encouraged to raise any queries with the relevant chairmen.  
All committee minutes are circulated to directors unless it is not 
appropriate to do so.

PROCESS USED IN RELATION TO BOARD 
APPOINTMENTS
The Board is committed to ensuring that it remains diverse  
in terms of gender and ethnicity. This includes targets of at 
least 25% of the directors being female and at least one (and 
preferably more) person of colour. At the date of this report, 
the Board’ s gender diversity target is not currently met, as a 
result of the resignation of Judy Dlamini in August 2016. 
Search processes for new non-executive directors aim to 
address this while securing the best possible candidates  
for the Board, regardless of gender. Spencer Stuart  
(South Africa) and Heidrick & Struggles are retained by  
the Committee to assist with these search processes. Both 
consultancies have worked for the Group in recruiting for 
senior appointments and were chosen for having the best 
understanding of the Board’ s requirements given the markets 
in which the most suitable candidates are likely to be found. 
Shortlisted candidates are generally interviewed by all 
members of the Committee and, where practical, other 
directors prior to Board approval.

Governance
 81 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 ENSURING INDEPENDENCE OF THE  
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
Anglo American’s policy on auditor’s independence is 
consistent with the ethical standards published by the  
Audit Practices Board.
A key factor that may impair an auditor’s independence is 
a lack of control over non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor. The external auditor’s independence is 
deemed to be impaired if the auditor provides a service that:
 • results in the auditor acting as a manager or employee  
of the Group
 • puts the auditor in the role of advocate for the Group
 • creates a mutuality of interest between the auditor and  
the Group.
Anglo American addresses this issue through three primary 
measures, namely:
 • disclosure of the extent and nature of non-audit services
 • the prohibition of selected services – this includes the 
undertaking of internal audit services
 • prior approval by the Audit Committee chairman of 
non-audit services where the cost of the proposed service 
is likely to exceed $50,000.
Anglo American’s policy on the provision of non-audit 
services is regularly reviewed and has been updated to reflect 
new regulations that became effective on 1 January 201 7 .  
The definition of prohibited non-audit services corresponds 
with the European Commission’s recommendations on the 
auditor’s independence and with the Ethical Standards  
issued by the Audit Practices Board in the UK.
Non-audit work is only undertaken where there is 
commercial sense in using the auditor without jeopardising 
audit independence. Non-audit fees represented 49% of 
the 2016 audit fee.
Other safeguards 
 • The external auditor is required to adhere to a rotation 
policy based on best practice and professional standards  
in the UK. The standard period for rotation of the audit 
engagement partner is five years and for any key audit 
partner, seven years. The audit engagement partner was 
appointed in 2015, and will rotate off at the end of the  
2019 audit in accordance with this requirement
 • Any partner designated as a key audit partner of 
Anglo American shall not be employed by Anglo American 
in a key management position unless a period of at least 
two years has elapsed since the conclusion of the last 
relevant audit
 • The external auditor is required to assess periodically 
whether in their professional judgement they are 
independent of the Group
 • The Audit Committee ensures that the scope of the auditor’s 
work is sufficient and that the auditor is fairly remunerated
 • The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditor
 • The Audit Committee has the authority to engage 
independent counsel and other advisers as they determine 
necessary to resolve issues on the auditor’s independence
 • An annual assessment is undertaken of the auditor’s 
effectiveness through a structured questionnaire and 
input from all business units and Group functions covering 
all aspects of the audit process.
Audit tender
Anglo American will undertake, at the latest, a tender  
and rotation of the audit appointment at the time of the 
rotation of the lead engagement partner which is due  
after completion of the 2019 audit. Deloitte has been the 
auditor since 1999.
Anglo American confirms compliance during the year  
with the provisions of the Competition and Markets  
Authority Order on mandatory tendering and audit 
committee responsibilities.
Conclusions of the Audit Committee for 2016
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself that the external 
auditor’s independence was not impaired. 
The Audit Committee held meetings with the external 
auditor without the presence of management on two 
occasions, and the chairman of the Audit Committee held 
regular meetings with the lead audit engagement partner 
during the year. 
Consideration given to the appointment of the 
external auditor 
The Audit Committee’s assessment of the external  
auditor’s performance and independence underpins its 
recommendation to the Board to propose to shareholders 
the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor until the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2018. Resolutions to authorise the 
Board to re-appoint and determine the remuneration of 
Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the AGM on 24 April 2017.
Risk management
Risk management is the responsibility of the Board and is 
integral to the achievement of our objectives. The Board 
establishes the system of risk management, setting risk 
appetite and maintaining the system of internal control to 
manage risk within the Group. The Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control are monitored by the  
Audit Committee under delegation from the Board.
The system of risk management is designed to ensure 
awareness of risks that threaten the achievement of 
objectives. The controls that mitigate those risks are 
identified so that assurance can be provided on the 
effectiveness of those controls and a determination can  
be made as to whether the risk is operating within the 
Group’s risk appetite. We seek to embed a culture of  
risk awareness into the development of our strategic  
and operational objectives. 
The process for identification and assessment of the 
principal risks combines a top-down and bottom-up 
approach. At the operations level, a process to identify  
all risks that prevent the achievement of objectives is 
undertaken. Detailed analysis of the material risks at  
each location is performed to ensure management 
understanding of the risk and controls that reduce likelihood 
of occurrence and impact should the risk materialise. These 
operational risk profiles contribute to the assessment of 
risks at the business unit level. Executive management at 
each business unit assess risks that threaten achievement  
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
82 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
GOVERNANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT of the business unit objectives and the status of controls,  
or actions, that mitigate those risks. At the Group level, risks 
are identified through assessment of global factors affecting 
the industry and the Group specifically, as well as the risks 
arising from the business unit assessments. Materiality  
of risk is determined through assessment of the various 
impacts that may arise and likelihood of occurrence. An 
exception relates to those risks deemed catastrophic in 
nature, where the focus of assessment is on impact and 
status of internal controls, given the very low likelihood of 
occurrence. When considering the impact of any risk, we 
assess financial, safety, environmental, legal or regulatory, 
social and reputational consequences.
The robust process of identifying and evaluating the 
principal risks is ongoing and was in place during 2016. 
Regular reports on the status of risks and controls are 
presented to executive management teams throughout the 
year. The Audit Committee reviews reports on the overall 
Anglo American risk profile on two occasions during the  
year and conducts in-depth reviews of specific risks during 
its meetings over the course of the year. Each principal  
risk is assigned to either the Board or the relevant Board 
committees to oversee executive management actions  
in response to that risk. The Audit Committee reviews that 
oversight process on an annual basis.
Details of the principal risks are provided on pages 42-45.
Risk appetite
We define risk appetite as ‘the nature and extent of risk  
that Anglo American is willing to accept in relation to the 
pursuit of its objectives’. Each principal risk is assessed as  
to whether it is operating within the limit of appetite for the 
Group based on review of the external factors influencing 
that risk, the status of management actions to mitigate or 
control the risk and the potential impact should the risk 
materialise. For risks operating beyond the limit of appetite, 
a change in strategy may be required. For risks operating 
within, but approaching the limit of, appetite, specific 
management actions may be required to ensure the risk 
remains within the limit of appetite. 
Risk management and the system of internal control
Controls either reduce the likelihood or impact of any risk 
once it has occurred and the identification of material 
controls – i.e. those controls that have the most influence  
in mitigating a risk – is an important input for audit planning.
The system of internal control operates on a traditional  
‘three lines of defence’ approach, with operating 
management implementing and monitoring controls  
on a day-to-day basis, and business unit or functional 
management providing a second line of defence through 
regular and frequent oversight of operating management’s 
implementation of controls. A centrally managed internal 
audit department provides the third line of defence by 
reviewing design and operating effectiveness of the  
internal control environment, which includes the work 
performed by the first and second lines of defence 
management teams. Internal audit operated in all of the 
Group’s managed businesses in 2016, reporting its work  
to executive management and the Audit Committee on a 
regular basis. The internal audit department’s mandate  
and annual audit coverage plans were approved by the  
Audit Committee. 
The scope of internal audit work covers the broad  
spectrum of risk that the Group is exposed to. The audit  
of controls associated with major operating/technical  
risks is undertaken in conjunction with relevant experts  
from the Technical and Sustainability function, the results 
of which were shared with the Sustainability Committee 
and Audit Committee.
In determining its opinion that the internal control 
environment was effective during 2016, the Audit 
Committee considered the following factors:
 • the results of internal audit work, including the response  
of management to completion of actions arising from  
audit work
 • the output of risk management work
 • the output of external audit work and other  
assurance providers
 • issues identified by management or reported through 
whistleblowing arrangements, and the results of 
investigations into allegations of breaches of our  
values and business principles.
Reviewing the effectiveness of the system  
of risk management and internal control
The Board, through the Audit Committee, fulfils its 
responsibility in reviewing the effectiveness of the system  
of risk management and internal control through review of 
reports submitted over the course of the year covering the 
risk management process, adequacy of the internal control 
environment, consideration of risk appetite, in-depth 
reviews of specific risks and the results of external audit 
work. The Sustainability Committee also reviews technical 
and safety risks in detail and reports its findings to the Board.
Whistleblowing programme
The Group has a whistleblowing facility operating in all  
its managed operations and a Group-wide stakeholder 
complaints and grievance procedure (see the 2016 
Sustainability Report for more details). The whistleblowing 
programme, which is monitored by the Audit Committee,  
is designed to enable employees, customers, suppliers, 
managers or other stakeholders to raise concerns on a 
confidential basis where conduct is deemed to be contrary  
to our values.
During 2016, 413 (2015: 388) reports were received via  
the global ‘Speak Up’ facility, covering a broad spectrum  
of concerns, including:
 • ethical
 • criminal
 • supplier relationships
 • health and safety
 • HR issues.
Reports received were anonymous to Anglo American. 
All received the appropriate attention and, where necessary, 
action was taken to address issues. A governance process 
is in place to ensure all reports are acted upon in a timely 
manner and actions completed where necessary.

 83 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 1.  INTRODUCTORY LETTER
Dear Shareholder,
The role of the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
(Committee) is to ensure that the remuneration 
arrangements for executive directors and other members 
of the Group Management Committee (GMC) offer them 
every encouragement to deliver our strategy and create 
stakeholder value in a sustainable and responsible manner. 
It is also our task to ensure that the remuneration received 
by the executive directors is proportionate to the levels of 
performance achieved and the returns received by you as 
shareholders. As a Committee, we therefore have to give full 
consideration to the Company’s strategy, its performance, 
your interests and the interests of the wider communities 
we affect. This is particularly pertinent in light of the volatility 
faced by the Company and by the mining industry more 
generally in recent years.
Pay for performance
As reported by the chief executive in his introduction to  
this year’s Annual Report, the actions taken across the 
business to drive free cash flow and further refine the 
portfolio enabled the Company to strengthen its financial 
position and foundations for the future. With the continued 
sharp focus on operational costs and volume growth, the 
business delivered $1.5 billion of in-year incremental cost  
and volume improvements, driving a 25% increase in 
underlying EBITDA and an increase in EBITDA margin  
of five percentage points to 26%. Underlying earnings per 
share (EPS) was $1.72/share. Net debt has been reduced 
to $8.5 billion from $12.9 billion at the end of 2015, primarily 
driven by a $3.5 billion increase in attributable free cash 
flow. ROCE was 1 1%.
The role of the Company’s Remuneration 
Committee is to ensure that the remuneration 
arrangements for executive directors offer  
every encouragement for them to deliver  
our strategy and create stakeholder value  
in a sustainable manner .
The performance of the business, up to and during  
2016, is reflected in the long and short term remuneration 
received by the executive directors. Specifically:
 • The executive directors’ salaries were frozen in 2016,  
to recognise the challenges faced by the Company at  
the beginning of the year. The Committee has decided to 
increase the executive directors’ salaries in 2017 by 2%. 
This increase is felt to be appropriate in the light of the 
directors’ contribution to the Company’s improved 
financial position over 2016, and is consistent with the 
increase awarded to the general UK employee population. 
 • Strong operational improvements, supported by 
favourable bulks prices and foreign exchange (FX) rates 
and a recovery in De Beers’ sales volumes have supported 
the material outperformance on EPS targets. However, 
without the tailwind from changes in prices and FX rates, 
EPS would have still been above the maximum vesting 
target, reflecting management’s strong delivery in the year. 
Combined with strong personal performance, this resulted 
in higher annual bonus outcomes than in 2015. Safety 
performance during the year led to an overall modifier  
of (0.5)%, which incorporates the maximum deduction  
in respect of the very disappointing increase in fatalities  
in 2016. This led to overall bonus outcomes of between 
84.7% and 87.5% of maximum opportunity. The 
Committee has carefully reviewed the bonus outcomes 
and is satisfied that they are appropriate. A full explanation 
can be found on page 99. 
 • The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards granted  
in 2014 will not vest, as neither the three-year Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) nor the ROCE targets  
were met.
2017 remuneration policy
The remuneration policy disclosed in section 2 of this  
report has been revised during the year and will be put  
to shareholders for approval at the 2017 AGM, in line with 
normal timescales. In preparing the policy, the Committee 
was mindful of the complexities of setting remuneration 
against the backdrop of volatility in the mining sector. The 
Committee also took into consideration the feedback 
received from some shareholders in advance of the 2016 
AGM, as well as the relatively low level of support received 
for the 2015 remuneration report in comparison to  
previous years. In particular, we were determined to address 
investors’ concerns about the potential windfall gains  
for executive directors arising as a result of the volatility  
of the Company’s share price and the mining industry  
more generally.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
84 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION  
REPORT The Committee undertook a thorough and detailed 
consultation with our major shareholders in relation to 
these changes. Views as to specific remuneration items 
are inevitably diverse, particularly given the global  
spread of our shareholder base and the sometimes 
different perspectives of, for example, UK and South 
African shareholders. However, we are confident that  
we have created a remuneration policy that balances  
the needs and expectations of management and 
shareholders, is fair and robust, links directly to the 
Company’s strategy and gives the Committee greater 
ability to deal with volatility.
Executive director changes
Stephen Pearce joined the Company in January 2017,  
and will be proposed for election to the Board as finance 
director at the 2017 AGM. 
As previously disclosed, his remuneration package 
comprises:
 • Annual base salary of £775,000
 • Annual bonus and LTIP participation consistent with  
the Company’s remuneration policy
 • Compensation for incentives forfeited from his previous 
employer, including a performance-related cash bonus  
of up to £300,000 payable in 2017, and 382,235 
performance-related share awards granted in three 
tranches vesting over 2017, 2018 and 2019
 • Other benefits including pension, medical insurance  
and relocation from Australia to the UK.
Full details will be included in the 2017 remuneration  
report. René Médori will step down from his current 
position as finance director at the 2017 AGM, and will 
continue to work for the Company until the end of 2017, 
when he will retire, to provide continuation in the transition 
and focus on specific projects. 
Report layout
Finally, the Committee has taken the opportunity to  
make some changes to the layout and design of both the 
policy and the implementation reports, including adding  
an ‘At a Glance’ section directly after this letter. We hope 
these changes make the Company’s remuneration  
strategy and outcomes more easily digestible.
I very much hope you will support our proposed 
remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM.
Sir Philip Hampton 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
While we believe that the fundamental structure of the 
remuneration package is appropriate, we have made a 
number of changes to the previous remuneration policy 
which are primarily designed to address the issue of 
volatility, while also directly addressing the concerns raised 
by shareholders in relation to the 2016 grant levels: 
 • Continue the use of EPS as a KPI for short term incentives, 
as the Committee considers it to be appropriate in 
measuring annual business performance. However, the 
measure will be split into two; half of the award will be 
measured on actual results versus the original budget, and 
the other half will be measured excluding the impact of 
quoted commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations. 
The Committee considers that this change will help 
smooth volatility and result in outcomes which provide  
a better balance between items within management’s 
control and those outside it. This is explained further on 
page 90
 • The performance conditions to be applied to LTIP awards 
from 2017 onwards will incorporate a greater emphasis 
(70%) on TSR, recognising two challenges of identifying 
financial targets. First, the mining sector is subject to 
significant earnings volatility driven by uncontrollable 
factors. Secondly, while driving controllable performance, 
there is a need to continue to align management rewards 
with shareholder returns to a greater extent. The remaining 
30% of LTIP awards from 2017 will be subject to a 
balanced scorecard of financial and strategic measures. 
Further details can be found on page 106
 • Reduce the maximum annual LTIP opportunity for  
the chief executive from 350% to 300% of basic salary, 
bringing it into line with the other executive directors  
and moderating the value that may be received from 
future LTIP awards 
 • Introduce a cap on the value that can be received  
from LTIP awards, both past and future. The maximum 
combined value that can vest in relation to the 2014,  
2015 and 2016 LTIP awards is limited to the sum of the 
total face value of the 2014-2016 awards at grant, with 
any value above that level being forfeit before the start of  
the two-year holding period. For the chief executive, this 
limit is £13.1 million. From 2017 onwards, the value of 
LTIP awards at the time of vesting, using the share price 
at the time, will be limited to twice the face value of the 
award at grant; in exceptional circumstances amounts 
earned above twice the face value of the award may  
be deferred at the discretion of the Committee. Further 
details can be found on pages 91 and 107.

88 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Figure 1: Key aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors
Basic salary Purpose
To recruit and retain high-calibre executives.
Operation
Basic salary levels are reviewed annually by the 
Committee, taking account of Company performance, 
individual performance, levels of increase for the broader 
UK population and inflation.
Reference may also be made to median levels  
within relevant FTSE 50 and natural resources 
companies. Alternative peer groups may be  
considered as appropriate.
The Committee also considers the impact of any basic 
salary increase on the total remuneration package.
Increases awarded each year will be set out in the 
statement of implementation of policy.
Maximum opportunity
Maximum increase of 5% of salary per annum. 
Assessment of performance
Individual performance is considered for context when 
considering any salary increases awarded.
Discretion
There may be occasions when the Committee needs  
to recognise, for example, development in role, change  
in responsibility and/or specific retention issues.  
External factors such as sustained high inflation may  
also be a consideration.
In these circumstances, the Committee may offer a higher 
annual increase, the rationale for which will be explained  
to shareholders in the relevant remuneration report.
2. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
2.1 Future policy table
The Company’s remuneration policy, as set out in the  
2013 Annual Report and Accounts, received approval  
from shareholders at the AGM held on 24 April 2014. 
The Company intended that this policy should apply until  
the Company’s 2017 AGM.
As required, the Company will put the new remuneration 
policy, as set out on the following pages, to shareholders  
for a binding vote at the AGM on 24 April 2017. The intention 
is that the revised policy, if approved, will apply until the 
Company’s 2020 AGM.
The table below sets out the key components of executive 
directors’ pay packages, including the rationale for use and 
practical operation considerations. 
 89 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Governance Figure 1: Key aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors
Annual bonus Purpose
To encourage and reward delivery of the Company’s  
strategic priorities.
To help ensure, through the share-based elements, that  
any resulting performance is sustained over the longer 
term in line with shareholder interests.
Operation
Each year, executive directors participate in the annual 
bonus, which rewards EPS, individual performance 
targets and improvements in safety over the full year.  
Part of the award is deferred into Bonus Shares under  
the Company’s BSP .
The EPS measure has been chosen as it continues to  
link reward to the delivery of earnings and returns to 
shareholders. The EPS targets are set each year to 
ensure they are demanding yet realistic. Consideration  
is given to internal budgets and price expectations  
for the year, as well as prior performance and  
external expectations.
The individual objectives measure was chosen to  
provide a balance and reflect management’s underlying 
activity towards delivering the Company’s strategy 
regardless of price or other volatility. The individual 
objectives are based on the Company’s strategic priorities 
for the year and will be fully disclosed in the relevant 
remuneration report.
Form and timing of payment
 • 40%: cash award at end of year
 • 40%: Bonus Shares vesting three years after  
end of bonus year
 • 20%: Bonus Shares vesting five years after  
end of bonus year.
Dividends are paid on Bonus Shares.
Malus and clawback 
The Committee is able to reduce any unvested Bonus 
Share awards, or future awards in the event of a material 
misstatement in the Company’s results, misconduct or a 
material failing in risk management processes that has 
given, or is likely to give, rise to significant and lasting 
value destruction for the Company.
Maximum opportunity
210% of salary.
Assessment of performance
At least 50% – EPS. The final performance measurement 
will be 50% based on actual prices and FX rates, and 50% 
based on fixed prices and FX rates.
Up to 50% – scorecard of measures based on individual 
objectives linked to the Company’s strategic priorities  
and safety. 
A modifier to the above is applied depending on the extent 
to which safety targets are met.
Where relevant, targets will be disclosed retrospectively  
as they are considered to be commercially sensitive.
Outcome at threshold
EPS: 25% of award portion.
Discretion
Under the BSP Rules, the Company has the standard 
discretion to take appropriate action in the event of 
unforeseen events which affect the Bonus Shares  
(for example, on a variation in share capital) and to settle  
the Bonus Shares in cash (for example, on a termination).
Should circumstances change such that EPS is no longer 
considered to be the most appropriate financial measure, 
the Committee retains the discretion to replace EPS with 
one or more alternative financial measures. Full details of 
any such change would be given in the relevant 
remuneration report.
Changes from policy agreed at the 2014 AGM
A change to the measurement of targets is proposed. 
Currently, assessment of performance against financial 
targets set as part of the annual bonus is at actual prices and 
FX rates only. It is proposed that, from 2017 onwards, 50% 
of the payout be based on performance at actual prices and 
FX rates, and 50% on performance adjusted to fixed prices 
and FX rates. The Committee believes that this approach will 
help smooth potential volatility and also make annual bonus 
payouts a fairer reflection of underlying performance. 
GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
90 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Figure 1: Key aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(LTIP)
Purpose
T o encourage and reward the generation of long term 
sustainable shareholder returns and the delivery of 
financial/strategic priorities.
Operation
The Committee makes an annual conditional award of 
shares to each executive director.
The TSR measures have been selected to reflect the extent 
to which value is being delivered to shareholders, and the 
balanced scorecard to reflect the Company’s financial and 
strategic priorities.
Each year, the Committee reviews the performance  
targets prior to grant. The relative TSR targets are set so 
that only a quarter of the relevant portion of the award is 
payable for index/median performance, while maximum 
vesting requires exceptional relative performance.
The balanced scorecard will be based on a small number  
of measurable financial and/or strategic performance 
indicators. The measures may vary each year to reflect the 
Company’s financial and/or strategic priorities and will be 
set out in the statement of implementation in the year of 
grant to the extent that they are not commercially sensitive. 
Dividend equivalents are paid on any shares that vest.
In order to mitigate potential excessive gains brought about 
by the volatile nature of the mining industry, the value that 
can be delivered on an award vesting will be limited to twice 
the face value of the award on grant. Any gains above this 
level will be forfeit before the start of the two-year holding 
period or, in exceptional circumstances and at the 
Committee’s discretion, deferred for a further period. 
Performance period
Three years.
Additional holding period
Two years.
Malus and clawback
The Committee is able to reduce any unvested awards, 
vested awards subject to a holding period or future grants 
in the event of a material misstatement in the Company’s 
results, misconduct or a material failing in risk management 
processes that has given, or is likely to give, rise to 
significant and lasting value destruction for the Company.
Maximum opportunity
300% of salary.
The value that can be received in the year of vesting will  
be limited to twice the face value of the award at grant,  
with any value above that level being forfeit or, in exceptional 
circumstances and at the Committee’s discretion, deferred  
for a further period. 
Performance measures
70%: TSR relative to sector index and leading UK-listed  
comparator companies.
30%: Balanced scorecard of key performance indicators, 
linking to the Company’s KPIs.
Vesting at threshold
TSR: 25% of award portion.
Balanced scorecard: 25% of award portion.
Discretion
The Committee does not intend to make adjustments to the 
method by which it measures L TIP performance conditions 
(see page 106). However, it reserves the discretion to make 
adjustments to outcomes in very exceptional circumstances, 
whether related to internal or external factors (for example,  
on a sequestration of assets). Shareholders would be given 
details of any exercise of this discretion in the relevant 
remuneration report.
Under the L TIP Rules, the Company also has the standard 
discretion to take appropriate action in the event of 
unforeseen events during an award cycle (for example, on  
a variation in share capital) and to settle the awards in cash 
(for example, on a termination).
The Committee may, in exceptional circumstances, allow  
the value delivered in the year of vesting to be above the limit 
described under ‘Operation’ and ‘Maximum opportunity’. 
Should this discretion be applied, consideration would be 
given to deferring any gains above the normal limit for an 
extended time period. In addition, the Committee would take 
account of the Company’s overall financial performance, the 
magnitude of commodity and share price movements and 
overall remuneration outcomes in recent years. The exercise 
of any such discretion would be fully explained in the relevant 
remuneration report.
Changes from policy agreed at the 2014 AGM
Reduction in maximum opportunity for the chief executive 
officer from 350% to 300% of salary. 
Changes to the performance measures and a limit on the 
value that can be delivered from future awards are proposed. 
The performance measures set out above will replace the 
previous measures (50% TSR and 50% ROCE).
Pension Purpose
To offer market-competitive levels of pension provision.
Operation
Executive directors participate in defined contribution 
pension arrangements.
Executive directors have the option for contributions which 
may not be paid to a UK-registered pension scheme as a 
result of HMRC limits (either annual allowance or lifetime 
allowance) to be treated as if paid to an unregistered 
unfunded retirement benefit scheme (a UURBS). 
Executive directors may request a pension allowance to  
be paid in place of defined contribution arrangements.
Maximum opportunity
30% of basic salary.
 91 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Governance Figure 1: Key aspects of the remuneration policy for executive directors
SAYE/SIP Purpose
As UK employees, UK-based executive directors are 
eligible to participate in the Company's Save As You  
Earn (SAYE) scheme and SIP .
Operation
The plans are registered with HMRC and do not have 
performance conditions.
Other benefits Purpose
To provide market-competitive benefits. 
Operation
The Company provides the following ongoing benefits:
 • 28 days’ leave and encashment of any accumulated 
leave in excess of 20 days
 • car-related benefits
 • medical insurance
 • death and disability insurance
 • directors’ liability insurance
 • limited personal taxation and financial advice
 • club membership
 • other ancillary benefits, including attendance at  
relevant public events.
In addition, the Company pays additional benefits  
when specific business circumstances require it,  
including costs and allowances related to relocation  
and international assignments.
The Company reimburses all necessary and reasonable 
business expenses.
Maximum opportunity
Capped at 10% of salary.
Discretion
The Committee reserves the discretion to exceed the 
ongoing maximum level for certain situation-specific 
benefits, such as relocation. Full details of the exercise  
of any such discretion will be provided to shareholders  
in the following remuneration report.
Changes from policy agreed at 2014 AGM
Clarification that directors’ liability insurance is included  
in the list of benefits.
Figure 2: Recruitment and promotion arrangements
Purpose 
To secure the appointment and promotion of  
high-calibre executives. 
Operation
The remuneration arrangements for a newly recruited  
or promoted executive director will reflect the 
remuneration policy in place for executive directors at  
the time of the appointment. The arrangements will 
therefore comprise basic salary, annual bonus, LTIP 
awards, benefits, pension and SAYE/SIP on the bases  
set out above.
The initial basic salary level for a newly recruited or 
promoted executive director will be set to reflect the 
individual’s experience, salary levels within the Company 
and market levels. Where basic salary is set below the 
level that might be expected, given the executive’s  
relative inexperience, and the executive then develops 
successfully into the role, the Committee has the 
discretion to give a salary increase in the year(s) after 
appointment above the standard maximum level of 5%. 
For external appointments, the Committee may also  
offer additional cash and/or share-based elements
(including in-flight LTIPs) to replace any remuneration 
forfeited, when it considers this to be in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. The terms of any 
share-based elements offered will reflect the nature, time 
horizons and performance requirements of remuneration 
forfeited and will have equivalent performance conditions 
attached. Shareholders will be informed of any such 
payments at the time of appointment. If necessary, the 
Company can go outside of existing plans as currently 
permitted under the Listing Rules.
Pensions for new hires will be set at a level commensurate 
with the wider workforce, and will be no greater than 25% 
of salary.
For internal appointments, any commitments made 
before appointment and not relating to appointment are 
allowed to pay out according to their terms. For external 
and internal appointments, the Committee may agree

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
92 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 Figure 3: Key aspects of the remuneration policy for non-executive directors
Chairman –  
Fees
Purpose
To attract and retain a high-  
calibre chairman by offering a 
market-competitive fee level.
Maximum increase 
Equivalent to annual increase  
of 5% of fee level. 
Operation
The chairman is paid a single fee for all of his responsibilities. The level of this fee is 
reviewed every two to three years by the Committee and chief executive, with reference 
to UK market levels (FTSE 50 companies), and a recommendation is then made to the 
Board (in the absence of the chairman).
Fees are paid in cash, with the flexibility to forgo all or part of the net fees to acquire 
shares in the Company. 
Chairman –  
Benefits
Purpose
To provide market-competitive 
benefits.
Maximum benefits
£35,000. 
Operation
The chairman is provided with medical insurance and reasonable use of a car and driver. 
Reasonable and necessary expenses are reimbursed.
Changes from policy agreed at the 2014 AGM
Maximum benefits increased from £30,000 to £35,000 to allow for expected changes 
to UK tax rates on car and fuel benefits through to 2020.
Non-executive 
directors –  
Fees
Purpose
To attract and retain high-calibre 
non-executive directors by 
offering market-competitive fees.
Maximum increase for each 
type of fee 
Equivalent to annual increase  
of 5% of fee level. 
Operation
The non-executives are paid a basic fee. The chairmen of the main Board committees 
and the senior independent director are paid an additional fee to reflect their extra 
responsibilities. These fee levels are reviewed every few years by the chairman and 
executive directors, with reference to UK market levels (FTSE 50 companies), and a 
recommendation is then made to the Board.
Fees are paid in cash with the flexibility to forgo all or part of the net fees to acquire 
shares in the Company.
Reasonable and necessary expenses are reimbursed.
Other fees/
payments
Purpose
To have the flexibility to provide 
additional fees/benefits if 
required. This may include the 
introduction of committee 
membership fees.
Maximum additional/
committee fee
£30,000.
Operation
The Company has the discretion to pay an additional fee, up to the equivalent of the 
committee chairmanship fee (currently £30,000), to a non-executive director should 
the Company require significant additional time commitment in exceptional or 
unforeseen circumstances. 
Base fees have not been increased since 2010. It is therefore the Board’s intention to 
review fee levels and structures during 2017 with a view to determining any necessary 
changes. Such changes may include, for example, the introduction of committee 
membership fees. 
Changes from policy agreed at the 2014 AGM
Additional flexibility is proposed to be incorporated to allow for the possible introduction 
of committee membership fees.
2.2  Supplementary information
2.2.1 Shareholding targets
Within five years of appointment, executive directors are 
expected to hold Company shares with a value of three 
times basic salary in respect of the chief executive and two 
times basic salary in respect of other executive directors. 
The Committee takes into consideration achievement 
against these targets when making grants under the 
Company’s various incentive plans.
2.2.2 Policy in rest of company
The remuneration arrangements for the executive directors 
outlined in Figure 1 are consistent with those for other 
executives serving on the GMC, although opportunity  
levels vary. The majority of our employees are located in 
South Africa and South America, and the remuneration 
arrangements of these employees are aligned to local 
market practices and levels.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
96 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 2.5 Development of directors’ remuneration policy
In developing and reviewing the Company’s remuneration 
policy for executive directors and other senior executives, 
the Committee is receptive to the views of shareholders and 
sensitive to the relationship between the arrangements for 
executive directors and those for other employee groups. 
Specifically:
 • in 2016- 17, in developing the revised remuneration  
policy, the Committee chairman undertook a consultation 
with major shareholders, incorporating feedback as 
appropriate. In particular, the Committee has responded  
to concerns raised in relation to the possibility of windfall 
gains from the 2016 LTIP awards by introducing a cap  
on the value that can be received from these awards on 
vesting. The Committee also listens to and takes into 
consideration investor views and comments throughout 
the year
 • each year the Committee also reviews in detail how  
the arrangements for the executive directors compare  
to those for other members of the GMC to ensure an 
appropriate relationship and to support career 
development and succession.
Given the geographic spread of the Company’s workforce, 
the Committee does not consider that consulting with 
employees on the remuneration policy for directors  
is a sensible use of resources. Many of the Company’s 
UK-based employees are shareholders, through the  
SAYE and SIP schemes, and they, like other shareholders, 
are able to express their views on directors’ remuneration  
at each general meeting.
Figure 6: Policy on change in control 
Incentive plan 
provisions  
relating to  
change of  
control (without

Bonus Shares
The Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released.
LTIP awards
The number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which  
the applicable performance conditions have been met at the time of the change of control.
Vested LTIP awards subject to holding period
LTIP awards will be released.
2.6 Payments under previous policies
The Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of office, 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set 
out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed  
(i) under a previous policy, in which case the provisions of 
that policy shall continue to apply until such payments have 
been made; (ii) before the policy or the relevant legislation 
came into effect; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual 
was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a director of the Company. For these 
purposes, ‘payments’ includes the satisfaction of awards of 
variable remuneration and, in relation to awards of shares, 
the terms of the payment which are agreed at the time the 
award is granted.
2.7 Changes from previous policy
The chairman’s letter, beginning on page 84, describes  
the main changes that the Committee has made to the 
remuneration policy that was approved at the 2014 AGM.  
These changes are also described in the relevant section  
of the policy table.

3.1.3 Annual bonus outcomes for 2016
Figure 10 shows the annual bonus outcomes for 2016. 
Figure 12 summarises the individual objectives for the  
2016 annual bonus for Mark Cutifani, René Médori and  
Tony O’Neill, performance achieved and the resulting  
outcomes. 
The Committee reviewed the annual EPS targets set at  
the beginning of 2016 and, in light of the severity of the  
falls in commodity prices, the negative price outlook at  
the start of 2016 and the launch of the Company’s cash 
improvement programme, decided to set threshold 
performance expectations at $0.00/share with maximum 
vesting at $0.50/share. 25% vesting would take place with 
performance at threshold. While stretching at the time, a 
progressive recovery in commodity prices since the middle 
of the year, coupled with strong delivery on cost and volume 
improvements and cash generation from management 
actions, meant that the earnings element of the annual 
bonus has been fully achieved. 
If performance had been measured excluding FX and price 
movements in line with the methodology introduced for 
2017 bonuses, and normalising for one-off tax adjustments, 
EPS would have been above the maximum vesting target at 
$0.53/share, reflecting the strong delivery of management 
in the year. 
The executives’ individual objectives were set at the start  
of the year and reflect the Company’s strategic priorities for 
the year. Each category contained between one and five 
specific objectives, incorporating a combination of 
quantitative and qualitative metrics. At the end of the  
year, the Committee made a detailed assessment of 
performance against each objective, leading to the 
evaluations shown in Figure 12. 
Assessment of Group safety performance in 2016 operated 
through both additive and deductive component measures. 
Figure 1 1 sets out the outcome in each category, resulting in 
a net modifier of (0.5)%. The very disappointing increase in 
fatalities in 2016 led to the maximum possible FIFR 
deduction being applied.

Critical tasks are identified in each of the performance categories at the start of the year. These form the basis of measurement, but are  
overlaid with an assessment of executive performance in the round in the relevant category. The assessment for 2016 took place against  
a backdrop of significant and successful restructuring and transformation, cost saving, production growth, efficiency improvements and  
improved stakeholder relationships. 
The personal performance outcomes set out above, combined with maximum EPS achievement and the safety modifier of (0.5)%, have 
generated overall bonus outcomes of 87.5%, 84.7% and 87.1%. When applied to the maximum bonus of 210% of salary, these performance 
outcomes translate into bonuses of £2,316,573, £1,430,383 and £1,441,239 for the chief executive, finance director and technical director 
respectively.
40% of the total bonus is payable in cash, with 60% deferred into Bonus Shares. Two-thirds of the Bonus Shares will vest after three years,  
subject to continued employment; the remaining third will vest after five years.

In 2014, Mark Cutifani, René Médori and Tony O’Neill 
received LTIP grants of 285,733, 156,222 and 153,071 
conditional shares respectively, with vesting subject to: 
(a) the Company’s TSR performance relative to:
(i) the Euromoney Global Mining Index; and  
(ii) FTSE 100 constituents over the three-year period  
to 31 December 2016; and 
(b) Driving Value ROCE to 31 December 2016.
Figure 13 sets out further details of the measures and the 
Company’s performance against each, resulting in an overall 
vesting level of zero. 
The LTIP amounts shown in last year’s report in respect of 
the LTIPs granted in 2013 were calculated on an ‘expected’ 
basis with an assumed share price of £4.73. The actual 
share price at vesting was £5.08, leading to the following 
increases in value: 
Mark Cutifani – estimated value £778,000;  
actual value £820,000 (increase of £42,000).
René Médori – estimated value £373,000;

for 2016 include a cash allowance of £317,000  
(2015: £297,000) and £208,000 (2015: £93,000), 
respectively
 • The total amount of pension contributions treated  
as having been paid into the UURBS for 2016 were  
£241,000 for René Médori (2015: £241,000)
 • Contributions treated as being paid into the UURBS  
earn a return equivalent to the Company’s pre-tax sterling 
nominal cost of debt, capped at a rate determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. The total return earned in  
2016 was £90,000 for René Médori (2015: £73,000)
 • As at 31 December 2016, the total balance due to 
executive directors in relation to the UURBS was 
£1,976,000 for René Médori (2015: £1,644,000). 
Retirement benefits can only be drawn from the  
UURBS if a member has attained age 55 and has  
left Group service.

3.1.6 External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external 
directorships or offices without the prior approval of the 
Board. If approved, they may each retain the fees payable 
from only one such appointment.
In the year, in addition to his basic salary, René Médori 
retained fees amounting to £82,000 in respect of one 
external directorship.
3.2 Other director remuneration in 2016
3.2.1 Non-executive director remuneration
Figure 15 sets out the remuneration paid to the  
non-executive directors of the Company in 2016.  
Fees shown include any additional fees paid in  
respect of chairmanships of committees or other  
roles such as senior independent director.
3.2.2 Payments for past directors
In addition to retirement benefits, the Company continues  
to provide seven former executive directors with private 
medical insurance arrangements. The annual cost to  
the Company is minimal. The Committee continues to  
meet these longstanding commitments but no new 
commitments have been made recently or will be made  
in future. There were no other payments to past directors 
during 2016.

Governance 3.3 Scheme interests granted during 2016
The information in this section has been subject to  
external audit.
Figure 16 summarises the longer term, conditional share 
awards granted to executive directors during 2016.  
Receipt of these awards is dependent on the Company’s 
performance over 2016- 18 and to the maximum vesting 
value imposed by the Committee, as detailed below. 
The value of Bonus Shares awarded to directors in respect 
of 2016 is included in the annual performance bonus figures, 
set out in Figure 10. They are also included in Figure 17.
3.4 Total interests in shares
Figure 17 summarises the total interests of the directors  
in shares of Anglo American plc as at 31 December 2016. 
These include beneficial and conditional interests, and 
shareholdings of their connected persons. 
As already disclosed, Mark Cutifani is expected to hold 
interests in shares to a value of three times basic salary  
(built up over five years) and René Médori and Tony O’Neill 
to a value of two times salary. At the date of preparation of 
this report, Mark Cutifani, René Médori and Tony O’Neill 
have net shareholdings (including Bonus Shares) equal  
to 430%, 587%, and 310% of basic salary, respectively.

The face value of each award has been calculated using the share price at time of grant (£4.44 for the LTIP awards). As receipt of these awards is conditional on performance, the actual value of these awards 
may be nil. In addition, the maximum value that may be received in the year of vesting of the awards granted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 is limited for each executive director to the combined face value of the 2014, 
2015 and 2016 awards. Any value over this level will be forfeit. Vesting outcomes will be disclosed in the 2018 remuneration report.

acquisition of shares under the SIP . Their total holdings therefore increased to 2,081,61 1 and 1,283,385 respectively.
 105 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Governance 3.5 Statement of implementation of policy in 2017
The Company’s policy on executive director remuneration 
for 2017 is summarised in the policy statements in Figure 1. 
Figure 18 summarises how that policy will be implemented 
in 2017. It is the Company’s intention that the fees for 
non-executive directors will remain at their 2016 levels for 
the first half of 2017, following which they will be reviewed. 
The EPS performance range for 2017 is considered by  
the Board to be commercially sensitive, although it will  
be disclosed in the 2017 remuneration report.
As set out on page 91, changes to the previous LTIP 
performance targets are proposed to apply from 2017; 
vesting of 70% of the 2017 award will be subject to the 
achievement of TSR conditions, and the remaining 30%  
to a balanced scorecard of financial and strategic measures. 
For the 201 7 balanced scorecard, ROCE (10%) has been 
selected to maintain focus on disciplined capital allocation.  
An attributable free cash flow target (10%) is being 
introduced as a new measure. This links management’s 
remuneration outcomes directly to the Company’s goal  
of reducing net debt through cash generation, thereby 
maintaining the Group’s net debt/EBITDA ratio below 1.5.

T ony O’Neill 300% of salary
The remaining 10% of the balanced scorecard for  
2017 will be based on emissions reduction (5%) and 
occupational disease prevention (5%), directly reflecting 
two pillars of value. Following the overwhelming  
shareholder support for the ‘Aiming for A’ resolution  
at the 2016 AGM, the Committee strongly believes that 
management’s incentives should be linked to achievement 
of the Company’s public commitment to reducing CO
2
 
emissions by 22% by 2020, as measured against the 
business as usual case. Linking the remaining 5% of the 
2017 LTIP award to a 10% reduction in inhalable hazards by 
the end of 2019 (as measured against a certified industrial 
hygienist approved baseline) reflects the Group’s ongoing 
commitment to the prevention of occupational disease.
The three-year cumulative attributable free cash flow  
target within the LTIP is also considered by the Board  
to be commercially sensitive; disclosing it would enable 
competitors to derive information as to our detailed business 
plan. The actual targets, along with the outcomes, will be 
disclosed in the 2019 remuneration report. The definition  
of attributable free cash flow can be found on page 189. 
Further details of the individual performance targets for  
201 7 will be included in the 201 7 remuneration report.
GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
106 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 3.5.1 Outstanding LTIP awards
The previous LTIP structure, in the context of the volatile 
nature of the mining industry, brought with it the potential  
for windfall gains where awards were granted at a relatively 
low share price. 
The Committee has therefore imposed a limit on the value 
that can be delivered on vesting for recent awards. The 
delivered value for the awards granted in 2014, 2015 and 
2016 will be limited to 100% of the total face value (number 
of shares granted multiplied by share price on grant) of the 
awards granted over these three years. Any value over and 
above this limit will be forfeit.
3.6 Remuneration disclosures
3.6.1 Eight-year remuneration and returns
Figure 19 shows the Company’s TSR performance against 
the performance of the FTSE 100 Index from 1 January 
2009 to 31 December 2016. The FTSE 100 Index was 
chosen as being a broad equity market index which  
includes companies of a comparable size and complexity  
to Anglo American. 
TSR is calculated in US dollars, and assumes all dividends 
are reinvested. The TSR level shown as at 31 December 
each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for 
the five-day period up to and including that date.
Figure 20 shows the total remuneration earned by the 
incumbent chief executive over the same eight-year period, 
along with the proportion of maximum opportunity earned 
in relation to each type of incentive. The total amounts are 
based on the same methodology as for Figure 7. 
For the period 2010 to 201 1, the TSR performance of the 
Company, and the remuneration received by Cynthia Carroll 
as chief executive, demonstrates that this was a period of 
strong operational performance and high commodity 
prices. These led to a doubling of profits and almost a 
doubling of underlying EPS in 2010. 
Cynthia Carroll’s remuneration levels in 201 1 also reflect 
record profits and strong EPS performance for the year 
in addition to the increase in value of the LTIP awards that 
vested at the end of 201 1 – when granted, the Company’s 
share price was £12.61; the share price at vesting 
was £26.00. 
The vesting levels of long term incentives from 2012  
have been much lower, reflecting, in part, the impact of  
the severe decline in commodity prices on earnings and  
the returns delivered to shareholders. 
Mark Cutifani’s remuneration levels in 2013 and 2014  
are not reflective of his underlying remuneration, given  
that he received a compensatory share award in 2013  
and compensation for tax on relocation benefits in  
2014. The impact of longer term incentives was only  
realised in 2015 as a consequence of the vesting of the  
2013 LTIP award.

concerns expressed by a number of 
shareholders in relation to executive 
remuneration in 2015, particularly 
around LTIP awards granted in  
March 2016. Setting executive 
remuneration in a volatile industry, 
such as mining, can be challenging 
and the Committee has actively 
engaged with shareholders in order 
to refine the revised policy to ensure 
that it is both appropriate and 
motivational.

By order of the Board
Mark Cutifani René Médori
Chief Executive Finance Director
20 February 2017
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS regulation, and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’. The directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
 • state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1  
requires that directors:
 • properly select and apply accounting policies
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance
 • make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions, disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF ANGLO AMERICAN PLC
Opinion on financial statements of Anglo American plc
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of the 
Group’s profit and the Parent Company’s loss for the year then ended;
 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 • the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
 • the Consolidated Income Statement;
 • the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;
 • the Consolidated Balance Sheet;
 • the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
 • the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity;
 • the Accounting Policies; 
 • the related notes 1 to 40; and 
 • the Balance Sheet of the Parent Company and related information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Going concern and the directors’ assessment of the principal 
risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting 
contained within note 39 to the financial statements and the directors’ 
statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the 
strategic report on page 40.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 • the directors’ confirmation on page 40 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 • the disclosures on pages 41 to 45 that describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
 • the directors’ statement in note 39 to the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months 
from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
 • the directors’ explanation on page 40 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting and we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, 
because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is 
not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
We confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also 
confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services 
referred to in those standards.  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 113
Financial statements
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These risks are consistent with those identified last year. 
Risk description How the scope of our audit responded to the risk Key observations
Impairment (notes 1 and 6)
As a consequence of continued volatility in 
commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, the 
assessment of the recoverable amount of operating 
assets and development projects remains a key 
judgement. 
This includes the coal operations in Australia (where 
a pre-tax impairment of $1.2 billion has been 
recorded) as well as other specific assets including 
the Sishen mine operations and the Minas-Rio 
project where impairments had previously been 
recorded.
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether 
indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist for assets 
including the coal operations in Australia, the Sishen mine 
operations and the Minas-Rio project. Where such indicators 
were identified we obtained copies of the valuation models used 
to determine the value in use or fair value less costs of disposal 
of the relevant asset. 
We challenged the assumptions made by management in 
relation to these models, including the discount rate used, the 
short-term and long-term commodity prices, capital expenditure 
and operating cost forecasts and the expected production 
profiles, by comparison to recent analyst forecast commodity 
price data, reference to third party documentation where 
available, utilisation of Deloitte valuation specialists, review of 
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources reports, consultation with 
operational management and consideration of sensitivity 
analyses. 
We assessed whether the assumptions had been determined 
and applied on a consistent basis across the Group.
We found that the assumptions 
used were reasonable and had 
been determined and applied 
on a consistent basis across the 
Group. No additional 
impairments or impairment 
reversals were identified from 
the work performed.
We found that the impairments 
recorded at the coal operations 
in Australia were primarily due 
to reduced forecast long-term 
commodity prices, but this effect 
was partially offset by forecast 
exchange rate movements and 
targeted reductions in forecast 
operating costs. In the second 
half of the year, the impact of 
encountering challenging 
geological conditions has been 
offset by increased spot prices.
Corporate asset transactions (notes 29 and 30)
The appropriate accounting treatment of corporate 
asset disposals which have completed during 2016 
is a key area of audit focus specifically in respect of 
assessing the point at which control is transferred 
from the seller to the buyer and the calculation of any 
profit or loss on disposal and assessing the potential 
accounting implications of ongoing transactions. 
In 2016 this includes specifically the sale of the 
Niobium and Phosphates businesses (pre-tax gain 
on disposal of $460 million), the Rustenburg 
operation (pre-tax loss on disposal of $121 million) 
and certain coal assets in Australia (combined net 
gain on disposal of $606 million).
For the sales completed in the year, we reviewed the sales and 
purchase agreements to assess whether control had passed to 
the buyer prior to 31 December 2016 and to recalculate any 
profit or loss on disposal.
For those assets where sales agreements are underway but 
not completed, we considered whether the criteria of 
IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations had been met and in particular whether the sale 
could be considered highly probable.
We are satisfied that the asset 
disposals that completed in 2016 
have been accounted for 
correctly, with appropriate 
disclosures properly made.
For all other planned asset sales 
we are satisfied that the criteria 
have not been met for them to be 
disclosed as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5.
Taxation (notes 1, 8 and 21)
The assessment of the Group’s taxation exposures 
across all jurisdictions is a key area of judgement 
particularly with respect to transfer pricing 
arrangements and the appropriateness of the 
recognition of tax provisions and deferred 
taxation assets.
We reviewed all potential taxation exposures within the Group 
and, through discussions with the Group’s taxation department, 
the tax specialists within the audit team and review of relevant 
documentation, we assessed the appropriateness of the 
provisions raised. 
We considered, in the context of our tax specialists’ prior 
experience of similar issues and the legal advice received by the 
Group, the Group‘s transfer pricing arrangements to confirm that 
they are reasonable and the Group’s deferred taxation assets 
and liabilities to confirm they are appropriate.
We are satisfied that the 
provisions raised in respect of 
the Group’s potential taxation 
exposures are appropriate and 
that deferred tax assets are 
properly recognised.
Special items and remeasurements (note 6)
The assessment of the appropriateness of items 
disclosed within ‘special items and remeasurements’ 
is a key judgement because of their impact upon 
the reporting of the underlying financial performance 
achieved by the Group.
In the context of our review of the overall income statement and 
with reference to the recently published guidance from the 
European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA) we considered 
and challenged each item disclosed within ‘special items and 
remeasurements’ as defined in note 6 to the financial statements. 
We determined whether such categorisation is appropriate and 
consistent with the Group’s stated policy and past practice for 
recognition of such items, and whether, taken as a whole, the 
income statement is fair and balanced in its presentation.
We are satisfied that all items 
included within ‘special items and 
remeasurements’ display no 
indication of management bias in 
the categorisation and that where 
relevant the categorisation was 
consistent with prior practice. 
We consider that the related 
disclosures are also appropriate.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters. 114 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ANGLO AMERICAN PLC
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use 
materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality $200 million (2015: $200 million)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
We have considered both asset and profit bases in the 
determination of materiality. $200 million equates to 
0.8% (2015: 0.9 %) of net assets and 6.3% 
(2015: 4.7%) of normalised three year pre-tax profit 
before special items and remeasurements.
The use of a combination of bases is a change to our 
approach in 2015 when materiality was based solely on 
the normalised three-year pre-tax profit before special 
items and remeasurements.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Given the current volatility in commodity prices and the 
cyclical nature of the mining industry, we believe that 
widening our assessment to incorporate balance sheet 
metrics in addition to normalised pre-tax profit before 
special items and remeasurements is a more 
appropriate approach as it reflects the capital invested, 
the changes in production, the volume of commodities 
sold and the scale of the Group’s operations.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee 
all known profit impacting audit differences in excess of $10 million 
(2015: $10 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including internal control, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement.
All business units were subject to a full scope audit with the exception of 
Niobium and Phosphates (which was disposed of in 2016) and Manganese 
where specific audit procedures were performed. The work performed by the 
component audit teams at each business unit is guided by the Group audit 
team and is executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual 
entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from $90 million 
to $110 million (2015: $80 million to $110 million). 
The Senior Statutory Auditor and/or a senior member of the Group audit team 
visits the principal location of each significant business unit at least once 
every year and key operational assets on a rotating basis.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 • the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
 • the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
 • the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its 
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any 
material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 • the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report arising from these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with certain 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 • materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 • apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 • otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 115
Financial statements
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We 
also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). 
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES 
OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the course of preparing financial statements, management necessarily 
makes judgements and estimates that can have a significant impact on 
the financial statements. The most critical of these relate to impairment and 
impairment reversals of assets, taxation, contingent liabilities, joint 
arrangements, estimation of Ore Reserves, assessment of fair value, 
restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs, retirement benefits and 
deferred stripping. The use of inaccurate assumptions in assessments made 
for any of these judgements and estimates could result in a significant impact 
on financial results. 
Critical accounting judgements
Impairment and impairment reversals of assets 
Mining operations are large, complex assets requiring significant technical 
and financial resources to operate. Their value may be sensitive to a range 
of characteristics unique to each asset and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty include Ore Reserve estimates and cash flow projections. 
In performing the impairment reviews, the Group assesses the recoverable 
amount of its operating assets principally with reference to fair value less 
costs of disposal, assessed using discounted cash flow models. These models 
are subject to estimation uncertainty and there is judgement in determining 
the assumptions that are considered to be reasonable and consistent with 
those that would be applied by market participants as outlined below.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are any indicators 
that its assets and cash generating units (CGUs) may be impaired. Operating 
and economic assumptions, which could affect the valuation of assets using 
discounted cash flows, are updated regularly as part of the Group’s planning 
and forecasting processes. Judgement is therefore required to determine 
whether the updates represent significant changes in the service potential of 
an asset or CGU, and are therefore indicators of impairment or impairment 
reversal. The judgement also takes into account the Group’s long-term 
economic forecasts, market consensus and sensitivity analysis of the 
discounted cash flow models used to value the Group’s assets.
Assets (other than goodwill) that have been previously impaired must be 
assessed for indicators of both impairment and impairment reversal. Such 
assets are, by definition, carried on the balance sheet at a value close to 
their recoverable amount at the last assessment. Therefore in principle any 
change to operational plans or assumptions, economic parameters, or the 
passage of time, could result in further impairment or impairment reversal 
if an indicator is identified. Significant operating assets that the Group has 
previously impaired include Minas-Rio and Sishen (Iron Ore and Manganese); 
Moranbah-Grosvenor, Capcoal, Dawson and Isibonelo (Coal); Barro Alto 
(Nickel) and El Soldado (Copper). These assets have a combined carrying value 
of $9.0 billion within property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2016.
In addition, in making assessments for impairment, management necessarily 
applies its judgement in allocating assets, including goodwill, that do not 
generate independent cash flows to appropriate CGUs.
Subsequent changes to the CGU allocation, to the timing of cash flows or to 
the assumptions used to determine the cash flows could impact the carrying 
value of the respective assets. 
See note 6 for the Group’s impairment and impairment reversals disclosures.
Taxation 
The Group’s tax affairs are governed by complex domestic tax legislations, 
international tax treaties between countries and the interpretation of both by 
tax authorities and courts. Given the many uncertainties that could arise from 
these factors, judgement is often required in determining the tax that is due. 
Where management is aware of potential uncertainties that are judged more 
likely than not to result in a liability for additional tax, a provision is made for 
management’s best estimate of the liability, determined with reference to 
similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from independent experts. 
See note 8 for the Group’s income tax expense disclosures.
In addition, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax requires the 
application of judgement in assessing the amount, timing and probability  
of future taxable profits and repatriation of retained earnings. These factors 
affect the determination of the appropriate rates of tax to apply and the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets. These judgements are influenced, 
inter alia, by factors such as estimates of future production, commodity  
lines, operating costs, future capital expenditure and dividend policies. 
See note 21 for the Group’s deferred tax disclosures. Further details of the 
Group’s tax accounting policy are described in note 39c.
Contingent liabilities 
On an ongoing basis the Group is a party to various legal disputes, the 
outcomes of which cannot be assessed with a high degree of certainty. 
Management applies its judgement in determining whether or not to record a 
provision or contingent liability. A provision is recognised where, based on the 
Group’s legal views and, in some cases, independent advice, it is considered 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle a present 
obligation that can be measured reliably. A contingent liability is a potential 
future outflow of cash, or other resources, where the likelihood of payment is 
less than probable but more than remote. Disclosure of contingent liabilities 
is made in note 34, including quantification of the potential future outflow of 
resources, unless the amount cannot be reliably estimated. 
Joint arrangements 
Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures 
according to the rights and obligations of the parties, as described in 
note 39k. Judgement is required in determining this classification through 
an evaluation of the facts and circumstances arising from each individual 
arrangement. When a joint arrangement has been structured through 
a separate vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the 
separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when 
relevant, other facts and circumstances. When the activities of an 
arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output to the parties 
and, the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows contributing to 
the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this indicates that the 
parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities. Certain joint arrangements that are structured through separate 
vehicles including Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb are accounted for as 
joint operations. These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision 
of output to the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have 
rights to substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of 
the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the 
parties; this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations 
for the liabilities. It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to 
the classification as joint operations.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Ore Reserves 
When determining Ore Reserves, which may be used to calculate useful 
economic lives of assets and depreciation on the Group’s mining properties, 
assumptions that were valid at the time of estimation may change when new 
information becomes available. In addition, the calculation of the unit of 
production rate of amortisation could be impacted to the extent that actual 
production in the future is different from current forecast production. 
Any changes in estimate could affect prospective depreciation rates and 
asset carrying values and, as a result, the determination of Ore Reserves is 
considered a key source of estimation uncertainty.
Factors which could impact useful economic lives of assets and Ore Reserve 
estimates include: 
 • the grade of Ore Reserves varying significantly from time to time 
 • differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price 
assumptions used in the estimation of Ore Reserves 
 • renewal of mining licences 
 • unforeseen operational issues at mine sites 
 • adverse changes in capital, operating, mining, processing and reclamation 
costs, discount rates and foreign exchange rates used to determine 
Ore Reserves. 
For further information refer to the unaudited Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resources Report 2016.

1. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES 
OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY continued
Assessment of fair value 
The assessment of fair value is principally used in accounting for business 
combinations, impairment testing and the valuation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities.
The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to 
sell the asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants. Fair value is determined based on observable market 
data, discounted cash flow models (and other valuation techniques), 
contractual agreements and other assumptions considered to be reasonable 
and consistent with those that would be applied by a market participant. 
The estimation of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities is 
subjective and the use of different valuation assumptions could have 
a significant impact on financial results. 
Fair value of financial instruments
Certain of the Group’s financial instruments, principally derivatives, are 
required to be measured on the balance sheet at fair value. Where a quoted 
market price for an identical instrument is not available, a valuation model is 
used to estimate the fair value based on the net present value of the expected 
cash flows under the contract. Valuation assumptions are usually based on 
observable market data (for example forward foreign exchange rate, interest 
rate or commodity price curves) where available.
Cash flow projections for business combinations and impairment testing 
Expected future cash flows used in discounted cash flow models are 
inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. They are 
significantly affected by a number of factors including Ore Reserves and 
Mineral Resources, together with economic factors such as commodity 
prices, exchange rates, discount rates and estimates of production costs 
and future capital expenditure. 
Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and Life of Mine Plans 
or, for non-mine assets, an equivalent appropriate long-term forecast, 
incorporating key assumptions as detailed below: 
 • Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources  
Ore Reserves and, where considered appropriate, Mineral Resources are 
incorporated in projected cash flows, based on Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resource statements and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by 
appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resources are included where 
management has a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction, 
despite additional evaluation still being required prior to meeting the 
required confidence to convert to Ore Reserves.
 • Commodity and product prices  
Commodity and product prices are based on latest internal forecasts, 
benchmarked with external sources of information, to ensure they are within 
the range of available analyst forecasts. In estimating the forecast cash 
flows, management also takes into account the expected realised price from 
existing contractual arrangements. 
 • Foreign exchange rates 
Foreign exchange rates are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked 
with external sources of information for relevant countries of operation. 
Foreign exchange rates are kept constant (on a real basis) from 2022 onwards. 
 • Discount rates  
Cash flow projections used in fair value less costs of disposal impairment 
models are discounted based on a real post-tax discount rate, assessed 
annually, of 6.5% (2015: 6.5%). Adjustments to the rate are made for any 
risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including the risk 
profile of the individual asset and country risk. 
 • Operating costs, capital expenditure and other operating factors  
Operating costs and capital expenditure are based on financial budgets 
covering a five year period. Cash flow projections beyond five years are 
based on Life of Mine Plans or non-mine production plans, as applicable, 
and internal management forecasts. Cost assumptions incorporate 
management experience and expectations, as well as the nature and 
location of the operation and the risks associated therewith. Underlying 
input cost assumptions are consistent with related output price 
assumptions. Other operating factors, such as the timelines of granting 
licences and permits are based on management’s best estimate of the 
outcome of uncertain future events at the balance sheet date. 
Where an asset has potential for future development through capital 
investment, to which a market participant would attribute value, and the 
costs and economic benefits can be estimated reliably, this development 
is included in the cash flows (with appropriate risk adjustments). 
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs 
Costs for restoration of site damage, rehabilitation and environmental costs 
are estimated using either the work of external consultants or internal 
experts. The amount recognised as a provision represents management’s 
best estimate of the consideration required to complete the restoration and 
rehabilitation activity, the application of the relevant regulatory framework 
and timing of expenditure. These estimates are inherently uncertain and 
could materially change over time. To the extent that the actual future costs 
differ from these estimates, adjustments will be recorded and the amount 
provided could be impacted.
See note 20 for the Group’s environmental restoration and decommissioning 
provisions disclosures.
Retirement benefits 
The expected costs of providing pensions and post employment benefits 
under defined benefit arrangements relating to employee service during the 
period are determined based on financial and actuarial assumptions. 
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set after consultation with 
qualified actuaries. While management believes the assumptions used are 
appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements. 
See note 27 for the Group’s retirement benefits disclosures.
Deferred stripping 
In certain mining operations, rock or soil overlying a mineral deposit, known 
as overburden, and other waste materials must be removed to access the 
orebody. The process of removing overburden and other mine waste 
materials is referred to as stripping.
The Group defers stripping costs onto the balance sheet where they are 
considered to improve access to ore in future periods. Where the amount to 
be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the 
volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified 
component of the orebody. This determination is dependent on an individual 
mine’s design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the design or 
Life of Mine Plan will result in changes to these estimates. Identification of 
the components of a mine’s orebody is made by reference to the Life of Mine 
Plan. The assessment depends on a range of factors including each mine’s 
specific operational features and materiality. 
Further details of the Group’s deferred stripping accounting policy are 
described in note 39h and the amounts capitalised are presented within 
‘Mining properties and leases’ in note 12.
Changes in estimates
Due to the nature of Platinum in-process inventories being contained in weirs, 
pipes and other vessels, physical counts only take place annually, except in 
the Precious Metal Refinery which take place once every five years (the latest 
being in 2016). Consequently, the Platinum business runs a theoretical metal 
inventory system based on inputs, the results of previous physical counts and 
outputs. Once the results of the physical count are finalised, the variance 
between the theoretical count and actual count is investigated and recorded 
as a change in estimate. During 2016, the change in estimate following the 
annual physical count has had the effect of increasing the value of inventory 
by $38 million (2015: increase of $181 million), resulting in the recognition of 
a post-tax gain of $27 million (2015: gain of $130 million).

2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted and disclosed 
in the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, except 
for changes arising from the adoption of the following new accounting 
pronouncements which became effective in the current reporting period:
 • Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions  
of Interests in Joint Operations.
 • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements:  
Disclosure Initiative.
 • Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle.
The adoption of these new accounting pronouncements has not had a 
significant impact on the accounting policies, methods of computation or 
presentation applied by the Group.
The Group has not early adopted any other amendment, standard or 
interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective. It is expected that 
where applicable, these standards and amendments will be adopted on each 
respective effective date.
New IFRS accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations not yet adopted
The following new IFRS accounting standards in issue but not yet effective 
are expected to have a significant impact on the Group:
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and subsequent amendments, Clarifications 
to IFRS 15, were issued in April 2016. IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, although the April 
2016 amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. For the Group, 
transition to IFRS 15 will take place on 1 January 2018.
The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue should be recognised in a 
manner that depicts the pattern of the transfer of goods and services to 
customers. The amount recognised should reflect the amount to which the 
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. The 
standard requires entities to apportion revenue earned from contracts to 
individual promises, or performance obligations, on a relative standalone 
selling price basis, based on a five-step model.
During 2016 the Group has undertaken an accounting impact analysis based 
on a review of the contractual terms of its principal revenue streams, and 
internal accounting guidance has been developed. Work is underway to 
collect the information required to calculate the impact of restating the 
31 December 2016 balance sheet and 2017 income statement on adoption 
of the new standard, and to embed the collection of such new data into 
existing systems and processes. 
The indicative impacts of implementing IFRS 15 on the Group results are 
as follows:
 • Under IFRS 15 the revenue recognition model will change from one based 
on the transfer of risk and reward of ownership to the transfer of control of 
ownership. The Group’s revenue is predominantly derived from commodity 
sales, where the point of recognition is dependent on the contract sales 
terms, known as the International Commercial terms (Incoterms). As the 
transfer of risks and rewards generally coincides with the transfer of control 
at a point in time for the Incoterms as part of the Group’s commodity sales 
arrangements, the timing and amount of revenue recognised for the sale of 
commodities is unlikely to be materially affected for the majority of sales.
 • IFRS 15 introduces the concept of performance obligations that are defined 
as a ‘distinct’ promised good or service. For the Incoterms Cost, Insurance 
and Freight (CIF) and Cost and Freight (CFR) the seller must contract for 
and pay the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named 
port of destination. Consequently, the freight service on export commodity 
contracts with CIF/CFR Incoterms represents a separate performance 
obligation as defined under the new standard. This means that, where 
material, a portion of the revenue earned under these contracts, 
representing the obligation to perform the freight service, will be deferred 
and recognised over time as this obligation is fulfilled, along with the 
associated costs. Based upon the preliminary assessment performed, the 
impact of this change on the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a year 
is not expected to be material.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 and becomes effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, which will be the date the Group 
transitions to IFRS 9. The new standard is applicable to financial assets and 
financial liabilities, and covers the classification, measurement, impairment 
and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities together with a 
new hedge accounting model.
During the year the Group has undertaken an accounting impact analysis of 
the new standard based on the nature of the financial instruments it holds and 
the way in which they are used. The indicative impacts of adopting IFRS 9 on 
the Group are as follows:
 • Classification and measurement: IFRS 9 establishes a principles-based 
approach to determining whether a financial asset should be measured at 
amortised cost or fair value, based on the cash flow characteristics of the 
asset and the business model in which the asset is held. The Group 
anticipates that the classification and measurement basis for its financial 
assets will be largely unchanged under this model. 
 • Impairment: Based on the Group’s initial assessment, the introduction of an 
‘expected credit loss’ model for the assessment of impairment of financial 
assets held at amortised cost is not expected to have a material impact on 
the Group’s results, given the low exposure to counterparty default risk as 
a result of the credit risk management processes that are in place.
 • Hedge accounting: The adoption of the new standard would not materially 
change the amounts recognised in relation to existing hedging arrangements 
but could provide scope to apply hedge accounting to a broader range of 
transactions in the future. The Group is currently assessing whether to take 
the accounting policy choice, permitted under the IFRS 9 transition 
requirements, to continue to account for all hedges under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 was published in January 2016 and will be effective for the Group 
from 1 January 2019, replacing IAS 17 Leases subject to EU endorsement.
The principal impact of IFRS 16 will be to change the accounting treatment by 
lessees of leases currently classified as operating leases. Lease agreements 
will give rise to the recognition by the lessee of an asset, representing the 
right to use the leased item, and a related liability for future lease payments. 
Lease costs will be recognised in the income statement in the form of 
depreciation of the right-of-use asset over the lease term, and finance 
charges representing the unwind of the discount on the lease liability. Certain 
exemptions from recognising leases on the balance sheet are available for 
leases with terms of 12 months or less or where the underlying asset is of 
low value. 
The Group has begun its impact assessment on the new standard. The most 
significant impact on the Group financial statements is expected to be on the 
balance sheet, as a consequence of the recognition of right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities in relation to arrangements currently accounted for as 
operating leases. 
Other issued standards and amendments that are not yet effective are not 
expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements.  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 123

3. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group’s segments are aligned to those business units that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate 
resources and in assessing performance.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the ‘Iron Ore and Manganese’ segment on the basis of the ultimate 
product produced (ferrous metals). The ‘Corporate and other’ segment includes unallocated corporate costs, exploration costs and the Other Mining and 
Industrial business unit, the majority of whose remaining operations were disposed of in the year ended 31 December 2015. Exploration costs represent the 
cost of the Group’s exploration activities across all segments. 
Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows – De Beers: rough and polished diamonds; Platinum: platinum group metals; Copper: copper; Nickel: 
nickel; Niobium and Phosphates: niobium and phosphates; Iron Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys; Coal: metallurgical coal and thermal 
coal. See note 39a for the Group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition.
Niobium and Phosphates was sold on 30 September 2016 (see note 30).
During the year, Anglo American Platinum Limited has identified certain computational errors affecting its results reported in prior periods, the impact of 
which is considered material to Anglo American Platinum Limited but is not material to the Group. Consequently, the affected prior period results have been 
restated in the individual financial statements of Anglo American Platinum Limited but have been corrected in the current year in the Group financial 
statements. Had the Group results been restated, underlying EBIT and underlying EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016 would be higher by 
$77 million (2015: underlying EBIT lower by $21 million and underlying EBITDA lower by $10 million).
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.
The disclosures in this note include certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including 
definitions, please refer to page 188.

Attributable capital employed is capital employed attributable to equity shareholders of the Company, and therefore excludes the portion of capital employed attributable to non-controlling 
interests in operations where the Group has control but does not hold 100% of the equity. Joint operations, associates and joint ventures are included in their proportionate interest and in line 
with appropriate accounting treatment.

6. SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS
Special Items
Special items are those items of financial performance that, due to their size and nature, the Group believes should be separately disclosed on the face of the 
income statement. These items, along with related tax and non-controlling interest, are excluded from underlying earnings, which is an Alternative Performance 
Measure (APM). For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions, please refer to page 188.
 • Operating special items are those that relate to the operating performance of the Group and principally include impairment charges and restructuring costs.
 • Non-operating special items are those that relate to changes in the Group’s asset portfolio. This category principally includes profits and losses on disposal 
of businesses and investments or closure of operations, adjustments relating to business combinations, and adjustments relating to former operations of the 
Group, such as changes in the measurement of deferred consideration receivable or provisions recognised on disposal or closure of operations in prior 
periods. This category also includes charges relating to Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transactions.
 • Financing special items are those that relate to financing activities and include realised gains and losses on early repayment of borrowings, and the 
unwinding of the discount on material provisions previously recognised as special items. 
Remeasurements
Remeasurements are items that are excluded from underlying earnings in order to reverse timing differences in the recognition of gains and losses in the 
income statement in relation to transactions that, whilst economically linked, are subject to different accounting measurement or recognition criteria. 
Remeasurements include mark-to-market movements on derivatives that are economic hedges of transactions not yet recorded in the financial statements, 
in order to ensure that the overall economic impact of such transactions is reflected within the Group’s underlying earnings in the period in which they occur. 
When the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are reversed from remeasurements and are recorded in 
underlying earnings. If the underlying transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in 
remeasurements on settlement of the derivative. 
 • Operating remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on derivatives relating to revenue, operating profit or capital expenditure transactions. They 
also include the fair value gain or loss, and its subsequent reversal through depreciation and amortisation, arising on revaluation of a previously held equity 
interest in a business combination.
 • Financing remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting 
hedges, related to financing arrangements.
 • Tax remeasurements include foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local 
currency financial information and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations.

Operating special items 
Impairments
Coal
Moranbah North and Grosvenor are adjacent longwall metallurgical coal operations in Queensland, Australia, sharing infrastructure and processing facilities. 
The two operations are assessed for impairment as a single cash generating unit (CGU).
In the first half of 2016 the Group’s expectations for long-term metallurgical coal prices were revised downward. Consequently, an impairment of $1,248 million 
($1,248 million after tax) against the value of the operations was reported in the Group’s 2016 interim results, based on a recoverable amount of $1.6 billion at 
30 June 2016. The valuation was based on the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU, measured using discounted cash flow projections (see note 1).
The valuation is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future metallurgical coal prices, which are subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty. For 
example, a $5/tonne change in the long-term price forecast for hard coking coal, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the 
valuation by $0.2 billion. The valuation also incorporates assumptions about future production at Grosvenor, which is still ramping up and has encountered 
challenging geological conditions in the latter part of 2016. Changes in these assumptions could result in further impairments or impairment reversals.
Other coal impairments of $64 million ($46 million after tax) relate to assets in Coal South Africa that are no longer expected to provide future economic 
benefits due to changes in the Life of Mine Plans across the export portfolio during the year.
El Soldado
An impairment charge of $200 million ($120 million after tax) has been recorded in relation to El Soldado (Copper) which is no longer expected to provide 
future economic benefits as a result of licensing uncertainty following changes made to sequencing in response to low prices during 2016.

6. SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued
Minas-Rio 
The Minas-Rio iron ore project (Minas-Rio) (Iron Ore and Manganese) in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008. Prior to 
2016, impairment charges totalling $11.3 billion (before tax) were recorded against the carrying value of Minas-Rio. The valuation was reassessed as at 
31 December 2016 and the recoverable amount was considered to be in line with the carrying value of $4.3 billion. The valuation remains sensitive to 
economic and operational factors that provide both upside and downside risk, including price and the scheduling of required permits and licences. For 
example, a $5/tonne change in the long-term price forecast for iron ore, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the valuation 
by $0.7 billion.
Sishen
The Sishen iron ore mine is located in the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. In the year ended 31 December 2015 the operation was impaired by 
$514 million based on a recoverable amount of $1.3 billion. The valuation was reassessed as at 31 December 2016 and the recoverable amount was 
considered to be in line with the carrying value of $1.4 billion. The valuation remains sensitive to economic and operational assumptions, particularly price. 
For example, a $5/tonne change in the long-term price forecast for iron ore, with all other valuation assumptions remaining the same, would change the 
valuation by $0.3 billion.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs of $120 million (before tax) relate to organisational changes as part of the Driving Value programme. The programme has incurred costs 
between 2014 and 2016 and constitutes a single strategic restructuring to effect permanent change to the Group’s organisational structure. Restructuring 
costs in 2015 were $148 million ($106 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
2015
In 2015 operating special items principally related to impairments of Minas-Rio, Coal assets, Platinum assets, Snap Lake, Sishen and El Soldado. Total pre-tax 
impairments were $5,824 million ($4,894 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
Operating remeasurements
Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $33 million ($25 million after tax and non-controlling interests) which principally relates to a $101 million 
depreciation and amortisation charge arising due to the fair value uplift on the Group’s pre-existing 45% shareholding in De Beers, which was required on 
acquisition of a controlling stake, and gains on derivatives of $68 million mostly related to economic hedges of capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil.
In 2015 operating remeasurements reflected a net loss before tax of $178 million ($125 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
Non-operating special items
Disposals of businesses and investments
The gain on disposal of $1,157 million principally comprises net gains on disposal of subsidiaries and joint operations of $977 million, which relate to the 
disposals of Callide (gain of $564 million), Niobium and Phosphates (gain of $460 million), Rustenburg (loss of $121 million), Foxleigh (gain of $42 million) 
and Morupule (gain of $32 million). Further details of disposals are provided in note 30.
In addition, a net gain of $180 million ($145 million after tax) realised on disposal of the Group’s 9.7% interest in Exxaro Resources Limited (Exxaro) on 
1 December 2016 for net proceeds of $215 million.
Adjustments relating to business combinations
Contingent liabilities that were required to be recognised at fair value on acquisition of De Beers in 2012, have been derecognised as the legal proceedings 
in respect of these matters have been closed. This has resulted in a pre-tax gain of $121 million ($82 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
Charges relating to BEE transactions
Charges relating to BEE transactions of $63 million ($36 million after tax and non-controlling interests) include a charge of $24 million relating to the 
repurchase by De Beers of shares in Ponahalo Holdings Limited awarded to certain employees and their dependants as part of DBCM’s 2006 empowerment 
transaction, and a charge of $39 million relating to the Kumba Envision Trust, which was Kumba’s broad based employee share scheme provided solely for the 
benefit of non-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees who did not participate in other Kumba share schemes. 
Adjustments relating to former operations
The net loss of $12 million includes amounts contributed to the Q(h)ubeka Trust pursuant to the agreement reached in March 2016 by Anglo American South 
Africa (AASA) and AngloGold Ashanti which resolved fully and finally 4,400 stand-alone silicosis claims. The settlement was reached without admission of 
liability by AASA or AngloGold Ashanti.
2015 
Non-operating special items in 2015 principally relate to the write-down to fair value of Rustenburg, the loss on disposal of Anglo American Norte S.A. and the 
loss on disposal of interests in Tarmac businesses. The total charge was $1,278 million ($1,063 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
Financing special items and remeasurements
Financing special items and remeasurements reflect a net loss of $314 million (2015: net gain of $615 million) and $318 million after tax and non-controlling 
interests (2015: net gain of $668 million after tax and non-controlling interests).
Financing special items and remeasurements principally comprise a net fair value loss of $389 million on derivatives hedging net debt and a net gain of 
$120 million resulting from the bond buybacks completed in the year. Of the fair value losses on derivatives, a loss of $482 million relates to the reduction 
in the debit valuation adjustment on derivatives hedging net debt. This adjustment is incorporated into the valuation of these derivatives to reflect the impact 
on the fair value of Anglo American’s own credit quality. The loss principally reflects the reduction in Anglo American’s observed credit spreads since 
31 December 2015.

b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The effective tax rate for the year of 26.6% (2015: (7.1%)) is higher (2015: lower) than the applicable weighted average statutory rate of corporation tax in the 
United Kingdom of 20% (2015: 20.25%). The reconciling items, excluding the impact of associates and joint ventures, are:

Included within other temporary differences is an amount of $306 million in respect of enhanced tax depreciation in Chile. This is partially offset by an amount included within prior year 
adjustments of $200 million. 
(2) 
The special items and remeasurements reconciling item of $111 million (2015: $1,333 million) relates to the net tax impact of total special items and remeasurements before tax calculated at the 
United Kingdom corporation tax rate less the associated tax recorded against these items, one-off tax charges and tax remeasurements. See note 6 for further details of the tax amounts 
included within special items and remeasurements.
IAS 1 requires income from associates and joint ventures to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement. Associates’ and joint ventures’ tax  
is therefore excluded from the Group’s income tax expense. Associates’ and joint ventures’ tax included within ‘Share of net income/(loss) from associates  
and joint ventures’ for the year ended 31 December 2016 is a charge of $117 million (2015: charge of $143 million). Excluding special items and 
remeasurements this becomes a charge of $123 million (2015: charge of $100 million).
The underlying effective tax rate was 24.6% for the year ended 31 December 2016. This is lower than the equivalent underlying effective tax rate of 31.0% for 
the year ended 31 December 2015. The decreased rate in 2016 was due to a benefit received in relation to the reassessment of withholding tax provisions, and 
the utilisation of losses and other tax attributes not previously recognised, partially offset by the impact of enhanced tax depreciation and other prior year 
adjustments. In future periods it is expected that the underlying effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.

9. EARNINGS PER SHARE continued
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
Profit/(loss) attributable  
to equity shareholders of  
the Company Headline earnings Underlying earnings
2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015

Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,300 1,289 1,300 1,292 1,300 1,292 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares.
In the year ended 31 December 2016, there were 274,815 share options which were potentially dilutive but not included in the calculation of diluted earnings 
because they were anti-dilutive.
In the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group disclosed a basic loss per share and consequently all 12,855,264 potential ordinary shares were anti-dilutive 
and excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. 8,996,586 potential shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted headline earnings per 
share and diluted underlying earnings per share as they were anti-dilutive. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, based on headline and underlying earnings, uses the following earnings data:
US$ million 2016 2015
Profit/(loss) for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company  1,594 (5,624)

2015 includes goodwill impairment of $52 million allocated to Snap Lake (De Beers) and $41 million allocated to Rustenburg (Platinum). 
(3) 
Relates to the disposal of the Niobium business (see note 30).
Impairment tests for goodwill
See note 39f for the Group’s accounting policy on impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal 
management purposes. This allocation largely represents the Group’s segments. The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups of CGUs is as follows:
US$ million 2016 2015
De Beers 1,604  1,553 
Platinum 189 189 
Copper 124  124 
Coal South Africa 88  88 
Other 9  216 
 2,014 2,170 
For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value 
less costs of disposal basis. The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1. Management believes that any 
reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their 
recoverable amounts.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to $14,006 million (2015: $13,945 million). 
Inventories held at net realisable value amounted to $641 million (2015: $1,048 million).
The write-down of inventories (net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases) amounted to $96 million (2015: $121 million).
16. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value (with the exception of receivables 
relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39a), net of appropriate provision for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.

Of the year end trade receivables balance, $29 million (2015: $55 million) were past due at 31 December, stated after an associated impairment provision 
of $13 million (2015: $18 million). The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Group’s businesses operate. Given this, 
the use of payment security instruments (including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions), and the nature of the related counterparties, these 
amounts are considered recoverable. The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is 
considered to be high.
17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

purchases which are marked to market using the appropriate forward price) until settled.

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
See notes 39l, 39m and 39n for the Group’s accounting policies on financial asset investments, impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments 
and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities are as shown below. Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not approximate 
its fair value, this is also disclosed. 
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by 
reference to market value. For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and 
consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to 
approximate fair value.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed.

Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt which is held at amortised cost, adjusted for the fair value of the hedged interest rate risk. The fair value of these borrowings is 
$12,405 million (2015: $10,898 million), which is measured using quoted indicative broker prices and consequently categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the 
remaining borrowings at amortised cost of $832 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, is considered to approximate the fair value. At 31 December 2015 the fair value of borrowings at 
amortised cost of $3,167 million, principally comprising bank borrowings, was $2,463 million. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value primarily reflected the debit valuation 
adjustment of Anglo American’s own credit quality based on observed credit spreads at 31 December 2015.

Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. This category includes listed equity shares.
(2) 
Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
(3) 
Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input (which could have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation) is not based on 
observable market data. Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used. Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate 
for the input. This category includes deferred contingent consideration.
(4) 
The debit valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect in the fair value of financial liabilities the effect of Anglo American’s own credit quality based on observed credit spreads. This adjustment 
is calculated in total for each counterparty based on the net expected exposure. In many cases this includes exposures on a number of different types of derivative instruments. Consequently 
the impact of this adjustment has been presented as a separate item within the analysis of derivatives above. Based on an allocation weighted by exposure to each category of instrument, 
$73 million (2015: $555 million) is attributable to derivatives hedging net debt and nil (2015: $12 million) relates to other derivatives. 
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of contingent proceeds and receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity 
investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows:
Assets Liabilities

This is principally recorded in special items and remeasurements.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain estimated inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value 
significantly.

19. DERIVATIVES
See note 39n for the Group’s accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within ‘Derivative financial assets’ and ‘Derivative financial liabilities’. 
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the contracted maturity of the derivative. 
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. Such derivatives are classified as ‘Held for trading’ 
and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges
In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges. Where 
this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses 
are transferred to the Consolidated income statement (or hedged balance sheet item).
Fair value hedges
The majority of interest rate swaps (taken out to swap the Group’s fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Group’s policy) have been 
designated as fair value hedges. The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes 
in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Held for trading
The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges. This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting 
cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for 
certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt. Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as 
remeasurements or within underlying earnings in accordance with the policy set out in note 6.
The fair value of the Group’s open derivative positions at 31 December (excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet), recorded within 
‘Derivative financial assets’ and ‘Derivative financial liabilities’, is as follows:

Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $98 million (2015: $143 million), offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of $106 million 
(2015: $146 million).
(2) 
Relates to cross currency swaps (see note 18).
(3) 
Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure, forward commodity contracts and other commodity contracts that are accounted for as 
‘Held for trading’.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.  
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at 31 December, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. For more information about these risks and the ways in which the 
Group manages them see notes 24 and 38.

Environmental restoration
The Group has an obligation to undertake restoration, rehabilitation and environmental work when environmental disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production of a mining property. A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on management’s best estimate of the legal 
and constructive obligations incurred. Changes in legislation could result in changes in provisions recognised. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs 
will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work. It is anticipated that the majority of 
these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
The pre-tax, real discount rates that have been used in calculating the environmental restoration and decommissioning liabilities as at 31 December 2016 and 
31 December 2015, in the principal currencies in which these liabilities are denominated, are as follows: US dollar: 2.1%; South African rand: 4%; Australian 
dollar: 3%; Chilean peso: 3%; and Brazilian real: 6%.
Employee benefits
Provision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements including long service leave, annual leave, sickness pay and similar obligations. It is 
anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.
Onerous contracts
Provision is made for the present value of certain long-term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Group’s obligations is expected to exceed the 
benefits to be received. It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period of up to nine years.
Other
Other provisions primarily relate to restructuring costs, indemnities, legal and other claims. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over 
a period of up to five years.
Environmental rehabilitation trusts
The Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities, 
primarily in South Africa. The funds comprise the following investments:
US$ million 2016 2015
Equity 135  115 
Bonds 153  121 
Cash 65  54 
 353  290 
These assets are primarily denominated in South African rand. Cash is held in short term fixed deposits or earns interest at floating inter-bank rates. Bonds 
earn interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.0% (2015: 8.1%) for an average period of three years (2015: four years). Equity investments are recorded at 
fair value through profit and loss and bonds are recorded at amortised cost.
These funds are not available for the general purposes of the Group. All income from these assets is reinvested to meet specific environmental obligations. 
These obligations are included in provisions stated above.

The deferred tax asset on other temporary differences of $243 million arises primarily as a result of currency movements in deferred tax in US dollar functional currency entities whose tax 
computations are generated based on local currency financial information. This is partially offset by an amount related to capital allowances in excess of depreciation.
(2) 
The deferred tax liability on other temporary differences of $217 million arises primarily in relation to deferred stripping costs, partially offset by an amount related to post-employment benefits.

No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in 
joint arrangements where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches, 
associates and interests in joint arrangements is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to 
$17,804 million (2015: $15,103 million).

Derivatives hedging net debt represents the mark-to-market valuation of such derivatives before taking into account the effect of debit valuation adjustments which reduce the valuation of 
derivative liabilities hedging net debt by $73 million (2015: $555 million). Further details on this adjustment are provided in note 18.
c) Net (debt)/cash by segment
The Group’s policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre. Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in 
connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group. Other than 
the impact of South African exchange controls (see 23d below), there are no significant restrictions over the Group’s ability to access these cash balances or 
repay these borrowings. Net (debt)/cash by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances.

d) South Africa net cash/(debt)
The Group operates in South Africa where the existence of exchange controls may restrict the use of certain cash balances. The Group therefore monitors  
the cash and debt associated with these operations separately. These restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the Group’s ability to meet its 
ongoing obligations. Below is a breakdown of net cash/(debt) in South Africa.

24. BORROWINGS
See note 39o for the Group’s accounting policy on bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, the  
South African Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) programme, the Australian Medium Term Note (AMTN) programme and through accessing the  
US bond markets. The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Group’s borrowings are floating rate US dollar 
denominated.
In March 2016, the Group completed a bond buyback transaction consisting of Euro, Sterling and US dollar denominated bonds with maturities from 
December 2016 to September 2018. The Group used $1.7 billion of cash to retire $1.83 billion of contractual repayment obligations (including derivatives 
hedging the bonds).

24. BORROWINGS continued
Liquidity risk
The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities (including refinancing, where necessary) in order to meet short term business 
requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions 
that exist. In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.
The expected undiscounted cash flows of the Group’s net debt related and other financial liabilities, by remaining contractual maturity, based on conditions 
existing at the balance sheet date are as follows:

In January 2017, the Group retired the $1.05 billion Club facility which was entered into in 2016 in the context of the bond buyback transaction. This facility was 
undrawn at 31 December 2016 and is included in the table above within ‘greater than one year, less than two years’.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
enable the business to operate effectively.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group has a number of options including raising and refinancing debt, adjusting returns to 
equity shareholders, managing the allocation of capital and divesting non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital using various financial metrics including the ratio of net debt to total capital (gearing). Net debt is calculated as total borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents (including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt). Total capital is calculated as ‘Net assets’ (as shown in the 
Consolidated balance sheet) excluding net debt. Total capital and gearing are as follows:
US$ million 2016 2015
Net assets 24,325  21,342 
Net debt including related derivatives (note 23) 8,487  12,901 
Total capital 32,812  34,243 
Gearing 25.9% 37.7%
Gearing has decreased from 37.7% at 31 December 2015 to 25.9% at 31 December 2016 as net debt has decreased, offset by a decrease in total capital. Net 
debt decreased from $12.9 billion to $8.5 billion during the year, driven by operating cash inflows and proceeds from asset disposals.

24. BORROWINGS continued 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values and related cash flows will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. The Group manages interest 
rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority 
of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South 
Africa. For more information regarding the Group’s financial risk management see note 38.

See note 39x for the Group’s accounting policy on leases.
A commitment is a contractual obligation to make a payment in the future which is not provided for in the balance sheet. The Group also has purchase 
obligations relating to take or pay agreements which are legally binding and enforceable.
Capital commitments for subsidiaries and joint operations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are $1,317 million (2015: $1,168 million), 
of which 45% (2015: 82%) relate to expenditure to be incurred within the next year.
The Group’s outstanding commitments relating to take or pay agreements are $14,398 million (2015: $14,928 million), of which 9% (2015: 8%) relate to 
expenditure to be incurred within the next year.
At 31 December the Group’s total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

27. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
See note 39t for the Group’s accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. It also operates post employment medical plans, principally 
in South Africa. 
Defined contribution plans
The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds. The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on 
the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year. The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans (net of amounts 
capitalised and special items) was $180 million (2015: $221 million) and for defined contribution medical plans (net of amounts capitalised) was $64 million 
(2015: $73 million).
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans
The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of regions. The most significant plans are in South Africa and the 
United Kingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows:
US$ million 2016 2015
Net liability recognised at 1 January (361) (889) 
Net income statement charge (42) (60) 
Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation (214)  290 
Employer contributions to funded pension plans 105  118 
Benefits paid to unfunded plans 39 24
Disposal of business (2)  41 
Other (3)  12 
Currency movements (30)  103 
Net liability recognised at 31 December (508) (361) 
Amounts recognised as:
Defined benefit pension plans in surplus
(1)
 270  306 
Retirement benefit obligation – pension plans (377) (330) 
Retirement benefit obligation – medical plans (401) (337) 
(508) (361) 
(1) 
Included in ‘Other non-current assets’ on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently 
administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction. The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation 
to termination indemnity plans in Chile. 
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants. Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain 
criteria. The majority of these plans are unfunded and are principally in South Africa. 
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method. The actuaries have updated the 
valuations to 31 December 2016. Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries. While management believes the assumptions used are 
appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would impact the Group’s other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans
The defined benefit plans are exposed to risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. 
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 11 years (2015: 11 years), United Kingdom plans is 19 years (2015: 18 years) and plans in other 
regions is 14 years (2015: 14 years). This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made. 
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year. Employer contributions made to funded plans 
in the year ended 31 December 2016 were $105 million (2015: $118 million). In addition $39 million (2015: $24 million) of benefits were paid to unfunded plans 
and $21 million (2015: $23 million) of benefits were paid in relation to post employment medical plans. The Group expects to contribute $108 million to its 
pension plans and $25 million to its post employment medical plans in 2017.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.

The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus 
Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds’ actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund. All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and 
the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual. As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Group’s provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability. 
United Kingdom
The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom. These plans are closed to new members and to the future accrual of benefits. 
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of 
investment strategies, including the use of interest rate hedging and inflation hedging to manage interest rate risk and inflation rate risk, respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees. Where 
the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give 
rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable. Any resulting surplus has been 
assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.

Other
Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination 
indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract. The features of this provision meet the definition of a 
post employment benefit obligation and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet. Other plans are in Brazil, Canada 
and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans. These plans are not considered to be significant 
to the Group.

Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally. In  
South Africa, the PA90 tables are used. The main plans in the United Kingdom use either CMI tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments based 
on mortality investigations. The mortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life expectancy 
(shown as weighted averages):
Male Female

The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female aged 45 at the balance sheet date. When viewed together 
with the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy (shown as weighted averages):

Sensitivity analysis
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality. The sensitivity 
analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year, assuming 
that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded. The effect on plan liabilities is as follows:

28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
See note 39u for the Group’s accounting policy on share-based payments.
During the year ended 31 December 2016 the Group had share-based payment arrangements with employees relating to shares of the Company, the details 
of which are described in the Remuneration report. All of these Company schemes, as well as any non-cyclical awards, are equity settled either by award of 
ordinary shares (BSP, LTIP, SIP and Non-cyclical) or award of options to acquire ordinary shares (SAYE).
The total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows:
US$ million 2016 2015
BSP 100 88
LTIP 49 42
Other schemes 12 5
Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares
(1)
 161 135
(1) 
In addition, there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $43 million (2015: $47 million) relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares, $28 million (2015: $26 million) relating to 
Anglo American Platinum Limited shares and $2 million (2015: nil) of other equity settled share-based payment charges. Certain business units also operate cash settled employee 
share-based payment schemes. These schemes had a charge of $2 million (2015: $1 million). 
Schemes settled by award of ordinary shares
The fair value of ordinary shares under the BSP, LTIP and LTIP-ROCE, being the more material schemes, was calculated using the Black Scholes model. The 
fair value of shares awarded under the LTIP-TSR scheme was calculated using the Monte Carlo model. 
The awards were granted on 04/03/16 (2015: 03/03/15) with a share price of £5.92 (2015: £12.05). These awards have a contractual life of three years and 
are conditional on three years continuous employment. The LTIP-ROCE and LTIP-TSR awards are conditional on a Group ROCE target and market based 
performance conditions, respectively, being achieved. The following assumptions were used in the valuation of the awards: expected volatility of 50% 
(2015: 35%) based on historic volatility over the last five years; risk free interest rate of 0.5% (2015: 0.9%) based on the yield on zero-coupon UK government 
bonds with a term similar to the expected life of the award; expected departures rate of 5% pa (2015: 5% pa); and a dividend yield of nil (2015: 2.1%).
The awards granted during the year under these assumptions are summarised below:

instruments⁽¹⁾

average)(£)

LTIP-TSR 2,213,836 4.12 827,674 5.30
(1) 
The number of instruments used in the fair value models may differ from the total number of instruments awarded in the year due to awards made subsequent to the fair value calculations. 
The fair value calculated per the assumptions above has been applied to the total number of awards. The difference in income statement charge is not considered significant.
The charges arising in respect of the other Anglo American plc employee share schemes that the Group operated during the year are not considered material.

Tenon
Tenon Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited (Tenon), a wholly owned subsidiary of Anglo American South Africa Limited (AASA), has entered into 
agreements with Epoch Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited (Epoch), Epoch Two Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited (Epoch Two) and Tarl 
Investment Holdings Proprietary Limited (Tarl) (collectively the Investment Companies), each owned by independent charitable trusts whose trustees are 
independent of the Group. Under the terms of these agreements, the Investment Companies have purchased Anglo American plc shares on the market and 
have granted to Tenon the right to nominate a third party (which may include Anglo American plc but not any of its subsidiaries) to take transfer of the Anglo 
American plc shares each has purchased on the market. Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including 
associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the 
Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market. These payments by Tenon were 
sourced from the cash resources of AASA. Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average 
amount of $3.95 per share to Epoch, $6.15 per share to Epoch Two and $5.10 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively 
incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party. These funds will then become available for redemption of 
the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies. The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to 
Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares. 
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after 
tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax 
of Epoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, 
are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts. 
The Investment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2016 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 (2015: 112,300,129) Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.0% 
(2015: 8.0%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares) with a market value of $1,603 million (2015: $498 million). The Investment Companies 
are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.
The Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities. Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint 
or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Group considers that the agreement outlined above, including Tenon’s right to nominate the transferee of the 
Anglo American plc shares held by the Investment Companies, result in the Group having control over the Investment Companies as defined under IFRS 10. 
Accordingly, the Investment Companies are required to be consolidated by the Group.

Employee benefit trust
The provision of shares to certain of the Company’s share option and share incentive schemes may be facilitated by an employee benefit trust or settled by 
the issue of treasury shares. During 2016, 263,281 shares (2015: nil) from the trust were transferred to employees in settlement of share awards. Shares held 
by the trust are recorded as own shares, and the carrying value is shown as a reduction within shareholders’ equity. The employee benefit trust has waived the 
right to receive dividends on these shares. The costs of operating the trust are borne by the Group but are not material.
The market value of the 4,736,720 shares (2015: 1 share) held by the trust at 31 December 2016 was $67,609,894 (2015: $4).

34. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the Group has provided indemnities against certain liabilities 
as part of agreements for the sale or other disposal of business operations. Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability 
arising from the indemnities provided is remote.
The Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations. The Group has 
provided for the estimated cost of these activities.
No contingent liabilities were secured on the assets of the Group at 31 December 2016 or 31 December 2015.
Anglo American South Africa Limited (AASA)
AASA is named as one of 32 respondents in a consolidated class certification application filed in the South Gauteng High Court (Johannesburg) on behalf of 
former mineworkers (or their dependants or survivors) who allegedly contracted silicosis or tuberculosis as a result of having worked for various gold mining 
companies including some in which AASA was a shareholder and to which AASA provided various technical and administrative services. The High Court has 
certified two classes of claimants: those with silicosis or who died from silicosis and those with tuberculosis or who died from tuberculosis. AASA and other 
respondents are appealing the ruling.
AASA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold announced in November 2014 that they had formed an industry working group  
to address issues relating to compensation and medical care for occupational lung disease in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The companies are  
in the process of engaging all stakeholders on these matters, including government, organised labour, other mining companies and legal representatives  
of claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies. These legal proceedings are being defended. The industry working group is seeking a 
comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks that is fair to past and current employees and enables  
companies to continue to be competitive over the long term.
AASA was also a defendant in approximately 4,400 separate lawsuits filed in the North Gauteng High Court (Pretoria), which were referred to arbitration. 
These 4,400 claims (approximately 1,200 of which were separately instituted against AngloGold Ashanti) were settled by AASA and AngloGold Ashanti in 
2016, without admission of liability, for an amount which is not material to the Group.
35. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, joint operations, associates and joint ventures (see notes 37 and 40). Members of the Board 
and the Group Management Committee are considered to be related parties.
The Company and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sale, purchase and service transactions with joint operations, 
associates, joint ventures and others in which the Group has a material interest. These transactions are under terms that are no less favourable to the Group 
than those arranged with third parties.

38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting 
structures. The risk management processes of the Group’s independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Group’s own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 
31 December is as follows (subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk). See note 24 for liquidity risk.
Market risks
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay for its obligation. The Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises 
from these financial assets and is as follows:
US$ million 2016 2015
Cash and cash equivalents 6,051  6,895 
Trade and other receivables
(1)
 2,289  1,885 
Financial asset investments
(2)
 701  662 
Derivative financial assets 593  1,149 
 9,634  10,591 
(1) 
Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables.
(2) 
Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions 
approved by the Board. Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and 
Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity (in case of relationship banks) and fund size (in case of asset managers).
Given the diverse nature of the Group’s operations (both in relation to commodity markets and geographically), and the use of payment security instruments 
(including letters of credit from financial institutions), it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure 
spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction 
in the recoverability of the cash flows. Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 160 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
b) Commodity price risk
The Group’s earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Group’s policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be 
undertaken for strategic reasons. In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Group’s sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery  
to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements. The exposure of the 
Group’s financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows:

(2) 
Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are classified as part of normal sales and purchases and settled through physical delivery of the Group’s production are not 
marked to market.
c) Foreign exchange risk
As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US 
dollar revenue. The Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs. A strengthening 
of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Group’s underlying earnings. The Group’s policy is generally 
not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can 
be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional 
currency entities. The Group’s policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24. Net 
other financial liabilities (excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to 
derivatives hedging net debt) are $72 million. This includes net assets of $503 million denominated in US dollars and $215 million denominated in Brazilian 
real, and net liabilities of $212 million denominated in Australian dollars, $207 million denominated in Chilean pesos and $234 million denominated in  
South African rand. 
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities. The Group is principally 
exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Group’s policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with 
commodity prices. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt. Strategic hedging using fixed 
rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Group’s policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments (less than 
one year) in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24. Net other 
financial liabilities (excluding net debt related balances and cash in disposal groups, but including the debit valuation adjustment attributable to derivatives 
hedging net debt) of $72 million, are primarily non-interest bearing.

e) Financial instrument sensitivities
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables. The 
following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 December to changes in foreign currencies, commodity 
prices and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives 
portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December. 
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December. As a 
consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 • all income statement sensitivities also impact equity
 • for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move
 • no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes
 • no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed 
materially to offset one another
 • all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective
 • debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year
 • translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Group’s presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible 
changes in the relevant foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate.

Without the impact of capitalised interest, the Group’s sensitivity to a 50bps increase and decrease in LIBOR would be $57 million (2015: $61 million) loss and gain respectively.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including:
 • fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances
 • derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year
 • fluctuating cash balances
 • changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Group’s sales and operating costs, which are highly 
sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates. In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, 
interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 162 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) interpretations as adopted for use by the European Union, with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS and with the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom as applicable to 
periodic financial reporting. The financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of pension 
assets and liabilities and certain financial instruments. A summary of the 
principal Group accounting policies is set out below. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ 
from those estimates. 
As permitted by UK company law, the Group’s results are presented in 
US dollars, the currency in which its business is primarily conducted. 
Going concern 
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements continues to be adopted. Further details are contained in the 
Directors’ report on page 198. 
Basis of consolidation 
The financial statements incorporate a consolidation of the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies into line with 
those used by the Group. Intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation, where appropriate. 
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are presented 
in equity separately from the equity attributable to shareholders of the 
Company. Profit or loss and other comprehensive income are attributed to 
the shareholders of the Company and to non-controlling interests even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
Changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a change 
in control are accounted for in equity. The carrying amounts of the controlling 
and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by 
which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recorded directly in equity and attributed 
to the shareholders of the Company. 
39a. Revenue recognition 
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the 
fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, 
volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. A sale is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed. This is 
usually when title and insurance risk have passed to the customer and the 
goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location. 
Sales of metal concentrate are stated at their invoiced amount which is 
net of treatment and refining charges. Sales of certain commodities are 
provisionally priced such that the price is not settled until a predetermined 
future date and is based on the market price at that time. Revenue on these 
sales is initially recognised (when the above criteria are met) at the current 
market price. Provisionally priced sales are marked to market at each 
reporting date using the forward price for the period equivalent to that 
outlined in the contract. This mark-to-market adjustment is recognised in 
revenue, see note 4 for more information on provisional price adjustments. 
Revenues from the sale of material by-products are included within revenue. 
Where a by-product is not regarded as significant, revenue may be credited 
against the cost of sales. 
Revenue from services is recognised as services are rendered and accepted 
by the customer. Amounts billed to customers in respect of shipping and 
handling activities are classified as revenue where the Group is responsible 
for freight. In situations where the Group is acting as an agent, amounts billed 
to customers are offset against the relevant costs. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable. 
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ 
rights to receive payment have been established. 
39b. Borrowing costs 
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying assets 
in the course of construction is added to the capitalised cost of those projects 
under ‘Capital works in progress’, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds have been 
borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents 
the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a 
project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated 
using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings 
of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in 
the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
39c. Tax 
The tax expense includes the current tax and deferred tax charge recognised 
in the income statement. 
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction (other 
than in a business combination) that affects neither taxable profit nor 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date 
and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also taken directly to equity. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 163
Financial statements
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle 
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis in that taxation authority. 
39d. Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon 
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, 
a joint arrangement or an associate, which can be measured reliably, are 
recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is the fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent 
consideration and previously held non-controlling interests) less the fair 
value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets on acquisition. 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously 
held interests in the acquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date 
that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to the income statement, where such treatment would be 
appropriate if that interest were disposed of. 
Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination 
are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the 
acquisition date. 
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint operations is included within 
intangible assets. Goodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is 
included within the carrying value of the investment. 
Where the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of 
the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the acquisition, 
is recognised directly in the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially 
recorded at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the fair values of net 
assets recognised at acquisition. 
39e. Non-mining licences and other intangibles 
Non-mining licences and other intangibles are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised 
separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or 
legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, usually 
between 3 and 20 years, except goodwill and those intangible assets that are 
considered to have indefinite lives. For intangible assets with a finite life, the 
amortisation period is determined as the period over which the Group expects 
to obtain benefits from the asset, taking account of all relevant facts and 
circumstances including contractual lives and expectations about the 
renewal of contractual arrangements without significant incremental costs. 
An intangible asset is deemed to have an indefinite life when, based on an 
analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. 
Amortisation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are 
reviewed at least annually. 
39f. Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash 
generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from synergies of the 
combination, and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
by the Group’s board of directors for internal management purposes. The 
recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. 
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Impairment of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. 
39g. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost is the fair value of 
consideration required to acquire and develop the asset and includes the 
purchase price, acquisition of mineral rights, costs directly attributable to 
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of 
any decommissioning obligation and, for assets that take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for their intended use, borrowing costs.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. The gain 
or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Mining properties are depreciated to their residual values using the unit of 
production method based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and, in 
certain limited circumstances, other Mineral Resources included in the Life 
of Mine Plan. These other Mineral Resources are included in depreciation 
calculations where, taking into account historical rates of conversion to Ore 
Reserves, there is a high degree of confidence that they will be extracted 
in an economic manner. This is the case principally for diamond operations, 
where depreciation calculations are based on Diamond Reserves and 
Diamond Resources included in the Life of Mine Plan. This reflects the unique 
nature of diamond deposits where, due to the difficulty in estimating grade, 
Life of Mine Plans frequently include significant amounts of Indicated or 
Inferred Resources.
Buildings and items of plant and equipment for which the consumption of 
economic benefit is linked primarily to utilisation or to throughput rather 
than production, are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, or the Reserve Life, 
whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives normally vary from up to 20 years 
for items of plant and equipment to a maximum of 50 years for buildings. 
Under limited circumstances, items of plant and equipment may be 
depreciated over a period that exceeds the Reserve Life by taking into 
account additional Mineral Resources other than Proved and Probable 
Reserves included in the Life of Mine Plan, after making allowance for 
expected production losses based on historical rates of resource conversion. 
‘Capital works in progress’ are measured at cost less any recognised 
impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management, at which point they are 
transferred to the appropriate asset class. 
Land is not depreciated. 
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components). 
Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are 
reviewed at least annually. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
39h. Deferred stripping 
The removal of rock or soil overlying a mineral deposit, overburden, and other 
waste materials is often necessary during the initial development of an open 
pit mine site, in order to access the orebody. The process of removing 
overburden and other mine waste materials is referred to as stripping. The 
directly attributable cost of this activity is capitalised in full within ‘Mining 
properties and leases’, until the point at which the mine is considered to be 
capable of operating in the manner intended by management. This is 
classified as expansionary capital expenditure, within investing cash flows.
The removal of waste material after the point at which depreciation 
commences is referred to as production stripping. When the waste removal 
activity improves access to ore extracted in the current period, the costs of 
production stripping are charged to the income statement as operating costs 
in accordance with the principles of IAS 2 Inventories. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 164 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Where production stripping activity both produces inventory and improves 
access to ore in future periods the associated costs of waste removal are 
allocated between the two elements. The portion that benefits future ore 
extraction is capitalised within ‘Mining properties and leases’. This is classified 
as stripping and development capital expenditure, within investing cash 
flows. If the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is 
determined based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected 
volume for the identified component of the orebody. Components are specific 
volumes of a mine’s orebody that are determined by reference to the Life of 
Mine Plan. 
In certain instances significant levels of waste removal may occur during the 
production phase with little or no associated production. This may occur at 
both open pit and underground mines, for example longwall development. 
The cost of this waste removal is capitalised in full to ‘Mining properties 
and leases’. 
All amounts capitalised in respect of waste removal are depreciated using the 
unit of production method based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves of 
the component of the orebody to which they relate. 
The effects of changes to the Life of Mine Plan on the expected cost of waste 
removal or remaining Ore Reserves for a component are accounted for 
prospectively as a change in estimate.
39i. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If such an indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of any impairment. Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is 
an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value 
in use (VIU). In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income 
statement. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment been 
recognised for the asset or CGU. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement. 
39j. Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is expensed in the year in which it 
is incurred. 
Exploration expenditure is the cost of exploring for Mineral Resources other 
than that occurring at existing operations and projects and comprises 
geological and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling and sampling and 
resource development. 
Evaluation expenditure includes the cost of conceptual and pre-feasibility 
studies and evaluation of Mineral Resources at existing operations. 
When a decision is taken that a mining project is technically feasible and 
commercially viable, usually after a pre-feasibility study has been completed, 
subsequent directly attributable expenditure, including feasibility study costs, 
are considered development expenditure and are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment.
Exploration properties acquired are recognised in the balance sheet when 
management considers that their value is recoverable. These properties are 
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
39k. Associates and joint arrangements 
Associates are investments over which the Group has significant influence, 
which is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee, but without the ability to exercise control or joint 
control. Typically the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity 
of its associates. 
Joint arrangements are arrangements in which the Group shares joint control 
with one or more parties. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, and exists only when decisions about the activities 
that significantly affect the arrangement’s returns require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control. 
Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures 
based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. In joint 
operations, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities relating to the arrangement, whereas in joint ventures, the parties 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
Joint arrangements that are not structured through a separate vehicle are 
always joint operations. Joint arrangements that are structured through a 
separate vehicle may be either joint operations or joint ventures depending 
on the substance of the arrangement. In these cases, consideration is given 
to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual 
arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. When the 
activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output 
to the parties, and the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows 
contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this 
indicates that the parties to the arrangements have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities. 
The Group accounts for joint operations by recognising the assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses for which it has rights or obligations, including its share 
of such items held or incurred jointly. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale. The 
Group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ net income is based on their 
most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim statements 
drawn up to the Group’s balance sheet date. 
The total carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures 
represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of 
goodwill, the share of post acquisition retained earnings, any other 
movements in reserves and any long term debt interests which in substance 
form part of the Group’s net investment. The carrying values of associates 
and joint ventures are reviewed on a regular basis and if there is objective 
evidence that an impairment in value has occurred as a result of one or more 
events during the period, the investment is impaired. 
The Group’s share of an associate’s or joint venture’s losses in excess of its 
interest in that associate or joint venture is not recognised unless the Group 
has an obligation to fund such losses. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the 
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised 
losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment. 
39l. Financial asset investments 
Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements  
and associates, are financial asset investments and are initially recognised  
at fair value. At subsequent reporting dates, financial assets classified as 
held-to-maturity or as loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, 
less any impairment losses. Other investments are classified as either at fair 
value through profit or loss (which includes investments held for trading) or 
available for sale financial assets. Both categories are subsequently 
measured at fair value. Where investments are held for trading purposes, 
unrealised gains and losses for the period are included in the income 
statement within other gains and losses. For available for sale investments, 
unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the investment is 
disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement.

Financial statements
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
39m. Impairment of financial assets (including receivables) 
A financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss is assessed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence 
that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates 
that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost 
is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present 
value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. Losses are recognised in the income statement. When a 
subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the 
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement. 
Impairment losses relating to available for sale investments are recognised 
when a decline in fair value is considered significant or prolonged. These 
impairment losses are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has 
been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the income 
statement. The loss recognised in the income statement is the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value. 
39n. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and 
commodity price risk, the Group enters into forward, option and swap 
contracts. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. Commodity based (own use) contracts that meet 
the scope exemption in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement are recognised in earnings when they are settled by 
physical delivery. 
All derivatives are held at fair value in the balance sheet within ‘Derivative 
financial assets’ or ‘Derivative financial liabilities’ except if they are linked 
to settlement and delivery of an unquoted equity instrument and the fair 
value cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are carried at cost. 
A derivative cannot be measured reliably where the range of reasonable fair 
value estimates is significant and the probabilities of various estimates cannot 
be reasonably assessed. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows (cash flow hedges) 
are recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is 
recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in 
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. 
The corresponding entry and gains or losses arising from remeasuring the 
associated derivative are recognised in the income statement. 
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion 
of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity (within the cumulative 
translation adjustment reserve). The ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated in the 
cumulative translation adjustment reserve are recycled to the income 
statement on disposal of the foreign operations to which they relate. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained until the forecast transaction 
occurs. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to the 
income statement for the period. 
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated 
in a hedge relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement 
and are classified within other gains and losses (operating costs) or net 
finance costs depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-financial 
host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and 
the host contracts themselves are not carried at fair value with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the income statement. 
39o. Cash and debt 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits, 
together with short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within short term borrowings in 
current liabilities on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash 
flow statement are shown net of overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at amortised cost. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified and accounted for 
as debt or equity according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. 
Borrowings 
Interest bearing borrowings and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair 
value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue 
costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest 
method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
39p. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from 
the asset has expired, the right to receive cash flows has been retained but 
an obligation to on-pay them in full without material delay has been assumed 
or the right to receive cash flows has been transferred together with 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the associated obligation has been 
discharged, cancelled or has expired. 
39q. Inventories 
Inventory and work in progress are measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The production cost of inventory includes an appropriate 
proportion of depreciation and production overheads. Cost is determined 
on the following basis: 
 • Raw materials and consumables are measured at cost on a first in, first out 
(FIFO) basis or a weighted average cost basis. 
 • Work in progress and finished products are measured at raw material cost, 
labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses. 
 • Metal and coal stocks are included within finished products and are 
measured at average cost. 
At precious metals operations that produce ‘joint products’, cost is allocated 
amongst products according to the ratio of contribution of these metals to 
gross sales revenues. 
39r. Environmental restoration and decommissioning 
obligations 
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and 
decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of a mining asset. Such costs arising 
from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, 
discounted to their net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the 
start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. 
These costs are recognised in the income statement over the life of the 
operation, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the 
discount on the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at 
their net present values and recognised in the income statement as 
extraction progresses.  166 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of 
plant or other site preparation work (that result from changes in the estimated 
timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added 
to or deducted from the cost of the related asset in the current period. If a 
decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the asset value is 
increased and there is an indication that the revised carrying value is not 
recoverable, an impairment test is performed in accordance with the 
accounting policy set out above. 
For some South African operations annual contributions are made to 
dedicated environmental rehabilitation trusts to fund the estimated cost of 
rehabilitation during and at the end of the life of the relevant mine. The Group 
exercises full control of these trusts and therefore the trusts are consolidated. 
The trusts’ assets are disclosed separately on the balance sheet as  
non-current assets. 
The trusts’ assets are measured based on the nature of the underlying assets 
in accordance with accounting policies for similar assets. 
39s. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is met only when a sale is highly 
probable within one year from the date of classification, management is 
committed to the sale and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale from 
the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resulting impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement. 
On classification as held for sale the assets are no longer depreciated. 
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
39t. Retirement benefits 
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension 
plans for its employees as well as post employment medical plans. For 
defined contribution plans the amount recognised in the income statement 
is the contributions paid or payable during the year. 
For defined benefit pension and post employment medical plans, full actuarial 
valuations are carried out at least every three years using the projected unit 
credit method and updates are performed for each financial year end. The 
average discount rate for the plans’ liabilities is based on AA rated corporate 
bonds of a suitable duration and currency or, where there is no deep market 
for such bonds, is based on government bonds. Pension plan assets are 
measured using year end market values. 
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, movements in asset 
surplus restrictions and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest 
income) are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive 
income and are not recycled to the income statement. Any increase in the 
present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service 
during the year is charged to operating profit. The net interest income or cost 
on the net defined benefit asset or liability is included in investment income or 
interest expense respectively. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits 
are already vested and otherwise amortised on a straight line basis over the 
average period until the benefits vest. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet represents 
the present value of the deficit or surplus of the defined benefit plans. Any 
recognised surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds or 
reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
39u. Share-based payments 
The Group makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, 
which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market related 
vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method 
at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market 
vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. 
For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the 
market value of the shares at the grant date. For all share schemes with 
non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken 
into account when determining the relevant charge. Vesting assumptions 
are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect 
current expectations. 
39v. Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transactions 
Where the Group disposes of a portion of a South African based subsidiary 
or operation to a BEE company at a discount to fair value, the transaction is 
considered to be a share-based payment (in line with the principle contained 
in South Africa interpretation AC 503 Accounting for Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) Transactions). 
The discount provided or value given is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 
and the cost, representing the fair value of the BEE credentials obtained by 
the subsidiary, is recorded in the income statement. 
39w. Foreign currency transactions and translation 
Foreign currency transactions by Group companies are recognised in the 
functional currencies of the companies at the exchange rate ruling on the date 
of the transaction. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in 
the income statement for the period and are classified as either operating or 
financing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates 
prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at 
the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate the rates 
at the dates of the transactions. Any exchange differences arising are 
classified within the statement of comprehensive income and transferred to 
the Group’s cumulative translation adjustment reserve. Exchange differences 
on foreign currency balances with foreign operations for which settlement is 
neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, and therefore 
form part of the Group’s net investment in these foreign operations, are offset 
in the cumulative translation adjustment reserve. 
Cumulative translation differences are recycled from equity and recognised 
as income or expense on disposal of the operation to which they relate. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign 
entities are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the  
closing rate. 
39x. Leases 
In addition to lease contracts, other significant contracts are assessed to 
determine whether, in substance, they are or contain a lease. This includes 
assessment of whether the arrangement is dependent on use of a specific 
asset and the right to use that asset is conveyed through the contract. 
Rental costs under operating leases are recognised in the income statement 
in equal annual amounts over the lease term.

Financial statements
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY
3) Accounting policies: Anglo American plc (the Company)
The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards 
100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements (FRS 100) and 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 101 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to 
exercise judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the statement of comprehensive income of the Company is not presented as part of these financial 
statements. 
Significant accounting policies
Investments
Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Financial Instruments
The Company recognises financial instruments when it becomes a party to the contractual arrangements of the instrument. Financial instruments are 
de-recognised when they are discharged or when the contractual terms expire.
Dividends
Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid. Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market related vesting 
conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting 
conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the 
shares at the grant date. For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the 
relevant charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings. Equity settled share-based 
payments that are made to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a 
corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included in the Company financial statements are set out in note 28 to the 
Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016. 178 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016

ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES
 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 181
INTRODUCTION
The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this  
Annual Report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc 
(AA plc) Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves standard. This standard requires that the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 
2012 edition (the JORC Code) be used as a minimum standard. Some 
Anglo American plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa 
where public reporting is carried out in accordance with the South African 
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (the SAMREC Code). The SAMREC Code is similar to the  
JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology 
appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC (2012) 
and SAMREC (2007 Edition as amended July 2009) Codes. Ore Reserves 
in the context of this Annual Report have the same meaning as ‘Mineral 
Reserves’ as defined by the SAMREC Code and the CIM (Canadian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy) Definition Standards on Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared 
by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the  
JORC or SAMREC Codes. All Competent Persons have sufficient 
experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit  
under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. All  
the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the 
information in the form and context in which it appears. The names of  
the Competent Persons (CPs) along with their Recognised Professional 
Organisation (RPO) affiliation and years of relevant experience are listed  
in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Report 2016.
Anglo American Group companies are subject to a comprehensive 
programme of reviews aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore 
Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The reviews are conducted by 
suitably qualified Competent Persons from within the Anglo American 
Group, or by independent consultants. The frequency and depth of the 
reviews is a function of the perceived risks and/or uncertainties associated 
with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource. The overall value of 
the entity and time that has lapsed since an independent third-party review 
is also considered. Those operations/projects that were subjected to 
independent third-party reviews during the year are indicated in footnotes 
to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require due consideration of reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction for Mineral Resource 
definition. These include long-range commodity price forecasts which  
are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future 
supply and demand and long term economic outlooks. The calculation  
of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are based on long term 
prices determined at the beginning of the second quarter each year. Ore 
Reserves are dynamic and are more likely to be affected by fluctuations in 
the prices of commodities, uncertainties in production costs, processing 
costs and other mining, infrastructure, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors which may impact the financial condition and 
prospects of the Group. Mineral Resource estimates also change and  
tend to be influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the 
understanding of the deposit and secondly by the conversion to Ore 
Reserves. Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional  
to (exclusive of) those resources converted to Ore Reserves and are 
reported on a dry tonnes basis.
The appropriate Mineral Resource classification is determined by the 
appointed Competent (or Qualified) Persons. The choice of appropriate 
category of Mineral Resource depends upon the quantity, distribution and 
quality of geoscientific information available and the level of confidence in 
these data.
To accommodate the various factors that are important in the development 
of a classified Mineral Resource estimate, a scorecard approach is 
generally used. Mineral Resource classification defines the confidence 
associated with different parts of the Mineral Resource. The confidence 
that is assigned refers collectively to the reliability of the Grade and 
Tonnage estimates. This reliability includes consideration for the fidelity  
of the base data, the geological continuity predicated by the level of 
understanding of the geology, the likely precision of the estimated grades 
and understanding of grade variability, as well as various other factors  
(in particular density) that may influence the confidence that can be  
placed on the Mineral Resource. Most business units have developed 
commodity-specific scorecard-based approaches to the classification  
of their Mineral Resources.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are stated as  
at 31 December 2016. The figures in the tables have been rounded and,  
if used to derive totals and averages, minor differences with stated results 
could occur. 
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report 2016 should be 
considered the only valid source of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource 
information for the Anglo American group exclusive of Kumba Iron Ore  
and Anglo American Platinum Limited which publish their own 
independent annual reports.
It is accepted that mine design and planning may include some  
Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources in the Life of  
Mine Plan (LOM Plan) are described as ‘Inferred (in LOM Plan)’ separately  
from the remaining Inferred Mineral Resources described as ‘Inferred  
(ex. LOM Plan)’, as required. These resources are declared without 
application of any Modifying Factors. Reserve Life reflects the scheduled 
extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved  
Life of Mine Plan.
The Ownership (Attributable) Percentage that Anglo American holds in 
each operation and project is presented beside the name of each entity. 
Operations and projects which fall below the internal threshold for 
reporting (25% attributable interest) are excluded from the Ore Reserves 
and Mineral Resources estimates. Operations which were disposed of 
during 2016 and hence not reported are: Kimberley Mines (Diamonds), 
Rustenburg Mines (Platinum), Boa Vista (Niobium), Chapadão 
(Phosphates), Callide and Foxleigh (Coal).
In South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development  
Act, Number 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) was implemented on 1 May 2004 
(subsequently amended by the Minerals and Petroleum Resources 
Development Amendment Act 49 of 2008) effectively transferred 
custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State. 
A Prospecting Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA that is valid for 
up to five years, with the possibility of a further extension of three years. 
A Mining Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA and is valid for  
up to 30 years, with the possibility of a further extension of 30 years. The 
Minister of Mineral Resources will grant a renewal of the Mining Right if the 
terms and conditions of the Mining Right have been complied with and the 
applicant is not in contravention of any relevant provisions of the MPRDA.
In preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement for  
South African assets, Anglo American plc has adopted the following 
reporting principles in respect of Prospecting Rights and Mining Rights:
 • Where applications for Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been 
submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory

Mining method: OP = Open Pit, UG = Underground, OC = Open Cast/Cut, MM = Marine Mining. TMR = Tailings Mineral Resource. Operations = Mines in steady-state or in ramp-up phase. 
 
* Capcoal comprises opencast operations at Lake Lindsay and Oak Park, with an underground longwall operation at Grasstree. 
(1) 
Estimated Ore Reserves are the sum of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves (on an exclusive basis, i.e. Mineral Resources are reported as additional to  
Ore Reserves unless otherwise stated). Please refer to the detailed Ore Reserve estimates tables in the AA plc R&R Report for the individual Proved and 
Probable Reserve estimates. The Ore Reserve estimates are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves (The JORC Code, 2012) as a minimum standard. Ore Reserve estimates for operations in South Africa are reported in accordance 
with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended 
July 2009). The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves. Anglo American plc ownership is stated separately. Rounding of figures may cause 
computational discrepancies. 
(2) 
Reserve Life = The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan. 
LOM = Life of Mine (years) is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning.
(3) 
DBCi = De Beers Canada, DBCM = De Beers Consolidated Mines, Debswana = Debswana Diamond Company, Namdeb = Namdeb Holdings. 
k¢ = thousand carats. M¢ = million carats. k m² = thousand square metres.  
Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes (cpht) or as carats per square metre (cpm²).  
Reported Diamond Reserves are based on a Bottom Cut-off (BCO) which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 1.00mm and 3.00mm 
(nominal square mesh). Specific BCO’s applied to derive estimates are included in the detailed Diamond Reserve tables in the AA plc R&R Report. 
Snap Lake has been placed on Care & Maintenance. Damtshaa will resume production in H2 2017.  
No Diamond Reserves reported for Letlhakane Kimberlite as mining is now scheduled exclusively from Inferred Resources hence one year LOM.
(4) 
Estimates reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.  
Details of the individual operations appear in the Anglo American Platinum Limited Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Report.  
4E is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold. 
(5) 
TCu = Total Copper.
(6) 
Saleable Product tonnes are reported on a wet basis (average moisture content is 9.0 wt% of the wet mass) with quality stated on a dry basis.
(7) 
GEMCO Manganese grades are reported as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields, see page 29 in the AA plc 
R&R Report.
(8) 
Total Saleable Tonnes represents the product tonnes produced quoted as metric tonnes on a Product moisture basis. The coal quality for Coal Reserves is 
quoted as either kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg) or Crucible Swell Number (CSN). Kilocalories per kilogram represent Calorific Value (CV) on a Gross 
As Received (GAR) basis. CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal/kg and CSN to the nearest 0.5 index.  
Metallurgical – Coking: High-, medium- or low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry.  
Metallurgical – Other: Semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection (PCI) or other general 
metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal.  
Thermal – Export: Low- to high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation; quality measured by calorific value (CV). 
Thermal – Domestic: Low- to high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation.  
Synfuel: Coal specifically for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals.  
Peace River Coal (Trend and Roman Mountain Mines) has been placed on Care & Maintenance. ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

to produce the reported Coal Reserves. Coal Resources are reported on an in situ moisture basis. The coal quality for Coal Resources is quoted on an in situ heat 
content as kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), representing Calorific Value (CV) on a Gross As Received (GAR) basis. CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal/kg. 186 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
Ore Reserves
An ‘Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or 
Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances 
for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is 
defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that 
include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at 
the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. ‘Modifying 
Factors’ are (realistically assumed) considerations used to convert Mineral 
Resources to Ore Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, 
processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors. Ore Reserves are sub-
divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and 
Proved Ore Reserves.
A ‘Proved Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of a Measured 
Mineral Resource. A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of confidence 
in the Modifying Factors.
A ‘Probable Ore Reserve’ is the economically mineable part of an Indicated,  
and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in 
the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that 
applying to a Proved Ore Reserve. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level 
of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve 
as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit.
Mineral Resources
A ‘Mineral Resource’ is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of 
economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade (or quality), 
and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade (or quality), continuity and other 
geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge, including 
sampling. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing 
geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape, and physical characteristics are 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying 
Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade 
(or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples 
are gathered.
A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that 
applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral 
Resource. It may be converted to a Proved Ore Reserve or under certain 
circumstances to a Probable Ore Reserve.
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity, grade (or quality), densities, shape and physical characteristics are 
estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying 
Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from 
adequately detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing gathered 
through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to assume geological and grade 
(or quality) continuity between points of observation where data and samples 
are gathered.
An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that 
applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to 
a Probable Ore Reserve.
An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which 
quantity and grade (or quality) are estimated on the basis of limited geological 
evidence and sampling. Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not 
verify geological and grade (or quality) continuity. It is based on exploration, 
sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that 
applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to 
an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred 
Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with 
continued exploration.
Life of Mine Plan (LOM Plan)
A design and costing study of an existing operation in which appropriate 
assessments have been made of realistically assumed geological, mining, 
processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social, governmental, engineering, operational and all other 
Modifying Factors, which are considered in sufficient detail to demonstrate 
at the time of reporting that extraction is reasonably justified.
Reserve Life
The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the 
approved LOM Plan.
Inferred (in LOM Plan)
Inferred Resources within the scheduled LOM Plan.
Inferred (ex. LOM Plan)
The portion of Inferred Resources with reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction not considered in the LOM Plan.
Fatal-injury frequency rate (FIFR) 
FIFR is the number of employee or contractor fatal injuries due to all causes 
per 200,000 hours worked. 
Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 
LTIFR is the number of lost time injuries (LTIs) for both employees and 
contractors per 200,000 hours worked. An LTI is a work related injury 
resulting in the person being unable to attend work or perform the routine 
functions of his/her job, on the next calendar day after the day of the injury, 
whether a scheduled workday or not. Restricted work cases are therefore 
counted as LTIs. 
Total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR) 
TRCFR is the number of fatal injuries, lost time injuries and medical treatment 
cases for both employees and contractors per 200,000 hours. 
New cases of occupational disease (NCOD) 
NCOD is the sum of occupational diseases due to asbestosis, noise-induced 
hearing loss, silicosis, coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive 
airways disease, occupational tuberculosis, occupational asthma, hand/arm 
vibration syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, dermatitis, occupational 
cancers and other occupational diseases. 
Total energy consumed 
Total amount of energy consumed is the sum of total energy from electricity 
purchased, total energy from fossil fuels and total energy from renewable 
fuels and is measured in million gigajoules (GJ). 
Total new water consumed 
Total amount of water used is the total new or make-up water entering the 
operation and used for the operation’s primary operational activities and is 
measured in million m

Greenhouse gases (GHGs)
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 report (as updated in 
2011) factors are applied as defaults for all carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO
2
e) 
and energy calculations. Where emission factors are available for specific 
countries or sub-regions from government and regulatory authorities, these 
are applied. Australian operations apply conversion factors required by the 
government for regulatory reporting and operations in Brazil apply local 
factors for biomass and biofuel. Factors for CO
2
e from electricity are based 
on local grid factors. 
Based on a self-assessment, Anglo American believes it reports in 
accordance with the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol, as issued prior to the 2015 
revision on Scope 2 emissions reporting. In line with the GHG Protocol’s 
‘management control’ boundary, 100% of the direct and indirect emissions 
for managed operations are accounted for while zero emissions for joint 
ventures and other investments are included in the reporting scope.
Level 3, 4 and 5 environmental incidents
Environmental incidents are unplanned or unwanted events resulting from 
our operations that adversely impact the environment or contravene local 
regulations/permit conditions. They are classified from minor (Level 1) to 
significant (Level 5) depending on the duration and extent of impact, as well 
as the sensitivity and/or biodiversity value of the receiving environment. 
Level 3-5 incidents are those which we consider to have prolonged impacts 
on the local environments, lasting in excess of one month and affecting areas 
greater than several hundred metres on site, or extending beyond the 
boundaries of our immediate operations.
Total amount spent on corporate social investment (CSI)
Categories for corporate social investment expenditure include charitable 
donations, community investment and commercial initiatives. CSI is reported in 
US dollars and converted from currency of the operations at the average foreign 
exchange rate applied by Anglo American for financial reporting purposes.
Charitable donations include cash donations, contributions in kind, employees’ 
working hours spent on charity projects during work hours, and the cost of initiatives 
designed to inform communities about community-benefit initiatives (e.g. the 
production of reports that are issued to communities for the purpose of reporting 
progress). Not included is expenditure that is necessary for the development of an 
operation (e.g. resettlement of families) or receiving a licence. T raining expenditure 
for individuals who will be employed by the company following completion of training 
is not included. 
Community investment includes the funding of community partnerships which 
address social issues, the costs of providing public facilities to community members 
who are not employees or dependants, the marginal value of land or other assets 
transferred to community ownership, and income creation schemes or mentoring/
volunteering initiatives which do not have a principally commercial justification.
Commercial initiatives include enterprise development and other community 
initiatives/partnerships that also directly support the success of the Company 
(such as supplier development). There must, however be a clear and primary 
element of public benefit. 
We prohibit the making of donations for political purposes to any politician, 
political party or related organisation, an official of a political party or candidate 
for political office in any circumstances either directly or through third parties.
Jobs created/sustained through enterprise development 
initiatives in Chile
In Chile, Anglo American supports jobs through training and mentoring 
programmes. On an annual basis, we report the number of entrepreneurs 
who have been provided support through our local partner, TechnoServe. 
The associated programmes are engaged in ongoing monitoring and data 
is reported at the end of the reporting period. 
Businesses supported through enterprise development 
initiatives in South Africa
Anglo American supports a range of entrepreneurs and small and medium 
enterprises in South Africa through the issuance of micro-finance loans. 
Businesses supported are enterprises for which funding has been approved 
and made available by the Zimele investment committee in the reporting year.  188 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
OTHER INFORMATION
Introduction
When assessing and discussing the Group’s reported financial performance, 
financial position and cash flows, management makes reference to 
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) of historical or future financial 
performance, financial position or cash flows that are not defined or specified 
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The APMs used by the Group fall into two categories:
 • Financial APMs: These financial measures are usually derived from the 
financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS. Certain financial 
measures cannot be directly derived from the financial statements as they 
contain additional information, such as financial information from earlier 
periods or profit estimates or projections. The accounting policies applied 
when calculating APMs are, where relevant and unless otherwise stated, the 
same as those disclosed in the Group’s Consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2016.
 • Non-financial APMs: These measures incorporate certain non-financial 
information which management believes is useful when assessing the 
performance of the Group.
APMs are not uniformly defined by all companies, including those in the 
Group’s industry. Accordingly, the APMs used by the Group may not be 
comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other 
companies. 
APMs should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or as 
superior to, measures of financial performance, financial position or cash 
flows reported in accordance with IFRS.
Purpose 
The Group uses APMs to improve the comparability of information between 
reporting periods and business units, either by adjusting for uncontrollable or 
one-off factors which impact upon IFRS measures or, by aggregating 
measures, to aid the user of the Annual Report in understanding the activity 
taking place across the Group’s portfolio.
Their use is driven by characteristics particularly visible in the mining sector: 
1. Earnings volatility: The Group mines and markets commodities and 
precious metals and minerals. The sector is characterised by significant 
volatility in earnings driven by movements in macroeconomic factors, 
primarily price and foreign exchange. This volatility is outside the control of 
management and can mask underlying changes in performance. As such, 
when comparing year-on-year performance, management excludes 
certain non-recurring items (such as those classed as ‘special items’) to aid 
comparability and then quantifies and isolates uncontrollable factors in 
order to improve understanding of the controllable portion of variances.
2. Nature of investment: Investments in the sector typically occur over several 
years and are large, requiring significant funding before generating cash. 
These investments are often made with partners and the nature of the 
Group’s ownership interest affects how the financial results of these 
operations are reflected in the Group’s results e.g. whether full 
consolidation (subsidiaries), consolidation of the Group’s attributable 
assets and liabilities (joint operations) or equity accounted (associates and 
joint ventures). Attributable metrics are therefore presented to help 
demonstrate the financial performance and returns available to the Group, 
for investment and financing activities, excluding the effect of different 
accounting treatments for different ownership interests.
3. Portfolio complexity: The Group operates in a number of different, but 
complementary commodities, precious metals and minerals. The cost, 
value of and return from each saleable unit (e.g. tonne, pound, carat, 
ounce) can differ materially between each business. This makes 
understanding both the overall portfolio performance, and the relative 
performance of its constituent parts on a like-for-like basis, more 
challenging. The Group therefore uses composite APMs to provide a 
consistent metric to assess performance at the portfolio level.
Consequently, APMs are used by the Board and management for planning 
and reporting. A subset is also used by management in setting director and 
management remuneration. The measures are also used in discussions with 
the investment analyst community and credit rating agencies.

Group revenue includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint 
ventures’ revenue.
A reconciliation to ‘Revenue’, the closest equivalent IFRS measure to Group 
revenue is provided within note 3 to the Consolidated financial statements.
Underlying EBIT
Underlying EBIT is ‘Operating profit/(loss)’ presented before special items 
and remeasurements
(1)
 and includes the Group’s attributable share of 
associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT. Underlying EBIT of associates 
and joint ventures is the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint

Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation 
and includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ 
underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation. 
A reconciliation to ‘Profit/(loss) before net finance (costs)/income and tax’, 
the closest equivalent IFRS measure to underlying EBITDA, is provided within 
note 3 to the Consolidated financial statements.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings is ‘Profit/(loss) for the financial year attributable to equity 
shareholders of the Company’ before special items and remeasurements
(1)
 
and is therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax expense and 
non-controlling interests.
A reconciliation to ‘Profit/(loss) for the financial year attributable to equity 
shareholders of the Company’, the closest equivalent IFRS measure to 
underlying earnings, is provided within note 9 to the Consolidated financial 
statements.
Underlying effective tax rate
The underlying effective tax rate equates to the income tax expense, before 
special items and remeasurements
(1)
 and including the Group’s share of 
associates’ and joint ventures’ tax before special items and remeasurements,
(1)
 
divided by profit before tax before special items and remeasurements

Underlying earnings per share
Basic and diluted underlying earnings per share are calculated as underlying 
earnings divided by the basic or diluted shares in issue. The calculation of 
underlying earnings per share is disclosed within note 9 to the Consolidated 
financial statements.
Net debt
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents 
(including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt, see note 
19, before taking into account the effect of debit valuation adjustments 
explained in note 18). A reconciliation to the Consolidated balance sheet is 
provided within note 23 to the Consolidated financial statements.
(1) 
Special items and remeasurements are defined in note 6 to the Consolidated financial 
statements.
Capital expenditure (capex)
Capital expenditure is defined as cash expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment, including related derivatives, and is presented net of proceeds from 
disposal of property, plant and equipment and includes direct funding for capital 
expenditure from non-controlling interests in order to match more closely the 
way in which it is managed. A reconciliation to ‘Expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment’, the closest equivalent IFRS measure to capital expenditure, 
is provided within note 22 to the Consolidated financial statements.
Operating cash flows generated by operations that have not yet reached 
commercial production are also included in capital expenditure. However, 
capital expenditure is also periodically shown on an underlying basis i.e. 
before inclusion of capitalised operating cash flows. Where this occurs, the 
measure is footnoted as such.
Attributable return on capital employed (ROCE)
ROCE is a ratio that measures the efficiency and profitability of a company’s 
capital investments. Attributable ROCE displays how effectively assets are 
generating profit on invested capital for the equity shareholders of the 
Company. It is calculated as attributable underlying EBIT divided by average 
attributable capital employed. 
Attributable underlying EBIT excludes the underlying EBIT of non-controlling 
interests. 
Capital employed is defined as net assets excluding net debt and financial asset 
investments. Attributable capital employed excludes capital employed of 
non-controlling interests. Average attributable capital employed is calculated 
by adding the opening and closing attributable capital employed for the relevant 
period and dividing by two. 
Attributable ROCE is also used as an incentive measure in executives’ 
remuneration and is predicated upon the achievement of ROCE targets in the 
final year of a three year performance period. It is one of the performance 
measures used in LTIP 15 and LTIP 16 and is proposed to be used in LTIP 17. 
Capital employed by segment is disclosed in note 3 to the Consolidated 
financial statements.
Driving Value ROCE
Driving Value ROCE is used for the measurement of LTIP 14 only. It is 
calculated using Attributable ROCE adjusted for non-recurring items that do 
not impact cash performance: 
 • Impairments announced after 10 December 2013 are added back to total 
capital employed (unless the impairment resulted from the asset being 
taken out of service). 
 • Earnings and return impacts from impairments (due to reduced 
depreciation or amortisation expense) are excluded from earnings. 
 • The De Beers fair value uplift which resulted from the revaluing upward of 
the Group’s 45% share in De Beers, owned at the time of acquisition of a 
further 40% in 2012, is removed from 2012 capital employed onwards.
Attributable free cash flow
Attributable free cash flow is calculated as ‘Cash flows from operations’ plus 
dividends received from associates, joint ventures and financial asset 
investments, less capital expenditure, less tax cash payments excluding tax 
payments relating to disposals, less net interest paid including interest on 
derivatives hedging net debt, less dividends paid to non-controlling interests.
A reconciliation of ‘Cash flows from operations’, the closest equivalent IFRS 
measure, is provided on page 38 of the Group Financial Review. 190 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016

the purpose of the measure is not typically covered by IFRS. 
Group APM Category Purpose
Copper equivalent production Portfolio complexity Communicate production/revenue generation movements in a single comparable measure 
removing the impact of price
Unit cost Earnings volatility Express cost of producing one unit of saleable product
Copper equivalent unit cost Portfolio complexity Communicate the cost of production per unit in a single comparable measure for the portfolio
Productivity Portfolio complexity Highlight efficiency in generating revenue per employee
Volume and cash cost improvements Earnings volatility Quantify year-on-year EBITDA improvement removing the impact of major uncontrollable factors
Copper equivalent production
Copper equivalent production, expressed as copper equivalent tonnes, 
shows changes in underlying production volume. It is calculated by expressing 
each commodity’s volume as revenue, subsequently converting the revenue 
into copper equivalent units by dividing by the copper price (per tonne). 
Long-term forecast prices (and foreign exchange rates where appropriate) 
are used, in order that period-on-period comparisons exclude any impact for 
movements in price.
When calculating copper equivalent production, all volumes relating to 
domestic sales are excluded, as are volumes from Samancor and sales from 
non-mining activities. Volume from projects in pre-commercial production 
(e.g. Minas-Rio, Gahcho Kué) are included. 
Unit cost
Unit cost is the direct cash cost including direct cash support costs incurred 
in producing one unit of saleable production. 
For bulk products (coal, iron ore), unit costs shown are FOB i.e. cost on board 
at port. For base metals (copper, nickel), they are shown at C1 i.e. after 
inclusion of by-product credits and logistics costs. For platinum and 
diamonds, unit costs include all direct expensed cash costs incurred 
i.e. excluding, amongst other things, market development activity, corporate 
overhead etc. Platinum unit costs exclude by-product credits. Royalties are 
excluded from all unit cost calculations.
Copper equivalent unit cost
Copper equivalent unit cost is the cost incurred to produce one tonne of 
copper equivalent. Only the cost incurred in mined output from subsidiaries 
and joint operations is included, representing direct costs in the Consolidated 
income statement controllable by the Group. Costs and volumes from 
associates and joint ventures are excluded, as are those from operations that 
are not yet in commercial production, that deliver domestic production, and 
those associated with third-party volume purchases of diamonds and 
platinum concentrate. 
When calculating copper equivalent unit cost, unit costs for each commodity 
are multiplied by relevant production, combined and then divided by the total 
copper equivalent production, to get a copper equivalent unit cost i.e. the cost 
of mining one tonne of copper equivalent. The metric is in US dollars and, 
where appropriate, long-term foreign exchange rates are used to convert 
from local currency to US dollars.
Productivity
The Group’s productivity measure calculates the copper equivalent 
production generated per employee. It is a measure that represents how well 
headcount is driving revenue. It is calculated by dividing copper equivalent 
production by the average direct headcount from consolidated mining 
operations in a given year.
Volume and cash cost improvements
The Group uses an underlying EBITDA waterfall to understand its year-on-
year underlying EBITDA performance. The waterfall isolates the impact of 
uncontrollable factors in order that the real year-on-year improvement in 
performance can be seen by the user. 
Three variables are normalised, in the results of subsidiaries and joint 
operations, for:
 • Price: The movement in price between comparative periods is removed, by 
multiplying current year sales volume by the movement in realised price for 
each product group
 • Foreign exchange: The year-on-year movement in exchange is removed 
from the current year non-US dollar cost base i.e. costs are restated at prior 
year foreign exchange rates. The non-US dollar cash cost base excludes 
costs which are price linked (e.g. purchase of concentrate from third-party 
platinum providers, third-party diamond purchases)
 • Inflation: CPI is removed from cash costs, restating these costs at the 
pricing level of the base year.
The remaining variances in the underlying EBITDA waterfall are in real 
US dollar terms for the base year i.e. for a waterfall comparing 2016 with 2015, 
the sales volume and cash cost variances exclude the impact of price, foreign 
exchange and CPI and are hence in real 2015 terms. This allows the user of 
the waterfall to understand the underlying real movement in sales volumes 
and cash costs on a consistent basis.   Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 191

The 76.3% interest in Sishen Iron Ore Company (SIOC) is held indirectly through Kumba Iron Ore, in which the Group has a 69.7% interest. A 3.1% interest in SIOC was previously held by the 
Kumba Envision Trust for the benefit of participants in Kumba’s broad based employee share scheme for non-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees. The Trust met 
the definition of a subsidiary under IFRS, and was therefore consolidated by Kumba Iron Ore. The earlier mentioned interest in the Kumba Envision Trust is no longer held at year end due to the 
wind up of the Envision Trust in November 2016. Consequently the effective interest in SIOC included in the Group’s results is 53.2%.

Sustainable development
The Sustainability Report 2016 will be published online on 13 March 2017. 
This report focuses on the safety, sustainable development, health and 
environmental performance of the Group’s managed operations, its 
performance with regard to the Company’s Code of Conduct, and the 
operational dimensions of its social programmes. 
Audit information
The directors confirm that, so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditor is are unaware, and that all directors have 
taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information.
Employment and other policies
The Group’s key operating businesses are empowered to manage within the 
context of the different legislative and social demands of the diverse countries 
in which those businesses operate, subject to the standards embodied in 
Anglo American’s Code of Conduct. Within all the Group’s businesses, the 
safe and effective performance of employees and the maintenance of 
positive employee relations are of fundamental importance. Managers  
are charged with ensuring that the following key principles are upheld:
 • adherence to national legal standards on employment and workplace  
rights at all times  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016 199
Other information
OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 • adherence to the International Labour Organisation’s core labour rights, 
including: prohibition of child labour; prohibition of inhumane treatment  
of employees and any form of forced labour, physical punishment or other 
abuse; recognition of the right of our employees to freedom of association 
and the promotion of workplace equality; and the elimination of all forms  
of unfair discrimination
 • continual promotion of safe and healthy working practices
 • provision of opportunities for employees to enhance their work related  
skills and capabilities
 • adoption of fair and appropriate procedures for determining terms and 
conditions of employment.
It is our policy that people with disabilities should have full and fair 
consideration for all vacancies. Employment of disabled people is considered 
on merit and with regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the 
role. We endeavour to retain the employment of, and arrange suitable 
retraining for, any employees in the workforce who become disabled during 
their employment. Where possible we will adjust a person’s working 
environment to enable them to stay in our employment.
Further, the Group is committed to treating employees at all levels with 
respect and consideration, to investing in their development and to ensuring 
that their careers are not constrained by discrimination or arbitrary barriers.
The Code of Conduct is supplemented by four Anglo American ‘Way’ 
documents, covering the safety, environmental, occupational health and 
social aspects of responsible operation and sustainable development.  
These set out specific standards for each of these subject areas, in line with 
international best practice. The Code of Conduct and the Anglo American 
‘Way’ documents may be accessed on the Company’s website.
In addition, all Anglo American suppliers must commit to adhering to the 
requirements set out in the ‘Sustainable Development in the Supply Chain 
Policy’, which is available on the Company’s website.
The Business Integrity Policy and its 11 Performance Standards support our 
anti-corruption commitment by making it clear that we will neither give, nor 
accept, bribes, nor permit others to do so in our name, either in our dealings 
with public officials or with our suppliers and customers. The Policy sets out 
the standards of conduct required at every level of Anglo American, including 
our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in combating corrupt 
behaviour of all types. It also sets out the requirements of those with whom 
we do business and those who work on our behalf.
The Business Integrity Policy and Performance Standards have been 
translated into all the main languages that we use at our operations. Two 
dedicated business integrity managers, who operate within a broader risk 
management and business assurance team, oversee implementation of the 
policy by working with senior managers in our business units and corporate 
functions and assisting them to put in place adequate procedures for 
managing corruption risks (including extensive face-to-face training of 
employees in high-risk roles).
Our internal audit team provide assurance on anti-corruption controls on an 
annual basis and all stakeholders are able to confidentially report breaches, 
or potential breaches, of the Business Integrity Policy through our 
independently managed ‘Speak Up’ facility.
The Group has a social intranet called Eureka! which helps employees to 
connect, communicate and collaborate more effectively. 
Political donations
No political donations were made during 2016. Anglo American has an 
established policy of not making donations to, or incurring expenses for the 
benefit of, any political party in any part of the world, including any political 
party or political organisation as defined in the Political Parties, Elections 
and Referendums Act 2000.
Additional information for shareholders
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Company’s current 
Articles and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies 
Act 2006 (the Companies Act)) required as a result of the implementation of 
the Takeover Directive in English law. This is a summary only and the relevant 
provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further 
information is required.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may, by 
ordinary resolution, from time to time declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies such payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all, or any part of any dividends or other 
monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares, from a person with a 
0.25% interest or more (as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been 
served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary and preference shares  
are set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed by a special 
resolution passed by the shareholders.
Voting
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to 
voting attached by or in accordance with the Articles to any class of shares, on 
a show of hands every member who is present in person at a general meeting 
shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in person or 
by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is the holder. It is, 
and has been for some years, the Company’s practice to hold a poll on every 
resolution at shareholder meetings.
Where shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group’s 
employee share plans and the voting rights attached to such shares are not 
directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company’s practice that such 
rights are not exercised by the relevant trustee/nominee.
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need 
not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend 
and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting.
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting 
or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that  
is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a 
general meeting or class meeting as a corporate representative. Where a 
shareholder appoints more than one corporate representative in respect  
of its shareholding, but in respect of different shares, those corporate 
representatives can act independently of each other, and validly vote in 
different ways.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in 
respect of any share held by him/her to vote either personally or by proxy  
at a shareholders’ meeting, or to exercise any other right conferred by 
membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings, if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been 
served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act relating to authority and 
pre-emption rights and of any resolution of the Company in a UK general 
meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of  
the directors and they may allot (with or without conferring a right of 
renunciation), grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such 
persons at such times, and on such terms, as they think proper. 200 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2016
OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held in uncertificated 
form, and title to such shares may be transferred by means of a relevant 
system, or that shares of any class should cease to be so held and transferred. 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST regulations and 
every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or order for the time 
being in force concerning companies and affecting the Company (together, 
the Statutes), the directors may determine that any class of shares held on the 
branch register of members of the Company resident in South Africa, or any 
other overseas branch register of the members of the Company, may be held 
in uncertificated form in accordance with any system outside the UK that 
enables title to such shares to be evidenced and transferred without a written 
instrument and which is a relevant system. The provisions of the Articles shall 
not apply to shares of any class that are in uncertificated form to the extent 
that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that class in 
uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of 
a relevant system or any provision of the CREST regulations.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting of the Company in respect of 
which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised 
in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate 
representative. The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the 
meeting or adjourned meeting.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than 
three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the 
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting the 
quorum shall be two persons holding, or representing by proxy, at least 
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the 
holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the 
rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or 
issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of shares that are in certificated form may be effected by transfer 
in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the 
directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be 
signed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid 
shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall remain the 
holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in 
the register of shareholders. All transfers of shares that are in uncertificated 
form may be effected by means of the CREST system.
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to 
shares in certificated form unless it:
(a) is in respect of only one class of share; and
(b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied by 
the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the directors 
may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the 
transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other 
person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do).
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute 
discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, refuse to register  
any transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that, where any 
such shares are admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings  
in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis.  
The directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares 
(whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly.
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send the 
refusal to the allottee or the transferee within two months after the date on 
which the letter of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company.
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of 
other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to 
take place.
Directors
Directors shall not be fewer than 10 nor more than 18 in number. A director  
is not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. 
The Company may by ordinary resolution increase or reduce the maximum 
or minimum number of directors. At the 2017 AGM, shareholders will be 
asked to vote on an ordinary resolution reducing the minimum number of 
directors from 10 to five. 
Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company.
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and 
to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property and uncalled capital 
and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral 
security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party.
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, but no dividend 
shall be payable in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. 
Subject to the provisions of the Articles and to the rights attaching to any 
shares, any dividends or other monies payable on or in respect of a share may 
be paid in such currency as the directors may determine. The directors may 
deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money (if any) 
presently payable by him/her to the Company on account of calls or otherwise 
in relation to shares of the Company. The directors may retain any dividends 
payable on shares on which the Company has a lien, and may apply the same 
in or towards satisfaction of the debts, liabilities or engagements in respect of 
which the lien exists.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors may from time to time appoint one or more directors.
The Board may appoint any person to be a director (so long as the total 
number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). 
Any such director shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall then be 
eligible for election.
The Articles provide that at each AGM all those directors who have been in 
office for three years or more since their election, or last re-election, shall 
retire from office. In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and 
stand for re-election. However, in accordance with the Code, all directors will 
be subject to annual re-election.
Significant agreements: Change of control
At 31 December 2016, Anglo American had committed bilateral and 
syndicated borrowing facilities totalling $10.3 billion with a number of 
relationship banks which contain change of control clauses. $5.4 billion of the 
Group’s bond issues also contain change of control provisions. In aggregate, 
this financing is considered significant to the Group and in the event of a 
takeover (change of control) of the Company, these contracts may be 
cancelled, become immediately payable or be subject to acceleration. 
In the ordinary course of its business the Group’s subsidiaries enter into  
a number of other commercial agreements, some of which would alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company. None of these are 
considered by the Group to be significant to the Group as a whole.
Purchases of own shares
At the AGM held on 21 April 2016, authority was given for the Company to 
purchase, in the market, up to 210.1 million ordinary shares of 54
86
⁄ 91 US cents 
each. The Company did not purchase any of its own shares under this 
authority during 2016. This authority will expire at the 2017 AGM and, in 
accordance with usual practice, a resolution to renew it for another year will 
be proposed.
Indemnities
To the extent permitted by law and the Articles, the Company has made 
qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors 
during the year, which remain in force at the date of this report. Copies of 
these indemnities are open for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

– dividend information 
– AGM information 
– FAQs.
Electronic communication
Shareholders may elect to receive, electronically, notification of the 
availability on the Company’s website of future shareholder correspondence, 
e.g. Annual Reports and Notices of AGMs. 
By registering for this service, UK shareholders can also vote online in respect 
of future AGMs and access information on their shareholding including, for 
example, dividend payment history, sales and purchases and indicative  
share prices. In order to register for these services, UK shareholders should 
contact the UK Registrars or log on to www.shareview.co.uk and follow the 
on-screen instructions. It will be necessary to have a shareholder reference 
number when registering, which is shown on share certificates, dividend tax 
vouchers and proxy cards. New UK shareholders also have the option to elect 
via their proxy card.
Dividends
Dividends are declared and paid in US dollars to shareholders with registered 
addresses in all countries except the UK, eurozone countries and South Africa 
where they are paid in sterling, euros and South African rand respectively. 
Shareholders outside South Africa may elect to receive their dividends in 
US dollars.
Shareholders with bank accounts in the UK or South Africa can have their 
cash dividends credited directly to their own accounts. Shareholders should 
contact the relevant registrar to make use of this facility. South African branch 
register shareholders would need South African exchange control approval to 
mandate their dividends to an account outside South Africa.
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), which  
enables shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends into purchasing  
Anglo American shares. Details of the DRIP and how to join are available  
from Anglo American’s UK Registrars and South African Transfer Secretaries 
and on the Company’s website.
ShareGift
The Company supports ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme 
administered by The Orr Mackintosh Foundation (registered charity number 
1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders with very small numbers of 
shares which might be considered uneconomic to sell are able to donate  
them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift,  
the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of charities. For those 
shareholders who wish to use ShareGift, transfer forms are available  
from the Registrars and further details of the scheme can be found on  
the website www.sharegift.org.
Share dealing service
Telephone, internet and postal share dealing services have been  
arranged through Equiniti, providing a simple way for UK residents to  
buy or sell Anglo American shares. For telephone transactions call  
0345 603 7037 during normal office hours and for internet dealing log  
on to www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. You will need your shareholder 
reference number, found on share certificates, dividend tax vouchers  
and proxy cards. For further details on the postal dealing service call  
0371 384 2026 (or +44 121 415 7558 from overseas).
Unsolicited mail
Under the Companies Act, the Company is obliged to make the share register 
available upon request on payment of the appropriate fee. Because of this,

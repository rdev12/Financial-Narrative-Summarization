0 HIGHLIGHTS bowleveN Plc ANNuAl rePort & A ccouNts 2006   GROUP MANAGEMENT BOARD 
t he former executive c ommittee of the 
c ompany is disbanded. A group board of 
management which will manage the day-to-day 
aspects of the business is now established.  
t his group management board, which 
comprises all the executive directors of the 
c ompany, will focus on generating value 
from the existing asset base and from new 
opportunities for corporate growth.
the group management board is made up of:
chief executive officer:  kevin Hart*
exploration director:  Jerry Anthony
finance director:  John brown
chief operating officer:  John morrow
chairman of euroil:  chief t abetando
commercial director:  Peter wilson**
*   kevin Hart will chair the group 
management board.
**  Peter wilson also fulfils the roles of 
general counsel and company secretary to 
the main board.
this board of management will follow all of 
the procedures and disciplines that have been 
established by the board.
t he group management board is the  
executive engine of the c ompany. it will advise 
the board on policy matters and implement 
declared policies as determined from time 
to time. Apart from managing day-to-day 
business matters, the future direction of the 
business will be substantially determined by the 
recommendations of the group management 
board. 
this is a strong and capable management 
team and i have every confidence in its ability 
to move the company forward with success.  
i am also very pleased to announce that  
mr. ed willett, a senior explorationist at cairn 
energy Plc, has agreed to join bowleven in 
the New year as deputy exploration director. 
ed is a proven finder of hydrocarbons and 
we are confident that he will be a valuable 
member of the team. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”) AND 
SHARE OPTION SCHEME
A lti P has been designed to incentivise the 
executive team. details of the scheme are set 
out in a separate circular, which is intended to  
be posted to shareholders shortly for their 
consideration at an egm, to be held on  
6 december 2006, immediately prior to  
our Agm. 
currently, only executive directors are 
being offered ltiPs under this scheme; the 
previously approved share option scheme 
remains in place for all other employees.
NOMINATED ADVISER AND BROKER
with effect from 2 November 2006, the  
broker to bowleven is Hoare govett limited  
(a subsidiary of the AbN-Amro group) and, 
with effect from 6 december 2006, the position 
of Nominated Adviser to the company will also 
change to Hoare govett.
0 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT bowleveN Plc ANNuAl rePort & A ccouNts 2006
STRATEGIC 
ALLIANCE WITH 
SUNTERA AGREED
t He grou P mANAgeme Nt bo Ard will focus oN 
ge Ner Ati Ng vAlue from t He existi Ng Asset bAse ANd 
from New oPPortu Nities for cor Por Ate growt H whilst i am pleased to announce the 
appointment of Hoare govett, it is with some 
sadness that we are changing the advisory and 
broking relationship. Noble & c ompany (“Noble”) 
were appointed financial advisers to bowl even 
in 1998 and, despite several difficult years, when 
they were not being fully rewarded for their 
efforts, they persevered with bowl even and 
sponsored the c ompany to list its shares on the 
Aim market in december 2004. 
Noble’s broking arm also raised in excess of  
£87 million of new funds for the company in 
2004/05, and shareholders should be very 
grateful for the loyalty, commitment and 
dedication that Noble gave to the company  
over the past several years.
STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, SUNTERA
on 3 July 2006, suntera resources limited 
(“suntera”), a joint venture owned 50% by sun 
energy limited and 50% by itera oil & gas 
llc, acquired a 13% interest in the company, 
through a placing of 4,438,000 new ordinary 
shares at approximately 245 pence each, for 
a cost of £10.9 million. this investment by 
suntera is the basis of an important strategic 
alliance for bowleven. suntera, which has 
considerable experience in monetising gas 
assets, has built up a strong knowledge base 
and solid relationships in west Africa, and 
aims to help the bowleven group to secure 
new opportunities in the region. the strategic 
alliance with suntera can help bowleven to 
deliver its longer-term strategic objectives. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
the group reported a loss of £1.7 million for 
the 12 months ended 30 June 2006. the main 
contributor to the loss was administrative 
expenses, as the group expanded operations 
to properly carry out its work programme and 
exploit the potential of the etinde Permit.
the company, which had £42.5 million of cash 
at bank at year end, as further supplemented 
by the £10.9 million share placing to suntera, 
has the financial resources to fulfil its 
2007 capital investment plans and drilling 
programme.  
some £5 million has been spent since  
30 June, on 3d seismic acquisition, processing 
and interpretation, which should prove to be a 
significant asset to the group. 
RESERVES & CONTINGENT RESOURCES
in accordance with the london stock 
exchange’s recently published Aim guidelines 
for resources companies, bowleven 
summarises, from the competent Person’s 
report, its recoverable hydrocarbon reserves 
and contingent resources on page 10.
these figures, which were independently 
assessed by scott Pickford, are expanded upon 
in more detail in the chief operating officer’s 
statement.
OUTLOOK
despite the drilling of two unsuccessful wells  
in 2005, the stated hydrocarbon asset base 
of the group has not materially changed 
since the listing of bowleven’s shares on Aim 
two years ago. the potential to exploit these 
recoverable reserves and contingent resources 
remains intact, and i am confident that the 
management team will do so.
the exploration potential of the etinde 
Permit remains; blocks mlHP-5 and 6 have 
the potential for discovery of substantial 
hydrocarbon reserves and resources, with 
consequent benefits for shareholder value. 
t he board and management team have been 
strengthened and this team has the undoubted 
potential to drive the c ompany forward to 
success.

0 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT bowleveN Plc ANNuAl rePort & A ccouNts 2006          The Directors submit their report and Group financial statements of BowLeven plc for the year ended 30 June 2006.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activities of the Group in the period under review were to procure and analyse scientific and technical data in order to assess exploration 
and development potential for oil and gas production in Cameroon, West Africa.
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS
The Directors are satisfied with the results for the year. Two wells were drilled on block MHLP-7 of the Etinde Permit and further seismic data 
acquired over the acreage. A significant capital-raising was completed to carry out the ongoing work programme and exploit the potential of the 
hydrocarbon assets.
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
The trading results for the year, and the Group’s financial position at the end of the year, are shown in the attached financial statements.
The Directors have not recommended a dividend.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
As discussed in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 2 to 5, there have been a number of events since the year end that place the Group in a strong 
position to continue to develop its asset base.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group currently finances its operations from cash reserves funded from share issues. The management’s objectives are to retain sufficient liquid 
funds to enable it to meet its day-to-day obligations as they fall due, while maximising returns on surplus funds.
Hedge accounting is not used by the Group.
The Group’s surplus funds are held primarily in short-term variable-rate deposit accounts. The Directors believe this gives them the flexibility  
to release cash resources at short notice and also allows them to take advantage of changing conditions in the finance markets as they arise.  
All deposits are with reputable European and American banks, and the Directors believe their choice of bank minimises any credit risk associated  
with not placing funds on deposit with a UK clearing bank. 
 
THE DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS
The Directors who served the Company during the year, together with their beneficial interests in the shares of the Company, were as follows:
              Ordinary Shares of £0.10 each

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The Ordinary Shares of the Company are listed on AIM under the symbol ‘BLVN’. As at 27 October 2006, the broad distribution of the Ordinary Shares 
in issue was as follows:
    Shares % 
    (millions) %
Institutions    20,890,681 62
Directors and management    1,163,875 3
Other individuals    11,990,369 35
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Directors are aware of the Combined Code applicable to listed companies, which consolidates the work of the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel 
Committees on corporate governance. As a company which is quoted on AIM, the Company is not required to comply with the Combined Code,  
but the Directors intend to comply with its main provisions as far as is practicable having regard to the size of the Group.
BOARD STRUCTURE
The Board currently comprises six Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and two Non-Executive Directors. The Board meets at least six times 
throughout the year, and as issues arise which require Board attention.
Biographies of the Directors are set out on page 12 to 13 of this Annual Report.
The Chairman conducts Board and shareholder meetings, and ensures that all Directors are properly briefed. The Directors are responsible for 
formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of capital expenditure and senior personnel appointments.  
The Directors have access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, and to the Company Secretary (who is also a Director),  
and receive appropriate training, where necessary.
There are transparent procedures for the appointment of new Directors to the Board in place, and all Directors are required to retire by rotation at  
least every three years, when they can offer themselves for re-election, if eligible. In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association, at this 
year’s AGM two Directors would be required to offer themselves for re-election but because the Chairman and Dr. A. Easton Wren are standing down 
and not seeking re-election this satisfies the requirement in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association. Accordingly, there will be  
no resolution to re-elect Directors at this year’s AGM.
The Company has established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees. Terms of reference for the Committees (see below) are available on 
request from the Company. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
An Audit Committee has been established and currently comprises the Chairman and Dr. A. Easton Wren. It meets at least twice a year and is 
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored. It liaises with the auditors and reviews 
the reports from the auditors relating to the accounts and internal control systems.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
A Nomination Committee has been established and currently comprises the Chairman, Dr. A. Easton Wren and Mr. S. Lowden. It reviews and 
recommends to the Board the appointment of Directors.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
A Remuneration Committee has been established and currently comprises the Chairman, Dr. A. Easton Wren and Mr. S. Lowden. It reviews the 
performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration on the basis of their service agreements with due 
regard to the interests of the shareholders and the performance of the Group. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the 
Board concerning employee incentives, including the allocation of share issues to employees. Directors of the Group are not permitted to participate 
in discussions or decisions of the Committee concerning their own remuneration.
Membership of the above Committees will be re-constituted following the first Board meeting after the AGM.
16 DIRECTORS’ REPORT BOWLEVEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Communications with shareholders are considered important by the Directors. The primary contact with shareholders, investors and analysts is the 
Chairman; however, the Executive Directors regularly speak to investors and analysts during the year. Company circulars and press releases  
have also been issued throughout the year and since the balance sheet date, in relation to various proposals and to keep investors informed about  
the Group’s progress.
The Company also maintains a website on the internet: www.bowleven.com which is regularly updated and contains a wide range of information  
about the Group.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and reviewing its effectiveness. 
The procedures which include inter alia financial, operational and compliance matters, and risk management, are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  
The internal control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
considered the need for an internal audit function but does not consider it necessary at the current time.
REMUNERATION REPORT
In addition to complying with the main provisions of the Combined Code, as far as is practicable having regard to the size of the Group, the Company is 
committed to the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATIONS AND INTEREST IN SHARES
Details of the annual remuneration of the Directors and their interests in share options are set out in Note 3 on pages 25 to 27 of the financial 
statements.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
No Directors have any service contracts, consultancy agreements or other such arrangements with a notice period in excess of one year.
SUPPLIER PAYMENT POLICY
It is a Group policy to agree and clearly communicate the terms of payment as part of the commercial arrangement negotiated with suppliers and  
then to pay according to those terms, based upon receipt of an accurate invoice. It is the Group’s policy to pay suppliers within 30 days. 
DONATIONS
During the year, the Group made no donations to political parties (2005: £nil).
DISABLED EMPLOYEES
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the respective qualifications and abilities of the 
applicants concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure their employment will continue. The training, 
career development and promotion of a disabled person is, as far as possible, identical to that of a person fortunate enough not to suffer from  
a disability.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
Using regular briefing procedures and meetings, managers keep employees at all levels informed about matters affecting the policy, progress,  
and people in the business in which they work.
 
AUDITORS AND THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITORS
So far as each person is aware who was a Director at the date of approving this report, there is no relevant audit information, this being information  
needed by the auditors in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditors are unaware. Each Director has taken all the steps which in 
their position they are obliged to take to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware  
of that information.
Baker Tilly, Chartered Accountants, were re-appointed as the Company’s auditors during the year, and are willing to continue in office. A resolution  
for their re-appointment, and authorising the Directors to fix their remuneration, will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.
On behalf of the Board

17 DIRECTORS’ REPORT BOWLEVEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006 The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for complying with the AIM listing rules and for ensuring website access to the financial statements.
18 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES BOWLEVEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
 IN PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We have audited the consolidated financial statements on pages 20 to 33 for the year ended 30 June 2006. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified  
by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other 
information comprises the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement, the Chief Operating Officer’s 
Statement and the Financial Review. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
OPINION
In our opinion:
–  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2006 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

23 GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT BOWLEVEN PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2006 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice for 
Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities, and with applicable accounting standards.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all Group undertakings. These are adjusted,  
where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
As a consolidated Group profit and loss account is published, a separate profit and loss account for the parent Company is omitted from the Group 
financial statements by virtue of Section 230(4) the Companies Act 1985.
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful economic lives, as follows:
Leasehold improvements  Over the life of the lease
Plant and machinery  Over four years
Computer equipment  Over three years
Motor vehicles  Over four years
INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS
The Group follows the full cost method under which expenditure relating to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas 
interests, including an appropriate share of overheads and relevant financing costs, is initially capitalised as intangible assets pending determination 
of commercial reserves. These costs are then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not 
been completed. Following the discovery of a commercially viable field, the attributable costs are transferred to tangible fixed assets in single field 
cost centres and then depreciated over their useful lives.
INVESTMENTS
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
STOCKS
Stocks comprise equipment and materials purchased for the drilling programme and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in  
foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken into 
account in arriving at the operating profit. 
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or 
events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable, and therefore only recognised when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as 
more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal 
of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the timing differences are expected to  
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a  
non-discounted basis.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group may use certain derivative instruments for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the business in 
accordance with the Group’s risk management policies. Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that  
is being hedged is itself recognised. The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2006 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group’s financial instruments principally comprise cash at bank, and various items such as trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from 
operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for BowLeven’s operations.
BowLeven has taken advantage of the exemption of the disclosures in respect of short-term debtors and creditors.
Financial assets and liabilities
BowLeven policy is to ensure that adequate cash is available and BowLeven does not trade in financial instruments and has not entered into any 
derivative transactions.
BowLeven had no financial assets that do not fall under the exemption of short-term debtors or short-term creditors and are therefore due within  
one year.

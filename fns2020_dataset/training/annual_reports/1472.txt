cHairman’s statement
delivering:
It is pleasing to report a year of record 
production resulting in the Group 
selling its ten millionth tonne of coal 
since commencing operations in 1998. 
Business progress
The Group continues to build on the strategy 
of growing the business organically and by 
acquisition. It is pleasing to report a year 
of record production resulting in the Group 
selling its ten millionth tonne of coal since 
commencing operations in 1998. The Surface 
Mining business opened two new mines in the 
year and commissioned the full length of its 
16km conveyor network linking the new mines 
to the railhead.
The land regeneration and coal tip washing 
business, re-branded as ATH Regeneration, 
is fully integrated within the Group and continues 
to perform ahead of expectations. A number 
of exciting new opportunities, to exploit the 
business’ intellectual property and market 
potential in both the UK and Australia, are 
being actively pursued. 
development
Following the year end, the Board was 
delighted to hear that the Group was 
successful in its appeal on the Muir Dean 
site in Fife. The planning process has been 
an extended one, given the appeal, and the 
Group is now looking forward to working 
with the local community in opening the 
site later in 2008.

Planning consents for new reserves remain 
a key issue for the Group. The business is 
awaiting final approval for an extension to 
the Grievehill mine from the Scottish Executive 
Planning Department (“SEPD”). The Board is 
confident that confirmation of SEPD’s decision 
will be received within the necessary timeframe 
for the Group to meet its production plans in 
2007/08.
Board of directors
During the year, Steven Beaumont replaced 
Richard Croston as Group Finance Director. 
In addition, the Director nominated by The 
Alchemy Plan, Ivana Ridler, left Alchemy and 
became an Independent Non-executive Director. 
Following the year end, Group Marketing 
Director John Hodgson, one of the three 
founding Directors, retired from the Board. 
John will continue as a Director of the 
Surface Mining business. His commitment 
and dedication to the business has been 
fundamental to the success of ATH and 
the Board is grateful for his contribution 
over the last nine years.
strategy
There is a growing recognition of the value 
and importance of UK produced coal in creating 
a balanced and secure portfolio of energy supply 
within the UK. With this background the Group 
will continue to develop the business organically 
and through acquisition, exploiting new 
opportunities especially in the Regeneration 
business, to build on the reserve base.

Coal is loaded at the Group’s dedicated rail 
loading facility at Crowbandsgate in East Ayrshire 
for delivery to energy generating customers.
The Group celebrated selling its ten millionth 
tonne of coal by commissioning this unique 
piece of human artwork, involving children 
from three local East Ayrshire and Dumfries 
and Galloway schools.

operational review
Surface Mining
The Surface Mining business continues to 
grow steadily in line with the Group’s strategy. 
During the year, the Group brought two new 
mines at Glenmuckloch and Laigh Glenmuir 
into production and both mines operated 
ahead of expectations. In addition, 16km 
of overland conveyors linking the sites to the 
rail loading facility at Crowbandsgate were 
constructed with the assistance of a £2.2 million 
Freight Facilities Grant provided by the Scottish 
Executive. The conveyors, which can handle 
up to 500 tonnes of coal per hour, remove over 
50,000 lorry loads of coal from local roads and 
significantly reduce the environmental impact 
of these sites.
The Grievehill mine finished production 
on existing reserves in November 2007. 
An application for a further one million tonne 
extension was approved by the Local Planning 
Authority in November 2007 and ratification 
of this decision by the SEPD is awaited, 
with mining expected to re-commence 
in February 2008.  www.ath.co.uk
ATH Resources plc

In addition to Grievehill, a Surface Mining 
planning application was submitted for Rigg 
in Dumfries and Galloway for 1.3 million tonnes 
and an extension of 0.7 million tonnes to the 
Glenmuckloch mine was identified. During 
2008, the Group expects to submit at least 
two further new planning applications for 
2.1 million tonnes of surface mine reserves. 
The Surface Mining business has an 
estimated 7.9 million tonnes of proven 
and probable reserves. Subject to the 
approval of the Grievehill extension these 
are sufficient to satisfy production at current 
capacity levels for over three and a half years. 
This is approximately double the reserve life 
that the Company had when it came to 
the Stock Market.
Regeneration
ATH Regeneration continues to operate 
ahead of expectations at its coal washing 
plant at Grimethorpe utilising its unique 
natural medium coal recovery techniques. 
Coal is being extracted from the coal tip at 
rates and qualities higher than anticipated at 
the time of acquisition in 2006. Coal recovery 
at Grimethorpe is expected to cease during 
2008 with the site entering a period of restoration.
In March 2007, the Group acquired 12.3 acres 
of development land at Pinxton in Derbyshire 
to facilitate the access and washing of the 
Langton coal tip which was part of the 2006 
acquisition. A planning application has been 
submitted and the operations are expected 
to commence in 2008.
Several new tip washing opportunities 
have been identified and negotiations with 
prospective partners where the necessary 
planning permission is in place are ongoing 
on two further projects. On agreement of terms 
with these partners, 1.3 million tonnes would 
be added to either the reported proven 
reserves or future order book. Progress is 
also being made on two further tip washing 
operations expected to commence in the UK 
in the next two years. 
In addition, a number of projects are being 
actively pursued in Australia. The Directors 
have identified a clear opportunity to build a 
presence in this much larger coal production 
market, where the Group’s successful coal 
recovery techniques are not presently employed.
France
The Group continues to pursue its 
development opportunities in France. 
The Administrative Court in Toulouse has 
found in the Group’s favour on litigation 
brought against the French State after their 
refusal of applications to transfer concessions 
at Bertholene in 1997. The Directors hope that 
this ruling will have significance in progressing 
the French State’s determination of the Group’s 
long outstanding application for a concession 
at Commentry.
Site preparation for a new coal processing plant 
installed at Garleffan. All coal produced is cleaned 
and sorted into different grades prior to despatch 
to customers.
The construction of the conveyor was carefully 
planned to preserve the local environment and 
historic sites. The conveyor was placed on a 
specially made bridge to ensure there was no 
damage to historic lime kilns.
the group has a dual 
strategy of growing coal 
reserves organically...whilst 
continuing to identify suitable

Surface Mining
The Surface Mining business proudly commissioned its overland conveyor this year. The 16km 
conveyor system quietly and efficiently transports coal from the mines to the Company’s rail 
loading facility in East Ayrshire. Through this innovation the majority of the Company’s coal 
can reach its power station customers without using the road system – a saving of hundreds 
of thousands of lorry journeys over the next few years – providing a beneficial community and 
environmental solution.
With imports of coal at record levels, the Company plays an important role in producing local 
coal to the high environmental standards necessary in our modern and sophisticated economy.
The business plays an active part in the local communities in which it operates and has donated 
over £2 million to local community schemes over the last ten years. page

operational review continued
Reserves 
The Group has a dual strategy of growing 
coal reserves organically from its existing 
portfolio whilst continuing to identify suitable 
complimentary acquisitions. Estimated 
reserves of recoverable coal (proven and 
probable) grew by 9% during the year to 
8.6 million tonnes (2006: 7.9 million tonnes) 
despite a year of record production. Current 
planning activity levels will continue to replace 
mined coal with new reserves, securing 
production for the foreseeable future.
Market
Demand for coal in the UK was exceptional 
during 2006 and, as expected returned to 
near previous normal levels in 2007. UK coal 
production meets approximately one third of 
demand, with the balance being imported 
predominantly from Russia, South Africa 
and Colombia. 
International coal prices are at an all time high, 
largely due to soaring demand from China, 
India and smaller developing countries in the 
Far East, leading to severe logistical difficulties, 
particularly at Australian ports that are struggling 
to cope with the required throughputs. 
The conveyor’s modular design ensures 
the system operates quietly and efficiently, 
minimising the environmental impact.
The Skares Road site, having been mined since 
1998, has some fully restored sections which 
include a designated wetland area inhabited by 
aquatic birds and animals.

mines at glenmuckloch

Although there is currently resistance among 
UK electricity generators to pay these higher 
international coal prices to indigenous producers, 
the Directors expect an outcome that will 
satisfy both producer and generator. 
Consequently, the Directors anticipate a 
prolonged period of higher UK coal prices 
in the medium term. These higher prices for 
coal are already starting to benefit the Group 
as long term supply contracts are renewed. 
The Group holds supply agreements with 
a number of major UK electricity generators. 
These cover the supply of 3.1 million tonnes 
of coal up to 2011. New contract agreements 
have recently been secured for a further 
1.3 million tonnes at a price in 2009/10 
15% above the legacy contract. 
Health and safety
The Board understands the potentially hazardous 
nature of the work undertaken in the Group’s 
operations and takes very seriously its 
responsibilities for health and safety.
Each operational site has a nominated 
and qualified Health and Safety Manager 
and employees are regularly trained in the 
Group’s processes which aim to exceed 
HSE best practice. 
staff
The Board recognises the critical importance 
of its employees in the Group’s continued 
growth and success. The business has a 
skilled, innovative and highly motivated 
workforce approaching a total of 400 and 
the Group continues to deliver structured 
and targeted training programmes to ensure 
staff are competent to carry out their duties.
The Board joins me in thanking all of our 
employees for the efforts they have made 
during the past year of trading.
summary
These strong results reflect a busy period 
for the Group in growing the reserve base 
and identifying important future opportunities, 
particularly for ATH Regeneration in the UK 
and Australia. The Board looks forward to 
delivering value from these opportunities and 
further strengthening the Group’s market position.

t urnover
The Group’s turnover for the year was 
£70.5 million (2006 restated: £54.1 million) 
on sales of 2.2 million tonnes (2006: 1.8 million). 
The average coal price was £32 per tonne 
(2006: £30 per tonne).
Turnover on Surface Mining was £57.3 million 
(2006 restated: £48.2 million) and on Regeneration 
was £13.2 million (2006 restated: £5.9 million).
The increase in turnover from Surface 
Mining reflects the greater resources available 
following the opening of the Glenmuckloch 
and Laigh Glenmuir mines to complement 
existing production and the cessation of coaling 
at the Garleffan site in 2006. Regeneration 
provided a full year of production.
The increase in average coal prices reflects 
a full year contribution from Regeneration 
and new contracts with power generators.
Profit before interest and tax
Profit before interest and tax (“PBIT”) was 
£10.3 million (2006 restated: £8.1 million) 
and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (“EBITDA”) was £25.1 million 
(2006 restated: £19.2 million).
Return on capital employed of 16% 
(2006 restated: 15%) reflects good cost 
control and careful management of capital 
within the business.

interest
Net interest of £2.4 million (2006 restated: 
£1.0 million) was charged in the year. Following 
current and prior year plant acquisitions, hire 
purchase interest charges increased to 
£1.1 million (2006 restated: £0.6 million) and 
£0.3 million (2006 restated: £Nil) was charged 
in respect of the unwinding of the discount 
on restoration provisions. Additional investment 
in the asset base and the Regeneration 
acquisition in 2006 resulted in an increase 
in bank loan and overdraft interest charges 
of £1.0 million (2006 restated: £0.4 million).
corporation tax
The effective rate of tax was 34% (2006 restated: 
35%) compared with a standard rate of tax 
of 30%. The difference between the actual 
and standard rate is primarily due to the 
amortisation of acquired goodwill which 
is not allowable against tax.
dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 8.24 pence per share (2006: 7.89 pence), 
payable on 18 January 2008, subject to approval 
by the members at the Annual General Meeting 
to be held on 15 January 2008, to members 
on the share register at 21 December 2007.
On approval, the total dividend will be 
11.6 pence per share, an increase of 3% 
on the 2006 figure of 11.25 pence. Under UK 
Accounting rules the proposed final dividend 
has not been accrued as a liability in these 
financial statements.
earnings per share
Earnings per share was 13.08 pence 
(2006 restated: 11.77 pence), an 11% increase 
overall. Fully diluted earnings per share, taking 
into account shares expected to be issued under 
employee option schemes, was 12.88 pence 
(2006 restated: 11.61 pence).
net assets
Net assets were £31.4 million (2006 restated: 
£30.0 million). Investment in fixed assets was 
£12.0 million, with £5.0 million on plant and 
machinery, including the conveyor, £2.3 million 
to acquire development land at Pinxton and 
£4.7 million on the development of new 
Surface Mining assets.
Cash flows
The Group continues to generate strong cash 
flows from its operations with a net cash inflow 
on operations of £23.6 million (2006 restated: 
£17.6 million). Cash outflows on fixed assets, 
£7.1 million (2006 restated: £7.8 million) 
and hire purchase payments, £8.2 million 
(2006 restated: £5.5 million) reflect the Group’s 
capital investment programme. A one-off 
corporation tax payment of £3.9 million relating 
to a pre-acquisition liability of Regeneration 
was made during the year. Overall, net cash 
outflow was £5.3 million (2006 restated: 
£1.2 million).
Net debt at 30 September 2007 was 
£31.6 million (2006 restated: £31.4 million). 
Debt repaid during the year was replaced 
by new hire purchase agreements and bank 
loans. Gearing, defined as net debt divided by 
capital employed, was 50% (2006 restated: 51%).
financing
Following the year end, the Group renegotiated 
its banking facilities with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland in order to take advantage of new 
investment opportunities in both the Surface 
Mining and Regeneration businesses.
The new arrangements include three year loan 
facilities totalling £15 million replacing existing 
term loans of £3 million. Further loans have 
been agreed in principle to finance the capital 
investment required to bring future projects 
and mines into production. 
frs 20 ‘share-based payment’
The Group adopted FRS 20 ‘Share-based 
payment’ in the year which is treated as 
a change in accounting policy under UK 
accounting rules, requiring both current 
and prior year figures to be restated.
On implementation of this new standard, 
the Group’s PBIT was reduced by £0.5 million 
in both 2007 and 2006.
international financial reporting 
standards (“ifrs”)
The Group will fully implement IFRS 
during 2008. Both the Interim Accounts to 
March 2008 and full year Financial Statements 
to September 2008 will be prepared on this 
basis with full comparative information.
The Group has not quantified the full potential 
impact on its earnings of IFRS but the key 
areas identified are noted below.
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’
This standard will require the goodwill 
arising on consolidation of the Group’s 
results to cease being charged to profit. 
Instead, the goodwill balance will be subject 
to an annual impairment test.
IFRS 12 ‘Income taxes’
This standard will require a deferred tax 
provision to be created for all differences 
between fair values of assets and liabilities 
and their tax bases which would not normally 
be required under current practice.

The Directors submit their report and the audited financial statements of ATH Resources plc for the year ended 30 September 2007.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The principal activities of the Group are the operation 
of surface coal mines and the recovery of coal via tip washing and its subsequent sale to UK electricity generators, industrial 
and domestic customers. The Group operates under the title of ATH Resources.
Review of developments and future prospects
The Group’s trading performance for the year was in line with Directors’ expectations and is discussed in greater detail 
in the Chief Executive’s Statement. The Directors are pleased with the Group’s progress and believe the businesses are 
ideally placed to continue to develop and mine new prospects.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”). Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK GAAP , of the state 
of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 1985. They are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination or financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ indemnities
The Group made third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors for the whole of the year, which continue 
to remain in force.

aware, that there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the Directors have confirmed

Key performance indicators (“KPis”)
The Board monitors the Group’s progress and financial performance on a regular basis. Performance is assessed against 
budget using financial and non-financial measures. The following are the most significant KPIs used by the Group:
         Restated 
        2007 2006
Sales price – revenue earned per tonne of coal sold (£)      32 30
Cost price – operating cost per tonne of coal sold (£)      23 22
Coal reserves – the volume of coal which is classed as permitted or probable reserves (million tonnes)  8.6 7.9
Health and safety – number of reportable accidents (number)      8 6
Environmental incidents – breaches of environmental legislation (number)    Nil Nil
Return on capital employed – profit before interest and tax divided by capital employed (%)   16 15
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
Replacement of production
The Group’s operations have a finite life due to the geology of each site and will become exhausted at some point in the future. 
Production is replaced through the development or acquisition of new sites and extensions to existing sites.
Exploration and development
The exploration for, and development of, coal deposits involves significant risks, which are managed through the combination 
of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge. Not all properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing 
mines. There can be no guarantee that estimates of quantities and qualities made will be realised or that appropriate consents 
will be granted. With all mining operations there is uncertainty and therefore risks associated with operating parameters and costs. 
General mining and processing risks
The Group’s operations are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally encountered in the exploration, development and 
production of coal. Appropriate levels of site investigation are undertaken to minimise the risk but these risks could include 
unusual and unexpected geological formations, geo-technical instability, flooding and other conditions involved in the 
extraction of material.

Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group continued
Volatility of price of coal
The market price of coal is volatile and is affected by numerous factors which are beyond the Group’s control. These include 
international supply and demand, the level of consumer product demand, international economic trends, currency exchange 
rate fluctuations, the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, the cost of freight, global or regional political events and international 
events as well as a range of other market forces. This volatility is managed through the entering into of long term, fixed price, 
supply agreements with electricity generating companies.
Environmental issues
The Group’s activities and the markets in which it operates are subject to environmental regulation. Such regulations typically 
cover a wide variety of matters including prevention of waste, pollution and protection of the environment. The risk is managed 
by daily inspections of all operations with a potential to cause environmental breaches and by careful design of the operations 
to mitigate any potential risk.
Health and safety
The Group’s activities are, and will continue to be, subject to health and safety standards and regulations. Failure to comply 
with such requirements may result in fines, penalties and/or litigation. Risk assessments are carried out by management as 
well as retaining the services of external risk consultants to identify any potential risks and ensure safe methods of working.
Financial instruments
Details relating to financial instruments are given in the Corporate Governance Report on page 21.
employees
The Directors recognise the importance of the Group’s employees in the success of the business. 
The Group is committed to equal opportunities in employment and seeks to ensure that all current employees or applicants 
are treated equally regardless of age, sex, nationality, race, colour, creed or disability.
The Directors retain regular contact with employees using both formal and informal lines of communication to ensure relevant 
financial and operational information is disseminated. Regular meetings take place to allow employees of all levels to 
contribute to the Group’s development. 
Payment policy
It is the Group’s policy to pay suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, provided the supplier has also complied with 
agreed terms and conditions. At 30 September 2007, the trade creditors of the Group represented 50 days (2006: 50 days) 
of purchases.
Auditors
The Directors, having been notified of the cessation of the partnership known as Baker Tilly, resolved that Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP 
be appointed successor auditor with effect from 1 April 2007, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1989, 
s26(5). Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in office as auditors of the Company, and a resolution 
to that effect will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 www.ath.co.uk
introduction
Although the rules of AIM do not require the Company to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(“the Code”), the Company fully supports the principles set out in the Code and will attempt to comply wherever possible, 
given both the size and resources available to the Company. Details are provided below of how the Company applies 
the Code.
the Board
At the start of the year, the Board of Directors comprised four Executive Directors, two independent Non-executive Directors, 
one of whom is the Chairman and an Alchemy Plan nominated Non-executive Director. During the year, the Director nominated 
by the Alchemy Plan left Alchemy and became an independent Non-executive Director. The Alchemy Plan did not nominate a 
new Director but retains the right to do so. If the Alchemy Plan’s shareholding in the Company falls below 10% of the issued 
share capital, the right to appoint ceases. After the year end, Mr John Hodgson retired as an Executive Director reducing 
the number of Executive Directors to three. It is not intended that John will be replaced on the Board in the short term.
Mr Richard Croston resigned as an Executive Director on 9 October 2006 following the appointment of Mr Steven Beaumont. 
Richard continued to work for the Group until May 2007.
The Board generally meets each month and receives a Board pack comprising individual reports from each of the 
Executive Directors, together with any other material deemed necessary for the Board to discharge its duties. It is the 
Board’s responsibility for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budgets, major items of expenditure 
and acquisitions.
During the year to 30 September 2007 the Board met a total of eleven times.
Board committees
The Board has established three committees; Audit, Remuneration and Nominations, all having written terms 
of delegated responsibilities.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and is scheduled to meet twice a year. It is the 
Audit Committee’s role to provide formal and transparent arrangements for considering how to apply the financial 
reporting and internal control requirements of the Code, whilst maintaining an appropriate relationship with the 
independent auditors of the Group. In order to comply with the requirement of the Code that at least one member 
has relevant financial experience, the Chairman of the Board sits on the Audit Committee.
During the year to 30 September 2007 the Audit Committee met on two occasions.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets at least once 
a year, normally in June. It is the Remuneration Committee’s role to establish a formal and transparent policy on Executive 
remuneration and to set remuneration packages for individual Directors.
During the year to 30 September 2007 the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises the three Non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive and meets as required 
to consider and make recommendations on the appointment of Directors to the Board.
Shareholder relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders and analysts as appropriate and encourages communication with 
private shareholders via the Annual General Meeting. In addition, the Company uses the Annual Report and Accounts, 
Interim Statement and website (www.ath.co.uk) to provide further information to shareholders.
The Board considers Mr Vaughan Williams to be the Senior Independent Director.

internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such systems are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate risks and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Each year, on behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of these systems. 
This is achieved primarily by considering the risks potentially affecting the Group and discussions with the external auditors.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function due to the small size of the administrative function, which 
amounts to six people, and the high level of Director review and authorisation of transactions.
A comprehensive budgeting process is completed once a year and is reviewed and approved by the Board. The Group’s 
results, as compared against budget, are reported to the Board on a monthly basis and discussed in detail at each meeting 
of the Board.
The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against the Directors as well as against material 
loss or claims against the Group and reviews the adequacy of the cover regularly.
Financial instruments
Currency risks
The Group does not have any direct exposure to currency risk as all of the Group’s business is conducted within the UK.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses fixed rate hire purchase agreements in order to hedge its interest rate risk.
Price risk
The Group uses a mixture of short term and fixed price long term contracts with suppliers and customers to manage 
its exposure to variation in market prices.
Credit risk
The Group trades predominantly with long standing customers, the nature of these relationships assist management 
in controlling its credit risk in addition to the normal credit management. In addition the Group carries credit insurance 
against material loss from the failure of a customer to pay.
Liquidity
Management control and monitor the Group’s cash flow on a regular basis, including forecasting future cash flows. page

Directors’ interests in share options continued
The performance target is cumulative pre-tax earnings per share. 
The number of options available to the members of the Approved Scheme with performance period from 1 October 2003 
to 30 September 2006, the Unapproved Scheme with performance period from 1 October 2003 to 30 October 2006 and 
the LTIP Scheme with performance period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2007 have been amended during the year 
following agreement of the schemes with the Inland Revenue. The revision to the number of options available was due to 
a previous share rights issue in 2005 as set out in the ‘Revised’ column on the table. 
The performance targets for the Approved and Unapproved Schemes with performance periods ending 30 September 2006 
were achieved and the options have vested.
The performance target for the LTIP Scheme ending on 30 September 2007 was not achieved and these options have 
now lapsed. 
No Directors exercised any options during the period.

Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that 
specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial Review, 
the Corporate Governance Report and the Remuneration Committee Report.
In addition we report to you, if in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received 
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial 
Review and the Directors’ Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relating to the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the relevant information and explanations which we consider 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of the information in the financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion: 
  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the Group’s and Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2007 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

ATH Resources plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 www.ath.co.uk
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards.
Basis of preparation
The Group has net current liabilities of £10,130,000 (2006: £12,997,000). The Group meets its day to day working capital 
requirements through an overdraft facility which is repayable on demand.
The Directors have prepared cash flow projections for the coming twelve months which show that the margin of cash 
requirements is within the Group’s existing borrowing facilities. On the basis of this cash flow information, the Directors 
consider that the Group will continue to operate within the facility currently and anticipated to be available to the Group. 
On this basis, the Directors consider it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis. 
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from this not being the case.
Accounting period
The Company has drawn up its accounts for the 52 week period to 30 September 2007 (52 week period to 1 October 2006).
consolidation
The accounts utilise the acquisition method to consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings 
other than as stated below. The accounts do not consolidate the results of the French subsidiary, Société des Ressources 
Minières du Massif Central (“SRMMC”), as it is not material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view (note 10).
Aardvark TMC Limited (“Aardvark”) has 20,000 ‘B’ ordinary shares, not owned by ATH Resources plc, subscribed at nominal 
value of 1 pence each, in addition to the ordinary shares wholly owned by ATH Resources plc.
The ‘B’ ordinary shares only carry the rights to receive a one off dividend in the event that Aardvark TFC Limited or SRMMC 
(Aardvark’s subsidiary and sub-subsidiary) are awarded damages in respect of existing and future litigation against the 
French State. The ‘B’ ordinary shares carry no voting rights or rights to receive any other dividend. As a result, the ‘B’ ordinary 
shares are not accounted for as a minority interest as it is not material for the purposes of giving a true and fair view.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985.
mine development costs
The costs of prospecting and identifying new sites are expensed until such time that a prospective site is considered by the 
Board to be economically viable and that there is a high degree of probability and commitment that the site will be worked. 
Costs then incurred in preparing and developing sites are capitalised up to the start of production. Upon commencement 
of production, depreciation is charged on a tonnage basis.
Goodwill
Consolidated goodwill, being the excess consideration over the fair values of the assets acquired on the purchase of subsidiary 
undertakings, is capitalised and charged to profit over ten years as, in the opinion of the Directors, this represents the period 
over which the goodwill is effective.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on cost in annual instalments over the estimated useful life of assets which are reviewed annually. 
The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Freehold land   Not depreciated
Freehold buildings   Depreciated to their estimated residual value over their estimated remaining 
economic lives – 20 years
Mine purchase and development T onnage basis over the estimated total recoverable reserve
Plant and machinery  10 – 50%

Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Finance leases and hire purchase contracts
Tangible assets acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at the estimated fair value at 
the date of inception of each lease or contract. The total finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in such 
a way as to give a reasonably constant charge on the outstanding liability.
operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases, where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, 
are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have 
occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as 
stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from 
those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme for the benefit of its employees but instead makes contributions to their 
personal pension policies. The contributions due for the period are charged to the profit and loss account.
Final void provisions
Following the conclusion of coal extraction the final working void of a surface coal site must be back filled. The total cost of 
this operation is recognised as a provision on site commissioning when the obligation arises. The amount provided represents 
the present value of the expected costs. Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount, 
being the difference between the present value and the total cost of the provision, is included in the interest charge for the 
period. An asset is created for an amount equivalent to the initial provision. This is charged to the profit and loss account 
on a tonnage basis over the estimated life of the recoverable reserves.
t urnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for sale of goods in the ordinary nature 
of the business. Turnover is shown net of Value Added Tax, of goods sold to customers outside the Group.
employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share-based incentives as outlined in the Remuneration Committee’s Report. The cost 
of awards to employees, being the difference between the market price at the date of award and the amount of consideration 
due, is recognised over the period of the employee’s related performance where there is a reasonable expectation that the 
performance criteria will be met. page

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 www.ath.co.uk
FRS 20 ‘Share-based payment’
During the year the Group adopted FRS 20 ‘Share-based payment’. The adoption of this standard constitutes 
a change in accounting policy and therefore the impact has been reflected as a prior year adjustment in accordance 
with FRS 3 ‘Reporting financial performance’.
The standard requires that where shares or rights to shares are granted to third parties, including employees, a charge should 
be recognised in the profit and loss account based on the fair values of the shares at the date the grant of shares or right to 
shares is made. The Group operates share option schemes for senior executives which are required under the standard to 
be valued and charged against profit before tax.
The effect of the adoption of FRS 20 on prior year comparatives is to reduce operating profit by £480,000 in the year 
to 1 October 2006. Operating profit in the year to 30 September 2007 is reduced by £460,000.
A corresponding reserve is created in the balance sheet – Share-based payment reserve – which is a distributable reserve. 
In addition, a deferred tax credit is recognised in the profit and loss account to reflect tax relief available when the options 
are exercised. The impact on net assets is an increase of £255,855 for the period ended 1 October 2006 and an increase 
of £393,855 for the period ended 30 September 2007.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments are recognised on an accruals basis and credited or charged 
to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which they relate.
investments
Investments are stated at cost and provision is made for any impairment in the value of fixed asset investments.

Aardvark TMC Limited has 20,000 ‘B’ ordinary shares, subscribed at nominal value of 1 pence each, in addition to the ordinary 
shares wholly owned by ATH Resources plc.

or its subsidiary SRMMC, are awarded damages in respect of the existing and future litigation against the French State. The ‘B’

4.  As permitted by Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, shareholders who hold shares in uncertificated form must be 
entered on the Company’s share register at 11:00 am on 11 January 2008 in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. 
Such shareholders may only cast votes in respect of shares held at such time. Changes to entries on the relevant register after that time shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
5.  Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment of each of the Directors will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and public holidays excluded) and at the place of the Annual General Meeting 
from at least 15 minutes prior to and until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.
6.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising CREST electronic appointment service may do so for the Annual General 
Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST 
sponsored members and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (CREST proxy instruction) must be 
properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCos* specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described 
in the CREST Manual. The message regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to 
a  previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent Capita Registrars (ID RA10) by 
the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt shall be 
taken as the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST applications host) from which the Company’s agent 
(Capita Registrars) is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time, any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of 
CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s) to procure his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s) such 
action as is necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by a particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular to those sections of the CREST Manual 
concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulations 35(5) of the Uncertified Securities 
Regulations 2001.

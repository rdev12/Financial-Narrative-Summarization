  W e deliv er ed 
another year of 
solid progress 
producing a 
good  nancial 
performance
Chairman  and Group CEO  statement
  Ov er view
We delivered another year of solid progress producing a good 
 nancial performance in line with our guidance given in January. 
We are embedding ‘Our vision, our future’ and it is encouraging 
to see how enthusias � c our people are about ‘Bringing life to 
technology™’. We con � nue to focus on our customers and our 
opera � onal founda � ons. We are pleased with the progress that 
has been made over the last two years.

3. Adjusted earnings is pro  t before speci  c items less tax where applicable.
Customers remain our key focus; the two of us have visited over 
27 during the past year. Our annual customer survey ra � ngs have 
improved and we are increasingly being seen as a key partner. 
We have con � nued to improve our opera � onal e ﬀ ec � veness 
demonstrated by margin improvements in all three divisions. 
The divisions are demonstra � ng ownership and responsibility 
for their individual businesses and are being agile in responding 
to the challenges they face. We have recon  rmed our strategy, 
maintaining our investment in the areas where we are seeing 
the greatest poten � al for growth. It was pleasing to complete 
the acquisi � on of SP Devices, a step forward in our strategy 
to provide customers with board-level solu � ons and specialist 
applica � ons exper � se.
The year ended 31 March 2016 represents our third consecu � ve 
year of revenue growth in markets with slow overall growth. 
Our investment priori � es remain Industrial Vision, Space, 
Radiotherapy and Semiconductors, whilst con � nuing to support 
customers across our other ac � vi � es. We are seeing the bene  ts 
of this disciplined approach. We have seen slower growth in 
many of our markets this year, so our innova � on is allowing us 
to make new markets and to take market share to support 
our growth. 
 P erf ormance 
The Group delivered reported revenues of £236.4m, an increase 
of 5.1% (2015: £224.9m), and maintained the adjusted
(1)
 
opera � ng pro  t margin at 17.8%, which resulted in adjusted
(3)
 
earnings per share increasing 6.7% from 13.68p last year to 
14.59p this year.
 The culture change within the business over the past two years 
is improving how we operate. We saw strong revenue growth 
in Imaging, both in Professional Imaging and Space Imaging, 
driven by innova � on and improving opera � onal performance. 
We have delivered a signi  cant margin improvement in Imaging 
and Semiconductors. In RF Power we saw modest margin 
improvement despite lower revenue, demonstra � ng the bene  ts 
of reorganisa � on and good cost control. 
  A dj u s te d
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t increased from £40.1m to £42.0m, 
a � er absorbing a £5.5m swing in foreign exchange, represen � ng 
growth of 4.7%. These results re  ect a good performance 
through the year, with a par � cularly strong fourth quarter. 
Comparing year on year performance, we saw organic growth 
in our Industrial Vision, Space, Radiotherapy, Commercial and 
Industrial businesses, with lower revenues in RF defence. We 
also bene  ted from the acquisi � on of AnaFocus and SP Devices, 
par � ally o ﬀ set by the disposal of our Thermal Imaging business. 
The  nancial posi � on of the Group remains strong with net 
borrowings of £21.1m (2015: £5.2m). In terms of working capital 
movements this is in line with our working capital model, and 
decisions that we consciously made in the second half. Inventory 
and trade receivables have increased in Imaging to support 
growth. We made progress on our reorganisa � ons and had 
lower accruals for incen � ve payments in the year. We completed 
our programme to reduce concentra� on in our supply chain 
in RF Power and have u � lised advanced payments as we have 
delivered on Space programmes. This was in part supported by 
reduc � ons in planned capital expenditure in the later part of  001

e2v technologies plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 201 6         
Shareholder Informa � on Strategic Report Governance Financials
the year such that this remained equivalent to deprecia � on and 
amor � sa � on. Acquisi � ons u � lised £13.0m of cash. This included 
the acquisi � on of SP Devices, earn out payments on AnaFocus 
and product line acquisi � ons in Semiconductors, less the 
proceeds from the sale of the Thermal Imaging business.
We have bene  ted from making the divisions more accountable 
for their end-to-end performance and reorganising them so they 
can focus on delivery to their customers. A refreshed management 
team for Space Imaging has been established under the new 
divisional president and we are beginning to see the bene  ts of 
the changes they are making. We have made progress on the 
reorganisa � on of the RF Power opera � ons in our Chelmsford 
facility ‘Project Sunrise’. We have established separate units for 
our specialist defence ac � vi � es in Lincoln, and we have completed 
the reorganisa � on of our US businesses. We were pleased to 
complete the sale of our Thermal Imaging business in October, 
further simplifying our Professional Imaging business.
As part of the evolu � on of the Group we have refreshed the 
management and refocused our people to be � er meet our 
customers’ needs. This aligns our people more closely with our 
strategy and provides them with more opportunity to share in 
the success of the Group. 
We closed the year, as expected, with a 12 month order book 
at £130m, an 11% decrease over the prior year of £146m. This 
re  ects the changing composi � on in the Group’s revenues with 
growth coming in shorter order cover businesses, delivery on 
programmes in Space Imaging and the cycle of the Radiotherapy 
business along with the an � cipated decline in RF defence.
 Dividend
The Board has recommended a  nal dividend of 3.8p per share, 
bringing the full year dividend to 5.4p per share, an increase of 
5.9% from last year’s full year dividend of 5.1p and in line with 
our progressive dividend policy. The  nal dividend is scheduled 
for payment on 2 August 2016 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 8 July 2016.
Direc on
We con � nue to embed our vision, ‘Bringing life to technology™’. 
As part of the Group’s strategic cycle, the Board has reviewed 
progress in the implementa � on of our strategy with its refocus 
on customers, markets and opportuni � es. This has rea ﬃ  rmed 
the a � rac � veness of our selected areas of investment priority.
Our strategic drivers bring together our vision. We con � nue to 
focus on our customers; this is our core belief. Our customers 
have provided improved scores in our most recent customer 
survey. We are seeing real progress in embedding the new 
culture and how everyone can make changes in what they do 
to bene  t our customers. We have strengthened management, 
simpli  ed our processes and reorganised our remaining central 
opera � ons leading to lower costs and improved margins. We 
con � nue to focus on opera � onal improvement, with an ongoing 
focus on process e ﬀ ec � veness  in Space Imaging. We are 
inves � ng in innova � on in our chosen markets where we see that 
there is strong customer pull and increasingly working with our 
customers as their trusted innova � on partner. We have made 
considerable progress over the last two years through self-help 
and the business is in good shape to respond when market 
condi � ons improve.
We successfully completed two acquisi � ons over the last 
two years and we con � nue to build a pipeline of possible 
opportuni � es. The � ming and terms of any par � cular deal 
is di ﬃ  cult to predict. To support this, the Board sees an 
appropriate target net indebtedness level of not more than 1.5x 
net borrowings to EBITDA. This could rise for a period of � me 
closer to the Group’s  nancing arrangements limit if there was 
an excep � onal acquisi � on and the Board was con  dent that 
leverage would reduce in a � mely manner post such acquisi � on.
Safety, health and environment
We are con � nuing our journey with our Safety, Health and 
Environmental Leadership Team (SHELT) programme. We are 
encouraged by the commitment of employees to iden � fy 
hazards and make proac � ve sugges � ons for changes to reduce 
risk. This is improving the safety of our working environment 
as we can take ac � on before issues arise. The Group maintains 
its good health and safety record with no serious incidents and 
improved sta ﬀ  safety recognised in a decrease in the accident 
count during the year. The Group is commi � ed to opera � ng in 
an environmentally sustainable way and we have reduced our 
normalised greenhouse gas emissions despite our growth.
 P eople
We are pleased with the ongoing engagement of our employees 
with our vision of ‘Bringing life to technology™’. Our people have 
used their talents to sustain innova � on and supply the solu � ons 
our customers seek. Our sta ﬀ  are commi � ed to pu �  ng the 
customer at the centre of everything that they do, simplifying 
how they do things and opera � ng in an e ﬀ ec � ve and e ﬃ  cient 
manner. We regularly celebrate success and value everyone’s 
contribu � on and are working together to improve what we do 
and work smarter. 
We remain commi � ed to o ﬀ ering opportuni � es to our people 
and new joiners to develop their careers. Amongst our sta ﬀ  of 
1,750, we welcome 271 new joiners, 29 of whom are on our 
graduate and appren � ce schemes, and we congratulate 113 
people who have been promoted. 
We are grateful to all of our employees for their hard work 
during this year and thank them for their commitment and 
success in growing the Group’s businesses. It was par � cularly 
pleasing to see the commitment of our people to deliver the 
performance in the  nal quarter. We were able to formally 
recognise this through discre � onary bonus payments at modest 
cost. 
Overall, we are pleased that we are delivering ‘Our vision, our 
future’.
Outlook
Whilst we remain cau � ous about the broader economic 
environment, our outlook for the current  nancial year remains 
unchanged with a similar  rst half, second half weigh � ng to that 
in the previous  nancial year.

Our strategy
FOCUS IN 2017 PROGRESS IN 2016
FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS
Our focus on our customers is at the 
core of our strategy.  
The divisions are empowered to focus 
on their customers’ needs and have the 
power and the responsibility for end-to-end 
delivery to customers. Our customers are 
apprecia � ng the changes we have made and 
this is being demonstrated in the improving 
feedback and increasingly they are looking 
to work with us as their trusted partner for 
their future developments.
We are looking to build greater customer 
in � macy and will con � nue to focus on 
our strategic customers. We will look to 
con � nue to make new markets and take 
market share with a focus on key market 
leaders. 
Our people have embraced the vision and 
the new brand and are making the change 
happen. They understand how they make 
a di ﬀ erence to people’s lives working in 
partnership with our customers.  
We will con � nue to be consistent in our 
internal communica � ons, with a focus on 
our founda � ons and values and explaining 
how everyone can play their part.
We have seen new product introduc � ons 
par � cularly in Imaging and Semiconductors, 
which have been well received by our 
customers. In our Space Imaging and 
RF Power customer programmes we 
are working at the cu �  ng edge of the 
technology, delivering high quality bespoke 
products. We have successfully completed 
the integra � on of AnaFocus which has 
accelerated innova � on within Imaging.  
We will complete the integra � on of SP 
Devices in the coming year and are already 
seeing the bene  ts that this team brings 
to the Semiconductors division. We will 
con � nue to invest in innova � on in our 
chosen markets where we see that there 
is strong customer pull and increasingly 
working with our customers as their trusted 
innova � on partner.
We have seen good progress across the 
business, with improved performance 
in each of our divisions.  Our people are 
open to doing things di ﬀ erently. They 
can see that their ideas for improvement 
are being listened to and are keen to 
share these, underpinning our drive for 
opera � onal excellence throughout the 
Group. As a result, we have made signi  cant 
improvements in areas which are cri � cal to 
our customers, including on- � me delivery.
We are looking for further opera � onal 
improvement in Space Imaging, and to focus 
on process e ﬀ ec � veness across the Group, 
along with a reduc � on in inventory cycle 
� me.
We saw strong revenue growth in Imaging, 
both in Professional Imaging and Space 
Imaging, driven by innova � on and improving 
opera � onal performance. We have 
delivered a signi  cant margin improvement 
in Imaging and Semiconductors.  In RF 
Power we saw modest margin improvement 
despite lower revenue, demonstra � ng the 
bene  ts of reorganisa � on and good cost 
control.
In slower growth markets, our organic 
growth will come from taking market share 
through innova � on and making new markets 
through new product introduc � ons. This 
means that to achieve our goal will require 
a greater propor � on of growth to come 
through acquisi � on and we con � nue to build 
our acquisi � on pipeline.
EMBED NEW CULTURE 
Retaining the best from our 
engineering heritage whilst 
simplifying processes and building 
a responsive and energe � c 
organisa � on.
SUSTAIN INNOVATION
Our people are encouraged to use 
their talents to sustain innova � on and 
supply the solu � ons our customers 
seek.
OPERATE WITH EXCELLENCE
We seek to operate with excellence, 
shown by rigorous execu � on driving 
responsiveness and agility.
GROW ORGANICALLY 
Accelerate with 
acquisi ons We will con � nue to focus on 
delivering organic growth, 
with accelera � on coming from 
acquisi � ons. 001

• Strategic realignment  – The Group seeks to achieve organic growth by 
further expansion into sub-systems and solu � ons.
• Advancement of technology – e2v operates in compe � � ve global 
markets characterised by con � nuous technological development.
• Change management – The reposi � oning of the Group is requiring 
organisa � onal change.
• Knowledge and skills – Our success  is reliant on our ability to a � ract, 
retain and con � nuously develop the right people in all areas of the 
business.
• Failure to protect the Group’s  intellectual property could result in loss 
of compe � � ve advantage.
The Group faces a number of opera � onal risks including:
• Long term contract execu� on
• Cyber security
• Product quality
• Supply chain disrup � on
• Compliance with Laws and regula � ons
• Fluctua � ons in exchange rates
• Global markets – e2v’s business is subject to wider poli � cal and 
macroeconomic condi � ons, par � cularly as a number of our end 
applica � ons are dependent on, and subject to, governmental policies 
and budgetary constraints.
• Acquisi � ons –  There is a risk that they may fail to integrate or realise 
the expected bene  ts. 001

 Our vision 
Our vision of ‘Bringing life to technology™’ is central to how 
we operate. It provides the Group with our common purpose, 
namely ‘we partner with our customers to improve, save and 
protect people’s lives’. It informs our decision making so that 
our innova � ons lead developments in automa � on, healthcare, 
communica � ons, safety, discovery and the environment. 
During the year, we have been embedding our new culture. All 
sta ﬀ  events in both Chelmsford and Grenoble demonstrated that 
our people understand our vision, brand and values and how 
they can play their part in making it real for both our customers 
and their colleagues.
Our strategy 
 Our focus on our customers is at the core of this framework. We 
ac � vely listen to our customers’ feedback and we are responding 
to what they tell us through delivering what our customers value, 
rather than what we seek to achieve technically. The divisions 
are empowered to focus on their customers’ needs and have 
the power and the responsibility for end-to-end delivery to 
customers. Our customers are apprecia � ng the changes we 
have made and this is being demonstrated in the improving 
feedback we receive from them in our annual customer survey 
and increasingly they are looking to work with us as their trusted 
partner for their future developments. We are looking to build 
greater customer in � macy and will con � nue to focus on our 
strategic customers.
We are seeing good progress in embedding our culture, which 
is retaining the best from our engineering heritage whilst 
simplifying processes and building a responsive and energe � c 
organisa � on. Our people have embraced the vision and the new 
brand and are making the change happen. They understand how 
they make a di ﬀ erence to people’s lives working in partnership 
with our customers. We have been consistent in our internal 
communica � ons, with a focus on our founda � ons and values 
and explaining how everyone can play their part. This means our 
people understand what is expected of them and can work more 
e ﬀ ec � vely. 
Our people are encouraged to use their talents to sustain 
innova � on and supply the solu � ons our customers seek. We 
have seen new product introduc � ons par � cularly in Imaging 
and Semiconductors, which have been well received by our 
customers. In our Space Imaging and RF Power customer 
programmes we are working at the cu �  ng edge of the 
technology, delivering high quality bespoke products. We have 
successfully completed the integra � on of AnaFocus which has 
accelerated innova � on within Imaging. We will complete the 
integra � on of SP Devices in the coming year and are already 
seeing the bene  ts that this team brings to the Semiconductors 
division.
We seek to operate with excellence, shown by rigorous 
execu � on driving responsiveness and agility. We have seen 
good progress across the business, with improved performance 
in each of our divisions. Our people are open to doing things 
di ﬀ erently. They can see that their ideas for improvement are 
being listened to and are keen to share these, underpinning our 
drive for opera � onal excellence throughout the Group. As a 
result, we have made signi  cant improvements in areas which 
are cri � cal to our customers, including on- � me delivery. We are 
looking for further opera � onal improvement in Space Imaging, 
and to focus on process e ﬀ ec � veness across the Group along 
with a reduc � on in inventory cycle � me.
We will con � nue to focus on delivering organic growth, with 
accelera � on coming from acquisi � ons and we are con � nuing to 
build our acquisi � on pipeline.

Shareholder Informa � on Strategic Report Governance Financials
Our opera ng model
We operate in interna � onal markets, with global supply chains. 
We have nine main engineering facili � es and six sales o ﬃ  ces 
across Europe, the US and Asia Paci  c to support our global 
customers. We have moved our facility in Beijing to be closer 
to our  radiotherapy customers, we have also opened a new 
facility in Shenzhen to support our Professional Imaging business 
and we are expanding our o ﬃ  ce in Japan to support the new 
business opportuni � es that AnaFocus has generated. The Group 
is organised according to the needs of our customers in three 
divisions: Imaging, RF Power and Semiconductors. The three 
divisions have full end-to-end pro  t and loss responsibility for 
their businesses; covering responsibility for product design and 
development, opera � ons, sales and customer services. During 
the year we completed the reorganisa � on of the regional teams 
in the US and Asia so that they too are aligned with the divisions. 
We have also completed the reorganisa � on of the remainder of 
Group opera � ons, with purchasing and facili � es being moved 
into the divisions. This signi  cantly reduced the size of the Group 
func � ons and empowers the divisions to focus on delivery 
to their customers. The divisions are now customer-led and 
supported by the Group which provides guidance and oversight 
on a ‘trust and verify’ basis.
Over the last year we have con � nued to strengthen our 
opera � onal founda � ons. Through focusing on our customers, 
we have further simpli  ed our business processes, making us 
more agile as an organisa � on. We are embedding a culture of 
opera � onal excellence and are seeing the bene  ts in all three 
divisions. We have con � nued to strengthen our management 
teams under our  Execu � ve leadership team, and they are driving 
change throughout the business.
The divisions deliver value to their customers in global 
applica � on segments. We partner with our customers to 
improve save and protect peoples’ lives.
The Group func � on provides strategic direc � on and support, 
and drives best prac � ce. It also provides some common services 
for the divisions.
Our markets
We focus our investment where we see strong customer demand 
for access to technology pla � orms for end market sectors with 
above GDP growth poten � al. These markets should also provide 
us with medium to high margin poten � al. We are priori � sing 
our investment in four business areas: Industrial Vision, Space, 
Radiotherapy and Semiconductors. We will also maintain our 
engagement in the segments where we see customer demand 
suppor � ng an a � rac � ve  nancial pro  le suppor � ng investment 
aligned to customers.
Our highly skilled workforce is trusted by our customers to 
supply technically complex solu � ons for our customers’ systems. 
We seek to generate growth through providing higher value 
solu � ons and new product development, pla � orm life extension 
and upgrade, and new applica � ons for our exis � ng technologies. 
The top two market sectors of focus for our Industrial Vision 
business are automa � on and healthcare. Both of these sectors 
have the poten � al for strong growth in the medium term. In 
the automa � on sector we now have good market coverage 
within Professional Imaging. In healthcare, we have the poten � al 
to con � nue to support our Radiotherapy OEMs. In our other 
markets, communica � on includes both moving people and 
enabling direct communica � on around the world covering 
space, civil avia � on, and marine sectors. Discovery is driven by 
mankind’s thirst for knowledge and o ﬀ ers growth opportuni � es 
par � cularly for space, planetary observa � on, and science 
imaging. Safety includes our passive defence sectors and 
re  ects the level of government spending in these sectors. The 
environmental market is driven by concern for our world and 
its  nite resources and covers earth observa � on and science 
sectors.
Our performance
Reported revenue of £236.4m is up 5.1% compared with the 
last  nancial year. Organic revenue growth was 1.4% before the 
bene  t of the acquisi � ons and excluding  the sale of the Thermal 
Imaging business. We also bene  ted from foreign exchange 
increasing reported revenue by 2.4%. In Industrial Vision we 
saw strong demand for automa � c data collec � on, machine 
vision sensors, and op � cal inspec � on CMOS cameras. In Space 
Imaging we had good growth from delivery on a number of our 
key programmes. We saw modest growth in  radiotherapy with 
increased demand from our key OEM customers, whilst we have 
absorbed some destocking. The weakness in RF defence was 
more pronounced than we an � cipated with some programme 
wins being delayed. In Semiconductors we saw increased ac � vity 
in the US along with good growth from our own design data 
converters, being o ﬀ set by lower demand for microprocessors 
and the an� cipated decline in the legacy ASIC business. In the 
 rst  ve months of the year, AnaFocus contributed addi � onal 
revenue of £4.4m, and SP Devices contributed £0.6m since its 
acquisi � on in January 2016.
Adjusted
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t of £42.0m re  ects the contribu � on 
from organic revenue growth of £1.9m. We are seeing the 
change in culture improve opera � onal performance, with 
reorganisa � on and cost reduc � on in those areas where growth 
has been slower than an � cipated. We have drawn on the 
 exibility established in the cost base with a reduc � on in the 
number of temporary sta ﬀ  and contractors along with lower 
incen � ve payments. We increased margins in Space Imaging as 
we are beginning to see the bene  t of improved opera � onal 
performance and delivery to customers. We absorbed a 
signi  cant swing in foreign exchange. The revenue bene  t of 
foreign exchange was partly o ﬀ set by the transla � on of working 
capital and realised losses on foreign exchange hedging. To 
support growth we have con � nued to target our research and 
development ac � vi � es where we see the poten � al for market 
growth and strong demand from our customers. We have 
also con � nued to increase selling and applica � on engineering 
resources in Asia to support customers in this region.

Annual Report & Financial Statements 
2012

Net borrowings of £21.1m, increased by £15.9m. In terms of 
working capital movements this is in line with our working capital 
model, and decisions that we consciously made in the second 
half. Inventory and trade receivables increased in Imaging 
to support growth. We have progressed our reorganisa � ons 
and made lower accruals for incen � ves in the year. We have 
con � nued to focus on our customers with our programme to 
reduce concentra � on in our supply chains and this along with 
u � lisa � on of advanced payments on Space programmes has 
also called upon working capital. This was in part supported by 
reduc � ons in planned capital expenditure in the later part of 
the year such that this remained equivalent to deprecia � on and 
amor � sa � on. Acquisi � ons u � lised cash of £13.0m. This included 
the acquisi � on in January of SP Devices, earn out payments on 
AnaFocus and product line acquisi � ons in Semiconductors. In 
October we sold the Thermal Imaging business.
Our closing order book at 31 March 2016 was £182m (2015: 
£191m) re  ec � ng good order intake in Professional Imaging, 
o ﬀ set by lower order intake in Space Imaging, RF Power and 
Semiconductors. Our order book for delivery over the coming 12 
months was £130m (2015: £146m), a decrease of 11%. The order 
book re  ects the progress made in Space Imaging on the current 
programmes, con � nued growth in our shorter order cover 
businesses and the cycle on our  radiotherapy orders.
Our goal
Our goal is to double the size of the Group by 2020, with 
reference to the adjusted opera � ng pro  t of the  nancial year 
ended 31 March 2015. In slower growth markets, our organic 
growth will come from taking market share through innova � on 
and making new markets through new product introduc � ons. 
This means that to achieve our goal will require a greater 
propor � on of growth to come through acquisi � on and we 
con � nue to build our acquisi � on pipeline, although the � ming 
and terms of any par � cular deal is di ﬃ  cult to predict.
We will con � nue to consider acquisi � on opportuni � es that are 
a good  t with our strategy and that accelerate our ongoing 
organic growth by providing us with further technological know-
how, as well as both strengthen our customer rela � onships and 
bring talented people. 
In summary, our investment proposi � on is revenue driven 
growth, based on being our customer’s trusted expert partner, 
whilst retaining a resilient  nancial pro  le in support of our 
progressive dividend policy.

 Our value proposi on 
– what we do and our key drivers 
Imaging is arranged in two business streams: Professional 
Imaging and Space Imaging. 
We provide high quality imaging sensors, cameras and 
sub-systems delivering high performance for our customers 
across a range of applica � ons in the automa � on, healthcare, 
discovery and environment markets. 
For Professional Imaging we provide high performance image 
sensors and cameras solu � ons in the form of customer speci  c 
products that we develop for our customers, as their innova � on 
partner, or as applica � on speci  c standard products. 
For Space Imaging we provide high performance and high quality 
space quali  ed imaging sensors and arrays for space science and 
astronomy applica � ons and high speed, high resolu � on sensors 
for earth observa � on satellites.  
 Customers and markets 
In Professional Imaging the industrial vision market is driven by 
the increased use of sensors in industrial automa � on for quality 
and e ﬃ  ciency where we see high single  gure market growth 
rates. AnaFocus has brought new customers and strengthened 
our exis � ng rela � onships. It provides growth through innova � on 
leading to new product lines and winning custom programmes. 
We work for specialised OEMs who are market leaders in the 
applica � on of imaging technology for factory automa � on, op � cal 
inspec � on, automa � c data collec � on, x-ray radiography and life 
sciences. We are well posi � oned to take advantage of the  ve 
year plan in China for automa � on to support the quality drive 
to ‘made in China.’ In the year, the combina � on of new product 
introduc � on and innova � on has doubled our growth. 
In Space, governments increasingly seek to maintain 
independent observa � on capabili � es. The expansion of climate 
change monitoring is driving a growing demand for new 
observa � on satellite programmes. We have a strong posi � on 
in Europe par � cularly in CCD sensors and our o ﬀ ering remains 
a � rac � ve to customers due to its long proven performance 
in  ight. The main end users are worldwide space agencies 
including ESA, NASA, JAXA and CSA, as well as the prime satellite 
manufacturers, including Astrium, Ball Aerospace, Lockheed 
Mar � n and Thales. We also provide sensors and sub-systems 
for use in ground based astronomy applica � ons, where the 
customers are typically academic ins � tu � ons, with our camera 
for JPAS due for delivery soon.
 Oper a onal progress 
We have con � nued to develop our rela � onships with the key 
OEMs with our ambi � on to be their trusted innova � on partner. 
We have invested in our product por � olio and widened our 
scope of services with the integra � on of AnaFocus that provides 
customer speci  c CMOS sensors for a range of applica � ons. 
We are focused on the areas that have the poten � al for strong 
growth and as part of this increasing focus. We sold our Thermal 
Imaging business during the year.
In Space Imaging, we work closely with our customers on their 
technically challenging programmes, providing solu � ons that 
meet their demanding requirements on the next genera � on 
of projects. We build understanding of their requirements and 
innovate subject to their constraints. We have established a new 
management team under the new divisional  President and we 
have seen the start of the opera � onal improvement and delivery 
to our customers. The recovery programme being addressed by 
the new management team is complex and mul � faceted and will 
take some � me.
We are pleased with the pace of progress. A year ago we had ten 
larger problem contracts. In the year four of these have been 
delivered or our  nancial posi � on improved with a further  ve 
due for delivery in this current  nancial year.

Performance 
 Reported revenue increased by 16.7% to £103.5m 
(2015: £88.7m) showing the fastest growth in the Group and 
now represen � ng over 44% of Group revenue. Excluding 
AnaFocus, foreign exchange and the sale of Thermal Imaging, 
organic growth was 12%. Professional Imaging represents two 
thirds of the division’s revenue with the balance coming from 
Space Imaging. Underlying growth came from strong demand 
in automa � c data collec � on, machine vision sensors and op � cal 
inspec � on CMOS cameras. Life sciences delivered modest 
growth re  ec � ng stronger end user demand. In Space Imaging, 
revenue growth came through delivery on programmes, 
although these programmes remain technically challenging and 
we are con � nuing to commit the resources needed to improve 
delivery to our customers. 
The division’s adjusted
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t was £15.7m 
(2015: £9.3m), an increase of 69%. Overall pro  t growth re  ects 
the contribu � on from the revenue growth with Professional 
Imaging delivering improving margins and in Space Imaging 
margin improvement re  ects the bene  t of the improving 
opera � onal performance. R&D ac � vi � es have been increased 
to drive future growth, focusing on areas of strong customer 
demand in par � cular industrial automa � on and Space. In 
line with our working capital model there is a higher level of 
inventory re  ec � ng revenue growth.
The order book at 31 March 2016 was £93m (2015: £90m). The 
orders due for delivery in 12 months as at 31 March 2016 were 
£60m (2015: £70m), re  ec � ng delivery on Space programmes, 
and the shorter order cycle nature of the Professional Imaging 
business.
The focus for the coming year in Professional Imaging is to make 
new markets and take market share with a focus on key market 
leaders. In Space the focus is on embedding the opera � onal 
changes and deliver ongoing margin improvement.

Customer Focus
With the opening of our new o ﬃ  ce in Yokohama, Japan, 
we have expanded our team in the region, o ﬀ ering greater 
in-country engineering support and local exper � se. Having 
a be � er understanding of our customers’ demanding 
applica � ons, and being able to respond in a more agile 
manner, has enabled us to develop and secure a range of 
new opportuni � es with global players.
We’ve recently secured a contract with a market leader 
in the ophthalmology sector in Japan – one of our largest 
contracts to date in Asia Paci  c. This contract has seen us 
partner with the customer to develop their next genera � on 
of op � cal coherence tomography devices, using line scan 
cameras manufactured in our facility in Grenoble, France. 
Working with this original equipment manufacturer, our 
innova � on is changing the way that physicians are able to 
diagnose a range of eye condi� ons, such as glaucoma and 
macular degenera � on, improving lives through enhanced 
diagnosis technology. 
We are seeing the bene  ts of having local o ﬃ  ces 
suppor � ng local customers, with the opening of our new 
oﬃ  ce in Beijing, and are making good progress in the 
provision and support of sub-systems into the radiotherapy 
market in China. We have established a test and evalua � on 
capability which is both a � rac � ng new customers, and 
helping our exis � ng customers as design and manufacturing 
moves into the region.   001

 Our value proposi on
 –  what we do and our key drivers 
We add value to our customers through consistently supplying 
reliable applica � on speci  c products, addressing di ﬃ  cult 
engineering challenges and providing long-term con � nuity 
support. 
We produce components and sub-systems that deliver high 
performance and high reliability radio frequency power 
genera � on for healthcare, industrial and defence applica � ons. 
The key growth drivers for the division are the increasing 
incidence of cancer worldwide, industrial growth and the level of 
defence spending.
 Customers and markets 
We sell to a diverse range of markets with a common need for 
high power radio frequency solu � ons. Our key market is medical 
radiotherapy where we work with all the leading systems 
suppliers. We also supply OEMs in the healthcare, automa � on, 
safety and communica � on markets. 
In radiotherapy we con � nue to an � cipate that spares revenue 
will grow in line with the past expansion of the installed base 
over the last  ve to ten years. Revenue growth is an � cipated 
from con � nued new build demand, which accounts for 
approximately one third of the growth, and which currently 
has low single  gure growth rates, with two thirds from the 
installed base which has had higher growth rates in prior years. 
We con � nue to engage with our customers to support their 
current organisa � onal priori � es. Our principal customers are the 
radiotherapy system OEMs including Accuray, Elekta and Varian.
Other applica � ons include our commercial and industrial 
markets, covering radar for commercial shipping and 
applica � ons such as industrial hea � ng, industrial and dielectric 
welding, lasers and cargo screening. In defence, the key driver is 
the level of NATO defence spending. Defence budgets across the 
NATO countries are constrained and we do not an � cipate this 
changing in the short-term despite global and regional threats.
 
Opera onal progress 
The majority of the growth in the division is an � cipated to 
come from radiotherapy where we con � nue to priori � se our 
investment. Our other applica � ons con � nue to be driven by the 
general industrial cycle. Defence will remain subdued re  ec � ng 
defence budgets. 
During the year we made progress on our site restructuring 
programme, Project Sunrise, which incorporates the new vision 
and brand, drives further opera � onal e ﬃ  ciency, consolidates the 
footprint of the ac � vi � es that support the por � olio and provides 
op � ons for the future use of space being vacated. We an � cipate 
that this programme will be completed over the next two years. 
We have also established separate units for the Lincoln based 
defence ac � vi � es.
Performance 
Reported revenue was £80.5m (2015: £84.2m) with modest 
growth in radiotherapy re  ec � ng increased demand from our 
key OEM customers, whilst absorbing some destocking, along 
with growth in our commercial and industrial markets. This was 
o ﬀ set by weakness in defence with slower than an � cipated 
programme wins and a pause in industrial processing systems. 
The division’s adjusted
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t was £18.7m 
(2015: £19.4m), re  ec � ng a modest improvement in the margin 
to 23.2% despite the lower revenue pro  le. This re  ects cost 
control and the alignment of the cost base in defence to the 
expected ac � vity level. Research and development ac � vi � es 
con � nue to be focused primarily on radiotherapy applica � ons. 
Inventory levels increased to support customer delivery and as 
part of a speci  c programme to reduce over concentra � on in the 
supply base and provide con � nuity of supply as new suppliers 
are quali  ed.

The order book at 31 March 2016 was £69m (2015: £80m). 
The decrease re  ects the cycle of the mul -year radiotherapy 
contracts with delivery against our contracts for our key OEM 
customers. We also had a reduc on in our defence order book 
re  ec ng slower than an cipated programme wins. The orders 
due for delivery in 12 months as at 31 March were £55m 
(2015: £58m), re  ec ng lower than a full year cover for 
radiotherapy. We secured a one year extension to one of our 
mul -year contracts with two more contracts up for renewal in 
the coming year.
The focus for the coming year is to grow radiotherapy revenue, 
suppor ng our key OEM customers who are increasingly focused 
on value.

  Oper a onal Excellence
  Over the last 12 months we have con nued with our 
focus on crea ng a world-class opera onal environment 
and have achieved the  rst phase of upgrading of our 
RF Power facili es at our Chelmsford site. In addi on, in 
September we successfully completed the expansion of 
our new clean room for CCD and CMOS image sensors, 
helping us to be er serve our demanding space, scien  c 
and ground based astronomy customers. The addi onal 
space will double our post-processing capacity, with an 
environment that con nually monitors temperature, 
humidity and par cle levels to deliver higher product 
quality by minimising the poten al of defects caused by 
contamina on. 
Overall, the improvements are  designed to help us deliver 
the best possible service to our customers in a quality 
driven environment, supported by streamlined, connected 
and common-sense process.
Underpinning this new opera onal environment is our 
commitment to maintain a healthy and safe workplace for 
all of our employees. Complying with health and safety isn’t 
a ‘ ck box’ exercise, it’s a fundamental approach to how 
we run the Group. Whilst we do not believe the number of 
hazards in our working environment has increased, we have 
seen a signi  cant upli  in the number of employees telling 
us about a poten al hazard. This is part of a very successful 
‘hazard spo  ng’ programme which is aimed at ensuring 
that we proac vely manage risks so that an incident does 
not occur.  001

 Our value proposi on 
–  what we do and our key drivers 
We provide high reliability semiconductors that meet the 
demanding speci  ca ons of our customers. Our design capability 
is enabling us to partner with customers and move up the value 
chain by providing customers with board-level solu ons and 
specialist applica ons exper se. SP Devices is providing access to 
new applica ons and sectors including test and measurement.
Through our strategic partnerships with Freescale, Everspin, 
Maxim and Micron we provide a range of high reliability versions 
of their standard products for use in aerospace applica ons. Our 
own design high speed data converters provide market leading 
performance for space and radio frequency communica ons. 
We also provide our customers with con nuity of supply for 
components that they value, avoiding risks associated with 
counterfeit products.
 Customers and markets 
We have con nued to focus on mee ng our customers’ 
requirements for high reliability, excellent service and on- me 
delivery. We have focused on our customers by increasing our 
business development resources to be er understand our 
customers’ needs, co-funded developments and strengthened 
our rela onships. We have also con nued our investment in 
growing our key strategic partnerships.
We see con nued ongoing market growth for high reliability 
products in civil avia on applica ons such as  ight control 
computers and engine management systems, driven by civil 
avia on produc on rates which have seen high single  gure 
growth rates. Our own designed space quali  ed data converters 
are winning market share as they enable our customers to 
reduce the size and weight of their satellites and at the same 
 me increase the number of communica on channels. The 
steady demand for products that are provided primarily into 
defence applica ons growth is driven by the  ow down of funds 
into the large defence OEMs.
Our in-house designed high speed data converters provide 
market leading performance for ADCs and DACs for space 
RF communica ons. Our data converters are used by most of 
the major space primes and  er one suppliers, including Boeing 
in the US where we secured a mul -year framework contract 
and Thales in Europe, where we enable high bandwidth radio 
frequency communica on links.
We were pleased to have completed the acquisi on of 
SP Devices in January 2016. SP Devices provides high 
performance sub-system solu ons for analogue to digital 
conversion applica ons. These are used by customers including 
leading original equipment manufacturers across a number of 
sectors, including industrial test and measurement, healthcare, 
communica ons and science. It also brings proven patented 
technology in so ware and board level sub-systems and 
services, which complements and enhances e2v’s broadband 
data converter business.
Opera onal progress 
We have introduced new own design high speed data converters 
and new mul -chip modules which enable our customers’ 
innova on. We have also secured design-ins for our products on 
future programmes for civil aerospace and space applica ons. 
During the year we completed the restructuring of the US 
opera ons and this has delivered cost reduc on and posi ons 
the business for the future.

Performance 
Reported revenue was £52.4m (2015: £52.0m). US legacy 
product lines saw revenue increase from  ow down on 
programmes, along with good growth coming from our own 
design high speed data converters for space applica � ons. This 
was o ﬀ set by lower demand for microprocessors. In other 
applica � ons there was the an � cipated decline in the legacy ASIC 
business as these products approach the end of their lifecycle. 
SP Devices contributed £0.6m in the last two months of the year.
The division’s adjusted
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t was £14.2m 
(2015: £11.9m), with a signi  cant improvement in the margin 
despite the decline in revenue. This was due to improved 
product mix, with growth in the higher margin lines, good cost 
control and improved opera � ng performance. Inventory levels 
have increased  to take advantage of opportuni � es for strategic 
product line acquisi � ons, SP Devices and to support short term 
delivery to customers.
The order book at 31 March 2016 was £20m (2015: £20m). 
Orders for delivery within 12 months as at 31 March are £15m 
(2015: £18m) . The lower order cover re  ects the an � cipated 
decline in the legacy ASICs business but also some delays to 
an � cipated orders in the  nal quarter of the year.
The focus for the coming year is on delivering growth from the 
product line acquisi � ons and announced microprocessor last 
� me buys. We will con � nue to invest in cards, subsystems and 
our own IP development moving up the value chain.

   Simpli  ca on
As part of the strategy for our Semiconductors division, 
we are looking to move up the value chain to provide 
customers with board-level solu � ons and specialist 
applica � ons exper� se. 
Our acquisi � on of Linkö ping-based Signal Processing 
(SP) Devices Sweden AB, a leader in the design and 
development of high performance analogue-to-digital 
processing technology, is a step forward in this approach. 
SP Devices is a great  t with our broadband data converter 
business and expands our capabili � es for communica � on, 
industrial and discovery end market applica � ons. 
We have realigned our sales and engineering resources to 
support our three levels of o ﬀ ering :  c omponen t, mul � chip 
module or subsystem.     With the aim of simplifying our 
customers’ design decisions, with a clear choice of product 
and service o ﬀ erings.   001

Principle Risks and Uncertain � es
Risk management approach
As noted in the Corporate Governance Report, the assessment 
and management of risk is a responsibility of the Board. The 
Execu � ve Directors lead the risk management process which 
includes a formal process for iden � fying, evalua � ng and 
managing the signi  cant risks faced by the Group, organised 
around a three- � ered framework at the process, management 
and strategic levels within the organisa � on.
A robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group has 
been carried out and the details of those risks and the Group’s 
approach to mi � ga � ng them are set out below. The assessment 
includes previously iden �  ed risks, and where appropriate, their 
mi � ga � on, being monitored monthly at the Board and divisional 
review mee � ngs, and any newly iden �  ed risks are evaluated as 
required. A detailed risk review is carried out and presented to 
the Audit Commi � ee, where the validity of the risk management 
process is assessed, the relevance and poten � al e ﬀ ects of the 
principal risks and uncertain � es are reviewed, and the net risk to 
the Group (a � er mi � ga � ng controls) is evaluated and assessed 
rela � ve to the risk appe � te of the Group. All risks are classi  ed 
based on a matrix of likelihood of occurrence compared with 
implica � ons for the business, and are aligned with the strategic 
drivers of the business.
Principal risks
The principal risks are listed in the following table, along 
with their poten � al e ﬀ ect and mi � ga � on. The  nancial risks 
associated with interest rates, credit and liquidity are discussed 
in note 31 to the consolidated  nancial statements.
Risk & Poten � al E ﬀ ect Mi� ga � ng Ac� ons
Focus on customer
Strategic realignment
The Group seeks to achieve organic growth by further expansion 
into o ﬀ ering sub-systems and solu � ons. By reposi � oning itself in 
the value chain the Group and its customers are seeking to engage 
on a development and advisory basis. This carries inherent risks 
in execu � on, par � cularly with regard to  nding and retaining the 
appropriate personnel.
•   Developing customer  rst focus further and embedding 
throughout the Group’s processes. 
•  Reposi � oning product o ﬀ erings at a higher level in the value 
chain, resul � ng in increased involvement in customers’ design 
processes, reducing the poten � al exposure to short term vola � lity 
in customer sourcing.
•  Con � nued investment in research and development, 
manufacturing, marke � ng, customer service support, people 
with the required skill sets and distribu � on networks to ensure 
compe � � veness in strategic growth areas.
Advancement in technology
e2v operates in compe � � ve global markets characterised by con � nuous 
technological development which is integral to the Group’s business of 
design and manufacture of specialist technology for high performance 
systems and equipment. Failure to innovate could result in our product 
o ﬀ ering becoming obsolete. The development of new technologies 
carries risks including failure to develop a commercially viable o ﬀ ering, 
taking longer to reach the market than planned and the risk that market 
size will be smaller than originally envisaged.
•  Focussing research and development programmes on innova � ons 
consistent with the Group’s strategic aims whilst accelera � ng 
investment through support, where possible, from government 
grant ini � a� ves.
•  Working closely with customers to ensure the Group develops 
solu � ons tailored to their needs and involving them extensively 
during product development.
Embed new culture
Change management
The reposi � oning of the Group in the value chain, growth both 
organically and through acquisi � ons, and the embedding of a culture 
that is customer-driven, is requiring organisa � onal change. If not 
properly managed and communicated, there is a risk that the skills of 
our people will not align to new strategic requirements.
•  Maintaining development and succession programmes, 
compe � � ve remunera � on and good communica � ons at all levels.
Sustain innova on
Knowledge and skills
Our business invests signi  cantly in the research and development 
of technologically advanced products. Failure to protect the Group’s 
intellectual property could result in lack of compe � � ve advantage 
and products, erosion of margin, or inability to recover investment.
In addi � on, our success is reliant on our ability to a � ract, retain and 
con � nuously develop the right people in all areas of the business. In 
par � cular to deliver the strategic growth opportuni � es, the Group 
relies heavily on the skills, experience and competence of its people.
•  Iden �  ca� on and documenta � on of intellectual property arising 
throughout development, with protec � on of certain products and 
manufacturing processes by the use of patents.
•  Safeguarding know-how by ensuring suppliers, customers and 
employees are subject to con  den � ality obliga � ons in respect of 
treatment and disclosure of intellectual property.
•  Maintaining development and succession programmes, compe � � ve 
remunera � on and good communica � ons at all levels. 001

Risk & Poten � al E ﬀ ect Mi� ga � ng Ac� ons
Operate with excellence
Long term contract execu � on
Approximately one quarter of the Group’s revenue relates to long term 
contracts, many of which involve advancements in technology and 
are  xed price. An inherent risk in  xed price contracts is that actual 
performance costs may exceed the projected costs on which the 
contracts are agreed; where failure to an � cipate technical problems, 
es � mate costs accurately or control costs during the performance of a 
contract can reduce its pro  tability or result in a loss.
•  Major projects are subject to peer review and Execu � ve 
Management approval.
•  Projects are reviewed at levels and frequencies appropriate to 
their performance and poten � al risks.
•  Work is underway to improve project management discipline 
across the Group and ensure appropriate tools are available.
Cyber security
Computer systems are cri � cal to the business and its future growth. 
A complete failure of the IT system, with the loss of trading and other 
records, would be damaging to the business. Furthermore, e2v faces an 
increased threat of system security breaches and data loss (including 
uninten � onal loss by employees) due to velocity of change in the 
dynamic external environment and as a result of the Group’s expansion 
increasing global informa � on sharing.
•  Senior management IT  Governance  Commi � ee iden �  es emerging 
external IT issues and priori � ses mi � ga � ng ac � ons.
•  Insider threat program, training of managers to raise awareness and 
assist in threat detec � on. 
•  Reviewing and enhancing IT security policies and tools on a 
con � nuing basis.
•  Con � nued development of IT security processes, procedures and 
planned responses to incidences
Product quality and liabili � es
There is a risk that the Group’s products do not achieve the required 
speci  ca � on or deliver to the customer’s expecta � ons which could 
lead to signi  cant liabili � es for warranty claims, defects and product 
recalls.
•  Standardising produc � on, where prac � cal, and applying stringent 
quality procedures to minimise produc � on defects.
•  Minimise poten � al risks arising from complex or extended 
contracts through speci  ca � on certainty and clear contractual 
arrangements through a robust contract review process.
Supply chain disrup � on
e2v’s ability to supply products to our customers could be adversely 
a ﬀ ected by a disaster or disrup � ve event at any of the Group’s 
manufacturing loca � ons or those of key suppliers. Any interrup � on 
to supplies, or increases in costs, could adversely a ﬀ ect our  nancial 
posi � on and future trading.
For both projects and the produc � on of standard product, there are a 
number of strategic partnerships and a reliance on external suppliers 
for specialist materials and products, o � en in small quan � � es. Some 
of these may be sourced from a single supplier, par � cularly for custom 
built or older components, and supply may be vulnerable to delay as 
suppliers priori � se customers with volume orders.
•  Maintaining our global business con � nuity plan to minimise any 
business implica � ons or disrup � on to produc � on capability and 
subjec � ng the plan to tes � ng to manage the risk of a loss of a major 
produc � on facility or supplier.
•  Mi � ga � ng  nancial e ﬀ ect through business interrup � on insurance.
•  Using accredited supplier programmes and cemen � ng long term 
partnership based rela � onships at every point in the supply chain.
•  Standardising components in produc � on developments and 
retaining appropriate inventory levels of components.
•  Determining and valida � ng other suppliers/ sources of supply for key 
materials reducing the number of components/  materials purchased 
from a sole supplier
Laws and regula � ons
e2v is subject to applicable laws and regula � ons of many jurisdic � ons, 
on subjects including but not limited to, export-import controls, health 
and safety, environmental, tax, ethical ma � ers including bribery and 
corrup � on. 
Failing to comply could harm business opera � ons or the Group’s 
reputa � on.
•  Employing individuals with relevant experience in these areas, aided 
by outside advisors where required, to oversee management of 
these dynamic risks.
•  Deploying resources to meet new requirements as they arise.
•  Emphasizing an ethical business conduct programme.
•  Monitoring compliance by regular repor � ng to the Board.
Foreign currency
The Group operates interna � onally and is exposed to a number 
of foreign currencies, the most signi  cant being the US dollar and 
Euro. Fluctua � ons in exchange rates will e ﬀ ect both foreign currency 
denominated transac � ons and the transla � on of net assets and 
income statements of foreign subsidiaries which could result in pro  t 
and balance sheet vola � lity.
•  Hedging policy to manage transac � onal currency exposure. See 
note 31 to the consolidated  nancial statements for further details.
Grow organically (accelerate with acquisi ons)
Global markets
e2v’s business is subject to wider poli � cal and macro-economic 
condi � ons, par � cularly as a number of the Group’s products are 
supplied for use into industries which are dependent upon, and 
subject to, government policies and na � onal and interna � onal 
poli � cal considera � ons and budgetary constraints. Reduc � on 
in military spending or prolonged downturn due to recession or 
economic instability would adversely a ﬀ ect our sales.
•  Increasing diversity of products through ongoing development of 
strategic growth applica � on areas.
•  Expanding geographical spread.
•  Maintaining  exibility within the cost base to enable prompt 
response to signi  cant changes in market condi � ons and demand.
Acquisi � ons
The Group may pursue acquisi � ons as part of our growth strategy, but 
these could fail to integrate successfully or realise expected bene  ts.
•  Acquisi � ons are considered by reference to the strategic plan to 
ensure strategic  t.
•  Established approach for due diligence and integra � on being 
followed. 001

Corporate Responsibility Review
 At e2v we con � nue to manage our business against responsible 
and sustainable principles. We have strong Corporate 
Responsibility (CR) policies which underpin the way we work 
and ensure that we meet the high expecta � ons of all of 
our stakeholders. We report on  ve main areas – investors, 
employees, community, environment and supply chain, and full 
details of our CR policy and key performance indicators are on 
our website  at www.e2v.com/cr.
Steve Blair, Group CEO, maintains Execu � ve Commi � ee 
responsibility for the se �  ng and implementa � on of our CR 
polic ies, with members of our Execu � ve Commi � ee holding 
named responsibility for speci  c aspects of the policy.
Investors
We have an annual investor rela � ons programme designed 
to ensure that we appropriately communicate with current 
and prospec � ve analysts and investors. To manage and meet 
informa � on requirements about e2v, we post relevant reports and 
presenta � ons on the investor sec � on of our website, which also 
has a number of  nancial tools to aid analysis. The site is supported 
through appropriate releases on the Regulatory News System 
(RNS) . We also regularly host investor site visits and presenta � ons, 
encourage a � endance at our Annual General Mee � ng and 
appropriately respond to individual requests for informa � on. 
We have a target to reduce the number of printed copies of 
our  nancial reports to below 40% of our total number of 
shareholders. This year  53% of our shareholders requested 
printed copies (2015: 50%). We have also ceased to print paper 
copies of our  Half Yearly Financial Report.
We con � nue to be a member of the FTSE4Good Index, the 
responsible investment index calculated by global index provider 
FTSE Group.
Employees
Health and Safety
The safety and well-being of our people in all aspects of our 
opera � ons is cri � cal to the success of our business and to the 
wider communi � es in which we operate. We con � nue to start 
all formal mee � ngs with a ‘ Safety Share’ to ensure Health and 
Safety is kept at the forefront of everyone’s agenda. We are now 
in the 2nd year of our cultural HSE programme called Safety, 
Health, and Environment Leadership Team (SHELT). Since the 
launch of SHELT our  incident repor � ng sta � s � cs have shown 
posi � ve  improvements, with proac � ve incidents (hazard spots) 
increasing from 162 in 2015 to 577 in 2016,  and have seen that 
 rst aid incidents  have fallen from 174 in 2015 to 72 in 2016, a 
65% reduc � on. In addi � on, lost � me accidents have fallen from 
three in FY15 to one in FY16. SHELT Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) for each division are in place with the targeted compliance 
score of 85% for 2016 , to maintain a drive for HSE con � nuous 
improvement this score will be increased to 90% for 2017.
We have in place a comprehensive Health and Safety 
management system, which has been accredited with the 
OHSAS 18001 standards at the following manufacturing sites: 
Chelmsford,  Lincoln, and Grenoble.
Employee engagement
We believe that mo � vated employees deliver a be � er service 
to our customers, and we strive to make e2v a rewarding and 
enjoyable place  to work. During the last year we  ran quarterly 
pulse surveys with employees to monitor their levels of 
engagement, supported by face to face sessions with members 
of our Execu � ve Commi � ee. Over the 12 month period we 
have seen increases in a number of important areas, including 
being able to promptly respond to customers’ requests, and the 
Group doing a good job of keeping an individual informed about 
ma � ers a ﬀ ec � ng them. As part of ensuring that we create and 
maintain an environment in which employees feel recognised 
for the contribu � on that they make, we made 305 S TAR Awards 
(2015: 219), to recognise people who live our Group values and 
‘go above and beyond’. 
To recruit and retain the best employees, we have a number of 
talent schemes in place, including our Appren � ceship and Fast 
Track schemes. For the second year running our Appren � ceship 
scheme was recognised in the Na � onal Appren� ceship Service 
Awards, achieving Highly Commended in the large employer 
award. We also maintained our posi � on in their Top 100 List of 
Appren� ce Employers in the UK. During the year, 39 employees 
were o ﬀ ered roles on our Appren � ceship and internship 
schemes globally, and we are targe � ng similar levels for 2017. 
 Seven individuals joined the Company on the Graduate scheme 
and our middle to senior level Fast Track talent scheme has also 
proved to be extremely successful, with further informa � on on 
the success of the 2015 scheme on page   26 . 12 employees are 
now taking part in this year’s programme. 
We’ve rolled out a comprehensive suite of training courses 
that have been designed speci  cally around the needs of our 
divisions and their people and our growth strategy. In addi � on, 
our global Leadership Excellence programme has been rolled 
out, with 65 managers trained, ensuring we align our leadership 
style and skills for the delivery of our growth ambi � ons. 
We con � nue to support the educa � on and development of 
young people in rela � on to Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathema � cs (STEM), with 53 STEM ambassadors having 
a � ended local schools events and career fayres. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We aim to provide equality of opportunity in recruitment, 
training, promo � on and career development for all people, 
irrespec � ve of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orienta � on, 
gender or age. We give full considera � on to applica � ons for 
employment from an individual with a disability, where a person 
with a disability can adequately ful  l the requirements of the 
role and workplace adjustments can be made.
If an exis � ng employee becomes disabled, it is our policy, 
wherever prac � cable, to provide workplace adjustments 
to ensure con � nuing employment under normal terms and 
condi � ons, and to provide training, career development and 
promo � on opportuni � es, wherever appropriate.  001

Community
In addi � on to our responsibili � es to shareholders, customers 
and employees, we believe that the contribu � on we make to the 
wider community at a Group and individual level is important.
The Chari � es Commi � ee co-ordinates the charitable ac � vi � es 
of the Group and includes members from major sites around 
the world. It aims to meet every month and seeks to manage 
e ﬀ ec � vely the Group’s approach to charitable support. The 
commi � ee monitors the budget, distributes resul � ng funds 
and encourages employees in their charitable and community 
ac � vi � es.
The e2v Founda � on is a fund managed by Essex Community 
Founda � on (ECF). It is currently valued at £168,266 (2015: 
£178,766) and no contribu � on was made to the fund in 2016. 
In line with the rules of the fund, £8,858 (2015: £8,700) is 
available for dona � on to good causes. During 2015/16, £2,210 
of corporate sponsorship was donated. £1,000 of this was for 
Chelmsford Science and Engineering Society (CSES), and the 
remaining £1,210 was for local community ac � vi � es.
Our Core Chari � es are associated with e2v sites around the 
world. We have selected 10 chari � es with connec � ons to six 
sites. Funds were raised for these chari � es from a range of 
ac � vi � es, totalling more than £4,800. On a corporate basis, 
e2v made a dona � on of £5,000 to SOS Children’s Villages. The 
ac � vi � es of this charity, suppor � ng children in many ways, 
were described to e2v sta ﬀ  during a Lunch and Learn session. 
Colchester Treatment Centre is one of our Corporate Chari � es 
and raises funds to improve facili � es for cancer pa � ents at 
Colchester General Hospital. We made a dona � on of £10,000.
We recognise the importance of suppor � ng our employees and 
the local community in their fundraising e ﬀ orts. This year we 
made dona � ons totalling more than £7, 000.
Environment
We con � nue to be commi � ed to operate in an environmentally 
responsible manner. We manage, and where possible, reduce 
any impact on the environment from our opera � onal ac � vi � es.
Under mandatory greenhouse gas emission repor � ng, in 
2016 the Group greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 9% 
in absolute terms compared with 2015 and decreased by 13% 
when normalised with reference to revenue. 
We have iden �  ed electricity usage at the sites within 
our  nancial manufacturing por � olio boundary as the Key 
Performance Indicator (KPI) for energy management, and we 
are monitoring performance to allow the business to target 
appropriate reduc � ons. Electricity usage consistently represents 
approximately 80% of the organisa � on’s greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
In 2016 we piloted a project in our RF Power assembly areas 
at Chelmsford to ensure precious metal waste is separately 
collected and e ﬃ  ciently recycled. In addi � on, as part of our 
refurbishment ac � vi � es at Chelmsford,  the management of 
chemicals is being considered so that we can minimise any 
environmental impacts, including emissions and the risks of 
environmental incidents.

Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Reports) Regula � ons 2013, which fall within our  nancial control.
Combus � on of fuel and opera � on of facili � es includes the use 
of natural gas as a fuel, the use of oil for on-site electricity 
genera � on, the emission of process and refrigerant greenhouse 
gases from manufacturing and development ac � vi � es and the 
use of fuel in owned vehicles.
We have used the methods indicated in the DEFRA 
Environmental Repor � ng Guidelines, June 2013 edi � on. Emission 
factors from the UK Government’s ‘GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Repor � ng’ for the relevant year were used, where 
available. For other factors, the Interna � onal Energy Agency’s 
 gures in ‘CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combus � on, Highlights’ 
(2012 edi � on) were used.
The intensity ra � os have been calculated using the reported 
revenue for each  nancial year. No revenue restatements have 
been made rela � ng to the acquisi � on of SP Devices in January 
2016. The acquisi � on of SP Devices has had no impact on the 
CO2 emissions within the Group’s  nancial boundary.
We have in place a comprehensive  environmental management 
system which has been accredited with the ISO14001 standard 
at the following manufacturing sites: Chelmsford, Lincoln 
(Saddler Road), Milpitas and Grenoble. 001

   P eople 
During 2015 the  rst year par cipants in our Fast Track 
scheme successfully completed the programme. The 
scheme aims to further the careers of our middle to senior 
level managers who are excelling in their current roles and 
are keen to progress their careers in the organisa on. 
11 employees graduated from the scheme during the 
year, and more than half of these individuals have 
either achieved a promo on or have undertaken a more 
challenging role. 
One employee greatly bene   ng from the scheme was 
Farzana Khan, who has been promoted from a role as 
Supply Chain Manager to an IT  Engagement Manager. 
Having been with e2v for  four years, Farzana was keen 
to progress her career and bene  t from some of the 
opportuni es open to employees on the scheme, including 
regular mentoring from our Execu ve Commi ee and high 
pro  le, cross-regional project work. 
In Farzana’s new role, she is focused on driving change 
through IT simpli  ca on, con nuous improvement 
and opera onal excellence across the en re business 
landscape, suppor ng our current and future growth 
agenda.  
Corporate Responsibility Review (con nued)
Supply chain
We use best in class commodity management methodology and 
our procurement teams ensure that our sourcing and supplier 
development strategies are fully aligned with the Company’s 
growth goals and the objec ves of our external and internal 
customers.
Our e2v supplier performance reviews drive con nuous 
improvement by enabling the supplier base to focus on the 
key areas of cost, quality and service, in addi on to promo ng 
environmental, social and ethical best prac ces, while 
implemen ng risk mi ga on plans. 
From a compliance perspec ve, we expect suppliers to 
con  rm to e2v’s legal, commercial and ethical requirements in 
conjunc on with our Corporate Social Responsibility (CR) policy.
Our approach helps us to target a low cost of ownership, whilst 
also ensuring a sustainable, secure supply chain, as well as 
maintaining our exac ng quality standards. 001

Review of trading performance and KPIs
The Group’s revenue of £236.4m is up 5.1% compared with the 
last  nancial year. The business grew 1.4% before the bene  t 
of the acquisi � ons and excluding the e ﬀ ect of the sale of the 
Thermal Imaging business. We also bene  ted from a foreign 
exchange tailwind of 2.4%. By geographical spread, revenue was 
up in Asia Paci  c and the rest of the world with North America 
and Europe where revenue was steady. Geographic reach, the 
propor � on of revenue outside Western Europe increased to 59% 
(2015: 57%) re  ec � ng the revenue growth Asia Paci  c and the 
rest of the world. New business in the year, from new products 
or customers in the last three years, made up approximately 
17% of revenue (2015:19%) and business mix, the percentage of 
revenue from sub-systems and solu � ons, was 34% (2014: 35%).
Gross pro  t was £95.2m (2015: £96.2m) a decrease of 1.4% 
and represented 40.3% of revenues (2015: 42.8%). Included 
within gross margin is a signi  cant swing in foreign exchange 
with losses on the retransla � on of working capital and realised 
losses on foreign exchange contracts of £2.1m (2015: gains 
£3.4m). The majority of the revenue growth came from high to 
mid margin businesses, along with improvement in the margins 
on Space programmes. Gross margins bene  ted from improved 
opera � onal performance in RF Power and Semiconductors with 
good cost control and the use of  exibility established in the cost 
base, including lower incen � ve payments. The re-organisa � on 
of our Chelmsford site will improve the working environment for 
our people and increase  exibility. We are also completed the 
separa � on of the defence businesses based in Lincoln to add 
further  exibility as we manage the por � olio of RF businesses. 
For the coming year the bene  ts of the reorganisa � ons will be 
used to rebuild the  exibility in the cost base including incen � ve 
payments.
Net expenditure on research and development decreased 
to £13.8m (2015: £14.8m) represen � ng 5.8% of revenue. 
The expenditure has been focused on investment in the key 
programmes suppor � ng the growth opportuni � es. Of the 
spend during the year 87% was customer aligned. Grant funding 
decreased by £1.8m to £2.3m, as we reached the end of the 
funded phase of our Regional Growth Fund programmes. We 
also received funding in France from the PIA. The main R&D 
programmes include: sensors for Industrial Vision, our CMOS 
pla � orm and establishing the pla � orm for next genera � on 
semiconductor products, the next genera � on of RF genera � ng 
 We have increased our dividend 
by 5.9%, re  ec� ng our

sub-systems for Radiotherapy and process capability, coa � ngs 
and CMOS for Space. We con � nue to use subcontract resource 
where necessary to deliver these key programmes and also 
provide agility and  exibility.
Selling and distribu � on costs decreased by 2.8% to £17.1m 
(2015: £17.6m) re  ec � ng the reorganisa � on of our customer 
services teams and the comple � on of the US organisa � on, whilst 
we con � nue to expand our ac � vi � es in Asia.
Administra � ve costs decreased to £25.1m (2015: £32.7m). 
Administra � ve costs include a number of the items excluded 
from adjusted

 opera � ng pro  t totalling £3.0m (2015: £8.9m) 
as detailed below. The remaining administra � ve costs of £22.2m 
(2015: £23.8m) decreased by 6.7%, re  ec � ng the reorganisa � on 
of the US and lower incen � ve payments par � ally o ﬀ set by the 
pay review, whilst building the pla � orm with investment in our 
core IT systems and our expansion in Asia.

capital employed (adjusted

 opera � ng pro  t divided by net 
opera � ng assets and intangibles) was 20% (2015: 23%), re  ec � ng 
the increased opera � ng pro  t o ﬀ set by increased working 
capital and the intangible assets arising on the acquisi � on of SP 
Devices.
Amor � sa � on of acquired intangible assets of £2.8m increased 
from the prior year (2015: £2.3m) and primarily re  ects a 
full year of amor � sa � on on the assets associated with the 
acquisi � on of AnaFocus. During the year payments under the 
earn out were £2.5m following the strong performance of the 
business and the achievement of integra � on targets. The  nal 
payment of £1.2m is due in the  rst half of the current  nancial 
year as a result of AnaFocus achieving the earn out targets set at 
the � me of the acquisi � on. 
The Group completed the acquisi � on of SP Devices in January 
2016 and in connec � on with this the Group incurred one-o ﬀ  
transac � on costs of £0.2m. In the year, earn out payments 
to employees were recognised in rela � on to the AnaFocus 
acquisi � on along with foreign exchange losses on the 
outstanding con � ngent considera � on of £0.6m.
During the year a restructuring of the remainder of the Group’s 
central opera � ons and RF Power was undertaken. The Group 
also incurred some costs rela � ng to the re-organisa � on of 
its Chelmsford facility. We completed the reorganisa � on to 
implement our new vision and culture, to simplify our US 
opera � ons and establish a separate organisa � on for the 
specialist defence ac � vi � es of the Electronic Safety and Ini � a � on 
and our Defence Microwave business.
The Group’s overall foreign currency hedging policy is to put in 
place forward contracts to sell surplus currencies based on its 
trading forecasts, with the level of coverage decreasing over the 
next 12 months. The mark to market adjustment on this cover 
amounted to a gain of £0.6m (2015: loss £1.9m).
Finance charges
Net  nance costs were £1.2m (2015: £1.0m), an increase of 20% 
compared with the prior year re  ec � ng the level of debt over 
the course of the year. Of this £0.6m was non u � lisa � on cost and 
amor � sa � on of arrangement fees.
Taxa on
The tax charge for the year was £8.1m (2015: £6.3m). The 
e ﬀ ec � ve tax rate on reported pro  t for the year ended 31 March 
2016 was 21%. This re  ects a reduc � on in the UK tax rate to 20% 
(2015: 21%) par � ally o ﬀ set by higher pro  ts in France and Spain 
which are subject to higher rates of taxa � on. The tax charge in 
the current year has bene  ted from tax credits for research and 
development in the UK and France of £2.6m (2015: £2.3m). The 
e ﬀ ec � ve tax rate on adjusted
(1)
 pro  t before tax was 22%. For 
the current  nancial year we consider that the e ﬀ ec � ve rate on 
adjusted
(1)
 pro  t will be c.29% based on the planned distribu � on 
of pro  ts, with growth principally outside the UK, and re  ec � ng 
that the bene  t of R&D tax credits will be accounted for within 
pro  t before tax re  ec � ng changes in the tax credit regime in 
the UK.
The Group generated pro  ts in the UK, France, Spain and the 
US which were subject to tax at 20%, c.34%, 28% and c.40% 
(including state taxes) respec � vely.
Pro t for the year
The pro  t for the year is £29.7m (2015: £23.8m). The level of 
pro  tability re  ects the lower level of speci  c items in the 
year par � ally o ﬀ set by higher  nancing and tax costs. We have 
increased our dividend by 5.9%, re  ec � ng our progressive 
dividend policy. An interim dividend of 1.6 pence per share, was 
paid in December 2015, and  nal dividend of 3.8 pence per share 
is proposed. 001

Shareholder Informa � on Strategic Report Governance Financials
Currency
Our UK, Spanish and French manufacturing opera � ons sell 
through the Group’s global sales and distribu � on network and 
are therefore subject to transac � onal and transla � onal risks 
par � cularly in rela � on to the US dollar which accounts for 45% 
(2015: 45%) of the Group’s sales. Where US dollar receipts are 
forecast to exceed US dollar costs, su ﬃ  cient surplus US dollars 
are sold under foreign exchange contracts to cover costs 
incurred in the UK and France in accordance with the Group’s 
hedging policy.
Our view for the current year is based on exchange rates as at 
the end of March 2016. These rates provide a revenue tail wind 
of c.7%. As at the 31 March 2016 we have unrealised losses on 
our foreign exchange hedges of £0.8m on the balance sheet, 
which we an � cipate being realised in the current  nancial year. 
This combined with the transla � on of our overseas cost base 
means the net bene  t of exchange rates in terms of adjusted 
pro  t is es � mated to be around c.4%. The foreign exchange 
markets remain vola � le and the outcome will depend on how 
rates change over the course of the year.
Cash  ow and net borrowings
Net borrowings of £21.1m, increased by £15.9m. In terms of 
working capital movements this is in line with our working 
capital model, and decisions that we consciously made in the 
second half. In Imaging inventory increased by £3.0m and 
trade receivables increased by £2.1m to support growth. The 
cash ou � low on our reorganisa � ons and lower accruals for 
incen � ves accoun � ng amounted to £6.5m. We have con � nued 
to focus on our customers with our programme to reduce 
concentra � on in our supply chains and this along with u � lisa � on 
of advanced payments on Space programmes has absorbed 
a further £5.2m. This was in part supported by reduc � ons in 
planned capital expenditure in the later part of the year such 
that this remained equivalent to deprecia � on and amor � sa � on. 
We an � cipate that capital expenditure will be c.£14m, higher 
than deprecia � on in the coming year as we con � nue with our 
Chelmsford reorganisa � on. Acquisi � ons u � lised cash of £13.0m. 
This included the acquisi � on in January of SP Devices for net 
considera � on of £9.8m. In the year we also made earn out 
payments on AnaFocus of £2.5m and product line acquisi � ons in 
Semiconductors of £4.0m. In October 2015 we sold the Thermal 
Imaging business for £3.3m. In terms of  nancing we made 
share purchases of £3.7m as part of our normal hedging policy 
for share based incen � ve schemes, in addi � on to our normal 
payments for interest, tax and dividend.
Working capital
We have a range of working capital cycles across the divisions 
and businesses. For example we support long term availably 
of product for Semiconductors, o � en holding inventory for a 
number of years. In some of our Imaging sensor lines much of 
the manufacturing is provided by third par � es and we only hold 
 nished goods to sa � sfy customer orders. As part of our focus 
on customers we have increased inventory levels to improve 
our responsiveness to their requirements. We look to agree 
reasonable payment terms with our customers for our products. 
Where we provide bespoke products or working on long term 
programmes we seek to obtain advance payments to maintain a 
posi � ve pro  le. In terms of trade payables we pay our suppliers 
in accordance with our agreed terms. Overall we seek to manage 
working capital through the cycle and es � mate that on average 
across the Group three to four months working capital is needed 
to support growth and we will con � nue ac � vi � es to shorten 
working capital cycles over the current  nancial year.
Borrowing facili es
The Group’s commi � ed mul � -currency revolving facili � es 
are equivalent to £94.3m at 31 March 2016 exchange rates 
and are available for un � l 28 July 2018. Based on the Group’s 
performance and net borrowings as at 31 March 2016, the 
margin and u � lisa � on fee payable is 115bps and non-u � lisa � on 
fees at 40% of margin.
The facility is subject to leverage and interest cover covenants. 
Due to the performance of the Group during the year and that 
the Group has net borrowings of £21.1m as at 31 March 2016, 
there is signi  cant headroom on both covenants.
Central func ons
The costs of the central func � ons are allocated to the divisions. 
The central costs of £4.5m (2015: £4.0m) are the costs rela � ng 
speci  cally to the management of e2v technologies plc which are 
not allocated.
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Our KPIs to monitor  nancial performance have been covered 
in detail in the Business Review. The table below provides a 
summary of our KPIs. Non-  nancial KPIs will be discussed in 
detail in the Corporate Responsibility Review in the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements and include customer 
sa � sfac � on, number of reportable accidents in the year, and 
percentage reduc � on in our carbon footprint.

  Financial
We have a number of important rela � onships with 
universi � es, ensuring that we con � nue to lead innova � ons 
in new technology pla � orms for high performance products. 
In partnership with the University of Birmingham’s College 
of Engineering and Physical Sciences, we have played 
a leading role in building a successful academic and 
industrial consor � um which secured funding for the new 
£80 million Na � onal Quantum Technology hub in Sensing 
and Metrology. We are already playing a major role in 
two pioneering projects – to produce a gravity imaging 
camera prototype for the Defence and Science Technology 
Laboratory, and Freeze-Ray, a next genera � on laser-cooled 
cold atom trap funded by Innovate UK. 
Our innova � on is also supported by customer and grant 
funded programmes, which are focused on developing the 
new technology that our customers are seeking. We are 
also bene  � ng from Research and Development tax credits 
from the UK and French governments.
 Viability St a t emen t
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of 
the Group over a three year period, taking into account the 
Group’s current posi � on and the poten � al e ﬀ ect of the principal 
risks documented within the Annual Report. Based on this 
assessment, the Directors con  rm that they have a reasonable 
expecta � on that the Company will be able to con � nue in 
opera � on and meet its liabili � es as they fall due over the period 
to 31 March 2019.
The Directors have determined that a three year period to 
31 March 2019 is an appropriate period over which to provide 
its viability statement. This combines the normal period of the 
Group’s  nancing arrangements, with the average of the range 
of business cycles across the Group and is aligned with the 
Group’s planning cycle.
To allow the Directors the make this assessment, a business 
base case has been prepared . For the  rst year, this is based 
on the detailed budgets for the Group, and the following years 
are taken from the Group’s strategic plan, which  is based on an 
appropriate set of assump � ons for growth, margins, working 
capital, capital expenditure, dividends and other ma � ers that 
could have a signi  cant e ﬀ ect on the  nancial performance 
and liquidity of the Group. Assump � ons have also been made 
in respect of the Group’s ability to secure addi � onal  nancing, 
speci  cally to re  nance the revolving credit facility which expires 
on 28 July 2018, as detailed in note 21 to the  consolidated 
 nancial statements. The resul � ng base case provides the 
Directors with EBITDA, debt and  nance charge headroom 
rela � ve to current bank covenants.
The Directors have made a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including their poten� al impact, and 
the adequacy of the Group’s  nancial headroom rela � ve to 
a severe but plausible combina � on of these risks. While the 
review has considered the principal risks iden �  ed by the Group, 
the following were focussed on for enhanced stress tes � ng: 
execu � on risks on current and future programmes; technological 
risk, both obsolescence and the poten � al for development 
programmes to fail; supply chain disrup � on and the poten � al for 
product quality or warranty issues; and, the risks from foreign 
exchange movements and the broader economic environment. 
Whilst this review does not consider all of the possible risks 
that the Group could face, the Directors consider that the 
approach adopted and the work performed is reasonable in 
the circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved and 
that it allows the Board to con  rm that they have a reasonable 
expecta � on that the Group will be able to con � nue in opera � on 
and meet its liabili � es as they fall due over the period to 
31 March 2019. 001

Annual Report & Financial Statements 
2012
36
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company  nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regula � ons.
Directors’ responsibili es for the prepara on of 
the Annual Report
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company  nancial statements for each year. Under the 
provisions of this law, the Directors are required to prepare 
the consolidated  nancial statements in accordance with 
Interna � onal Financial Repor � ng Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the European Union (EU) and applicable law and have elected to 
prepare the parent company  nancial statements in accordance 
with UK Accoun � ng Standards  including FRS 101, ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the  nancial 
statements unless they are sa � s  ed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of the a ﬀ airs of the Group and the parent 
company and of their pro  t or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company  nancial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accoun � ng policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and es � mates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state that the Group  nancial statements have complied with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU, subject to any material departures 
being disclosed and explained;
• state for the parent company  nancial statements whether 
the applicable UK Accoun � ng Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures being disclosed and 
explained in the  nancial statements; and
• prepare the  nancial statements on a going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
parent company will con � nue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accoun � ng 
records that are su ﬃ  cient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transac � ons and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any � me the  nancial posi � on of the parent company and enable 
the Directors to ensure that the  nancial statements comply 
with Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregulari � es.
Under applicable law and regula � ons the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remunera � on Report and Corporate Governance 
statement that comply with that law and relevant regula � ons. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and  nancial informa � on included 
on the Company’s website. Legisla � on in the UK governing the 
prepara � on and dissemina � on of  nancial statements may di ﬀ er 
from legisla � on in other jurisdic � ons.
Directors’ responsibility statement in respect of 
the Annual Report
We con  rm that to the best of our knowledge that:
• the  nancial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accoun � ng standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabili � es,  nancial posi � on and pro  t or 
loss of the Company and the Group; and
• the management report, which comprises the Directors’ 
Report and the Strategic Report, includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the 
posi � on of the Company and the Group together with a 
descrip � on of the principal risks and uncertain � es that they 
face.
We consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced, and understandable 
and provide the informa � on necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s posi � on and performance, business model 
and strategy.
By order of the Board

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
Introduc on
The Board recognises the importance of, and is commi � ed 
to, high standards of corporate governance and as such the 
Board acknowledges its contribu � on to achieving management 
accountability, improving risk management and crea � ng 
shareholder value. The following report, together with the Audit 
Commi � ee Report and the Directors’ Remunera � on Report, 
explains how the Board and its Commi � ees have discharged 
their du � es and applied the main principles of good corporate 
governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published by the Financial Repor � ng Council in September 2014 
(the Code). A copy of the Code is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
The Board has been mindful to ensure that the Group complies 
not just with the principles of the Code but also with its spirit.
Statement of Compliance
The Board con  rms that the Group has complied with the 
relevant provisions set out in the Code throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2016 and from that date up un � l the date of 
publica � on of this Annual Report.
Leadership
The role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of 
the Group within a framework of prudent and e ﬀ ec � ve controls 
which enables risk to be assessed and managed. Collec � vely 
the Board is responsible for the long term success of the 
Company. The names, biographical details and signi  cant � me 
commitments of the members of the Board are set out on pages 
 3 2 an d  33 .
The Board sets the Group’s strategic aims, ensures the necessary 
 nancial and human resources are in place to enable the Group 
to meet its objec � ves, and reviews management’s performance. 
The Board is responsible for se �  ng the Group’s values and 
standards and ensuring that the Group’s obliga � ons to its 
shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees, 
customers, suppliers and the wider community, are understood 
and met.
The Chairman’s primary role includes ensuring that the 
Board func � ons properly, that it meets its obliga � ons and 
responsibili � es and that its organisa � on and mechanisms 
are in place and working e ﬀ ec � vely. The Chairman is also 
an ambassador for the Company to shareholders and wider 
stakeholders. There is no Deputy Chairman.
Non-Execu � ve Directors are responsible for exercising 
independent and objec � ve judgement in respect of Board 
decisions, developing strategy with Execu � ve Directors and 
scru � nising the performance of management in mee � ng 
agreed goals and objec � ves and monitoring the repor � ng of 
performance.
The appointment of Carla Cico as a Non-Execu � ve Director 
brings relevant experience in technological  elds adjacent to 
those in which the Group currently operates, together with a 
global business perspec � ve.
The Group CEO’s primary role is to provide overall leadership 
and vision in developing, with the Board, the strategic direc � on 
of the Group. The Execu � ve Directors are responsible for the 
management of the overall business, ensuring strategic and 
business plans are e ﬀ ec � vely implemented subject to agreed 
levels of authority and ensuring results are monitored and 
reported to the Board and  nancial and opera � onal objec � ves 
are a � ained.
There exists a clear division of responsibili � es between the 
Chairman and the Group CEO, which are set out in wri � ng and 
agreed by the Board.
The Senior Independent Director acts as a sounding board to 
the Chairman and serves as an intermediary for other Directors 
where necessary. The Senior Independent Director is also 
available to shareholders should they have any concerns and 
where contact through the normal channels is inappropriate, 
and is responsible for leading the review of the Chairman’s 
performance as part of the annual Board evalua � on.
Opera on of the Board
The Board’s responsibili � es are discharged by way of monthly 
Board reviews (except in August and December) and other 
Board mee � ngs as required to approve ma � ers beyond the 
authority limits of the Group CEO. The Board also convenes 
ad-hoc mee � ngs during the year and resolves ma � ers by wri � en 
resolu � ons to deal with speci  c business requirements. There 
were ten general monthly Board mee � ngs during the year. At the 
monthly Board mee � ngs, the Non-Execu � ve Directors review 
the reports presented to them by the Group CEO and Group 
Finance Director, which include a review of the  nancial results. 
This review compares the current year with the previous year 
and the annual opera � ng plan as well as a current year forecast 
and order book levels.
In addi � on there are mee � ngs of the Commi � ees of the Board 
as well as regular business division and func � on reviews where 
senior members of execu � ve management make presenta � ons 
to the Directors.
Measures are taken to ensure that no con  icts of interest 
arise at Board and Commi � ee mee � ngs, and that quorum 
requirements are sa � s  ed at all mee � ngs.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of ma � ers detailing 
key aspects of the Company’s a ﬀ airs reserved for it to approve, 
which is reviewed annually to ensure it remains appropriate. 
Items requiring Board approval are either agreed at the monthly 
Board mee � ngs, at intervening mee � ngs speci  cally arranged 
for that purpose, or by wri � en resolu � on. The reserved ma � ers 
include: the approval of customer quotes over the approved 
 nancial limit set by the Board; the acquisi � on and disposal of 
property; certain ac � vi � es rela � ng to mergers and acquisi � ons; 
dividend policy; capital structure; and the approval of the annual 
budget, Group strategy, interim management statements, Half 
Yearly Financial Statements and Annual Report and Financial 
Statements.
Throughout the Group there are clear lines of delegated 
authority covering the full range of  nancial commitments.

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
All of the current Non-Execu � ve Directors have been appointed 
within the last six years. The Non-Execu � ve Directors (including 
Neil Johnson upon his appointment as Chairman on 31 March 
2013) are all considered to be independent of management and 
free from any business or other rela � onship that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Board has considered the other appointments by the 
Directors, details of which are contained in their biographies on 
pages  32 and  33 and has con  rmed that each is able to devote 
su ﬃ  cient � me to ful  l the du � es required under the terms of 
their contracts or le � ers of appointment.
In line with the Code, the Company’s Ar � cles of Associa � on 
require that Directors submit themselves for re-elec � on on an 
annual basis.
The composi � on of the Board is intended to ensure that its 
membership represents a mix of backgrounds and experience 
that will enhance the quality of its delibera � ons and decisions. 
Diversity in board composi � on is an important driver of board 
e ﬀ ec � veness. In looking for prospec � ve Directors, there is 
regard to the skills of the Board at that � me and the need to 
address longer term succession and business priori � es. The 
annual formal evalua � on of the Board, Board Commi � ees 
and individual Directors’ performance takes Board diversity 
into account and is instrumental in iden � fying any new skill 
requirements, as well as possible shortcomings, gaps or 
ine ﬃ  ciencies.
The current female representa � on on the Board is 29%. The 
Board recognises the importance of gender diversity at the level 
below the Board and is commi � ed to ensuring the appropriate 
level of gender diversity, in par � cular at senior management 
level where female representa � on is 24%. Further informa � on 
on the total number of women employed by the Group is 
provided in the Corporate Responsibility Review.
The Company Secretary reports to the Chairman on governance 
ma � ers and is responsible for keeping the Board as a whole up 
to date on all legisla � ve, regulatory and governance ma � ers 
and is responsible for suppor � ng the Chairman and other 
Directors as necessary, including the management of Board and 
Commi � ee mee � ngs, their evalua � on and advising on Directors’ 
du � es. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary 
is a ma � er for the Board as a whole.
Con  icts of interest
In line with the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
established a robust procedure requiring Directors to seek 
appropriate authorisa � on prior to entering into any outside 
business interests. Actual or poten � al con  icts of interest are 
reviewed by the Board.
Induc on and training
New directors undertake an induc � on programme upon their 
appointment to the Board covering the ac � vi � es of the Group 
and its key business and  nancial risks, the terms of reference 
of the Board and its Commi � ees and the latest  nancial 
informa � on of the Group. Ongoing training is provided as 
necessary and the requirement for this is assessed through the 
annual performance review as well as on an ad hoc basis. This 
includes all training required to perform the role. Directors have 
access to and may consult with the Company Secretary at any 
� me on ma � ers related to their role on the Board. All Directors 
have access to independent professional advice at the Group’s 
expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their du � es, 
with requests for such advice being authorised by the Chairman 
or the Company Secretary.
Performance evalua on of the Board
The Chairman and Company Secretary undertook a performance 
evalua � on of the Board which required an assessment, by 
each individual  Director, of the performance of the Board and 
its Commi � ees by way of an anonymous ques � onnaire and 
ra � ngs process. The results of this assessment were reviewed 
by the Board and there were no areas of concern. The Senior 
Independent Director also led a performance review of the 
Chairman, which required an assessment, by each Director, of 
the performance of the Chairman. This assessment was reviewed 
by the Board and there were no areas of concern. The Chairman 
met with the Non-Execu � ve Directors without the Execu � ve 
Directors present on two occasions and the Senior Independent 
Director met with the Non-Execu � ve Directors, without the 
Chairman present, once.
Accountability
Financial and business repor ng
The Board is responsible for presen � ng a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s posi � on and 
prospects.
The statement that gives the reasons why the Directors con � nue 
to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the  nancial 
statements is given in the Directors’ Report.
Risk management and internal control procedures
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its e ﬀ ec � veness and 
has accordingly reviewed the e ﬀ ec � veness of this during the 
year. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objec � ves, and 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement.
An ongoing process, in accordance with the guidance of the 
Turnbull Commi � ee on internal control, has been established for 
iden � fying, evalua � ng and managing the signi  cant risks faced 
by the Group. This process has been in place throughout the 
year under review and up to the date of approval of the  nancial 
statements.
In addi � on the Board considers the signi  cance of 
environmental, social and governance ma � ers relevant to the 
business of the Group as part of the Board mee � ngs. The Group 
CEO holds Execu � ve Commi � ee responsibility for the Group’s 
Corporate Responsibility policy and its execu � on.
A formal whistle blowing policy is operated and is included in the 
Group’s employee handbook. This policy provides arrangements, 
by which sta ﬀ  may, in con  dence, raise concerns about 
possible improprie � es in ma � ers of  nancial repor � ng or other 
ma � ers. The Company also has in place a Group policy and set  001

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
 T h e C o mmi � ee is chaired by Kevin Danger  eld and has 
met three � mes during the year. The other members of the 
Commi � ee are Alison Wood and Krishnamurthy Rajagopal. Kevin 
Danger  eld is deemed to have recent and relevant  nancial 
experience. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Commi � ee whilst the Chairman, Group CEO and Group Finance 
Director a � end Audit Commi � ee mee � ngs by invita � on. The 
audit partner of the Company’s auditor a � ended two mee � ngs 
during the year. At mee � ngs at which the interim and full year 
results are reviewed, the Non-Execu � ve Directors exercise their 
right for discussions with the audit partner where no Execu � ve 
Directors are present. 
The terms of reference of the Audit Commi � ee, which are 
available on the Company’s website, include:
• keeping under review the e ﬀ ec � veness of the  nancial 
repor � ng and internal control policies and procedures for the 
iden �  ca � on, assessment and repor � ng of risks;
• considering the requirements for establishing an internal audit 
func � on;
• monitoring the integrity of  nancial repor � ng;
• reviewing the arrangements for what is commonly known as 
whistle blowing;
• reviewing the Commi � ee’s terms of reference;
• making recommenda � ons to the Board in rela � on to: (1) the 
appointment and re-appointment of the external auditor 
as well as running the selec � on process of any new audit 
appointment; and (2) approval of Auditor’s remunera � on;
• keeping under review the rela � onship with the external 
auditor including assessments of independence and 
objec � vity and the e ﬀ ec � veness of the audit process 
when taking into account the relevant UK professional and 
regulatory requirements;
• developing and implemen � ng policy on engagement of 
external auditor to supply non-audit services; and
• repor � ng to the Board on how it has discharged its 
responsibili � es.
Risk management and internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and 
the system of internal control and for reviewing its e ﬀ ec � veness; 
however certain of the responsibili � es have been delegated to 
the Audit Commi � ee, in par � cular the monitoring and review of 
internal control procedures for the iden �  ca � on, assessment 
and repor � ng of risks. The Audit Commi � ee has received reports 
from management during the year and has reviewed the systems 
of internal control and risk management and is sa � s  ed that the 
systems are e ﬀ ec � ve.
The Commi � ee receives reports on ma � ers reported under 
the Group’s whistle blowing policy and assesses both how such 
incidents are dealt with and whether there was an indica � on of 
material risk. 
Financial repor ng
The primary role of the Commi � ee in rela � on to  nancial 
repor � ng is to review with both management and the external 
auditor, and report to the Board where requested or required, 
the appropriateness of the half-year and annual  nancial 
statements concentra � ng on, amongst other ma � ers:
• quality, acceptability and consistency of the Group’s 
accoun� ng policies and prac � se;
• material areas in which signi  cant judgements have been 
applied or there has been discussion with the auditors;
• whether the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the informa � on necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy;
• the clarity of disclosures and compliance with  nancial 
repor � ng standards and relevant  nancial and governance 
repor � ng requirements; and
• any correspondence from regulators in rela � on to the Group’s 
 nancial repor � ng.
To facilitate the Commi � ee’s  nancial repor � ng responsibility 
it receives reports from the external auditor. At the mee � ng 
 in which the Commi � ee reviews the year end results the 
Commi � ee consider a report which contains the  ndings of the 
auditor’s audit work, including comments on the dra �  Annual 
Report and Financial Statements.  At the mee � ng  in which the 
Commi � ee considers the half year results, a report is received 
from the auditor with regard to its review of the half year 
results. At this mee � ng the auditor also presents its planning 
memorandum for the annual audit, which includes details of key 
risks, audit scope and materiality. The auditor will also provide 
a summary of current and upcoming developments in company 
law, accoun � ng standards and other regula � ons.
The Commi � ee reviews the integrity of the Group’s annual and 
half yearly  nancial statements of the Group. This includes a 
review and discussion of papers prepared by management with 
regard to key es � mates, judgements and presenta � onal ma � ers. 
The primary areas of judgement considered by the Commi � ee 
in rela � on to  nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 
2016 and how these have been addressed are detailed below :
Carrying value of intangible assets:
The Commi � ee considered the carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangible assets and the assump � ons related to 
the impairment review. The judgements in rela � on to the 
impairment review relate to the achievability of long term 
forecasts and the discount rates applied to the forecast cash 
 ows. A sensi � vity analysis on these assump � ons was also 
considered by the Commi � ee ;
Accoun ng for acquisi ons:
the Commi � ee has considered the acquisi � on accoun� ng in 
rela � on to AnaFocus and SP Devices. Management have been 
challenged with respect to the assump � ons and methodologies 
applied to support the fair value of intangible assets, net assets 
acquired and con � ngent considera � on payable ;

Annual Report & Financial Statements 
2012
42
Long term contractual arrangements:
The Commi � ee reviewed key es � mates and judgements, 
including es � mates to complete, applied in the determina � on 
in the  nancial status of the more signi  cant projects, and in 
par � cular any loss making contracts ; and
Inventory provisions:
The Commi � ee reviewed the key judgements and assump� ons 
used in determining the level of provisioning, in par � cular with 
reference to the Group’s inventory holdings for its obsolescence 
management business and the last � me build programmes 
undertaken in Grenoble on the closure of the front end 
fabrica � on plant in 2011. In these cases inventory is sold over a 
number of years and therefore the carrying value is dependent 
upon longer term future sales forecasts.
These areas have also been iden �  ed as areas of higher audit 
risk and accordingly the Group’s auditor reported on these 
ma � ers and discussed these judgements with the Commi � ee.
With the requirement of the Code to include a viability 
statement in the 2016 Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
the Commi � ee has provided assistance to the Board in rela � on 
to this ma � er. At its mee � ng in January 2016, the Commi � ee 
considered a paper prepared by management which included 
a discussion of the period over which the Board should make 
its viability statement and the key risks and associated stress 
tes � ng. Whilst at its mee � ng in May 2016 the Commi � ee 
reviewed the dra �  viability statement and the suppor � ng 
discussion paper prepared by management detailing the 
sensi � vi � es as to liquidity and bank covenants, risks and 
associated stress tes � ng. 
External audit
Appointment, independence and e ﬀ ec � veness 
The Commi � ee considers the appointment of the external 
auditor each year and as part of the process considers the 
independence of the auditor and the e ﬀ ec � veness of the 
external audit process.
Following a tender process in 2013, KPMG LLP (KPMG) was 
appointed as auditor for the  nancial year ended 31 March 2014 
and was re-appointed as auditor at the 2015 Annual General 
Mee � ng (AGM). Having reviewed the performance of KPMG, 
the Commi � ee has decided to recommend to the Board that 
KPMG be re-appointed as auditor for the next  nancial year 
and a resolu � on to this e ﬀ ect will be put to the AGM on 13 July 
2016. The Commi � ee reviewed and agreed the audit fee for the 
 nancial year.
The external auditor is required to change the lead partner every 
 ve years and other partners periodically in order to protect 
the independence and objec � vity and provide fresh challenge 
to the Group. Mike Barradell has completed three years in the 
role of lead partner. KPMG con  rmed their independence to 
the Commi � ee in October 2015 and May 2016. The Commi � ee 
considered KPMG’s presenta � ons and con  rmed that it 
considered the auditors to be independent.
Following the conclusion of the annual audit, the Commi � ee 
reviews the e ﬀ ec � veness of the audit and the performance of 
the auditor through an evalua � on process, which takes into 
account the views of the Commi � ee members, the Board and 
senior managers involved in the audit process. The results of the 
review are considered by the Commi � ee and discussed with the 
auditor and management.
Non-audit services
To further safeguard the independence and objec � vity of 
the external auditor, non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor were authorised by the Chairman of the Audit 
Commi � ee. The Audit Commi � ee monitors fees paid to the 
auditor for non-audit work. The following fees have been paid 
to KPMG for non-audit work during the year ended 31 March 
2016: £27,000 for assurance services, including review of 
half-yearly  nancial statements and £9,000 for tax compliance 
services. The Company has engaged other independent  rms 
of accountants to perform tax consul � ng and other consul � ng, 
including  nancial due diligence, work. The Commi � ee monitors 
the level of non-audit services provided by the external auditor 
with a view to ensuring objec � vity, independence and cost 
e ﬀ ec � veness. 
Internal audit
At the current � me the Board are of the opinion that a formal 
internal audit func � on is not considered necessary due to 
the structure and size of the Group, widespread execu � ve 
involvement in the day to day business and the level of review 
undertaken by the execu � ve management and reported to the 
Board. The Group con � nues with a programme of internal audit 
reviews performed by mul � -disciplinary peer review teams from 
across division, group func � ons and jurisdic � ons.

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
Directors’ Remunera � on Report
 Le er from Krishnamurthy Rajagopal, Chairman of the Remunera on Commi ee
Dear Shareholder
I am very pleased to be able to take this opportunity, in my capacity as Chairman of the Remunera � on Commi � ee, to update you on 
the work of the Commi � ee during the year ended 31 March 2016.
Introduc on
This is the third year that e2v is publishing the details of its Directors’ remunera � on under the policy approved by shareholders at the 
2014 Annual General Mee � ng (AGM). No changes are proposed to the policy at the current � me and as such, it will not be subject to 
a shareholder vote at this year’s AGM. The policy sec � on of the report (pages  45 to  54) has been reproduced for reference only, in 
line with best prac � ce. However, as the regula � ons require the policy to be voted on by shareholders every three years, a new policy 
will be put to shareholders for approval at next year’s AGM.
The Directors’ Annual Report on Remunera � on (pages  54 to  66) sets out how the policy was implemented for the year ended 
31  March 2016 and this will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
Performance remunera on during the year
The results for the year ended 31 March 2016 re  ect a good performance for the year. The Group reports revenue of £236m, an 
increase of 5% on last year. Adjusted opera � ng pro  t of £42m, an increase of 5%, re  ects this good opera � ng performance. Cash 
genera � on during the year delivered opera � ng cash in  ow of £33m, with the Group repor � ng as at 31 March 2016 net borrowings of 
£21m, a � er the purchase of SP Devices.
Bonuses for the year ended 31 March 2016 were based solely on adjusted opera � ng pro  t performance, with up to 100% of salary 
in cash for achieving stretch performance and a further 40% of salary (payable in deferred shares) achievable for above stretch 
performance. Notwithstanding adjusted opera � ng pro  t for the year of £42m, 5% growth on prior year, this was below the target 
level of performance required resul � ng in no bonuses being payable to the Execu � ve Directors for the year ended 31 March 2016.
The 2012 Long Term Incen � ve Plan (LTIP) award vested during the year. The award was based 50% on absolute Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) and 50% on rela � ve TSR performance. The strong performance of the Company over this period has delivered an 89% 
return to shareholders, resul � ng in 81% of the award ves � ng. The Group CEO joined the Group in 2014 and therefore was not a 
par � cipant in the 2012 LTIP award cycle.
As noted in last year’s Annual Report on Remunera � on, the Commi � ee undertook a review of the base salary level for the Group 
CEO during 2015. Following a consulta � on with major shareholders last summer, the Remunera � on Commi � ee approved a one-o ﬀ  
salary increase for the Group CEO, Steve Blair, from £334,750 to £390,000 (e ﬀ ec � ve from 1 October 2015). While the Commi � ee 
originally considered phasing the increase over � me, during the consulta � on exercise a number of our major investors indicated that 
they would be comfortable with a one-o ﬀ  adjustment. The increase has been designed to bring his salary in line with the appropriate 
rate for the role and re  ects Steve’s excep � onal performance since he joined the Group, in re-energising the business and the strong 
improvement this has had on our  nancial and opera � onal performance.
Charles Hindson received a 5% salary increase in October 2015, following a review of individual and Group performance. The 
average increase awarded across the workforce was 2.5% (with actual increases ranging from 0% to 5% depending on individual 
performance). 
Implementa on of the remunera on policy for the year ending 31 March 2017
In November 2014, Steve Blair launched the revised vision for the Group ‘Bringing Life to Technology’ in which he set out the 
strategic goal to double in scale by 2020. Over the last year, the market environment has proved to be increasingly challenging, but 
we are s � ll focused on growth. This will be achieved both organically and increasingly through acquisi � ons, such as the recent one of 
SP Devices which provides high performance sub-system solu � ons for analogue to digital conversion applica � ons. 
Our focus remains on the end markets of: Industrial vision, Space, Radiotherapy and Semiconductors, whilst con � nuing to support 
customers across other ac � vi � es, including Science Imaging. 
The approach to remunera � on is to incen � vise successful implementa � on of the growth strategy with a higher propor � on of variable 
pay including the annual bonus and long term awards based on stretching performance targets. 001

The Commi ee is not proposing to make any changes to the Remunera on Policy for the year ending 31 March 2017. In terms of how 
the policy will be applied in the year ahead, the key points to note are:
• basic salaries will be reviewed in line with the rest of the Group on 1 October 2016. Increases are expected to be within the normal 
workforce range;
• pension provision will remain at 15% of salary;
• the annual bonus will con nue to be capped at 140% of salary based on a sliding scale of adjusted opera ng pro  t targets. 
Execu ve Directors will earn 50% of salary for achieving target performance and 100% of salary for achieving stretch target. Any 
bonus above 100% of salary (i.e. performance above stretch target) will con nue to be deferred into shares for three years;
• the LTIP awards for 2016 will con nue to be granted as a normal award (100% of salary) and an addi onal award (25% of salary) 
with performance based on earnings per share (EPS) and TSR (each accoun ng for half of the award). The TSR targets for the 
normal and addi onal awards will be the same as those applying to the 2015 awards. The EPS targets for the 2016 awards will 
require adjusted EPS growth of 5% to 13% per annum for the normal awards and 13% to 15% per annum for the addi onal awards. 
This represents a reduc on on the threshold target for the normal awards from 6% to 5% per annum as a result of the challenging 
market and economic condi ons faced by the Company. The stretch target for the normal awards and the target range for the 
addi onal awards are the same those used in prior years. The target ranges for the 2016 awards have been set taking into account 
latest internal and external forecast for the business and the Remunera on Commi ee is sa s  ed that the proposed target range 
is suitably challenging. 
• shareholding guideline, set at two  mes salary, will con nue to operate.
In summary, this has been a challenging year for the Group but our approach to execu ve remunera on con nues to incen vise 
execu ves to build sustainable value for our shareholders over the long term.
Yours sincerely
Krishnamurthy Rajagopal
Chairman of the Remunera on Commi ee

Directors’ Remunera on Policy Report
The following table sets out the approved policy for Execu � ve Directors in respect of each element of the remunera � on package. 
Further details regarding the opera � on of the policy can be found on pages  54 to  66 of this report. This policy was approved by 
shareholders at the AGM on 16 July 2014. No changes are proposed to the policy and it will therefore not be subject to a shareholder 
vote at the 2016 AGM. A new policy that will be subject to a vote by shareholders will be presented for approval at the 2017 AGM. 
The policy has been reproduced for reference only. 
Opera on Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
Core element of remunera � on, paid for doing the expected day-to-day job. To ensure a market compe � � ve level of base reward, 
suf cient to a � ract and retain the best talent.
Paid in cash.
The Commi � ee takes into considera � on a number 
of factors when se �  ng salaries, including (but not 
limited to):
• the broader company policy applied to all 
employees;
• scope of role and individual performance;
• market compe � � veness against companies of 
similar size and similar business opera � ons;
• overall company performance and a ﬀ ordability; 
and
• general external economic factors (e.g. in  a � on).
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any 
change typically being e ﬀ ec � ve from 1 October, in 
line with prac � ce in the rest of the Group.
Execu � ve Director pay increases will generally 
be in line with increases being implemented 
across the Group for the employee popula � on. 
The Commi � ee may exceed these levels for 
Execu � ve Directors in certain circumstances, 
including increased responsibili � es, 
development of an individual within the role, 
where necessary for reten � on or if the salary 
is uncompe � � ve, provided it does not exceed 
what it reasonably considers to be the market 
rate for the role.
None, although overall performance 
is taken into account during the 
salary review process.
Bene ts
To ensure a market compe � � ve level of bene ts, suf cient to a � ract and retain the best talent.
Execu � ve Directors are eligible to receive bene  ts, 
which typically may include (but not be limited to) 
company car provision (or cash equivalent), private 
medical insurance and life assurance.
Where Execu � ve Directors are required to relocate, 
the Commi � ee may o ﬀ er reloca � on and, if 
appropriate, addi � onal expatriate bene  ts.
Execu � ve Directors are also eligible to par � cipate 
in any all employee share plans operated by the 
Company on the same basis as other eligible 
employees. e2v currently operates a HMRC Save 
As You Earn (SAYE) scheme (see below for further

Opera on Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Annual Bonus
To incen vise the delivery of annual targets. Element of deferral into shares to ensure sustainable value is created and alignment with 
shareholders. Malus provisions to mi gate risk.
Awards based on performance during the relevant 
 nancial year.
Performance measures are set annually and pay-outs 
are determined by the Commi ee a er the year end, 
based on performance against those targets. 
A por on of the bonus may be deferred into share 
awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan. The por on 
is determined by the Commi ee for each  nancial 
year and may vary on an annual basis, up to a 
maximum deferral level of 50%.
Bonus awards in deferred shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan normally vest three years a er grant.
Bonus awards in deferred shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan are normally made in the form of 
condi onal share awards but may be awarded in 
other forms if appropriate (such as nil-cost op ons). 
Nil-cost op ons may normally be exercised un l the 
tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Awards may 
also be sa s  ed in cash.
At the Commi ee’s discre on, dividend equivalent 
payments may be made (in cash or shares) on 
deferred shares, equal to the amount of dividends 
that would have been payable during the period 
between the grant and ves ng of an award. Unvested 
deferred share awards are subject to claw-back 
provisions. 
The Commi ee may cancel or reduce a deferred 
bonus award if the results used to calculate the 
relevant bonus contained a material mis-statement.
Maximum opportunity of up to 140% of base 
salary in respect of any nancial year.
Annual bonus targets are set by the 
Commi ee each year, taking into 
account the Group strategy and 
corporate plan.
When se  ng the targets, the 
Commi ee ensures that they are 
appropriately stretching in the 
context of the corporate plan and 
that there is an appropriate balance 
between incen vising Execu ve 
Directors to meet targets for the 
year, whilst ensuring that they do not 
drive unacceptable levels of risk and 
encourage inappropriate behaviours.
100% of targets will be based on 
 nancial performance measures. 
For achievement of a threshold level 
of performance (the minimum level 
of performance that results in any 
payment), typically no more than 
50% of the maximum will be paid.

Opera on Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Long Term Incen ve Plan (LTIP)
Incen � vise execu � ve performance over the longer term. Rewards the delivery of targets linked to the long term strategy of the 
business, and the crea � on of shareholder value over the longer term. Malus provisions to mi � gate risk.
Awards are normally made annually. 
Ves � ng of awards is dependent on achievement of 
performance targets, measured over a period of 
ordinarily not less than three years. 
The Commi � ee has the discre � on to amend the 
performance condi � ons applicable to an award if 
an event occurs which causes the Commi � ee to 
determine an amended performance condi � on 
would be more appropriate and not materially less 
di ﬃ  cult to sa � sfy.
Share awards are normally made in the form of 
nil-cost op � ons but may be awarded in other forms 
if appropriate (such as condi � onal share awards). 
Nil-cost op � ons may normally be exercised un � l the 
tenth anniversary of the date of grant. Awards may 
also be sa � s  ed in cash.
The Commi � ee may adjust or amend the terms of 
the plan in accordance with the plan rules.
At the Commi � ee’s discre � on, dividend equivalent 
payments may be made (in cash or shares) equal 
to the amount of dividends that would have been 
payable during the period between the grant and 
ves � ng of an award.
The Commi � ee may impose addi � onal condi � ons 
or cancel or reduce unvested awards in certain 
circumstances which it considers appropriate, 
including: 
• material misstatement of the Group’s audited 
 nancial results;
• material failure of risk management by the 
Company, any Group member or relevant 
business unit;
• material breach of any applicable health and 
safety legisla � on or regula � ons by the Company, 
Group member or relevant business unit; or
• serious reputa � onal damage to the Company, 
any Group member or relevant business unit.
In the event of a change of control, awards may 
vest taking into account the extent to which any 
performance condi � on has been sa � s  ed and, if the 
Board so determines, the period of � me from the 
grant date to the date of the relevant event.
The maximum award level shall not normally 
exceed 175% of salary in respect of any  nancial 
year of the Company (with the Commi � ee 
having discre � on to award up to 200% of salary 
in excep � onal circumstances).
Awards vest based on variety of 
 nancial and/or shareholder value 
crea � on performance measures.
The Group’s strategy is to generate 
long term sustainable returns to 
shareholders. The Commi � ee aims 
to align the performance measures 
under the LTIP with the long term 
strategy of the Group and considers 
that strong performance under the 
chosen measures should result in 
sustainable value crea � on:
• Financial measure –  nancial 
measures re  ect the underlying 
performance of the Group 
and are a direct and focused 
measure of Group success. 
Targets are set to be stretching, 
with regard to the strategic 
plan and relevant external 
expecta � ons.
• Shareholder value crea � on 
measure –providing a direct 
link to the ul � mate delivery of 
shareholder returns, promo � ng 
alignment between Execu � ve 
Director reward and the 
shareholder experience. Targets 
are posi � oned at a level which 
the Commi � ee considers to be 
appropriately stretching, with 
due regard to the wider market.
For achievement of a threshold level 
of performance (the minimum level 
of performance that results in any 
payment), no more than 25% of the 
maximum award will be paid.
All Employee Share Plans
Allows all employees (including Execu � ve Directors) the opportunity to invest personally in the Group and share in its growth.
SAYE 
The Group operates an HMRC approved Save As 
You Earn plan, under which monthly payments are 
made into a savings plan over a period of three or 
 ve years, to purchase op � ons granted at a discount 
of up to 20%.

Directors’ Remunera � on Report (con � nued)
Notes to policy table 
Legacy ma ers
The Commi � ee can make remunera � on payments and payments for loss of o ﬃ  ce outside of the Policy set out above, where the 
terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into e ﬀ ect, or at a � me when the relevant individual was not a Director of 
the Company (provided that, in the opinion of the Commi � ee, the payment was not in considera � on for the individual becoming a 
Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discre � on available to the Commi � ee in connec � on with such payments.
For these purposes, payments include the Commi � ee sa � sfying awards of variable remunera � on and, in rela � on to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the � me the award is granted.
Group CEO Share Incen ve Plan
The Group CEO Share Incen � ve Plan was a one-o ﬀ  plan to provide, on appointment, the Group CEO with the opportunity to 
demonstrate long term commitment to the Group through a signi  cant personal investment in the Company and to incen � vise 
him to grow shareholder value in the long term. No future awards will be made under the Group CEO Share Incen � ve Plan. A short 
summary of the plan is provided below, with more detailed informa � on provided in the no � ce of the General Mee � ng in November 
2013.
• Ini � al shares were o ﬀ ered on a nil-price op � on basis to match the personal investment made by the Group CEO.
• Based on achievement of share price growth targets over the three-year performance period and subject to a secondary Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) measure requiring upper decile performance to achieve full ves � ng, both the invested shares and the 
matching shares are eligible to be mul � plied by a maximum of three � mes.
• Ves � ng is dependent on the Group CEO retaining the ini � al personally acquired shareholding.
Awards not subject to performance measures
Shares deferred under the annual bonus are not subject to further performance measures, as they represent the deferred element of 
remunera � on which has already been earned. 
Change of control
Awards under the deferred bonus, LTIP and Chairman and Group CEO Share Incen � ve Plans may be adjusted in the event of a 
varia � on of the Company’s share capital, demerger, delis � ng, special dividend, dividend in specie or other corporate event which may 
a ﬀ ect the current or future value of share awards. 
Explana on of choice of performance measures and how targets are set 
The Commi � ee believes the choice of performance measures for the annual bonus and LTIP represent an appropriate balance 
between the short term and long term focus of the Group’s strategy aims and key performance indicators, as well as an appropriate 
balance between internal and external assessments of performance. When targets are set, the Commi � ee takes into account a 
number of di ﬀ erent factors, including market prac � ce, market expecta � ons and internal business plans and forecasts. 
Remunera on arrangements throughout the Group
Remunera � on arrangements for the wider employee popula � on are based on the principle that reward should help deliver the 
business strategy and should be su ﬃ  cient to a � ract and retain the best talent. To the extent prac � cable, reward prac � ces for 
Execu � ve Directors are cascaded down through the organisa � on, such that where possible employees are incen � vised towards 
common goals.
Throughout the Group, the aim is to provide remunera � on packages that are compe � � ve in the relevant market for that role. 001

Fees
Core element of remunera � on, paid for ful  lling the relevant role. A � racts the appropriate individual to oversee the Group’s business 
strategy.
NEDs receive a basic annual fee, paid monthly, in 
respect of their Board du � es.
Further fees are paid to NEDs in respect of 
chairmanship of Board commi � ees and the role of 
Senior Independent Director. No fees are paid for 
membership of a Board commi � ee.
The Non-execu � ve Chairman receives an all-inclusive 
fee for ful  lling the role of Company Chairman.
Where contractual arrangements allow, further 
daily rate fees may be payable for the provision of 
addi � onal services.
The remunera � on of the Non-execu � ve Chairman is 
set by the Commi � ee. The Execu � ve Directors are 
responsible for determining NED fees.
These fees are the sole element of NED 
remunera � on. NEDs are not eligible for annual 
bonus, share incen � ves, pensions or other bene  ts 
other than the Chairman Share Incen � ve Plan, as set 
out below.
Fees are reviewed periodically.
Current fee levels can be found in the Report on 
Remunera � on on page  56.
Fees are set at a level which is considered 
appropriate to a � ract and retain the calibre of 
individual required by the Company.
Fees normally re  ect the level of contribu � on 
and � me commitment expected, and are 
posi � oned with reference to comparable roles in 
companies of similar size, sector and complexity.
None.
Chairman Share Incen ve Plan
The Chairman Share Incen � ve Plan was approved by shareholders at the Company’s July 2013 AGM. No further awards will be made 
under this plan. The key features of the plan are described below (a more detailed summary is provided in the July 2013 AGM No � ce 
available on the Group’s website).
The plan provides the Chairman with the opportunity to demonstrate long term commitment to the Company through a signi  cant 
personal investment in the Company and to incen � vise him to grow shareholder value in the long term.
• A con � ngent award of shares was made, dependent upon a personal investment made by the Chairman and the achievement 
of performance targets over a three-year performance period. A total poten � al award of 720,000 nil-cost op � ons was made, 
comprising up to six � mes the number of shares purchased by the Chairman.
• Ves � ng is condi � onal on the Chairman retaining the ini � al personally acquired shareholding.
• Ves � ng is also subject to certain performance condi � ons and targets. Share price growth targets are set subject to a secondary 
TSR performance measure requiring upper decile performance to achieve maximum ves � ng.
Recruitment policy 
Principles
The Group’s recruitment policy is based on a number of key principles:
• To provide a remunera � on package which is su ﬃ  cient to a � ract, retain and mo � vate key talent, whilst at all � mes having regard to 
the best interests of the Group and shareholders and ensuring that the Group pays no more than is necessary.
• In determining an appropriate remunera � on package, the Commi � ee takes into account a number of factors. These will usually 
include the candidate’s experience and calibre, their loca � on and circumstances, external market in  uences and exis � ng 
arrangements for other Execu � ve Directors.
• Following appointment, the remunera � on arrangements for the individual will typically be in line with the policy set out in the 
Policy Table, or be transi � oned onto these arrangements.
• Where the Company appoints a new Execu � ve Director, the Commi � ee will provide full details of the remunera � on in the next 
Director’s Annual Report on Remunera � on and will seek to provide shareholders with ra � onale for the decisions which were taken.
• The Commi � ee may also consider providing addi � onal bene  ts to expatriate appointments, where appropriate. 001

Directors’ Remunera � on Report (con � nued)
Components and approach
The following table sets out key elements which may be considered by the Commi � ee in determining the remunera � on package. In 
circumstances in which the Commi � ee considers it appropriate, other elements in addi � on to those below may also be considered.
Element of package Approach
Basic salary The level of base salary for any new recruit is set at a level commensurate with calibre and experience.
If it is considered appropriate to set the ini � al salary at a below-market level, then, subject to 
performance, as the individual gains experience a series of greater than usual increases may be required 
to reach an appropriate market compe � � ve level over subsequent years.
Bene  ts New appointments would typically receive bene  ts in line with the Policy table above.
The Commi � ee may consider providing reloca � on expenses and in the case of expatriate appointments, 
other addi � onal bene  ts such as interna � onal school fees and tax advice, where necessary.
Pension New appointments would typically receive pension provision in line with the Policy table.
Annual bonus Maximum annual bonus in line with the Policy table.
Share awards Maximum LTIP award in line with the Policy table.
LTIP awards may be made to any new recruit in line with the policy above and subject to the rules of the 
plan.
Typically, awards will be made in the normal annual cycle following the announcement of the annual 
results. However, at the Commi � ee’s discre � on, awards may be granted at other � mes in the year 
(including on appointment) and the performance period may therefore be adjusted as appropriate.
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded in respect of a recruitment event (internal or external), will not exceed 
340% of base salary excluding buy-out awards. This represents the current maximum award under the annual bonus and LTIP.
Buy-out awards
To facilitate recruitment, the Commi � ee may make a one-o ﬀ  award to ‘buy-out’ variable incen � ves which the individual would forfeit 
at their current employer. Typically such awards will be made in the form of shares with appropriate performance measures although 
in certain circumstances some, or all, of the award may be made in cash. This may include the use of the relevant provision in the FCA 
lis � ng rules, allowing for excep � onal one-o ﬀ  awards to be made without prior shareholder approval.
In making such awards, the Commi � ee will give considera � on to relevant factors. These will generally include the propor � on of 
the performance/ves � ng period outstanding and the poten � al value of the forfeited remunera � on, including any performance 
condi � ons a � ached to the forfeited awards and the likelihood of those condi � ons being met.
In cases of an internal hire, any exis � ng variable pay arrangements in rela � on to the previous role will be allowed to pay-out 
according to their terms and may be adjusted to take into account the Board appointment.
In the event of the appointment of a new Non-Execu � ve Director, remunera � on arrangements will be in line with those detailed in 
the Non-Execu � ve Director Policy table on page  49. 001

Directors’ Remunera � on Report (con � nued)
Loss of o ﬃ  ce payment policy 
The Commi � ee takes into account a number of factors when considering leaving arrangements for an Execu � ve Director.
• Where an individual resigns, they will receive no addi � onal payment for loss of o ﬃ  ce.
• Where the individual is dismissed for performance, capability or any other substan � al reason, they will receive no more than their 
statutory / contractual en � tlements, including salary for the relevant no � ce period, car allowance and pension contribu � on.
• Where the individual is dismissed for gross misconduct, they will receive no compensa � on.
• Individuals will not normally be eligible to receive an annual bonus if on the date the bonus is declared they are no longer 
employed by the Company, under no � ce or on garden leave. Where the Commi � ee considers the individual to be a ‘good leaver’, 
in some excep � onal circumstances it may consider the individual eligible for a � me pro-rated annual bonus, determined against 
the relevant performance condi � ons.
• Other payments such as legal and outplacement fees may be paid if it is considered appropriate.
Treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules. These are set out in the table below.

for dismissal for misconduct), as determined by the Commi � ee. In such circumstances awards will vest on 
the date of termina � on. 
LTIP All awards will lapse unless, at the discre � on of the Commi� ee, the leaver is deemed to be a ‘good leaver’ 
speci  ed as leaving due ill-health; injury or disability; redundancy; death; the individual’s employing 
business or company ceasing to be part of the Group or; any other reason (except for dismissal for 
misconduct) as determined by the Commi � ee.
Awards will normally vest on the original ves � ng date, unless the Commi � ee determines that awards 
should vest as soon as prac � cable following leaving.
In these circumstances, the Commi � ee will determine the extent to which awards should vest taking into 
account achievement of the relevant performance condi � ons and, unless the Commi � ee determines 
otherwise, the period of � me that has elapsed between grant and the anniversary of the grant date 
following the individual’s departure. Where a par � cipant has died, awards will only be � me pro-rated in 
accordance with the rules where the Commi � ee considers it appropriate.
Awards lapse for other leavers.

Considera on of condi ons elsewhere in the Group
When considering remunera � on arrangements for Execu � ve Directors, the Commi � ee considers, as a ma � er of course, the pay and 
employment condi � ons in place for employees elsewhere within the Group:
• Basic salary – In determining basic salary increases for Execu � ve Directors, the Commi � ee pays speci  c a � en � on to the level of 
increases within the wider employee popula � on. It also assesses Group performance and a ﬀ ordability within the context of the 
whole employee base.
• Annual bonus – The performance measures and targets that are set for the Execu � ve Directors form the basis for the variable pay 
arrangements in place at the execu � ve commi � ee and senior management levels. The percentage of salary that can be earned 
reduces through the organisa � on to re  ect the relevant level of responsibility.
• LTIP, bene  ts and pensions – Similarly, the same basic principles that govern these addi � onal elements of Execu � ve Director’s 
remunera � on are also used elsewhere in the Group. Award levels are tailored to re  ect seniority level.
Whilst the Commi � ee does not formally consult with employees when se �  ng Execu � ve Director pay, those employees who hold 
shares are able to comment on the Directors’ Remunera � on Report in the same manner as other shareholders.
Considera on of shareholder views
The Remunera � on Commi � ee is commi � ed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks the views of signi  cant shareholders 
whenever material changes are under considera � on.
Illustra on of the applica on of remunera on policy
The remunera � on arrangements have been designed to ensure that a signi  cant propor � on of pay is dependent on the delivery of 
stretching short term and long term performance targets. In reviewing the remunera � on package, the Commi � ee takes into account 
the level of remunera � on which Execu � ve Directors may receive at various levels of performance, to ensure that it is appropriate and 
shareholders are receiving value for money.
The charts below provide illustra � ve values for the remunera � on packages of the Execu � ve Directors under three di ﬀ erent 
performance scenarios. Note that these charts are for illustra � ve purposes only and based on a number of assump � ons. Actual 
outcomes may di ﬀ er from those shown. 
Note: the charts have been updated to re  ect how the approved policy will be applied in the year ending 31 March 2017
Fixed pay Assump ons
All performance scenarios Consists of total  xed pay, including salary, bene  ts and pension provision
• Basic salary – salary e ﬀ ec � ve as at 1 April 2016
• Bene  ts – the amount received in year ended 31 March 2016
• Pension – 15% of base salary 
Variable pay Assump ons

performance)
• Annual bonus – no pay-out
• LTIP – nil ves � ng
On-target (Performance in line with 
expecta � ons)

Maximum performance • Annual bonus – 140% of salary (100% of maximum pay-out)
• LTIP – 125% of salary (100% of maximum ves � ng)
(1)
(1)  For the purposes of these charts, we have assumed a maximum LTIP opportunity of 125% of salary. Our remunera� on policy allows for maximum awards of up to 
175% of salary, or 200% of salary in excep � onal circumstances.
The charts exclude any value related to par � cipa � on in the SAYE all-employee plan.
No share price growth or dividend equivalent payment assump � ons have been incorporated. 001

Minor amendments
To aid in the administra on of the Policy set out above, the Commi ee may make minor amendments without obtaining shareholder 
approval. For example, such amendments may include those for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administra ve purposes or to 
take account of a change in legisla on.
Remunera on Commi ee
The Remunera on Commi ee is responsible for recommending to the Board the framework and broad policy for the remunera on 
of the Chairman, Group CEO, Group Finance Director and such other members of the execu ve management as it is requested to 
consider. The remunera on of the Non-Execu ve Directors is a ma er reserved for the Execu ve Directors, subject to shareholder 
consulta on as appropriate.
Members of the Commi ee are appointed by the Board. Krishnamurthy Rajagopal is Chairman of the Commi ee. Its other members, 
who have served on the Commi ee throughout the year ended 31 March 2016, are Kevin Danger  eld and Alison Wood. On 1 April 
2016 Carla Cico was appointed to the Commi ee. The Board considers that all members of the Commi ee comprise independent 
directors. The Commi ee meets at least once a year. The Group CEO is given no ce of all mee ngs, may a end by invita on, and is 
consulted on the remunera on of other execu ves. However, the Group CEO does not take part in discussions that relate directly to 
his own remunera on.
The Commi ee members have no personal  nancial interest (other than as a shareholder), con  ict of interest arising from cross-
directorships with the Execu ve Directors, or involvement in the day to day business of the Group. 001

When determining the pay of Execu ve Directors, the Commi ee takes into account the pay and employment condi ons of 
employees throughout the Group. In this regard, the Commi ee ensures (via regular interac on with the Group’s human resources 
(HR) teams) that it is kept fully informed of all relevant group wide remunera on related issues and ensures that the same broad 
remunera on principles are used when designing the wider employee remunera on policies. The Chairman of the Remunera on 
Commi ee regularly consults with the Group HR Director, who may a end mee ngs by invita on. The Group Finance Director may 
also a end mee ngs by invita on. The General Counsel and Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Commi ee.
The Commi ee’s terms of reference are available on the Group’s website and include;
• agreeing with the Board the remunera on of the Chairman;
• agreeing with the Board the remunera on of the Execu ve Directors;
• agreeing with the Board the policy for the remunera on of the Company Secretary and other members of the execu ve 
management commi ee as well as reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the policy;
• determining targets for any performance related pay schemes and approving total annual payments under the schemes;
• reviewing all share incen ve plans, the related performance targets and all awards made under the schemes;
• determining the procedure for ve  ng, authorisa on and reimbursement of claims for all Directors; and
• establishing criteria, terms of reference and selec on and employment of remunera on consultants.
The Commi ee met  ve  mes during the year. Details of a endance at Commi ee mee ngs during the year ended 31 March 2016 
are set on page  38. During the year the Commi ee has considered the appropriateness and relevance of the remunera on policy, the 
Execu ve Directors’ remunera on packages, including base salaries, the grant and ves ng of share-based incen ve awards and the 
amount and basis of performance related bonuses.
Advisors to the Commi ee
The Commi ee requests its advisors to a end mee ngs periodically during the year. The Commi ee retained the services of New 
Bridge Street, a brand of Aon Hewi  Limited, as its independent advisor on remunera on ma ers throughout the year. New Bridge 
Street was appointed as adviser to the Commi ee in November 2014 following a compe  ve tender process. Total fees for advice

New Bridge Street is a member of the Remunera on Consultants Group and as such operates under the code of conduct in rela on 
to execu ve remunera on consul ng in the United Kingdom. New Bridge Street is a trading name of Aon Hewi  Ltd, part of Aon plc

has received from New Bridge Street has been objec ve and independent and that no con  ict of interest arises as a result of these 
services.

Directors’ Remunera � on Report (con � nued)
Basic salary (subject to audit)
The Group’s normal salary review process takes place in the autumn, with any changes e ﬀ ec � ve from 1 October. 
As highlighted in last year’s Annual Statement on Remunera � on, the Commi � ee believed that it was appropriate to review the salary 
for Steve Blair, Group CEO, in the second half of 2015 in light of this policy. Since joining e2v in March 2014, Steve has re-energised 
e2v and made a major posi � ve impact on the Group’s opera � ons, with the  nancial performance improving signi  cantly and the 
Group structure simpli  ed. In November 2014, Steve launched ‘our vision, our future’ focussed on ‘Bringing life to technology’. 
We are pleased with the progress he has made in delivering this vision and the impact of this strategy has been well received by 
shareholders. 
Steve was appointed in March 2014 on a salary of £325,000 which subsequently increased to £334,750 in October 2014. This was 
considered below market against companies of a comparable size and complexity and re  ected that this was his  rst listed company 
Chief Execu � ve role. Given Steve’s performance in the role and following discussions with major shareholders, the Commi � ee felt 
it appropriate to now re-posi � on his salary closer to the appropriate level for the role in line with our policy. While the Commi � ee 
originally considered phasing the increase over � me in line with best prac � ce, it became clear during the consulta � on exercise that 
a number of major investors were comfortable with a one-o ﬀ  adjustment. Accordingly, no � ng the con � nued strong performance of 
the individual and the Group and the very posi � ve feedback from shareholders, the Commi � ee awarded a one-o ﬀ  salary increase to 
£390,000 e ﬀ ec � ve from 1 October 2015.
Following a review of individual and Group performance, Charles Hindson received a 5% salary increase (also e ﬀ ec � ve from 1 
October 2015). This compares with an average increase across the workforce of 2.5%, with actual increases ranging from 0% to 5% 
depending on individual performance. 
The salaries as at 1 April 2016 are therefore:
• Group CEO – £390,000 
• Group Finance Director – £263,682
Base salaries will be reviewed in line with the rest of the Group on 1 October 2016. The increases are expected to be within the 
normal workforce range.
Fees (subject to audit)
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Execu � ve Directors are determined taking account the individual’s responsibili � es including chairing 
Commi � ees of the Board, � me required to devote to the role and comparable market rates. Fees were last increased in October 
2014. The fee policy as at 1 April 2016 is set out in the table below:

(1) For TSR condi on, earnings per share (EPS) condi on measured to 31 March 2017.
The face value of the awards (at maximum ves ng) has been calculated using 253.92 pence, being the average closing share price 
over the three days prior to the date of grant. 50% of both awards are based on the Company’s TSR performance rela ve to the TSR 
of the cons tuents of the FTSE Small Cap Index. The other 50% of the awards are based on the Group’s basic adjusted earnings per 
share (EPS) growth. TSR performance is measured over three years from the date of grant and EPS performance is measured over the 
three  nancial years ending 31 March 2018. The performance targets for the rela ve TSR and EPS growth condi ons are the same as 
for the 2014 LTIP awards, as detailed above. 
(E) 2016 LTIP (awards to be made during the year ending 31 March 2017) 
It is intended that LTIP awards will be made in June 2016 whereby the Execu ve Directors will receive nil price op ons based on 100% 
of salary for ‘normal’ awards and 25% of salary for an ‘addi onal award’. The awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant to the 
extent the performance targets have been sa s  ed. 
50% of both the normal and the addi onal awards will be based on the Company’s TSR performance rela ve to the TSR of the 
cons tuents of the FTSE Small Cap Index. The other 50% of the awards is based on the Group’s basic adjusted EPS growth. The 
addi onal awards will be subject to more stretching performance targets.
The rela ve TSR condi on will be the same as for the 2014 and 2015 LTIP awards (see above). The adjusted EPS condi on will 
require growth of 5% to 13% per annum growth for the normal awards (for 25% to 100% ves ng) and 13% to 15% per annum for the 
addi onal awards (for 0% to 100% ves ng). This represents a reduc on in the threshold target for the normal awards from 6% to 5% 
per annum as a result of the challenging market and economic condi ons faced by the Company. The stretch target for the normal 
awards and the target range for the addi onal awards are the same those used in prior years.

Shareholding guideline
Under the Company’s shareholding guidelines, which are operated to further align the interests of the Execu � ve Directors and 
shareholders, Execu � ve Directors are expected to build up over  ve years and retain shares equal in value to at least twice their 
respec � ve basic salaries. Where Execu � ve Directors hold shares above these levels then, with the prior approval of the Chairman, 
they may undertake sales of these excess shares and this will not be viewed adversely. As at 31 March 2016, Steve Blair holds 
119,338 shares, represen � ng 66% of his annual salary. Charles Hindson holds 1,914,052 shares, which is in excess of the shareholding 
guideline. This is based on the share price on 31 March 2016 of 215.0 pence.
Sourcing of shares – Employee Bene  t Trust (EBT) and treasury shares
The Company established the EBT in 2004 as a discre � onary employee bene  t trust, in which all employees of the Group are 
poten � ally bene  ciaries. The Trustee is EES Trustees Interna � onal Limited, a professional o ﬀ shore trustee. The main purpose of the 
EBT is to operate the LTIP and other share op � on schemes following recommenda � ons from the Remunera � on Commi � ee or Board. 
Shareholder approval has been given to allow the Trustee to hold no more than 5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company, and as at 31 March 2016 the percentage was 0.21% (2015: 0.36%). 328,490 shares from the EBT having been u � lised 
during the year to sa � sfy LTIP awards that vested. In addi � on to the shares held by the EBT, as at 31 March 2016, the Company held 
in treasury 1,851,091 (2015: 351,037) of its own shares. This holding represents 0.84% (2015: 0.16%) of the issued share capital of 
the Company. 1,500,000 shares were purchased during the year (2015: £nil). No treasury shares were issued during the year (2015: 
1,595,054) to sa � sfy LTIP awards that vested. 001

Seven year TSR performance graph
The graph below shows the change in the TSR (with dividends re-invested) for the seven year period to 31 March 2016 of a holding 
of a £100 investment in the Company’s shares against the corresponding change in a hypothe � cal holding of shares in the FTSE Small 
Cap Index. This sector was chosen as it represents the equity market index in which the Company is a cons � tuent member and it is 
also used to form the basis of one of the performance measures for the Chairman and Group CEO Share Incen � ve Plans and the LTIP.

(1)  We have used all UK-based employees as the compara � ve group, as this represents the most appropriate reference group for reward purposes 
for the UK-based Group CEO.
The percentage change in the salary for the Group CEO year-on-year re  ects the re-posi � oning of his base salary as noted on 
page  56. During year ended 31 March 2015, the Group CEO received one-o ﬀ  reloca � on costs following his appointment. Whilst a 
bonus has been awarded to the wider employee popula � on, as actual performance for year ended 31 March 2016 was below the 
target level for the management bonus scheme, of which the Group CEO is a par � cipant, no bonus payments have been awarded 
under that arrangement.

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
1.  Authorisa on of  nancial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS
e2v technologies plc (the Company) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered o ﬃ  ce is given in the Directors’ Report. The 
nature of the Group’s opera � on and its principal ac � vi � es are set out in the Strategic Report.
The consolidated  nancial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016 comprise the results of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings (together referred to as the Group).
These  nancial statements are presented in Sterling as that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. 
Foreign opera � ons are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) unless 
otherwise indicated.
The  nancial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 13  May 2016.
The principal accoun � ng policies adopted by the Group are set out below.
2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies
Basis of accoun ng
The  nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with Interna � onal Financial Repor � ng Standards (IFRSs) applied in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The  nancial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore 
the consolidated  nancial statements comply with Ar � cle 4 of EU IAS Regula � on. 
The  nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revalua � on of certain  nancial and equity instruments. The 
principal accoun � ng policies are set out below and have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  nancial statements. 
Going concern
The Directors have, at the � me of approving the  nancial statements, a reasonable expecta � on that the Group has adequate resources to con � nue 
in opera � onal existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they con � nue to adopt the going concern basis of accoun � ng in preparing the  nancial 
statements. Further informa � on on the going concern of the Group can be found on page  30 in the viability statement.
Basis of consolida on
The consolidated  nancial statements incorporate the  nancial statements of e2v technologies plc and en � � es controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Group subsidiaries are detailed in note 2 to the Company Financial Statements. Control is achieved 
when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a ﬀ ect those returns through 
its power over the investee. Speci  cally, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
• Power over the investee (i.e. exis � ng rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant ac � vi � es of the investee)
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
• The ability to use its power over the investee to a ﬀ ect its returns
Generally, there is a presump � on that a majority of vo � ng rights result in control. To support this presump � on and when the Group has less than a 
majority of the vo � ng or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over 
an investee, including:
•  The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
•  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
•  The Group’s vo � ng rights and poten � al vo � ng rights
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the 
three elements of control. Consolida � on of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group 
loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabili � es, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated  nancial statements from the date the Group gains control un � l the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Pro  t or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are a � ributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the 
non-controlling interests (if applicable), even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a de  cit balance. When necessary, adjustments 
are made to the  nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accoun � ng policies into line with the Group’s accoun � ng policies. All intra-group 
assets and liabili � es, equity, income, expenses and cash  ows rela � ng to transac � ons between members of the Group are eliminated in full on 
consolida � on.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transac � on. If the Group loses control over 
a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabili � es, non-controlling interest and other components of equity while any 
resultant gain or loss is recognised in pro  t or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Business combina ons
For acquisi � ons undertaken a � er 1 April 2010, the acquisi � on of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisi � on method of accoun � ng. The cost 
of the acquisi � on is measured as the aggregate of the considera � on transferred, measured at acquisi � on date fair value, and the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the propor � onate share of 
the acquiree’s iden �  able net assets is determined on a transac � on by transac � on basis. Acquisi � on costs incurred are expensed and included in 
administra � ve expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the  nancial assets and liabili � es assumed for appropriate classi  ca � on and designa � on in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and per � nent condi � ons as at the acquisi � on date. This includes the separa � on of 
embedded deriva � ves in host contracts by the acquiree.
Goodwill arising on acquisi � on is recognised as an asset and ini � ally measured at cost, being the excess of aggregate of the acquisi � on date fair value 
of the considera � on transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net iden �  able amounts of the assets acquired 
and the liabili � es assumed in exchange for business combina � on. Assets acquired and liabili � es assumed in transac � ons separate to the business 
combina � ons, such as the se � lement of pre-exis � ng rela � onships or post-acquisi � on remunera � on arrangements, are accounted for separately from 
the business combina � on in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Iden �  able intangible assets mee � ng either the contractual, legal or 
separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Con � ngent liabili � es represen � ng a present obliga � on are recognised if the acquisi � on 
date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisi � on date fair value of the considera � on transferred and the amounts recognised for the non-controlling interest is 
lower than the fair value of the assets, liabili � es and con � ngent liabili � es and the fair value of any pre-exis � ng interest held in the business acquired, 
the di ﬀ erence is recognised in the income statement.
Where the fair values of the iden �  able net assets and con � ngent liabili � es acquired have been determined provisionally, or where con � ngent 
considera � on is payable, adjustments arsing form their subsequent  nalisa � on are not re  ected in the income statement if they arise within twelve 
months of the acquisi � on date and the adjustments arise from be � er informa � on about condi � ons exis � ng at the acquisi � on date. If con � ngent 
considera � on is classi  ed as equity, it is not remeasured and is accounted for within equity. Otherwise changes are included in the income statement.
Acquisi � ons undertaken prior to 1 April 2010 were accounted for under the purchase method of accoun � ng. However transac � on costs directly 
a � ributable to the acquisi � on formed part of the acquisi � on costs. Furthermore, con � ngent considera � on was recognised if, and only if, the Group 
had a present obliga � on, the economic ou � low was more likely than not and a reliable es � mate was determinable. Subsequent adjustments to the 
con � ngent considera � on were recognised as part of goodwill.
Foreign currency transla on
The individual  nancial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its func � onal currency). For the purpose of the consolidated  nancial statements, the results and  nancial posi � on of each Group company are 
retranslated into Sterling, which is the func � onal currency of the Company, and the presenta � on currency for the consolidated  nancial statements.
In preparing the  nancial statements of the individual companies, transac � ons in currencies other than the en � ty’s func � onal currency (foreign 
currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transac � ons. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabili � es that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair 
value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary 
items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
All exchange di ﬀ erences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise except for: exchange di ﬀ erences on transac� ons 
entered into that hedge certain foreign currency risks; and exchange di ﬀ erences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign opera � on 
for which se � lement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign 
opera � on), which are recognised ini � ally in other comprehensive income and reclassi  ed from equity to pro  t or loss on disposal or par � al disposal of 
the net investment. 
On consolida � on, the assets and liabili � es of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period, unless exchange rates  uctuate signi  cantly during the period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the date of transac � ons are used. The exchange di ﬀ erences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity, within the foreign currency transla � on reserve. On disposal of a foreign opera � on, all of the accumulated 
exchange di ﬀ erences in respect of that opera � on a � ributable to the Group are reclassi  ed to the income statement. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisi � on of a foreign en � ty are treated as assets and liabili � es of the foreign en � ty and translated 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold buildings, plant and equipment held for use in the produc � on or supply of goods or services, or for administra � ve purposes are stated at 
cost less accumulated deprecia � on and any impairment in value.
Assets under construc � on for produc � on or administra � ve purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accoun � ng policy. Deprecia � on on these 
assets commences when the assets are available for use.
Freehold land is not depreciated and is held at historical cost.
Deprecia � on is recognised so as to write-o ﬀ  the cost of assets (other than land and assets under construc � on) less their residual values on a straight-
line basis over the es � mated useful life, as follows:
Freehold buildings   25 to 50 years
Leasehold improvements  over the remaining lease term
Plant and equipment   3 to 10 years
O ﬃ  ce equipment,  xtures and  �  ngs 3 to 10 years
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If any 
such indica � on exists and where the carrying values exceed the es � mated recoverable amount, the assets or cash genera � ng units are wri � en down 
to their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value 
in use, the es � mated future cash  ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re  ects current market assessments 
of the � me value of money and the risks speci  c to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash in  ows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash genera � ng unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the 
administra � ve expenses line item. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset is increased to the revised 
es � mate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of deprecia � on, had no impairment 
loss been recognised for this asset in prior years. A reversal of impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic bene  ts are expected to arise from the 
con � nued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecogni � on of the asset (calculated as the di ﬀ erence between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolida � on represents the excess of the cost of an acquisi � on over the Group’ s interest in the fair value of the iden �  able assets 
and liabili � es of the subsidiary. Goodwill is ini � ally recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment tes � ng, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash genera � ng units expected to bene  t from the synergies 
of the combina � on. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash genera � ng unit, to which goodwill relates. If the 
recoverable amount of the cash genera � ng unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is allocated  rst to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a cash genera � ng unit or part of the cash genera � ng unit the a � ributable amount of goodwill is included in the determina � on of the 
pro  t or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisi � ons before the date of transi � on to IFRSs has been retained at the previous amounts recorded under UK Generally 
Accepted Accoun � ng Prac � ce (UK GAAP) subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill wri � en o ﬀ  to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 
1998 has not been reinstated and will not be included in determining any subsequent pro  t or loss on disposal. 
Intangible assets – research and development costs
Expenditure on research ac � vi � es is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s development ac � vi � es is capitalised only if all of the following condi � ons are met: 
an asset is created that can be iden �  ed (such as so � ware and new processes); it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
bene  ts; and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amor � sed on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, the period of expected future sales, es � mated at 
between three and  ve years. The amor � sa � on is recorded as part of research and development costs in the income statement. Where no internally 
generated intangible asset can be capitalised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
When the asset is not in use, the carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently when an indicator of 
impairment arises during the repor � ng period indica � ng that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Gains or losses arising from derecogni � on of an intangible asset are measured as the di ﬀ erence between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised.  001

 2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and intangible assets acquired from a business acquisi � on are capitalised at fair value as 
at the date of acquisi � on. Following ini � al recogni � on, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets. 
Computer so � ware purchased or internally generated for use that is integral to the hardware (because without that so � ware the equipment cannot 
operate) is treated as part of the hardware and capitalised as property, plant and equipment. Other so � ware programmes are treated as intangible 
assets. Intangible assets, excluding development costs and so � ware, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged to the 
income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash genera � ng unit level. Useful lives are also examined on an annual 
basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospec � ve basis. 
The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either  nite or inde  nite. Where amor � sa � on is charged on assets with  nite lives, it is 
provided so as to write-o ﬀ  the cost of intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the es � mated useful life, as follows:
Patents, trademarks and technology 5 to 10 years
Customer rela � onships and agreements 4 to 10 years
So � ware    2 to 7 years
This expense is recorded in the income statement in administra � ve costs. Assets held under  nance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term or their useful economic life. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present loca � on and condi � on. Cost is calculated using a  rst-in,  rst-out 
method. Net realisable value represents the es � mated selling prices less all es � mated costs of comple � on and costs to be incurred in marke � ng, 
selling and distribu � on.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defec � ve items where appropriate. A net increase in provision for the year as a whole is recognised as 
an expense in the year whilst a net reversal of provision for the year as a whole is recognised as a reduc � on in expense. 
Financial assets
All  nancial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a  nancial asset is under a contract whose terms 
require delivery of the  nancial asset within the � meframe established by the market concerned, and are ini � ally measured at fair value, plus 
transac � on costs, except for those  nancial assets classi  ed as fair value through pro  t or loss, which are ini � ally measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classi  ed into the following categories:  nancial assets ‘at fair value through pro  t or loss’ (FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, 
‘available-for-sale’  nancial assets and ‘loans and receivables’ . The classi  ca � on depends on the nature and purpose of the  nancial assets and is 
determined at the � me of recogni � on.
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objec � ve evidence that, as a result of one or events that occurred a � er the ini � al recogni � on of the  nancial asset, the es � mated future cash 
 ows of the investment have been a ﬀ ected.
The Group derecognises a  nancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash  ows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the  nancial 
asset and substan � ally all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another en � ty.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 60 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollec � ble amounts. An es � mate for doub � ul debts is made when collec � on of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are wri � en o ﬀ  
when iden �  ed.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash in the balance sheet comprises cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. For the 
purpose of the Consolidated statement of cash  ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash as de  ned above.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups classi  ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets are classi  ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transac � on rather than through con � nuing 
use. This condi � on is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its 
present condi � on. Management must be commi � ed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recogni � on as a completed sale within one 
year from the date of classi  ca � on.
When the Group is commi � ed to the sale plan involving the loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabili � es of that subsidiary are classi  ed as 
held for sale when the criteria above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary a � er the sale. 001

Shareholder Informa � on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
 2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Financial liabili es
Debt and equity instruments are classi  ed as either  nancial liabili � es or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial liabili � es are classi  ed as either  nancial liabili � es at FVTPL or other  nancial liabili � es. Financial liabili � es are classi  ed as FVTPL when the 
 nancial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL and are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised in pro  t or loss. Other  nancial liabili � es are ini � ally measured at fair value, net of transac � on costs.
A  nancial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is se � led, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an exis � ng  nancial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substan � ally di ﬀ erent terms, or the terms of an exis � ng liability are substan � ally modi  ed, 
such an exchange or modi  ca � on is treated as a derecogni � on of an exis � ng liability and the recogni � on of a new liability.
Borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are ini � ally recognised at cost, being the fair value of the considera � on received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowing. A � er ini � al recogni � on, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amor � sed cost using the e ﬀ ec � ve interest 
method. The e ﬀ ec � ve interest method is a method of calcula � ng the amor � sed cost of a  nancial liability and of alloca � ng interest expense over the 
relevant period. The e ﬀ ec � ve interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts es � mated future cash payments through the expected life of the  nancial 
liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on ini � al recogni � on.
Borrowings are classi  ed as current liabili � es unless, at the balance sheet date, the Group has an uncondi � onal right to defer se � lement of the liability 
for at least 12 months a � er the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly a � ributable to the acquisi � on, construc � on or produc � on of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substan � al period of � me to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, un � l such � me as the assets are 
substan � ally ready for their intended use or sale. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the e ﬀ ec � ve interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obliga � on (legal or construc � ve) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will 
be required to se � le that obliga � on and a reliable es � mate can be made of the amount of the obliga � on. 
The amount recognised as a provision is based on the best reliable es � mate of the considera � on required to se � le the present obliga � on at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertain � es surrounding the obliga � on and its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash  ows.
When some or all of the economic bene  ts required to se � le a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised 
as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and that the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Present obliga � ons arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the 
Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of mee � ng the obliga � ons under the contract exceed the economic bene  ts expected to be 
received under it.
Pensions, other post-employment and other employment bene  ts
The Group operates de  ned contribu � on pension schemes which require contribu � ons to be made to a separately administered fund. Payments 
to de  ned contribu � on pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to a state-managed pension are dealt with as 
payments to de  ned contribu � on schemes where the Group’s obliga � ons under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a de  ned contribu � on 
re � rement bene  t scheme.
The Group operates unfunded de  ned bene  t plans in France providing termina � on payments (post-employment bene  t) to employees upon 
re � rement and long service awards paid when the employee reaches certain lengths of service (other employment bene  t). The cost of providing 
bene  ts is determined with actuarial valua � ons being carried out on each balance sheet date. Past service cost is recognised immediately. Actuarial 
gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. Those related to the termina � on bene  ts are recognised outside the income 
statement and are presented in other comprehensive income, whilst those related to the long service award are recognised in the income statement. 
When a se � lement or curtailment occurs, the obliga � on and related plan assets are re-measured using current actuarial assump � ons and the 
resultant gain or loss is recognised in the income statement during the period in which the se � lement or curtailment occurs. 001

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
 2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Share based payment transac ons 
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remunera � on in the form of share based transac � ons, whereby employees render services 
in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity se � led transac � ons). The cost of equity se � led transac � ons with employees is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using binomial or Black-Scholes models, combined with 
Monte Carlo simula � on as appropriate. Further details are given in note 28. In valuing equity se � led transac � ons, no account is taken of any ves � ng 
condi � ons, other than condi � ons linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market condi � ons).
The cost of equity se � led transac � ons is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
condi � ons are ful  lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully en � tled to the award (ves � ng date). The cumula � ve 
expense recognised for equity se � led transac � ons at each repor � ng date re  ects the extent to which the ves � ng period has expired and 
management’s best es � mate of the number of awards that will ul � mately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ul � mately vest, except for awards where ves � ng is condi � onal upon a market condi � on, which are 
treated as ves � ng irrespec � ve of whether or not the market condi � on is sa � s  ed, provided that all other performance condi � ons are sa � s  ed.
Where the terms of an equity se � led award are modi  ed, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modi  ed. In addi � on, 
an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transac � on as a result of the modi  ca � on, as measured at the date of modi  ca � on.
Where an equity se � led award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancella � on, and any expense not yet recognised for the 
award is recognised immediately. If a new award is subs � tuted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is 
granted, the cancelled and new shares are treated as if they were a modi ca � on of the original award.
The dilu � on e ﬀ ect of outstanding op � ons is re  ected as addi � onal share dilu � on in the computa � on of earnings per share (note 11).
Leases
Leases are classi  ed as  nance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substan � ally all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
Finance lease assets are capitalised at the commencement of the lease term at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the 
fair value of the leased asset. The obliga � ons rela � ng to  nance leases, net of  nance charges in respect of future periods, are recognised as liabili � es. 
Leases are subsequently measured at amor � sed cost using the e ﬀ ec � ve interest method.
All other leases are classi  ed as opera � ng leases. Rental payments under opera � ng leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systema � c basis is more representa � ve of the � me pa � ern in which the 
economic bene  ts from the leased asset are consumed. Con � ngent rentals arising under opera � ng leases are recognised as an expense in the period 
in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incen � ves are received to enter into opera � ng leases, such incen � ves are recognised as a liability. The aggregate bene  t of 
incen � ves is recognised as a reduc � on of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systema � c basis is more representa � ve of the 
� me pa � ern in which economic bene  ts from the leased assets are consumed.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the considera � on received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of standard products is recognised when all the following condi � ons are sa � s  ed:
•  the Group has transferred to the buyer the signi  cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
•  the Group retains neither con� nuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor e ﬀ ec � ve control over 
the goods sold;
•  the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
•  it is probable that the economic bene  ts associated with the transac � on will  ow to the en � ty; and
•  the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transac � on can be measured reliably.
Revenue in respect of long term contracts for non-standard products and services is recognised by reference to the stage of comple � on of the 
project. The stage of comple � on is determined either by reference to the comple � on of a physical propor � on of the work, dependent upon the 
nature of the underlying project, or by reference to the propor � on that costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the es � mated total project 
costs. Revenues derived from varia � ons on projects are recognised only when they have been accepted by the customer. Full provision is made for 
losses on projects in the period in which they are  rst foreseen. 
Royalty revenue is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement, provided that it is probable that the 
economic bene  ts will  ow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Royal � es determined on a � me basis are recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreement. Royalty arrangements that are based on produc � on, sales and other measures are 
recognised by reference to the underlying arrangement. 001

 2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Revenue (con nued)
Finance revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic bene  ts will  ow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Finance revenue income is accrued on a � me basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the e ﬀ ec � ve interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts the es � mated future cash receipts through the expected life of the  nancial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount on ini � al recogni � on. 
Government grants
Government grants are not recognised un � l there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the condi � ons a � aching to them and 
that the grants will be received. Government grants for research programmes are recognised as revenue over the periods necessary to match them 
with the related costs incurred, and in the income statement are deducted from the related costs. Government grants related to property, plant and 
equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Taxa on
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income 
if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it 
relates to items that are charged or credited  directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable pro  t for the year. Taxable pro  t di ﬀ ers from net pro  t as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deduc � ble in other years and it further excludes items of income or expense that 
are never taxable or deduc � ble. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substan � vely enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on di ﬀ erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili � es in the  nancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computa � on of taxable pro  t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabili � es are generally recognised for all taxable temporary di ﬀ erences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that the taxable pro  ts will be available against which deduc � ble temporary di ﬀ erences can be u � lised. Such assets and liabili � es are 
not recognised if the temporary di ﬀ erences arising from the ini � al recogni � on of goodwill or from the ini � al recogni � on (other than in a business 
combina � on) of other assets and liabili � es in a transac � on that a ﬀ ects neither the taxable pro  t nor the accoun � ng pro  t.
Deferred tax liabili � es are recognised for taxable temporary di ﬀ erences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary di ﬀ erence and it is probable that the temporary di ﬀ erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that su ﬃ  cient 
taxable pro  ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis and is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
se � led or the asset is realised. Deferred tax assets and liabili � es are o ﬀ set when there is a legally enforceable right to set o ﬀ  current tax assets against 
current tax liabili � es and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxa � on authority and the Group intends to se � le its current tax assets 
and liabili � es on a net basis.
Deriva ve  nancial instruments and hedging
The Group enters into a variety of deriva � ve  nancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including 
foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Further details of deriva � ve  nancial instruments are disclosed in notes 31 and 32.
Deriva � ve  nancial instruments are ini � ally recognised at fair value on the date on which a deriva � ve contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resul � ng gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately unless the 
deriva � ve is designated and e ﬀ ec � ve as a hedging instrument, in which event the � ming of the recogni � on in the income statement depends on the 
nature of the hedge rela � onship. The Group designates certain deriva � ves as either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabili � es or  rm 
commitments (fair value hedges), hedges of highly probably forecast transac � ons or hedges of foreign currency risk of  rm commitments (cash  ow 
hedges), or hedges of net investments in foreign opera � ons.
No deriva � ve  nancial instruments have been designated as a fair value or cash  ow hedge during the current or prior  nancial year.
A deriva � ve with a posi � ve fair value is presented as a  nancial asset whereas a deriva � ve with a nega � ve fair value is presented as a  nancial liability. 
A deriva � ve is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is 
not expected to be realised or se � led within 12 months. Other deriva � ves are presented as current assets or current liabili � es.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings to hedge its investment in currency investments and classi  es the hedging rela � onship as a net 
investment hedge. To the extent that the hedge is e ﬀ ec � ve, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. 001

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
 2. Summary of signi cant accoun ng policies (con nued)
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the en � ty a � er deduc � ng its liabili � es. Equity instruments 
issued by the Group are recognised as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
 Dividend d istribu on
Dividends to holders of equity instruments declared a � er the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability as at the balance sheet date. Final 
dividend distribu � ons to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the  nancial statements in the period in which they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Own shares reserve
e2v technologies plc shares held by the Employee Bene  t Trust and the Company are classi  ed in shareholders’ equity as own shares and are 
recognised at cost. Considera � on received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any di ﬀ erence between the proceeds from 
sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement or the statement of comprehensive 
income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancella � on of equity shares.
Cri cal accoun ng judgements and key sources of es ma on uncertainty
In the applica � on of the Group’s accoun � ng policies, management must make judgements, es � mates and assump � ons concerning the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabili � es that are not readily apparent from other sources. The es � mates and associated assump � ons are based upon factors 
such as historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di ﬀ er from these es � mates.
The es � mates and underlying assump � ons are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accoun � ng es � mates are recognised in the period in which 
the es � mate is revised if the revision a ﬀ ects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision a ﬀ ects both current and 
future periods.
The following are the cri � cal judgements and key sources of es � ma � on uncertainty that the Directors have made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accoun � ng policies and have the most signi  cant e ﬀ ect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated  nancial statements: accoun � ng 
for acquisi � ons (fair valua � on of intangible assets, net assets acquired and con � ngent considera � on payable) (note 13); subsequent impairment of 
goodwill and other intangible assets arising on acquisi � on (note 16); the measurement of long term contract balances as included in work-in-progress 
(note 17) and provisions (note 23), with regard to the stage of comple � on and the total costs to complete; and the measurement of inventory 
provisions, especially with regard to the Group’s inventory holdings for its obsolescence management business and the last � me build programmes 
undertaken in Grenoble ahead of the closure of its front end fabrica � on plant in 2011 (note 17). Other areas of es � ma � on uncertainty include: the 
measurement of product warranty provisions, with regard to the es � ma � on of the level of returns (note 23); the measurement of de  ned bene  t 
liabili � es (note 29); and the measurement and recogni � on of tax liabili � es and deferred tax assets (note 24).
Adjusted pro  t measures
In order to provide a more relevant presenta � on of the Group’s underlying performance, pro  t for each  nancial year has been analysed between:
a) Trading results before speci  c items; and 
b )  T h e e ﬀ ect of speci  c items. Speci  c items are material items of income and expense which, in the opinion of the Directors, because of the 
nature or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presenta � on to allow a be � er understanding of the elements of the 
Group’s underlying performance for the  nancial year and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with 
prior periods and assessments of trends in  nancial performance.
  Sp eci  c opera � ng items may include: business improvement programme expenses; last � me build inventory provisions; gains and losses on 
sale of property; acquisi � on costs; impairments and fair value gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts; all opera � ng items a � ributable 
to terminated or disposed opera � ons and opera � ons held for sale where there is a contractual agreement to sell; and amor � sa � on of 
acquired intangible assets, including impairment.
  Sp eci  c  nance items may include: fair value gains and losses arising on interest rate swaps; realised exchange di ﬀ erences on the re-
denomina � on of borrowings; and write-o ﬀ  of debt issue costs.
 Speci  c tax items include the tax e ﬀ ect on speci  c opera � ng items and speci  c  nance items.
Further analysis of speci  c opera � ng items is provided in note 5. There are no speci  c  nance items in the current or prior year. 001

The Interna � onal Accoun � ng Standards Board (IASB) and Interna � onal Financial Repor � ng Commi � ee (IFRIC) have also issued the following Standards 
and Interpreta � ons with an e ﬀ ec � ve date a � er the date of these  nancial statements (and in some cases not yet adopted by EU):
        E ﬀ ec � ve for
       periods
       commencing

(1) Note that IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts is not applicable to the Group as the Group is not a  rst- � me adopter of IFRSs.
The Group intends to adopt these standards in the  rst accoun � ng period a � er the e ﬀ ec � ve date. With the excep � on of IFRS 15, the Directors do not 
an � cipate that the adop � on of the remaining Standards and Interpreta � ons will have a material e ﬀ ect on the consolidated  nancial statements in the 
period of ini � al applica � on. With regard to IFRS 15, which provides for a single principles based model to be applied to all sales contracts based on the 
transfer of control of goods and services to customers, given the percentage of the Group’s revenue arising from long term contracts, the Directors 
an � cipate that the applica � on of IFRS 15 may have a material e ﬀ ect on the amounts reported and the disclosures made in the consolidated  nancial 
statements. Un � l the Group performs a detailed review, it is not prac � cable to provide a reasonable es � mate of the e ﬀ ect.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
4. Segment informa on
The Group is organised into three opera � ng divisions, which are organised and managed separately based on the key products that they provide. 
Each is treated as an opera � ng segment and a reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8, ‘Opera � ng Segments’ . 
The opera � ng and reportable segments are: 
•  Imaging providing high quality imaging sensors, cameras and sub-systems which deliver higher performance for our customers across a 
range of applica � ons in the automa � on, healthcare, discovery and environment markets.
•  RF Power producing components and sub-systems that deliver high performance and high reliability radio frequency power genera � on 
for healthcare, industrial and defence applica � ons.
•  Semiconductors providing high reliability semiconductors that meet the demanding speci  ca � ons of our customers. Our design capability 
is  enabling us to partner with customers and move up the value chain by providing mul � -chip modules and boards.
A more detailed descrip � on for each segment is included with the ‘Our value proposi � on - what we do and our key drivers’ sec � ons of the Business 
Review in the Strategic Report.
Centre-corporate includes those unallocated costs directly associated with the management of the Group’s public quota � on and other related costs 
arising from the corporate management of the Group along with treasury related ac � vi � es.

Acquisi � on related costs
As detailed in note 13, the Group completed the acquisi � on of SP Devices in January 2016 and in connec � on with this incurred one-o ﬀ  transac � on 
costs of £232,000 (2015: £446,000 in connec � on with acquisi � on of AnaFocus). Exchange losses of £199,000 (2015: gains £231,000) have been 
recorded rela � ng to the outstanding con � ngent considera � on for both SP Devices and AnaFocus. Where payments in connec � on with the acquisi � on 
are dependent upon future employment, they are treated as a cost of con � nuing employment, costs of £393,000 (2015: £544,000) have been 
recorded in rela � on to AnaFocus. No such costs arise from the acquisi � on of SP Devices.
Business improvement programme expenses, net
During the year the Group has reposi � oned its regional teams in US and Asia so that they too are aligned with the divisions and has also reorganised 
RF’s defence business into three dis � nct units. Costs of £1,205,000 have been recorded principally related to sta ﬀ  costs and which include £214,000 
to establish a new facility in Lincoln for the Microwave business unit. Project Sunrise, the reorganisa � on of the footprint at the Chelmsford facility, 
con � nues with costs of £441,000 (2015: £686,000) incurred in the period.
In the year ended 31 March 2015, an announcement to cease manufacturing in Beijing, China during the  rst half of the following  nancial year 
was made prior to 31 March 2015, together with the commencement of a consulta � on process regarding the planned closure of the sales o ﬃ  ce in 
Bievres, France. During the current year these work programmes have progressed and a credit of £269,000 recorded, principally as an onerous lease 
provision is no longer required.
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group restructured the Group’s central opera � ons, RF Power and Imaging teams and a charge of 
£3,429,000 was recorded in respect of these ac � vi � es and those in Bievres and China, principally related to sta ﬀ  and onerous lease costs. 
Foreign currency (gains)/ losses arising from fair value adjustment 
The Group, in part, hedges its exposure to foreign currency risks through the use of forward exchange contracts. The changes in the fair value of 
the instruments are recorded as speci  c items in the income statement. Fluctua � ons in the exchange rates have resulted in a net fair value gain of 
£618,000 (2015: loss £1,873,000).
Disposal of businesses
On 8 October 2015 the Group sold the trade and assets of the thermal imaging business. The net proceeds on this transac � on were £2,919,000. The

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
 11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net pro  t for the year a � ributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net pro  t for the year a � ributable to 
ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the e ﬀ ects of dilu � ve op � ons. 
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on the basis of net pro  t for the year before speci  c items. In the Directors’ judgement adjusted earnings 
per share is considered to more appropriately re  ect the underlying performance of the business year on year.
The following re  ects the net pro  t and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computa � ons:
      2016 2015
      £000 £000
Pro  t for the year      29,708 23,756
Amor � sa � on of acquired intangible assets      2,795 2,281
Acquisi � on related costs       824 759
Business improvement programme expenses, net      1,377 4,115
Foreign currency (gains)/ losses arising from fair value adjustment    (618) 1,873
Disposal of businesses      (1,132) (100)
Pro  t on sale of proper � es      (284) –
Tax e ﬀ ect of the above      (900) (2,993)
Pro  t before speci  c items a ributable to ordinary shareholders    31,770 29,691
      2016 2015
      No. 000 No. 000
Weighted average number of ordinary shares
For basic EPS      217,777 217,115
E ﬀ ect of dilu � on:
  Share op � ons      2,731 2,137
For diluted EPS      220,508 219,252
Since the repor � ng date and before the comple � on of these  nancial statements 46,189  shares (2015: 10,000) have been issued as a result of 
exercises under share op � on schemes. The weighted average number of ordinary shares excludes shares held by the EBT and by the Company as 
treasury shares.
12. Dividends paid and proposed
    2016 2016 2015 2015
    Pence per  Pence per
    share £000 s hare £ 0 0 0
Final dividend paid in respect of the prior year    3.6 7,863 3.0 6,482
Interim dividend paid in respect of the current year   1.6 3,472 1.5 3,264
    5.2 11,335 4.5 9,746
The EBT and the Company have waived their right to receive dividends. See note 25 for details of these holdings. 
The Board recommends that a  nal dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2016 of 3.8 p per share will be paid on 2 August 2016  to 
shareholders registered at the close of business on 8 July 2016 . This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Mee � ng 
and therefore the liability of approximately £8,281,000  has not been included in these  nancial statements. The amount is based on the number of 
shares in issue, excluding those held by the EBT and the Company, at the date that these  nancial statements have been approved and authorised for 
issue. The actual payment may di ﬀ er due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue between the date of approval of these  nancial 
statements and the record date of the  nal dividend.
13. Business combina ons
On 22 January 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Signal Processing Devices Sweden AB (SP Devices), a Linköping based company 
specialising in the design and development of high performance analogue-to-digital processing technology. The business brings proven patented 
technology in so � ware and board level sub-systems and services, which compliments and enhances e2v’s exis � ng broadband data converter 
business. The acquisi � on has been accounted for using the acquisi � on method. The consolidated  nancial statements include the results of SP 
Devices for the period from the acquisi � on date, reported within the Semiconductors segment (note 4). 001

The goodwill of £10,219,000 represents the premium paid in an cipa on of future pro  tability from assets that are not capable of being separately 
iden  ed and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the expecta on that the Group will be able to leverage its wider 
market access and strong  nancial posi on to generate sustainable  nancial growth beyond that what SP Devices would have poten ally achieved as 
a standalone company. None of the goodwill is expected to be deduc ble for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisi on relate mainly to current technology (£1,266,000), customer rela onships and agreements 
(£720,000), and trade name (£75,000), the fair value of which is dependent on es mates of a ributable future revenues, pro  tability and cash  ows 
and are being amor sed over 15, 8 and 2 years respec vely. Trade and other receivables acquired have a provisional fair value of £408,000 and a 
gross contractual value of £408,000, all of which is currently expected to be collec ble. The fair value of the acquired iden  able assets and liabili es 
is provisional pending  nalisa on of the fair value exercise.
£2,787 ,000 of con ngent considera on represents the fair value, at acquisi on date, of the addi onal considera on. This is the maximum payment 
and is dependent on the achievement of revenue targets over a two  year period from acquisi on. Acquisi on related costs of £232,000 have been 
included as a speci  c item in administra ve expenses (note 5).
SP Devices contributed £675,000 of external revenue and £92,000 to the Group’s adjusted opera ng pro  t from the date of acquisi on to 31 March 
2016. If the acquisi on had been completed on 1 April 2015, Group revenue and adjusted opera ng pro  t for the year ended 31 March 2016 would 
have been £239.0 million and £42.3 million, respec vely.
The Group acquired 100% of the vo ng rights of Innovaciones Microelectronicas SL (AnaFocus) on 4 September 2014. Provisional numbers were 
disclosed in the 2015  nancial statements while management completed the fair value exercise. No adjustments were iden  ed during the 
comple on of  this review. There have been no changes to the expected se lement of the con ngent considera on, with a payment of £2,500,000 
recognised in the year in line with the maximum payment. A further payment for the  nal tranche of con ngent considera on of €1.5million is 
expected to be paid in the  rst half of year ending 31 March 2017 .  001

e2v technologies comprises four UK based CGUs, RF Power, Siemens High Power Satcom, Dynex Microwave Alarms and UK Imaging. Goodwill 
acquired through the acquisi � ons of Siemens High Power Satcom (£359,000) and Dynex Microwave Alarms (£1,344,000) have been fully impaired. 
e2v semiconductors SAS is based in Grenoble has two CGU’s Imaging and Semiconductors. The goodwill for the Imaging CGU was fully impaired in the 
year ended 31 March 2009. e2v Inc is based in Milpitas, USA.
AnaFocus, based in Seville, and SP Devices, based in Linköping were acquired in the years ended 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016 respec � vely.
The recoverable amount of the remaining goodwill for all CGU has been determined based on a value in use calcula � on. To calculate this, cash  ow 
projec � ons are based on  nancial budgets and models from the Strategy Review, both of which are approved by the Board. The key assump � ons 
used in the valua � ons are:
Opera ng margins – the budgeted margin is used for the coming year, which is then adjusted if required for further years for any expected changes 
due to sales mix or e ﬃ  ciency improvements. 
Discount rates – discount rates re  ect the Directors’ es � mate of the return on capital employed required in every CGU. This is the benchmark used 
by the Group to assess opera � ng performance and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. A 15% (2015: 15%) pre-tax discount rate, adjusted 
for speci  c risk where appropriate, is considered appropriate for the purpose of impairment reviews as it is consistent with the rates used in all 
investment appraisals and is considered to be a conserva � ve es � mate of the return expected by market par � cipants.
Growth rates – have been considered separately for every CGU and are based on  nancial budgets and the Strategy Review. A � er  ve years, a long 
term growth rate of 2.5% (2015: 2.5%) has been u � lised.
For all CGUs the impairment review indicated su ﬃ  cient headroom not to be at risk of crea � ng impairment in the usual range of sensi � vity tests. 001

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 or 60 day terms and are shown net of provision for impairment. Before accep � ng 
any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the poten � al customer’s credit quality and de  nes credit limits by 
customers. As at 31 March 2016 trade receivables with a value of £1,062,000 (2015: £1,009,000) were impaired and provided for due to poor 
payment history, insolvency of the debtor or their age pro  le. The movements on the provision for impairment of receivables were as follows:

Bank debt
On 29 July 2014, the Group entered into a new revolving credit facility which expires on 28 July 2018, and which is denominated in Sterling 
(£62,500,000), US dollars ($40,000,000) and Euros (€5,000,000). At 31 March 2016 exchange rates, the total facility is £94,268,000 (2015: 
£93,176,000). Provided covenants con nue to be met, the draw down under the revolving credit facility is at the discre on of the Group and 
consequently the loan is treated as non-current. As at 31 March 2016, £36,234,000 (2015: £22,500,000) was drawn down under this facility.
The revolving credit facility is repaid and re-drawn at periodic intervals ranging from one to six months, with the interest rate set at each draw down 
date. Interest is set by reference to LIBOR plus a margin which is determined based on the level of the reported leverage covenant (de  ned as net 
borrowings: earnings before interest, tax, deprecia on and amor sa on).
As at 31 March 2016, the Group had available £58,034,000 (2015: £70,676,000) of un-drawn commi ed borrowing facili es in respect of which all 
condi ons precedent had been met.
As at 31 March 2016, unamor sed debt issue costs were £277 ,000 (2015: £547 ,000). As at 31 March 2016 and at 31 March 2015, the bank loans were

The e ﬀ ect of the � me value of money is not material and therefore the above provisions are not discounted.
Onerous project losses
A provision is recognised for expected losses on projects in progress at the balance sheet date. It is expected that the losses will be incurred in the 
next two  nancial years.
Employment related
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expecta � on 
in those a ﬀ ected that it will carry out the restructuring by star � ng to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those a ﬀ ected by it. The 
measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both 
necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing ac � vi � es of the en � ty. All payments associated with the programme are 
expected to be incurred over the period to March 2017 . 
From � me to � me the Group may be required to defend itself against proceedings brought by other par � es, including former employees. Provision is 
made for any expected costs and liabili � es in rela � on to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions 
(which may be subject to poten � ally material revision from � me to � me) will accurately predict the actual costs and liabili � es that may be incurred.
Product warranty
A provision is recognised for expected warranty claims on products sold that are within their warranty period at the end of the year under local sale of 
goods legisla � on or contract terms. The warranty period can be date or hours usage based. It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the next 
two  nancial years. Assump � ons used to calculate the provision for warran � es were based on relevant sales levels and current informa � on available 
about warranty claims and represent the Directors’ best es � mate of the expenditure required to se � le the Group’s obliga � on.
Property related
Includes a provision recognised for expected environmental costs rela � ng to UK manufacturing opera � ons. It is expected that the environmental 
costs will be incurred more than one year a � er the balance sheet date. 001

The UK government, with e ﬀ ect from 1 April 2015, reduced the main rate of UK corpora � on tax from 21% to 20%. In addi � on, the Finance Bill 2016, 
which was substan � vely enacted on 26 October 2015, will reduce the UK corpora � on tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 
2020. UK deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2016 have been calculated based on the reduced corpora � on tax rate of 20%, 19% and 18% being 
the relevant tax rate that is expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is se � led. The Spanish government, for  nancial 
periods beginning during 2015, reduced the main rate of Spanish corpora � on tax rate from 30% to 28%, and for  nancial periods beginning during 
2016, reduced the rate further to 25%. Spanish deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2016 have been calculated based on the Spanish corpora � on tax 
rate of 25%, the rate expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is se � led.
There are no income tax consequences for the Company a � aching to the payment of dividends to its shareholders.
Management have reviewed the situa � on for those jurisdic � ons where deferred assets arise and have determined, based on current forecasts 
prepared by management, that these assets can be recovered through future taxable pro  ts within a reasonable � me horizon.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £6.2 million (2015: £5.0 million) available for o ﬀ set against future pro  ts. A deferred tax 
asset of £1,458 ,000 has been recognised in respect of these losses, which expire between 2026 and 2032.
As at 31 March 2016, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabili � es have not been 
recognised is approximately £13 7 million (2015: £113 million). No liability has been recognised in respect of these di ﬀ erences because the Group 
is in the posi � on to control the � ming of the reversal of the temporary di ﬀ erences and it is probable that such di ﬀ erences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemp � on. 001

26. Reserves
Nature and purpose of reserves
Share premium
Generally, addi � ons to this reserve are made when shares are issued, for cash or otherwise, by the Company for amounts in excess of their nominal 
value. This reserve can be u � lised to issue fully paid bonus shares and  to write-o ﬀ  any issue costs .
Merger reserve
The excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued during the rights issue and placement in 2010 was recognised to the 
merger reserve. The Directors believe this reserve is currently distributable.
Own shares reserve
The own share reserve records movements in e2v technologies plc’s shares held by the EBT or the Company.
 C ap i t al r e d e m p on reserve
The capital redemp � on reserve is used to record reserve transfers required on the redemp � on of shares. This reserve is not distributable.
Foreign currency transla on reserve
The foreign currency transla � on reserve is used to record exchange di ﬀ erences arising from the transla � on of the  nancial statements of foreign 
subsidiaries. It is also used to record the net investments hedged in these subsidiaries. 
27. Commitments and con ngencies
Opera ng lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain proper � es, motor vehicles and items of machinery where it is not in the best interest of the 
Group to purchase these assets. Renewals are at the op � on of the speci  c en � ty that holds the lease. There are no restric � ons placed upon the lessee 
by entering into these leases.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable opera � ng leases as at 31 March are as follows:
      2016 2015
      £000 £000
No later than one year      1,334 1,055
A � er one year but not more than  ve years      896 967
      2,230 2,022
Capital commitments
At 31 March 2016, the Group has commitments of £1,277 ,000 (2015: £3,835,000) principally rela � ng to the acquisi � on of new plant and equipment.
Con ngent liabili es
The Company and its subsidiaries may be par � es to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, and can be material 
in value. Appropriate provision has been made in these accounts where, in the opinion of the Directors, liabili � es are likely to materialise (note 23). 
Furthermore, in the ordinary course of business, the Group may also issue performance and advance payment guarantees. Guarantees are treated as 
con � ngent liabili � es un � l such � me as it becomes probable that a payment will be required under the terms of the guarantee. As at 31 March 2016, 
bank guarantees of £3,406,000 (2015: £3,580,000) are outstanding. 
The Group has received grant assistance from the UK government’s Regional Growth Fund which is condi � onal on certain job targets being achieved 
in future years. The Directors are of the opinion that the risk of repayment of the grants is not signi  cant and consequently no liability is recorded for 
the repayment of such grants.
28. Equity se led share based payments
The Group operates three share based award schemes as detailed below. The share based payment expense charged to the income statement as an 
administra � ve cost for the year ended 31 March 2016 was £1,200,000 (2015: £875,000).
Long Term Incen ve Plan (LTIP)
For those awards made during the year ended 31 March 2016, awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of the award, subject to performance 
targets being met. For the ‘normal’ awards, 50% of the awards are subject to a performance condi � on based on the Group’s adjusted earnings per 
share (Adjusted EPS) and the remaining 50% of the awards are subject to a performance condi � on which relates the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance rela � ve to the TSR for the FTSE Small Cap Index (calculated as an average over the three month period ending on the 
last day of the performance period). Addi � onal awards made to the Group CEO and Group Financial Director also have 50% of the award subject to 
Adjusted EPS and 50% of the award subject to rela � ve TSR performance; however more stretching targets are assigned to these awards compared 
with the ‘normal’ awards. 001

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
29. Pensions, other post-employment and other employment bene  ts
De  ned contribu on plans
The Group has de  ned contribu � on plans in the UK and North America, covering substan � ally all of its employees, which require contribu � ons to 
be made to a separately administered fund. The Group contributes to state schemes for Con � nental European ac � vi � es. Such schemes are de  ned 
contribu � on schemes and there is no Group exposure to any scheme liabili � es. The de  ned contribu � on expense charged to the income statement 
during the period was £2,287 ,000 (2015: £2,227 ,000). Contribu � ons of £316,000 (2015: £292,000) were outstanding at the end of the  nancial year 
and have been included in other creditors.
 Other post-employment and other employment bene  ts
In addi � on to the state pension scheme, e2v semiconductors SAS and e2v SAS have arrangements where there are obliga � ons to provide termina � on 
allowances and ‘Medailles du Travail’ (long service awards). These are unfunded arrangements and the actuarial liability has been calculated at 31 
March 2016 by a quali  ed actuary using the unit credit method. The cost of providing these bene  ts is charged to the income statement in the period 
in which those bene  ts have been earned by the employees. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they arise. 
For the termina � on allowance the remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income whereas for the long service award 
the remeasurement gains and losses are recorded in the income statement. 
The main assump � ons used in determining the liabili � es of the arrangements include the discount rate for discoun � ng scheme liabili � es, the 
expected rate of salary in  a � on, sta ﬀ  turnover rates, re � rement age and future mortality in service assump � ons. For each of these assump � ons, 
there is a range of possible values. Rela � vely small changes in some of these variables can have a signi  cant e ﬀ ect on the level of the total obliga � on.
As at 31 March 2016, a non-current liability of £5,298,000 (2015: £4,893,000) has been recognised with respect to the termina � on allowance and 
long service award arrangements. 
The table below details the combined present value of the termina � on allowance and long service awards plan obliga � ons and experience 
adjustments recognised.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con � nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
31. Financial risk management objec � ves and policies
The Group’s principal  nancial instruments, other than deriva � ves, comprise bank and other loans,  nance leases and cash. The main purpose of 
these  nancial instruments is to raise  nance for the Group’s opera � ons. The Group has various other  nancial instruments such as trade debtors and 
trade creditors, which arise directly from its opera � ons.
The Group also enters into deriva � ve transac � ons, principally forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from 
the Group’s opera � ons and its sources of  nance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in  nancial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s  nancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising 
from all  nancial instruments. The magnitude of this risk that has arisen over the year is discussed in note 32. The Group’s accoun � ng policies in 
rela � on to deriva � ves are set out in note 2.
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s debt obliga � ons.
Where term debt exists, it is the Group’s policy to manage its interest cost using a mix of  xed and variable rate debt. To manage this mix in a cost 
e ﬃ  cient manner, the Group will enter into interest rate swaps, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at speci  ed intervals, the di ﬀ erence between 
 xed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon no � onal principal amount and will draw down por � ons of its revolving 
credit facility for periods of up to six months. At 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015, the Group did not have any term debt and therefore there were 
no interest rate swaps in place.
Based on the borrowings outstanding at the end of the year and assuming constant exchange rates, it is es � mated that an increase of 1% in interest 
rates on the Group’s borrowings would increase the annual interest payable by £0.3 million (2015: £0.2 million). A 1% increase in interest rates on 
bank deposits is es � mated to increase  nance revenue by less than £0.1 million (2015: less than £0.1 million).
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has opera � ons in the United States, Europe and Asia. As a result the Group’s balance sheet can be a ﬀ ected signi  cantly by movements in 
the US dollar and Euro exchange rates. The Group does not currently hedge this exposure, other than by using foreign currency borrowings, in part, to 
 nance overseas investments.
The Group also has transac � onal currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales by an opera � ng unit in currencies other than the unit’s 
func � onal currency. Approximately 85% (2015: 85%) of the Group’s sales are outside of the UK and a signi  cant propor � on of these sales are not 
in Sterling and therefore subject to foreign exchange. The Group also incurs opera � onal costs in both US dollars and Euros. The Group manages its 
transac � onal currency exposures centrally by using forward currency contracts to minimise the net currency exposures. It is the Group’s policy to

The Group’s cash and loans are subject to currency risk due them being held in foreign currencies. The analysis of the net balance by currency is

Credit risk 
The Group trades only with businesses it considers creditworthy third par � es. It is the Group’ s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms 
are subject to credit veri  ca � on procedures. In addi � on, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’ s exposure 
to bad debts is not signi  cant. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
With respect to credit risk arising from  nancial assets of the Group, which comprise trade and other receivables and cash, the Group’s exposure 
to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. There are no 
signi  cant concentra � ons of credit risk within the Group.
Credit risk to  nancial ins � tu � ons is limited by restric � ng the range of counterpar � es to those with high credit ra � ngs.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its  nancial obliga � ons as they fall due. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast 
and actual cash  ows and ensuring that su ﬃ  cient commi � ed facili � es are in place to cover possible downside scenarios. 
The Group currently maintains a balance between con � nuity of funding and  exibility through the use of the revolving credit facility. The Group’s 
objec � ve is to maintain a posi � ve cash balance at a level adequate for daily opera � ons with any funds in excess of this used to make repayments 
against the revolving facility agreement.
The table below summarises the maturity pro  le of the Group’s non-deriva � ve  nancial liabili � es at 31 March 2016 and 2015 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (con nued)
Year ended 31 March 2016
31. Financial risk management objec ves and policies (con nued)
Liquidity risk (con nued)
The carrying value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is a er a deduc on for unamor sed debt issue costs of £277 ,000 (2015: £547 ,000). 
Interest payable on loans and borrowings is calculated on an undiscounted basis at borrowing rates applicable at the end of the year.
The maturity analysis for  nance leases and deriva ve  nancial liabili es are detailed in notes 21 and 22, respec vely.
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that en  es in the Group will be able to con nue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the op misa on of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s capital comprises shareholders’ funds as detailed in notes 25 and 
26 and net borrowings as detailed above and in note 21. The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close rela onships with its 
bankers who provide the majority of funds used for opera onal requirements.
As at 31 March 2016, the Company was holding 1,851,091 (2015: 351,037) shares in treasury. During the year the Group purchased 1,500,000 shares 
(2015: nil) in the Company and no treasury shares (2015: 1,595,054) were released to sa sfy LTIP awards that vested. These treasury shares are seen 
as a hedge against those shares which may be required to be transferred to sa sfy op ons under the LTIP , deferred share scheme and the Chairman’s 
and Group CEO’s Share Incen ve Plans as they vest.
The Group is required to maintain covenant ra os in respect of: leverage (de  ned as net borrowings to rolling 12 months earnings before interest, 
tax, deprecia on and amor sa on (including earnings from acquisi ons for a full 12 months on a proforma basis)) and interest cover (de  ned as net 
interest costs to earnings before interest, tax and amor sa on). Breach of these covenants would cons tute events of default under the facili es 
which might result in these payments becoming immediately repayable. The Group has met its covenant ra os for the year ended 31 March 2016 and 
forecasts indicate that the current plan can be managed within the exis ng covenant levels.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Company intends to con nue its progressive dividend policy, with an interim dividend of 1.6 pence paid during the current year and a proposed 
 nal dividend of 3.8  pence.

the signi  cance of inputs used in making measurements of fair value. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) in ac ve markets for iden  able assets or liabili es;
Level 2  inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 001

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Year ended 31 March 2016
1 .  A c c o u n ng policies
Basis of prepara on
The parent company  nancial statements of e2v technologies plc (Company) for the year ended 31 March 2016 were authorised for issue by the 
Board of Directors on 13  May 2016.  e2v technologies plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  The 
Company’s shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange.
These  nancial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Repor � ng Standard 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).  The 
amendments to FRS 101 (2014/15 Cycle) issued in July 2015 and e ﬀ ec � ve immediately have been applied.  The  nancial statements are prepared 
under the historic cost conven � on, except for the revalua � on of  nancial instruments.
In preparing these  nancial statements, the Company applies the recogni � on, measurement and disclosure requirements of Interna � onal Financial 
Repor � ng Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemp � ons has been taken.  In these  nancial statements, the Company has 
adopted FRS 101 for the  rst � me.
As permi � ed under sec � on 408 of the Act the Company has elected not to present its own pro  t and loss account for the year.  The pro  t dealt with 
in the  nancial statements of the Company are disclosed in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
In the transi � on to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabili � es are measured in compliance with FRS 101.  
An explana � on of how the transi � on to FRS 101 has a ﬀ ected the reported  nancial posi � on and  nancial performance of the Company is provided in 
note 13.
In these  nancial statements, the Company has applied the exemp � ons available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• a cash  ow statement and related notes;
• compara � ve period reconcilia � ons for share capital, tangible  xed assets and intangible assets;
• disclosures in respect of transac � ons with wholly owned subsidiaries within the ul � mate parent undertaking group;
• disclosures in respect of capital management;
• the e ﬀ ects of new but not yet e ﬀ ec � ve IFRSs;
• an addi � onal balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest compara � ve period following the retrospec � ve changes in accoun � ng policies 
and the reclassi  ca � on of items in the  nancial statements (see note  13); and
• disclosures in respect of the compensa � on of Key Management Personnel.
As the consolidated  nancial statements of e2v technologies plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemp � ons 
under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2, ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of group se � led share based payments;
• certain disclosures required by IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’ in respect of the impairment of goodwill; and
• the disclosures required by IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IFRS 13, ‘Fair Value Measurement’ regarding  nancial 
instrument disclosures have not been provided apart from those which are relevant for the  nancial instruments which are  held at fair 
value and are not either held as part of trading por � olio or deriva � ves.
The accoun � ng policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the  nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016.  
Going concern
The Directors have, at the � me of approving the  nancial statements, a reasonable expecta � on that the Company has adequate resources to 
con � nue in opera � onal existence for the foreseeable future.  Thus they con � nue to adopt the going concern basis of accoun � ng in preparing the 
 nancial statements.  Further detail is contained in the Directors’ Report.
Foreign currencies 
The presenta � on and func � onal currency of the Company is Sterling.  Transac � ons denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of 
exchange ruling on the date of the transac � on.  Monetary assets and liabili � es denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.  Currency transla � on di ﬀ erences are recognised in the pro  t and loss account. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less provision for impairment.  The carrying values of investments are reviewed for impairment 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Where the reasons for such impairment provisions no 
longer apply, they are wri � en back to the extent that they are no longer necessary. 001

Taxa on
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  Income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income 
if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.  Similarly, income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it 
relates to items that are charged or  credited directly to equity.  Otherwise income tax is recognised in the pro  t and loss account.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable pro  t for the year.  Taxable pro  t di ﬀ ers from net pro  t as reported in the pro  t and loss account 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deduc � ble in other years and it further excludes items of income or expense that 
are never taxable or deduc � ble.  The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substan � vely enacted 
by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on di ﬀ erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabili � es in the  nancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computa � on of taxable pro  t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  
Deferred tax liabili � es are generally recognised for all taxable temporary di ﬀ erences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that the taxable pro  ts will be available against which deduc � ble temporary di ﬀ erences can be u � lised.  Such assets and liabili � es are 
not recognised if the temporary di ﬀ erences arising from the ini � al recogni � on of goodwill or from the ini � al recogni � on (other than in a business 
combina � on) of other assets and liabili � es in a transac � on that a ﬀ ects neither the taxable pro  t nor the accoun � ng pro  t.
Deferred tax liabili � es are recognised for taxable temporary di ﬀ erences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Company is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary di ﬀ erence and it is probable that the temporary di ﬀ erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent it is no longer probable that su ﬃ  cient 
taxable pro  ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis and is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is 
se � led or the asset is realised.  Deferred tax assets and liabili � es are o ﬀ set when there is a legally enforceable right to set o ﬀ  current tax assets against 
current tax liabili � es and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxa � on authority and the Company intends to se � le its current tax 
assets and liabili � es on a net basis.
Pensions
The Company contributes to personal pension arrangements for its employees.  The pension cost is the amount of contribu � ons payable in the year.  
Di ﬀ erences between contribu � ons payable in the year and contribu � ons paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Company receive remunera � on in the form of share based transac � ons, whereby employees render services 
in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity se � led transac � ons).  The cost of equity se � led transac � ons with employees is measured by 
reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.  The fair value is determined using a binomial, Monte Carlo or Black-Scholes model, 
as appropriate.  Further details are given in note  28 to the consolidated  nancial statements.  In valuing equity se � led transac � ons, no account is 
taken of any ves � ng condi � ons, other than condi � ons linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market condi � ons).
The cost of equity se � led transac � ons is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
condi � ons are ful  lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully en � tled to the award (ves � ng date).  The cumula � ve 
expense recognised for equity se � led transac � ons at each repor � ng date re  ects the extent to which the ves � ng period has expired and 
management’s best es � mate of the number of awards that will ul � mately vest.
The  nancial e ﬀ ect of awards by the Company of op � ons over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the 
Company in its individual  nancial statements with the Company recording an increase in its investment in subsidiaries and a credit to equity.  
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ul � mately vest, except for awards where ves � ng is condi � onal upon a market condi � on, which are 
treated as ves � ng irrespec � ve of whether or not the market condi � on is sa � s  ed, provided that all other performance condi � ons are sa � s  ed.
Where the terms of an equity se � led award are modi  ed, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modi  ed.  In addi � on, 
an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transac � on as a result of the modi  ca � on, as measured at the date of modi ca � on.
Where an equity se � led award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancella � on, and any expense not yet recognised for the 
award is recognised immediately.  If a new award is subs � tuted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is 
granted, the cancelled and new shares are treated as if they were a modi  ca � on of the original award.
Dividend income
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised at the point the dividend has been declared.  Dividends declared a � er the balance sheet 
date are not recognised in the pro  t and loss account. 001

 1 . A c c o u n ng policies (con nued)
Financial liabili es and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classi  ed as either  nancial liabili � es or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the en � ty a � er deduc � ng its liabili � es.  Equity instruments 
issued by the Company are recognised as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
A  nancial liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is se � led, sold, cancelled or expires.  Where an exis � ng  nancial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substan � ally di ﬀ erent terms, or the terms of an exis � ng liability are substan � ally modi  ed, 
such an exchange or modi  ca � on is treated as a derecogni � on of the original liability and the recogni � on of a new liability.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  A � er ini � al recogni � on, interest-bearing bank loans are 
subsequently measured at amor � sed cost using the e ﬀ ec � ve interest method.
Dividend distribu on
Dividends to holders of equity instruments declared a � er the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability as at the balance sheet date.  Final 
dividend distribu � ons to the Company’s shareholders are recognised in the  nancial statements in the period in which they are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.  Interim dividends are recognised when paid. 
Own shares
Shares in e2v technologies plc held by the Company or the Employee Bene  t Trust (EBT) are stated at cost and are presented in the balance sheet as a 
deduc � on from equity.

1 April 2020.  UK deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2016 have been calculated based on the reduced corpora � on tax rates of 20%, 19% and 18%,

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the  nancial statements is unmodi  ed 
We have audited the  nancial statements of e2v technologies plc for the year ended 31 March 2016 set out on pages  67 to  114.  In 
our opinion:  
• the  nancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the  Group’s and of the parent company’s a ﬀ airs as at 31 March 
2016 and of the Group’s and the parent company’s  pro  t for the year then ended;  
• the Group  nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Interna � onal Financial Repor � ng Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;  
• the parent company  nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accoun � ng Standards, including FRS 
101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
• the  nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the 
Group  nancial statements, Ar � cle 4 of the IAS Regula � on.  
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the  nancial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest e ﬀ ect 
on our audit , in decreasing order of audit signi  cance, are outlined below. These risks are consistent with the prior year except for 
business combina � ons where SP devices was acquired in the current year and Ana Focus in the prior year. Our assessment of the 
change in the audit signi  cance of the risks below compared with the equivalent risks in the prior year has not signi  cantly changed 
and is indicated by the use of arrows ( ). 
Recogni on of revenues, pro  ts and losses on long term contracts (£ 56.1 million of revenue
(2015: £53.8 million of revenue)) Risk vs 2015  
Refer to pages  41 and  42 (Audit Commi � ee Report), pages  76 and  77 (Summary of signi  cant accoun � ng policies), page   78 (Cri � cal 
accoun � ng judgements and key sources of es � ma � on uncertainty) and page  79 (note  3 to the consolidated  nancial statements). 
The risk – Approximately a  quarter of the Group’s revenues are derived from long-term contracts, which typically involve design, 
development or produc � on ac � vi � es, or a combina � on of these. These contracts usually involve technical and commercial risks 
and o � en specify physical performance  measures to be achieved throughout the contract period. Es � mates and assump � ons are 
required to (i) assess the propor � on of revenue to recognise based on comple � on of the physical propor � on of total contract 
work and (ii) forecast the margin on each contract and in par � cular to make allowance for technical and commercial risks related 
to physical performance  measures yet to be achieved. There are a number of contracts which are onerous and in these cases the 
assessment of forecast margin is more cri � cal as the expected loss is recognised in full. 
Our response – Our audit procedures included,  cri � cal assessment, challenge and tes � ng of the processes used to manage the 
 nancial aspects of the Group’s long-term contracts. For signi  cant contracts, determined on the basis of technical and commercial 
complexity and pro  tability, we: 
• obtained an understanding of the status of the contract through discussions with project teams, senior management and the 
Directors, a � endance at contract review mee � ngs and examina � on of  contractual and management documenta � on related to the 
contract; and 
• challenged the key es � mates and assump � ons applied by considering (i) how the key risks and uncertain � es are re  ected in the 
assessment of forecast margin and whether the es � mates and assump � ons are consistent with past experience and (ii) how the 
se �  ng and achievement of performance  measures re  ects the contract terms and the revenue recognised.
Carrying value of goodwill (£ 8 8.2 million (2015: £73.2 million)) Risk vs 2015  Refer to pages  41 and  42 (Audit Commi � ee Report), page  73 (Summary of signi  cant accoun � ng policies), page  78 (Cri � cal accoun � ng 
judgements and key sources of es � ma � on uncertainty) and page  90 (note  16 to the consolidated  nancial statements). 
The risk – There is a risk of irrecoverability of intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisi � ons, in par � cular goodwill. Due 
to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecas � ng and discoun � ng future cash  ows, which are the basis of the assessment of 
recoverability, this is one of the key judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on.

Independent Auditor’s report to the members of 
e2v technologies plc only (con � nued)
Our response – Our audit procedures included  tes � ng of the Group’s forecas � ng procedures upon which the cash  ow forecasts 
are based and the principles and integrity of the Group’s discounted cash  ow model. We compared the Group’s assump � ons to 
externally derived data as well as our own assessments in rela � on to key inputs such as projected sales growth, opera � ng costs and 
discount rates and challenged management where there were material di ﬀ erences. We also cri � cally assessed the Group’s sensi � vity 
analysis and considered whether it re  ects a reasonably possible change in key assump � ons by comparing the inputs and outputs to 
our own sensi � vity analysis. We compared the sum of the discounted cash  ows to the Group’s market capitalisa � on to assess the 
reasonableness of those cash  ows. We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensi � vity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to reasonably possible changes in key assump � ons re  ected the risks inherent in the valua � on of goodwill.
 Carrying value of inventory (£ 54.7 million (2015: £44.0 million)), including a write-down of £ 2.3 million in 
the year (2015: £2.9 million)  Risk vs 2015
Refer to pages  41 and  42 (Audit Commi � ee Report), page  74 (Summary of signi  cant accoun � ng policies), page  78 (Cri � cal accoun � ng 
judgements and key sources of es � ma � on uncertainty) and page  91 (note  17 to the consolidated  nancial statements). 
The risk – The Group’s ac � vi � es include its obsolescence management business which purchases inventory at the end of its 
produc � on life. In addi � on the closure of the fabrica � on plant in Grenoble in 2011 resulted in signi  cant inventory build-up to ful  l 
future requirements (“last � me build” programmes). The inventory associated with these ac � vi � es, which represents up to quarter of 
the recognised write-downs, is intended to be sold over a period of several years. The u � lisa � on and carrying value of this inventory 
therefore depends upon future sales forecasts which are inherently uncertain. 
Our response – Our audit procedures included  cri � cally assessing the Group’s method for determining net realisable value and 
whether this appropriately re  ected future sales forecasts, the past experience of the Group and other speci  c circumstances 
associated with the inventory.  
Business combina ons (goodwill addi ons of £ 10.2 million, other intangible addi ons of £ 2.1 million) Risk 
related to business combina on accoun ng for SP devices acquisi on replaces Ana Focus acquisi on 
Refer to pages  41 and  42 (Audit Commi � ee Report), page  73 (Summary of signi  cant accoun � ng policies), page  78 (Cri � cal accoun � ng 
judgements and key sources of es � ma � on uncertainty) and pages  86  and  87 (note  13 to the consolidated  nancial statements). 
The risk – The Group acquired SP Devices during the current  nancial year. The acquired intangible assets of technology and 
customer rela � onships are valued using discounted cash  ows methods. In applying these methodologies, the Group makes a 
number of key assump � ons and es � mates rela � ng to each class of intangible asset, including; growth and a � ri � on rates, discount 
rates and product life cycles. The iden �  ca � on and valua � on of acquired intangibles requires judgement and is sensi � ve to the 
assump � ons used. Amounts not allocated to acquired assets which include s acquired intangible assets recorded as  goodwill. 
Goodwill is not amor � sed and a ﬀ ects the income statement only on a future impairment. The determina � on of the fair value of the 
considera � on is dependent on contractual clauses which may be based on the outcome of future events.
Our response – Our audit procedures included  an assessment of the competency of the external experts used by the Group to value 
signi  cant acquired intangibles. We challenged and corroborated, using our experience, market data and informa � on from similar 
transac � ons , the process for iden � fying intangible assets. We considered the methodology and assump � ons used to determine the 
present value of cash  ow projec � ons. We inspected the documenta � on surrounding the acquisi � on to ensure the considera � on 
paid and con � ngent considera � on payable has been recognised in accordance with relevant accoun � ng standards. We also assess 
whether the Group’s disclosures about the business combina � ons are appropriate and in accordance with relevant accoun � ng 
standards
3 Our applica on of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group  nancial statements as a whole was set at £1,600,000. This has been determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group pro  t before taxa � on,  normalised to exclude the vola � lity in reported pro  t due to gains and losses 
on revalua � on of foreign currency deriva � ve  nancial instruments  in the year  resul � ng in  a benchmark of £37,227,000 (2015: 
£36,091,000 which also excluded the impact of net expenses of business improvement programme included as speci  c items). This 
materiality represents 43% (2015: 5.5%) of this benchmark and 3.9% (2015: 6.7%) of total reported pro  t before tax.   
We report to the Audit Commi � ee any corrected and uncorrected misstatements exceeding £80,000  (2015: £100,000) in addi � on to 
other iden �  ed misstatements that warranted repor � ng on qualita � ve grounds.

Shareholder Informa on Str a t egic R e port Governance Financials
Of the Group’s 18 (2015: 17) repor ng components, consistent with 2015 we subjected 9 to audits for group repor ng purposes 
(being in the United Kingdom (4 key repor ng components), France (3) and Spain (1). In addi on, speci  c risk-focussed audit 
procedures were performed by the Group audit team on a separate en  es in the US (consistent with 2015) and Hong Kong (speci  c 
risk-focussed audit procedures performed for the  rst  me in 2016). The la er were not individually  nancially signi  cant enough 
to require an audit for group repor ng purposes, but did present speci  c individual risks that needed to be addressed. For the 
remaining components we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no 
signi  cant risks of material misstatement within these.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results:
  Group Group
 Number of Revenue pro  t before Group Total
 components  (%) tax  (%) Assets (%)
Audits for Group repor ng purposes 8 52 92 87
Speci  c risk-focused audit procedures 3 48 6 12
Total 11 100% 98% 99%
Total 2015 10 100% 98% 100%
 The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the signi  cant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the informa on to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materiality levels set, which ranged 
from  £1,583,000 (2015: £1,690,000) to  £19,145 (2015: £12,000) having regard to the mix of size and risk pro  le of the Group across 
the components. 
The work on 8 of the  11 components was performed by component auditors and the rest by the Group audit team including the 
speci  c risk-focussed procedures performed for the  rst  me in 2016. The Group audit team performed procedures on the items 
excluded from normalised Group pro  t before tax. The Group audit team visited the United Kingdom and Spain. Telephone mee ngs 
were also held with the auditors in the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Spain. At these visits and mee ngs, the 
 ndings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail and any further work required by the Group team was then 
performed by the component auditor.
 4 Our opinion on other ma ers prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodi  ed
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remunera on Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the informa on given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the  nancial year for which the  nancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the  nancial statements.
 5  We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw a en on to in rela on to: 
• the directors’ viability statement   on page    30  concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the  Directors’ 
assessment and expecta ons of the Group’s con nuing in opera on over the  3 years to  31 March 2019; or 
• the disclosures in note  1 of the  nancial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accoun ng. 
6  We have nothing to report in respect of the ma ers on which we are required to report by 
excep on  
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
iden  ed other informa on in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the  nancial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In par cular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have iden  ed material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the  Directors’ statement 
that they consider that the annual report and  nancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the informa on necessary for shareholders to assess the  Group’s posi on and performance, business model and strategy; 
or
• the Audit Commi ee Report does not appropriately address ma ers communicated by us to the audit commi ee. 001

Notes
1.  A member en � tled to a � end and vote at the above mee � ng is en � tled to appoint a proxy to a � end and to speak and vote instead of him/her. A 
proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in rela � on to a mee � ng, provided that each proxy is 
appointed to exercise the rights a � ached to a di ﬀ erent share or shares held by that member.
2.  A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy direc � ons accompanies this no � ce. If you do not receive a proxy 
form and believe that you should have received one, or if you require addi � onal proxy forms in order to appoint more than one proxy, please 
contact Equini �  on the telephone number(s) given in note 16 below.
3.  To be valid, a form of proxy and, if applicable, any power of a � orney or other authority under which it is signed, or a notarially cer �  ed copy of 
such power or authority, must be received by Equini � , Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA by 9:00 a.m. on Monday 
11 July 2016.
4.  Members returning a form of proxy or a CREST Proxy Instruc � on (as described in paragraph 15 below) will also be able to a � end the mee � ng 
and vote in person should they wish to do so. If a member has appointed a proxy and a � ends the Annual General Mee � ng in person, the proxy 
appointment will automa � cally be terminated.
5.  Any person to whom this no � ce is sent who is a person nominated under sec � on 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy informa � on rights 
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him or her and the member by whom he or she was nominated, have a right 
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Mee � ng. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he or she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instruc � ons to the member as 
to the exercise of vo � ng rights.
6.  The statement of the rights of members in rela � on to the appointment of proxies in notes 1, 2 and 3 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in those notes can only be exercised by members of the Company.
7.  For the purposes of determining who is en � tled to a � end and vote (whether on a poll or otherwise) at the mee � ng, a person must be entered 
on the register of members by 6.00 p.m. on 11 July 2016 (or, in the event of any adjournment, by 6:00 p.m. on the date which is two days before 
the date of the adjourned mee � ng) and shall be able to vote only on those Ordinary Shares registered in that person’s name at that � me. 
Any changes to entries made a � er the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to a � end or vote at the 
mee � ng.
8.  As at 13 May 2016, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 218,382,156 Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares). Each Ordinary Share 
carries the right to vote on a poll at a general mee � ng of the Company and, therefore, the total vo � ng rights in the Company as at that date 
were 218,382,156. As at 13 May 2016, the Company held 1,851,091 Ordinary Shares as treasury shares.
9 .  A ny c o r p o r a � on which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representa � ves who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a 
member, provided that they do not do so in rela � on to the same shares.
1 0 .  Un d e r s e c � on 527 of the Companies Act 2006, members mee � ng the threshold requirements set out in that sec � on have the right to require 
the Company to publish on a website a statement se �  ng out any ma � er rela � ng to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the 
auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Mee � ng; or (ii) any circumstance connected with 
an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold o ﬃ  ce since the previous mee � ng at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance 
with sec � on 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the members reques � ng any such website publica � on to pay its 
expenses in complying with sec � ons 527 or 528 Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under 
sec � on 527 Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor no later than the � me when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Mee � ng includes any statement that the Company has 
been required under sec � on 527 Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
11.  A copy of this no � ce, and other informa � on required by sec � on 311A Companies Act 2006, can be found on the Company’s website at www.e2v.com.
12.  Any member a � ending the mee � ng has the right to ask ques � ons. The Company must cause to be answered any such ques � on rela � ng to the 
business being dealt with at the mee � ng but no such answer need be given if (i) to do so would interfere unduly with the prepara � on for the 
mee � ng or involve the disclosure of con  den � al informa � on, (ii) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a 
ques � on, or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the mee � ng that the ques � on be answered.
13.  There will be available for inspec � on at the Company’s registered o ﬃ  ce (106 Waterhouse Lane, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 2QU) during normal

15.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a vo � ng service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or vo � ng service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate 
ac � on on their behalf. 001

No � ce of Annual General Mee � ng (AGM) (con � nued)
  In order for a CREST proxy appointment or instruc � on made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruc � on”) must be properly authen � cated in compliance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s speci  ca � ons and must contain the necessary 
informa � on, as described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). The message, regardless of whether it cons � tutes the 
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruc � on given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmi � ed 
so as to be received by Equini �  (ID RA19) no later than 9:00 a.m. on Monday 11 July 2016. For this purpose, the � me of receipt will be taken to 
be the � me (as determined by the � mestamp applied to the message by CREST Applica � ons Host) from which Equini �  is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner required by CREST. A � er that � me any change of instruc � ons to proxies appointed through CREST 
should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or vo � ng service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does 
not make available special procedures in CREST for any par � cular messages. Normal system � mings and limita � ons will, therefore, apply in 
rela � on to the input of CREST Proxy Instruc � ons. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a 
CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a vo � ng service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or vo � ng service 
provider(s) take(s)) such ac � on as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmi � ed by means of the CREST system by any par � cular 
� me. In this connec � on, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or vo � ng service providers are referred, in par � cular, to 
those sec � ons of the CREST Manual concerning prac � cal limita � ons of the CREST system and � mings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruc � on in the circumstances set out in Regula � on 35(5)(a) Uncer �  cated Securi � es 
Regula � ons 2001.
16.  If you have any ques � ons rela � ng to this no � ce of Annual General Mee � ng or the comple � on and return of the form of proxy, you can 
contact Equini � ’s helpline on 0371 384 2689. Lines are open 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Monday to Friday. Callers from outside the UK should dial 
+44 (0)121 415 7047.
17.   Under sec � on 338 and sec � on 338A of the Act, members mee � ng the threshold requirements in those sec � ons have the right to require 
the Company (i) to give, to members of the Company en � tled to receive no � ce of the mee � ng, no � ce of a resolu � on which may properly be 
moved and is intended to be moved at the mee � ng and / or (ii) to include in the business to be dealt with at the mee � ng any ma � er (other 
than a proposed resolu � on) which may be properly included in the business. A resolu � on may properly be moved, or a ma � er may properly be 
included in the business, unless (a) (in the case of a resolu � on only) it would, if passed, be ine ﬀ ec � ve (whether by reason of inconsistency with 
any enactment or the Company’s cons � tu � on or otherwise), (b) it is defamatory of any person or (c) it is frivolous or vexa � ous, Such a request 
may be in hard copy or in electronic form, must iden � fy the resolu � on of which no � ce is to be given or the ma � er to be included in the business,

The Companies Act 2006 requires listed companies to put a resolu � on to shareholders at each Annual General Mee � ng to approve

Annual Report. The vote is advisory in nature.

further maximum nominal amount of £3,636,062 (represen � ng approximately a further 33.3% of the nominal value of the ordinary

e2v technologies plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2016          
Financials Governance Str a t egic R e port Shareholder Informa � on
issue. As at 13 May 2016, the Company held 1,851,091 ordinary shares as treasury shares, represen � ng approximately 0.85% of the 
ordinary shares in issue on that date (excluding treasury shares). This authority complies with ins � tu � onal investor guidelines.
The authority conferred by the resolu � on will expire on 13 October 2017 or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s Annual General 
Mee � ng (unless previously revoked, varied or renewed). 
The Directors have no present plans to allot unissued shares, other than on the exercise of share op � ons under the Company’s 
employee share op � on schemes. However, the Directors believe it to be in the best interests of the Company that they should 
con � nue to have this authority so that such allotments can take place to  nance appropriate business opportuni � es that may arise. 
Special Resolu ons
Resolu on 14 – to disapply pre-emp on rights
Unless they are given an appropriate authority by shareholders, if the Directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares for cash or 
grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than pursuant to an employee share scheme) they must  rst o ﬀ er them 
to exis � ng shareholders in propor � on to exis � ng holdings. These are known as pre-emp � on rights.
The exis � ng disapplica � on of these statutory pre-emp � on rights, which was granted at the Annual General Mee � ng held on 15 July 2015 
will expire at the end of this year’s Annual General Mee � ng. Accordingly, resolu � on 14 in the no � ce of Annual General Mee � ng will be 
proposed, as a special resolu � on, to give the Directors power to allot shares without the applica � on of these statutory pre-emp � on 
rights:  rst, in rela � on to o ﬀ ers of equity securi � es by way of rights issue, open o ﬀ er or similar arrangements (save that in the case of 
an allotment pursuant to the authority conferred by paragraph 13.2 of resolu � on 13, such o ﬀ er shall be by way of rights issue only); 
and second, in rela � on to the allotment of equity securi � es for cash up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount of £1,091,910 
(represen � ng approximately 10% of the nominal value of the ordinary shares in issue on 13 May 2016 (excluding treasury shares)). 
These limits are in accordance with guidelines issued by the Pre-emp � on Group and the Investment Management Associa � on.
The Directors intend to adhere to the provisions in the Pre-Emp � on Group’s Statement of Principles, as updated in March 2015, and 
not to allot shares for cash on a non pre-emp � ve basis pursuant to the authority in resolu � on 13:
(i) in excess of an amount equal to 5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares; or
(ii)  in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares within a 
rolling three-year period, without prior consulta � on with shareholders,
  in each case other than in connec � on with an acquisi � on or speci  ed capital investment which is announced contemporaneously 
with the allotment or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.
The authority sought, and the limits set, by this resolu � on will also apply to a sale by the Company of any shares it holds as treasury 
shares. The Companies Act 2006 permits shares purchased by the Company out of distributable pro  ts to be held as treasury shares, 
which may then be cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obliga � ons under its employee share-based incen � ve 
schemes.
The powers conferred by this resolu � on will expire on 13 October 2017 or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s Annual General 
Mee � ng. However, the Company may make an o ﬀ er or agreement prior to the expiry of this power which would or might require 
equity securi � es to be allocated a � er the expiry of this power as if statutory pre-emp � on rights did not apply to such allotments. 
In this case, Directors will be permi � ed to allot such securi � es pursuant to such o ﬀ er or agreement as if this power had not expired.
Resolu on 15 – Company’s authority to purchase its own shares
At the Annual General Mee � ng of the Company held on 15 July 2015, the Company was authorised to make market purchases of 
up to 21,890,853 of its own ordinary shares. In the period from the Annual General Mee � ng on 15 July 2015 to 13 May 2016, the 
Company purchased 1,500,000 ordinary shares under this authority. As at 13 May 2016 such authority remained outstanding in 
rela � on to 20,390,853 ordinary shares. 
Resolu � on 15 in the no � ce of Annual General Mee � ng, which will be proposed as a special resolu � on, will authorise the Company to 
make market purchases of up to 21,838,215 ordinary shares. This equals 10% of the Company’s ordinary shares in issue on 13 May 2016 
(excluding treasury shares). The maximum price that may be paid shall be the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the middle market 
quota � ons for an ordinary share for the  ve business days immediately before the day on which the purchase is made and (ii) the higher 
of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is 
carried out or otherwise in accordance with Ar � cle 3(2) of the Commission Delegated Regula � on (EU) of 08.03.2016 supplemen � ng 
Regula � on (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the 
condi � ons applicable to buy-back programmes and stabilisa � on measures. The minimum price which may be paid for each ordinary 
share shall be 5 pence (excluding of all expenses).
The authority conferred by this resolu � on will expire on 13 October 2017 or, if sooner, at the end of next year’s Annual General 
Mee � ng. 001

Explana � on of AGM Business (con � nued)
Your Directors are commi � ed to managing the Company’s capital e ﬀ ec � vely. The Directors may, amongst other things, make such 
purchases as required in support of share awards, and buying back the Company’s ordinary shares is one of the op � ons they keep 
under review for this. Purchases would only be made where the Directors consider that such purchases would be in the best interests 
of the shareholders generally and a � er having considering the e ﬀ ect on earnings per share.
The Company may hold in treasury any of its own shares that it purchases in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
the authority conferred by this resolu � on. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost 
e ﬀ ec � vely and would provide the Company with greater  exibility in the management of its capital base. Shares held in treasury may 
subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash, or transferred for the purposes of, or pursuant to, employee share schemes. Once held in 
treasury, the Company is not en � tled to exercise any rights, including the right to a � end and vote at mee � ngs, in respect of such 
shares. Further, no dividend or other distribu � on of the Company’s assets may be made to the Company in respect of the shares held 
in treasury. 
As at 13 May 2016, there were op � ons outstanding over 7,020,278 ordinary shares which, if exercised at that date, would have 
represented 3.2% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital, excluding treasury shares. If the authority given by resolu � on 15 
were to be fully used, these would then represent 3.6% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 
Resolu on 16 – no ce of general mee ngs
The Companies Act 2006 requires a no � ce period of 21 days for general mee � ngs of the Company unless shareholders approve a 
shorter no � ce period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days. Annual General Mee � ngs will con � nue to be held on at least 21 clear 
days’ no � ce.
The shorter no � ce period would not be used as a ma � er of rou � ne for such mee � ngs, but only where the  exibility is merited by the 
business of the mee � ng and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole. 
The approval will be e ﬀ ec � ve un � l the Company’s next Annual General Mee � ng, when it is intended that a similar resolu � on will be 
proposed. 
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to call a general mee � ng on less than 21 clear days’ 
no � ce, the Company must make a means of electronic vo � ng available to all shareholders for that mee � ng.
Vo ng recommenda on
The Directors believe that the resolu � ons which are to be proposed at the Annual General Mee � ng are in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders as a whole and recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of them, as each of the Directors intend 
to do in respect of his or her own bene  cial holding. 001

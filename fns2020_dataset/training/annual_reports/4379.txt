• Basic adjusted EPS*** has reduced by 2.6% from 13.52 pence to 13.17 pence
mainly as a result of increased finance charges

*
adjusted EBITDA is operating loss from continuing operations before amortisation,
depreciation, net exceptional operating costs and share-based payment (credits)/costs.

Chairman’s statement
OVERVIEW
Daisy Group plc (“Daisy Group” or “the Group”) has
continued to develop over this year to be an industry-
leading provider of unified communications to the 
SME and mid-market business sector in the UK.
Once again, we have made solid progress and I thank our
employees for their contribution, continued hard work and
commitment. This past year, the Group has continued to
focus on operational efficiency as well as the integration
of previously-acquired businesses. Revenue has grown by
0.8%, from £348.6 million to £351.5 million and adjusted
EBITDA has been maintained at £56.3 million. Operating
losses calculated after charging amortisation of intangible
assets, depreciation, exceptional items and taking into
account share-based payment (credits)/costs have
increased to £16.8 million from £13.1 million principally
due to the increase in charges for amortisation of
intangible assets to £66.2 million (2012: £61.9 million).
Basic loss per share has increased from 3.46 pence to
6.38 pence and basic adjusted earnings per share have
reduced by 2.6% from 13.52 pence to 13.17 pence due to
increased finance charges in the year.
Of particular note has been the significant increase in
cash generation in the year with cash generated from
operations of £47.6 million (2012: £29.1 million) and free
cash flow of £38.6 million (2012: £28.6 million),
demonstrating the strong cash flow characteristics of
our business model.
ACQUISITIONS
During the year the Group acquired Worldwide Group
Holdings Limited (“WWG”) and The Net Crowd Limited
(“TNC”). These acquisitions increase our capabilities
and the range of products we can offer to customers as
we continue to reduce the proportion of legacy fixed line
services within the business. A total of £31.5 million in
cash has been committed on the two acquisitions
completed during the year.
Since the year end we have announced the acquisition
of Daisy Data Centre Solutions Limited (“DDCS”), which
had acquired the data centre assets and customer
relationships from the administrator of 2e2, for a
consideration of £7.5 million. This acquisition will
provide further scale and capability in the growing
areas of cloud and managed services and we look
forward to reporting on progress in the future.
FUNDING
We were very pleased to announce on 26 March 2013
that the Group had signed a new banking agreement
with a group of six banks which expires on 30 June 2016,
reflecting the confidence of the banks in our business
model. This makes available a £50.0 million term loan
and a £150.0 million revolving credit facility for the
Group, providing significant resources for future
acquisitions. These combined facilities of £200.0 million
replace the Group’s previous facilities of £140.0 million.
OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s strategic acquisition programme, executed
over the past four years, has provided additional product
capability and reduced the dependence on fixed line
network services.
We continue to make operational improvements as we
integrate businesses acquired and invest in development
of our proprietary software platform to provide greater
business efficiency and benefits to customers. We will
continue to invest internally in addition to implementing
further acquisitions where we see strategic opportunities
to enhance value for our shareholders. D Di ir re ec ct to or rs s  a an nd d  g go ov ve er rn na an nc ce e O Ov ve er rv vi ie ew w C Co on nt te en nt ts s F Fu ur rt th he er r  i in nf fo or rm ma at ti io on n F Fi in na an nc ci ia al ls s

BOARD CHANGES
As previously announced, following almost three years
with the Group, Gareth Kirkwood stepped down from
the board with effect from 12 April 2012. Gareth left the
Group on 30 April 2012 to pursue other interests and
the board would like to thank Gareth for his
contribution and professionalism as Chief Operating
Officer of Daisy Group plc and wish him every success
in his future ventures.
DIVIDEND
In April we announced our intention to implement a
dividend policy and I am pleased to confirm that the
board is proposing a full-year dividend of 4.0p per
share. We also announced that we expected this
dividend to grow at a rate of 15% per annum for the
next two financial years. Subject to shareholder
approval at our Annual General Meeting on
17 September 2013, the final dividend will be payable
on 11 October 2013 to shareholders registered at the
close of business on 20 September 2013.
OUTLOOK
We believe that our strategy has created a strong base
from which we can continue to develop and we look
forward with confidence to delivering long-term value for
our shareholders. Whilst we remain mindful of current
macroeconomic headwinds, we look forward to the
coming year with cautious optimism.

Chief Executive’s review
OVERVIEW
Our performance this year has been robust and we have
continued to deliver on our strategy towards being the
provider of choice of unified communications to the UK
SME and mid-market sector. 
2013 2012
Group £m £m
Revenue 351.5 348.6
Gross profit 129.7 132.9
Gross margin % 36.9% 38.1%
Adjusted EBITDA 56.3 56.3
Adjusted EBITDA % 16.0% 16.2%
Operating loss (16.8) (13.1)
Cash generated from operations 47.6 29.1
Free cash flow 38.6 28.6
Revenue has grown with the contribution from
acquisitions offsetting the well understood market trends
of reducing fixed line revenues and the impact of
regulation on mobile tariffs.
This year our product portfolio has been enhanced and
we have continued to reduce our reliance on our
traditional voice business. New acquisitions have brought
further strengths in networks and systems, whilst our
data business has been reinvigorated by direct
investment in new data centre facilities.
I am pleased to highlight the significant level of cash
generation as we have now managed our way through the
working capital headwinds seen in the previous year.
The Group has delivered a solid performance this year in
a difficult economic climate. I would like to thank our
employees across the Group for the effort and
commitment that has made this possible.
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our primary market is the SME and mid-market
business sector within the UK and our aim is to 
develop the business through a strategy of organic 
and acquisitive growth.
The acquisitions completed during the year are set

On 16 April 2012 we completed the acquisition of the
entire issued share capital of WWG, a market-leader in
audio-conferencing and call-handling services. Based in
Peterborough, the business supplies services to a
number of the world’s largest audio-conferencing
companies and, though UK-based, routes inbound calls
from multiple foreign territories. WWG forms part of the
Daisy Retail division.
On 31 January 2013 we acquired the entire issued share
capital of TNC. TNC is an IT data specialist that provides
‘white-label’ professional services, maintenance and
installations to the UK channel. The business works with
vendors including Cisco, Juniper Networks, HP and
Microsoft to provide complex and specialist IT services,
delivered through its highly qualified in-house
engineering force. The Berkshire-based company has
experienced rapid organic growth since its establishment
in 2009 and its customer base is serviced by a UK-wide
team of field engineers and information and
communication technology consultants, supported by a
UK service desk. TNC now forms part of the Daisy
Wholesale division. Overview

DIVISIONAL REPORTING continued
Daisy Retail continued
Due to the change in mix of business, networks margin
has reduced to 40.4% (2012: 44.5%). This is as a result
of the effect of the high volume of inbound call
conferencing from WWG, which generates gross margin
of 23.5%. The underlying gross margin from fixed lines
and calls has been maintained through improved
commercial terms and pricing arbitrage in respect of
lower-cost voice traffic for mobile-terminated calls. 
In line with our expectations the volume of traditional
fixed line calls continued to decline. These legacy
products have diminishing significance as we diversify
our product range and increasingly provide new
technologies and mobile and data-led solutions to our
customers. Nonetheless, we are working hard to ensure
margins are maintained via continued enhancement
activity such as consolidation of supply, improved
volume discounts and product bundling to provide
improved customer value.
Our data revenue has reduced as some customers have
been switching into improved lower-cost products, but
we have been able to improve gross margin to 41.1%
(2012: 40.6%) through rationalisation of the supplier
base and by moving more data connections to our own
Daisy Wholesale division.
Investment in our existing owned data centres has
increased available capacity and improved our facilities,
with our current hosting capacity at approximately 66%
(2012: 70%) utilisation. This capacity provides a
significant opportunity for further growth in this market. 
The gross margin in systems has reduced to 59.2%
(2012: 65.4%) due mainly to the higher proportion of
SME sales versus sales of larger, mid-market systems.
The gross margin in mobile has reduced to 35.9% (2012:
37.8%) primarily through greater investment in smart
devices in line with customer demand. Our scale and
capability make us a key partner for the mobile
networks and this has allowed us to improve our
commercial arrangements as a consequence. Looking
forward, we are well positioned to take advantage of the
continued move to voice and data convergence on smart
devices, including both handsets and tablets.
Our success in Daisy Retail is driven by our ability to
increase the number of products and services taken by
our customer base, retention of the base through
excellent customer service and our ability to drive
further efficiencies and improvements in our processes.
Below is an analysis of the percentage split of the average
number of products per customer for the directly-owned
base within Daisy Retail. Products are defined as calls,
lines, inbound telephony services, mobile, internet
services, hosted solutions and maintenance:

Products per customer 1.85 1.80
The number of products per customer has increased as
the division focuses on cross-selling and increasing
product penetration. The number of customers now
taking at least three products has increased to 24%
(2012: 22%).
Efficient administrative functions are also important and
I am pleased to report that at 31 March 2013 the Retail
customer base enjoyed direct debit penetration of 77%
(2012: 75%) and e-billing penetration of 54% (2012: 53%).

Daisy Wholesale
Daisy Wholesale provides communications services to
smaller telecoms resellers. These resellers comprise
small to medium Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”),
telecoms networks and resellers and IT service
providers. These supply arrangements exist as a result
of the Group’s ability to obtain better pricing from
network carriers and ISPs, combined with the provision
of user-friendly portals, which facilitate efficient
provisioning for the resellers.
Products offered by Daisy Wholesale comprise:
Networks
Fixed line calls, fixed line rentals, inbound telephony
services, select services and managed billing
Data
IP VPN, broadband, ethernet and hosting
Systems
Maintenance, engineering and equipment

Daisy Wholesale continued 
Our Wholesale data business (principally aggregated
broadband services) continues to enjoy higher gross
margins than those traditionally seen in networks. 
The post-acquisition results of TNC have been included
within systems.
The main area of growth during the year has been in
mobile services which were first introduced to this
customer base during 2012. This growth, together with
some operating cost efficiencies, has seen a significant
improvement in adjusted EBITDA to £3.9 million (2012:
£2.7 million). We anticipate further progression during
the next financial year as we see the full-year benefit of
these improvements.
Daisy Distribution
Daisy Distribution provides a full range of mobile handsets
and airtime tariffs from O2, Vodafone, Orange and 
T-Mobile via a dealer network. A summary of the division’s

The division has rolling, three-year agreements in 
place with the mobile networks on market-leading 
commercial terms.
This year the division has been impacted by the reduced
level of mid-term contract renewal incentives, provided
by certain of the mobile operators, which has had a
significant impact on revenue. The consequence of a
lower level of renewals is that our dealers have earned
less commission and hence the revenue shortfall was
partly offset by an improved gross margin.
There are indications that we can begin to re-initiate
mid-term contract renewals which positions Daisy
Distribution well for the new financial year.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER GROWTH
We have a highly skilled executive team capable of
building on the Group’s position as the main
consolidator and the leading independent provider of
unified communications to the SME and mid-market
business segment. We will continue to evaluate and
execute acquisitions that help build strategic advantage
and where we can see value for our shareholders.
We have invested £2.1 million in software development
this year (2012: £2.2 million). This investment has
ensured that we have the required customer
relationship management and billing systems that will
enable us to service a growing customer base taking
multiple products, over the medium term. In addition,
we have enhanced our network infrastructure and data
centres in preparation for future growth. A total of 
£3.1 million has been spent on property, plant and
equipment (2012: £2.5 million), with the bulk of this
expenditure relating to new network infrastructure
equipment at our various locations.
During the year we also signed a 15-year agreement for
a state-of-the-art data centre facility. This provides
500kW of IT load at the brand new Virtus LON1 data
centre primarily for hosting our customers’ business
critical IT platforms.
Our investment in DDCS since the year end further
improves our infrastructure and capabilities and we are
well-positioned for growth.
During the year the Group was selected as one of 14
organisations to deliver communication services within
the government’s Public Services Network (“PSN”)
services framework. The PSN framework is a ‘network
of networks’ that enables the delivery of public services
from any location by any provider across central
government departments, non-departmental public
bodies, the NHS, local authorities and voluntary sector
charities. These services include traditional and IP
based voice services, internet services, hosting, co-
location, audio-conferencing and system maintenance.
We were pleased to announce in December 2012 that, in
collaboration with its joint venture partner Updata
Infrastucture (UK) Limited, the Group had been awarded
a long-term contract for ten years to manage and
develop the IT network infrastructure and associated
services of one of the largest local authorities in the UK,
Essex County Council.
The new financial year will bring further business
process improvement activity and we will ensure that
we invest sufficient funds to manage the change,
ensuring our IT systems and network infrastructure 
will facilitate further growth.
SUMMARY
The last 12 months have seen Daisy Group make good
progress on both organic and acquisitive growth,
reinforcing the Group’s position in the market place.
We have in place the platform, the systems, the people
and the product set to allow us to grow both organically
and via strategic acquisitions.
Against a difficult economic backdrop, we believe we are
well positioned to make further progress towards our
aim of being the unified communications provider of
choice to the SME and mid-market sectors.

Overview
Financial review
The trading results of the Group for the year ended
31 March 2013, comprising the trading results of the
three operating divisions, Daisy Retail, Daisy
Wholesale and Daisy Distribution, together with
central costs, have been included within 
continuing operations.
ACQUISITIONS
Acquisition of Worldwide Group Holdings Limited
(“WWG”)
On 16 April 2012 the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of WWG for an initial cash
consideration of £28.5 million. 
Pre-acquisition full-year revenue and adjusted
EBITDA were £36.0 million and £5.6 million
respectively. In the year WWG contributed revenue
and adjusted EBITDA of £41.4 million and £6.7
million respectively and further growth is expected
in the coming year.
Following the acquisition by the Group, some large
conferencing customers have signed new or
extended contracts, recognising the stronger
financial base of the Group. 
An earn-out agreement is in place to reward the
vendors based on performance of the acquired
assets which runs to March 2014, with payment in
June 2014. The resulting contingent consideration
payment is currently expected to be up to 
£4.6 million.
Acquisition of The Net Crowd Limited (“TNC”)
On 31 January 2013 the Group acquired the entire
issued share capital of TNC for an initial cash
consideration of £3.0 million and deferred
consideration of £2.1 million is due at the end of
June 2013.
In the year TNC contributed revenue and adjusted
EBITDA of £0.6 million and £0.2 million respectively.
An earn-out agreement is in place to reward the
vendors based on performance of the acquired
assets. The earn-out period runs to September 2014,
with payment in November 2014. The resulting
contingent consideration payment is currently
expected to be up to £1.5 million.
Acquisition of Daisy Data Centre Solutions Limited
(“DDCS”)
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 May 2013 the Group
acquired the entire issued share capital of DDCS for
a cash consideration of £7.5 million. DDCS is a data
centre business, providing managed services from
two data centres in Reading and Gateshead.
This business will be integrated with our existing
data business in Daisy Retail and we expect to
commence this activity over the summer months.
FUNDING
At 31 March 2012 the Group had banking facilities of
£115.0 million in place. The facilities were increased
to £140.0 million in April 2012, when The Royal Bank
of Scotland plc joined the club arrangement and the
increase in facilities was utilised to fund the
acquisition of WWG on 16 April 2012. We were very
pleased to announce on 26 March 2013 that the
Group had signed a new banking agreement which
expires on 30 June 2016. This makes available a
£50.0 million term loan and a £150.0 million
revolving credit facility for the Group. These
combined facilities of £200.0 million replace the
Group’s previous facilities of £140.0 million and
provide the Group with finance resources to support
its acquisition strategy.
The new facilities have been arranged with a group
of six banks comprising existing syndicate members
Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds Banking
Group plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and
Yorkshire Bank, who are joined by ING Bank N.V.
Each bank has committed an equal amount of
funding of £33.3 million. 
Net debt at 31 March 2013 was £81.2 million (2012:
£78.0 million) reflecting the acquisition, integration
and change activity undertaken in the year, offset by
free cash flow of £38.6 million (2012: £28.6 million).
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Continuing operations for the year ended 31 March
2013 include the results of all businesses that were
owned and designated as continuing at the start of
the financial year (including the Group’s holding
company), together with the post-acquisition results
of businesses acquired during the year.

The Group’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA were £351.5
million (2012: £348.6 million) and £56.3 million (2012:
£56.3 million) respectively. 
Amortisation of intangible assets in the year was
£66.2 million (2012: £61.9 million) and relates
primarily to the customer relationships acquired
during the current and prior periods. These
customer relationships have been valued based on
expected discounted future cash flows and are
amortised over periods from two to seven years.
Depreciation for the year totalled £2.9 million 
(2012: £3.9 million) and consists largely of charges
for computers, office equipment and network
infrastructure.
Net exceptional operating costs were £4.6 million
(2012: £2.9 million). These include employee and
other restructuring costs of £5.4 million (2012: 
£9.0 million), costs directly relating to acquisitions of
£1.0 million (2012: £1.0 million) and impairment of
fixed assets of £1.2 million (2012: £nil). Exceptional
credits included within net exceptional operating
costs include re-measurement of contingent
consideration of £2.9 million (2012: £6.7 million) in
relation to the acquisition of Daisy Wholesale
Limited (formerly Murphx Innovative Solutions
Limited (“Murphx”)). Profit on disposal of joint
ventures totalled £nil (2012: £0.3 million).
The management share options did not vest during
the year and this has resulted in a net credit to the
income statement of £0.7 million (2012: charge of
£0.7 million). 
The operating loss from continuing operations 
was £16.8 million (2012: £13.1 million).
Net finance costs were £6.8 million (2012: £5.6
million) and predominantly consist of finance costs
of £6.2 million (2012: £5.1 million) relating to the
bank facilities and discounting of provisions and
contingent consideration of £0.7 million (2012: £0.7
million). Included within finance costs are £0.6
million of one-off charges relating to the settlement
of the previous bank facilities.
The Group reported a net loss before tax from
continuing operations for the year of £23.5 million
(2012: £18.8 million). As noted above, the increase
over the prior year is predominantly due to the
increase in amortisation of intangible assets
reflecting the timing and scale of acquisitions 
in earlier years.
TAXATION
At the year end the Group has recognised a deferred
tax asset in the balance sheet of £9.8 million (2012:
£10.5 million), which is expected to unwind in future
periods, effectively reducing the cash tax liability 
on future profits. During the year net corporation tax
of £3.0 million was paid (2012: £2.8 million). 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing
operations increased to 6.38 pence in the year (2012:
3.46 pence) principally due to the increase in non-
trading related amortisation charges referred to
earlier. Basic adjusted earnings per share from
continuing operations reduced to 13.17 pence (2012:
13.52 pence) mainly as a result of increased finance
charges. Fully diluted adjusted earnings per share
from continuing operations is 13.07 pence (2012:
13.42 pence).
The adjusted earnings per share calculation
excludes the after-tax effect of amortisation of
acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based
payment (credits)/costs and net exceptional
operating costs, and we believe it is a better
representation of the underlying trading
performance of the Group.
“Cash generated from
operations was very
strong at £47.6 million”

BALANCE SHEET
Net assets of the Group were £143.9 million at 
31 March 2013, compared to £161.3 million at 
31 March 2012.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill reduced to
£160.8 million (2012: £193.7 million) as a result of
£27.0 million of assets acquired through business
combinations, a further £6.3 million of additions
(including £4.1 million spent on customer lists and
£2.1 million spent on computer software), less the
amortisation charge for the year of £66.2 million
(2012: £61.9 million). Goodwill arising on current 
and prior year acquisitions totalled £20.2 million,
taking the year end position to £118.4 million 
(2012: £98.2 million).
The deferred tax asset of £9.8 million (2012: £10.5
million) primarily relates to tax losses and fixed
asset timing differences for the former Vialtus
business, which are expected to continue to be
utilised against future profits.
Net current assets were £2.3 million (2012: net
current liabilities of £3.8 million). Total borrowings
stood at £117.2 million (2012: £111.3 million). This
balance consists of gross bank borrowings of £120.0
million less deferred finance fees of £2.8 million,
which will be released over the remaining period of
the bank facilities. Of the total borrowings, £4.1
million is classed as current (2012: £11.1 million)
and £113.1 million is classed as non-current 
(2012: £100.3 million).
CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT
Cash generated from operations was very strong at
£47.6 million, a significant improvement over the
previous year (2012: £29.1 million).
Net interest paid was £4.1 million (2012: £3.9
million). The Group made net taxation payments of
£3.0 million (2012: £2.8 million) as the Group now
makes tax payments on account in addition to
meeting obligations of acquired entities.
Net capital expenditure outflows totalled £3.0 million
in the year (2012: £2.2 million) and were largely
attributable to network infrastructure. The cash
flows associated with the acquisition of intangible
assets totalled £6.0 million (2012: £5.4 million
excluding deferred consideration payments relating
to the Telstra customer base) and were largely
attributable to customer lists and software.
Pre-exceptional free cash flow for the Group was
£38.6 million (2012: £28.6 million).

DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS
continued
considered to be material in the context of assessing
Ian’s independence. The directors’ remuneration and
their interests in the share capital of the Company are
detailed in note 9 of the Group financial statements.
EMPLOYEES
The Group has an equal opportunities policy which
ensures that people are provided with the same
opportunities for employment, career development,
training and promotion regardless of disability, race,
sex, religion/beliefs or age. The directors are committed
to maintaining and developing communication and
consultation processes with employees, who in turn are
encouraged to develop an awareness of the issues
affecting the Group. We aim to be recognised as an
employer of choice and seek to maintain strong
employee relations in all areas in which we operate. The
directors place considerable emphasis on employees
sharing in the success of the Group.
The Group is committed to open and regular
communications with employees about business
developments and issues of general interest and
concern to them, both on a formal and informal basis.
The performance of the Group is communicated
regularly to all staff. Copies of the annual report
together with details of preliminary and interim
announcements of the Group’s results are available 
to them. 
EMPLOYMENT OF DISABLED PERSONS
Both employment policy and practice in the Group are
based on non-discrimination and equal opportunities.
The Company remains supportive of the employment
and advancement of disabled people and provides
appropriate opportunities for their training, career
development and promotion. Applications for
employment by disabled persons are always fully
considered. Where employees have become disabled in
the service of the Group, every effort is made to
rehabilitate them in their former occupation or in some
suitable alternative.
SHARE CAPITAL
At the close of business on 17 June 2013, the Company
had 266,967,587 ordinary shares in issue, of which none
were held in treasury.
The Company has an employee benefit trust (“EBT”),
which has previously been used to make jointly owned
equity awards (“JOE awards”) under the Company’s
Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme. The JOE
awards comprised two elements:
• an interest in the future growth in value of awarded
shares in the Company. The EBT was entitled to the
value of the shares at the time of the award and the
employee was entitled to any future increase in
value of those shares (“JOE interest”); and
• an option over the trustee’s interest in the value of
the shares at the time of the award (“JOE option”). 
Both the JOE interest and the JOE option were subject
to performance and employment conditions during the
relevant performance period. These did not vest during
the year because relevant performance criteria were
not met.
The trustees of the EBT are Capita Trustees Limited,
which is a company resident in Jersey. The EBT holds
9,477,959 ordinary shares at the date of this report in
relation to both the above former JOE awards and
shares held as nominee for certain members of the
management team.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
As of 17 June 2013 interests notified to the Company in
accordance with Chapter 5 of the Disclosure and
Transparency Rules comprised:

Toscafund Asset Management LLP 27.00
Invesco Limited 26.40
Matthew Riley 23.01
Host Europe (Bermuda) Limited 13.60
Daisy Group plc Employee Benefit Trust 3.55
POLICY ON PAYMENT TO SUPPLIERS
The Group’s supplier payment policy is to agree 
terms and conditions for business transactions with
suppliers. Suppliers are made aware of the Group’s
terms of payment. Payment is then made subject to
these terms and conditions being met. The Group had
£45.9 million of trade payables at the end of the period
(2012: £41.9 million), which represented 79 payable 
days (2012: 70 days).
POLITICAL AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group made no political donations during the year
(2012: £nil). The Group made a donation to The Prince’s
Trust of £25,000 during the year (2012: £nil).

statutory requirements placed upon it and to apply good
environmental practice in its operations whilst
recognising that it is contractually obliged to meet its

CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group embraces corporate and social responsibility
and encourages all of its subsidiaries to become
involved in local projects and initiatives on an 
ad-hoc basis, dependent upon employee interest 
and participation.
RISK
Senior management is aware of its responsibility for
managing risks within each business unit. Group risk is
reviewed at board level to ensure that risk management 
is being implemented and monitored effectively.
The board’s policy is to ensure that the business units
are operated effectively and appropriately, bearing in
mind prevailing market conditions, the requirements for
timely decision making and commercial reality.
Insurance policies are regularly reviewed to ensure they
are adequate and appropriate, in line with the nature,
size and complexity of the business. Standard form
contracts are provided for commercial use and to assist
the varying segments of the business and their
commercial function to negotiate within 
approved parameters.
See the principal risks and uncertainties section below
for details of the Group’s risk management process.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The business review contained within this directors’
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s
review and the financial review, together with the key
performance indicators and principal risks and
uncertainties disclosed below, have been provided by
the directors in accordance with the Companies Act
2006. The Company has disclosed the main trends and
factors likely to affect the future development,
performance and position of the business.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
KPIs, which are set at Group level, have been devised to
allow the board and shareholders to monitor the Group
as a whole, as well as the operating businesses within 
the Group.
The Group has financial KPIs that it monitors on a
regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings as follows:
• adjusted EBITDA 
(continuing operations): £56.3 million 
(2012: £56.3 million)
• revenue 
(continuing operations): £351.5 million 
(2012: £348.6 million)
• free cash flow: £38.6 million 
(2012: £28.6 million)
• net debt: £81.2 million 
(2012: £78.0 million)
The Group has non-financial KPIs that it monitors on a
regular basis at board level and where relevant at
divisional management meetings, which are principally 
as follows:
• e-billing penetration
• product penetration
• direct debit penetration
More detail behind these KPIs is included in the Chief
Executive’s review.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Group is affected by a number of risks and
uncertainties, not all of which are wholly within its
control. Although many of the risks and uncertainties
influencing performance are macro-economic, and
likely to affect the performance of businesses generally,
others are particular to the Group’s operations.
This section highlights some of those particular risks
and uncertainties affecting the Group’s business, but it
is not intended to be an extensive or comprehensive
analysis of all such risks and uncertainties. Some risks
may be unknown to the Group and others, currently
regarded as immaterial, could turn out to be material. 
All of them may have the potential to adversely impact
the -Group’s business.

Directors’ report
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
continued
The Group has a risk management process for
identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks.
The Group risk register captures the most significant
risks facing the business. Each risk is assigned to a
senior management owner responsible for monitoring
and evaluating the risk and the appropriate mitigation
strategies.
The key operational risk to the Group is further
deterioration of the global and UK economy. The level of
business activity could be impacted by continued
economic uncertainty and could lead to a reduction in
revenue, profitability and cash generation. Should
markets weaken, it may become difficult for the Group’s
operational businesses to maintain volumes and pass
on price increases to customers. Cash collection could
potentially prove more difficult 
and bad debts may arise as customers suffer from the
current economic environment.
The following risks may impact the performance of the
Group:
• Contracts with suppliers
The Group resells the products of its suppliers, and
whilst it has the freedom to substitute certain of
these products, management acknowledges that the
Group has a reliance on contracts with its suppliers
such as BT, Cable & Wireless, Vodafone, O2 and
Verizon. The Group closely manages relationships
with its main suppliers and seeks to mitigate the risk
created by this reliance by building strong
relationships with such suppliers throughout the
business in order to understand and respond to 
their expectations.
• Integration
The significant growth of the Group over the last few
years has been driven by acquisition and the Group’s
strategy includes the acquisition of further
businesses where they are earnings enhancing.
Management recognises that there is a risk of
operational disturbance in the course of integrating
acquired businesses into the Group’s existing
operations. This risk is mitigated by detailed
planning and due diligence by the Group’s senior
management team and their oversight and execution
of the integration of acquired businesses, in each
case to safeguard future financial performance and
achieve planned synergies.
• Technological change
The market for the Group’s services is characterised
by technological developments and changes,
frequent introductions of new products and services
and evolving industry standards. There is a risk that
the Group may fail to secure the necessary contracts
to supply its customers with the latest technology.
The Group mitigates this risk by maintaining close
relationships with suppliers, which it believes will
keep it at the forefront of product development on a
sustained basis, and regularly monitors trends in
technological advancement so as to anticipate and
plan for future changes.
• Key resources
Consistent with groups of a similar size, the Group is
managed by certain key personnel, including
executive directors and senior management who
have significant experience within the Group and the
wider IT communications sectors and who may be
difficult to replace. Furthermore, the Group depends
on being able to recruit and retain sales and
marketing employees of an appropriate calibre to
win and service significant contracts. The Group has
sought to mitigate this resource risk by investing in
staff training programmes, competitive reward and
compensation packages, management incentive
schemes and succession planning.
• Regulatory change
The Group recognises that the pricing of products
and services and the activities of major industry
organisations, such as BT, may be affected by the
actions of regulatory bodies in the UK and the EU.
Such actions could affect the Group’s profitability
either directly or indirectly. The Group mitigates this
risk by constantly monitoring and assessing the
likelihood and potential impact of regulatory change.
GOING CONCERN
The Group had cash balances of £38.8 million (2012:
£34.6 million), net debt of £81.2 million (2012: £78.0
million) and unutilised borrowing facilities of £80.0
million (2012: £2.5 million) at 31 March 2013. The
borrowing facilities were increased by £25.0 million and
fully drawn on 16 April 2012 following the introduction of
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc into the Group’s banking
club arrangement. Further to this, on 26 March 2013 the
Group signed a new banking agreement which expires
on 30 June 2016. This agreement makes available a
£50.0 million term loan and a £150.0 million revolving
credit facility for the Group. These combined facilities of
£200.0 million replace the Group’s previous facilities of
£140.0 million.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances,
borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the
directors believe that the Group and the Company have
adequate resources to continue operations for the
foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.

TREASURY POLICY AND LIQUIDITY
The Group maintains borrowing lines estimated to be
sufficient to cover forecast cash requirements. In this
assessment, the Group only takes into account existing
or renewing facilities and new facilities where these
have received credit approval or equivalent.
The Group uses financial instruments to raise finance
and manage risk for its operations. It does not
undertake any speculative trading in derivative 
financial instruments.
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and
policies, including those concerning interest rate risk,
credit risk and liquidity risk, are disclosed in note 21 of
the Group financial statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 17
September 2013 at 11.00 am at Cadogan Hall, 5 Sloane
Terrace, London SW1X 9DQ.
At the Annual General Meeting, resolutions will be
proposed to receive these financial statements and the
directors’ and auditors’ reports, to declare a final
dividend of 4.0 pence per ordinary share, to re-elect
Matthew Riley and Steve Smith, (who are retiring by
rotation at the Annual General Meeting in accordance
with the Company’s articles of association), and
Christina Kennedy and Laurence Blackall (who will have
served for more than nine years on the board at the
time of the Annual General Meeting), and to re-appoint
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors and to
authorise the directors to fix the auditors’
remuneration. A resolution will also be proposed in
relation to political donations. It is not proposed to alter
the Company’s current policy of not making political
donations, but the resolution is being proposed to
ensure that any charitable donations made by the
Company are compliant with the widely drafted
provisions on political donations in the Companies 
Act 2006.
In order to maintain flexibility to act in a manner which
promotes the success of the Company for the benefit of
its members, the directors will also seek: (i) authority to
allot shares generally in respect of ordinary shares
having an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,779,783,
representing approximately one third of the issued
share capital of the Company; (ii) additional authority to
allot further shares by way of a fully pre-emptive rights
issue in respect of ordinary shares having an aggregate
nominal value of up to £1,779,783, representing
approximately a further one third of the issued share
capital of the Company; and (iii) a disapplication of
pre-emption rights in respect of ordinary shares having
an aggregate nominal value of up to £1,067,870,
representing approximately 20% of the issued share
capital of the Company. The directors will also seek
authority to buy back up to 53,393,517 ordinary shares,
representing 20% of the issued share capital of the
Company. The directors have no present intention to
allot any shares or to buy back any shares under the
authorities being sought.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’ LIABILITY
INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY
The Company has purchased insurance to cover its
directors and officers against the costs of defending
themselves in legal proceedings taken against them in
that capacity and in respect of any damages resulting
from those proceedings. In accordance with section
236(2) of the Companies Act 2006 the directors disclose
a qualifying third party indemnity provision entered into
between the Company and its directors and officers
which was in force at the date of approval of this report.
Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover
where the director has acted fraudulently or
dishonestly.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
Events after the balance sheet date are detailed in note
36 of the Group financial statements.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are
unaware. Relevant audit information is defined as
information needed by the Company’s auditors in
connection with preparing their report. Each director
has taken all the steps (such as making enquiries of
other directors and the auditors and any other steps
required by the director’s duty to exercise due care, skill
and diligence) that they ought to have taken in their duty
as a director in order to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that
the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have
indicated their willingness to continue in office and a
resolution concerning their re-appointment will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This report was approved by order of the board on
17 June 2013.

The remuneration committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy.
The committee meets at least twice a year to determine
all aspects of the remuneration of the executive
directors and other senior managers. The fees of the 
non-executive directors are determined by the board as
a whole. No director or employee has a role in
determining their own remuneration.
During the year, the remuneration committee has taken
advice from Ernst & Young LLP regarding remuneration.
REMUNERATION POLICY
The committee determines the overall policy for
executive remuneration. Details of the directors’
remuneration can be found in note 9. The committee
sets levels of remuneration to attract, retain and
motivate executive directors and other senior managers
and, in doing so, takes into account the level of
remuneration throughout the telecommunications
industry. Employees throughout the Group have
performance reviews annually.
The main components of the executive directors’ and
senior managers’ remuneration are:
• a competitive base salary
• an annual performance bonus
• pension provision
• benefits in kind
• share option awards
The Group operates a discretionary bonus scheme. The
scheme applies to directors, senior managers and
certain other employees. Individual payments made
under the scheme are generally dependent on the
Company achieving its financial targets and the
attainment of individual objectives.
The Group makes contributions to money purchase
personal pension schemes on behalf of certain
executive directors and senior managers.
Other customary benefits, such as car allowances,
permanent health insurance and life assurance, are
made available as appropriate.
The Group operated two share option schemes, the
“Daisy Group plc Executive Share Plan” and the “Daisy
Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme”, which have
now both expired. Details of awards made under these
schemes are given in note 10 to the Group financial
statements. After the year end, the Group adopted a
new long-term incentive plan which was approved by
shareholders at a general meeting held on 1 May 2013.
DIRECTORS’ SERVICE CONTRACTS
The service contracts of executive directors remain in
force until age 65 and continue until terminated by
either party giving to the other not less than 12 months’
written notice (or as otherwise terminated in
accordance with their other terms).
The service contracts of non-executive directors remain
in force for an initial term of 12 months, unless
terminated by either party giving to the other not less
than three months’ written notice, save that the service

The board is responsible to shareholders for effective
direction and control of the Group and this report
describes the framework for corporate governance and
internal control that the directors have established to
enable them to carry out this responsibility. Although,
as an AIM listed company, the Company is not required
to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code (“the Code”) and this is not a
statement of compliance as required by the Code, the
board of directors recognises the importance of, and is
committed to, ensuring that effective corporate
governance procedures are in place, appropriate for a
public company of its size and complexity.
THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES
Board
The board is responsible for the overall strategy and
financial performance of the Group and has a formal
schedule of matters reserved for its approval. Each
board meeting is preceded by a clear agenda and any
relevant information is provided to directors in advance
of the meeting. The Company has established properly
constituted audit, remuneration and nomination
committees of the board with formally delegated duties
and responsibilities. Terms of reference for each of
these committees can be found on the Company’s
website (www.daisygroupplc.com).
On 1 April 2012 the board comprised four executive
directors, Peter Dubens, Matthew Riley, Steve Smith
and Gareth Kirkwood and three non-executive directors,
Christina Kennedy, Ian McKenzie and Laurence
Blackall. Gareth Kirkwood resigned from the board on
12 April 2012.
During the year, Christina Kennedy was considered to
be an independent non-executive director as defined
under the Code. Christina Kennedy is the senior
independent director. The board also reconsidered the
independence of Ian McKenzie and have concluded that
he is independent notwithstanding that he holds a
historical one-off grant of warrants which are not
considered to be material in the context of assessing 
Ian’s independence.
The board met on five occasions during the year to
discuss operational business. All directors were in
attendance except Christina Kennedy, who was unable
to attend one meeting. The board also holds regular
telephone calls to update the members on operational
and other business.
An agreed procedure exists for directors in the
furtherance of their duties to take independent
professional advice. Newly appointed directors are
made aware of their responsibilities through the
company secretary. The Company provides training to
directors where required.
No individual or group of directors dominates the
board’s decision making. Collectively, the non-executive
directors bring a valuable range of expertise in assisting
the Group to achieve its strategic aims.
Since September 2003, the roles of chairman and chief
executive officer have been separate. The chairman is
responsible for the effective running of the board and
the chief executive is ultimately responsible for all
operational matters and the financial performance of
the Group.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee’s principal responsibility
is to determine the framework or board policy for the
remuneration of the chairman and the executive
directors, to consider and determine all elements of the
remuneration of those directors and to review board
performance. No director takes part in any discussion
concerning his own position.
The remuneration committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Ian McKenzie and Laurence Blackall and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy. The remuneration report
on page 39 contains a detailed description of the
Group’s remuneration policy. The committee met on five
occasions during the year. All members were in
attendance on each occasion.

THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES continued
Nomination committee
The nomination committee comprises Christina
Kennedy, Laurence Blackall and Ian McKenzie and is
chaired by Christina Kennedy. The nomination
committee considers the appointment of all directors
and is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and
composition (including skills, knowledge and
experience) of the board and makes recommendations
with regard to any changes. The articles of association
of the Company require directors to retire from office at
the first Annual General Meeting following appointment
(at which point they are eligible for re-appointment) and
then every three years by rotation, but in accordance
with good practice, one third of the directors are
submitted for re-election each year. The nomination
committee has had one meeting during the year in
relation to the re-election by rotation of directors at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting. This meeting took
place without the relevant directors voting in relation to
their own appointment. The Committee members and
the board believe that the directors put forward for re-
election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting
continue to be effective and demonstrate commitment
to their role. The nomination committee and board
unanimously recommend the election and appointment
of all board members offering themselves for re-
election or re-appointment.
Audit committee
The audit committee is responsible for the independent
monitoring of the effectiveness of the system of internal
control, compliance, accounting policies and published
financial statements on behalf of the board. It receives
and reviews reports from the Company’s management
and auditors relating to the interim and annual financial
statements and the accounting and internal control
systems in use throughout the Group. Any significant
findings or identified risks are examined so that
appropriate action may be taken.
The audit committee comprises Laurence Blackall
(chairman), Christina Kennedy and Ian McKenzie.
Christina Kennedy is considered by the board to have
relevant financial experience. The committee operates
under written terms of reference and is scheduled to
meet at least twice a year with the Company’s external
auditors, and with the executive directors present by
invitation only. The committee met twice during the
year. All members were in attendance. The committee
meets with the external auditors without the executive
directors present as it considers appropriate.
Conflicts of interest
The Company has procedures for the disclosure and
review of any conflicts, or potential conflicts, of interest
which the directors may have and for the authorisation
of such conflict matters by the board. In deciding
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict, the
directors must have regard to their general duties
under the Companies Act 2006. The authorisation of a
conflict matter, and the terms of authorisation, may be
reviewed at any time by the board. The board considers 
that these procedures are operating effectively.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company encourages the participation of both
institutional and private investors. Communication with
private individuals is maintained through the Annual
General Meeting and the Company’s annual and interim
reports. The chairmen of the Company’s audit,
remuneration and nomination committees are made
available to answer questions at the Company’s Annual
General Meetings.
In addition, further details on the strategy and
performance of the Company can be found at its website
(www.daisygroupplc.com), which includes copies of the
Company’s press releases. Regular updates are
provided to the board on meetings with shareholders
and analysts, and broker’s opinions are made available
to the board. As provided by the UK Corporate
Governance Code, non-executive directors are available
to meet major shareholders, if required. The Company’s
share registrars provide a helpdesk, which members
may contact with enquiries regarding their
shareholdings. The helpdesk telephone number is 
0871 664 0300* (or +44 20 8639 3399 for overseas
callers) and the helpdesk’s e-mail address is
ssd@capitaregistrars.com.
* calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras (lines
are open Mon – Fri 9.00 am – 5.30 pm).
INTERNAL CONTROL
The board maintains full control and direction over
appropriate strategic, financial, organisational and
compliance issues. The Group has an organisational
structure with clearly defined lines of authority,
responsibility and accountability, which is reviewed
regularly. The annual budget and forecasts are
reviewed by the board prior to approval being given. This
includes the identification and assessment of the
business risks inherent in the Group and the
telecommunications sector as a whole along with
associated financial risks.

INTERNAL CONTROL continued
The board has overall responsibility for the Group’s
systems of internal control and for monitoring their
effectiveness. Although no system of internal control
can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Group’s systems are designed
to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that
issues are identified on a timely basis and dealt with
appropriately.
The Group’s key internal financial control procedures
include:
• a budgeting programme with an annual budget
approved by the board
• a review by the board of actual results compared
with budget and forecasts
• reviews by the board of year end forecasts
• the establishment of procedures for acquisitions,
capital expenditure and expenditure incurred in the
ordinary course of business
• the appraisal and approval of proposed acquisitions
by  the board
• the detailed budgeting and monitoring of costs
incurred on the development of new products
• the reporting to, and review by, the board of changes
in legislation and practices within the sector and
accounting and legal developments pertinent to 
the Company
• the appointing of experienced and suitably qualified
staff to take responsibility for key business functions
to ensure maintenance of high standards of
performance
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion
on the financial statements. They discuss with
management the reporting of operational results and
the financial condition of the Group, to the extent
necessary to express their audit opinion.
The board has considered the need for an internal audit
function but resolved that, due to the size of the Group,
this could not be justified on the grounds of cost
effectiveness.
AUDIT AND AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
An additional responsibility of the audit committee is to
keep under review the scope and cost effectiveness of
the external audit. This includes recommending to the
board the appointment of the external auditors and for
reviewing the scope of the audit, approving the audit fee
and, on an annual basis, the committee being satisfied
that the auditors are independent.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are retained to perform
audit and audit-related work on the Group, the Company
and the majority of Group companies.
The committee monitors the nature and extent of non-
audit work undertaken by the auditors. It is satisfied that
there are adequate controls in place to ensure auditor
independence and objectivity. The matter is kept under
review and is a standing item on the agenda for the
audit committee. Periodically, the audit committee
monitors the cost of non-audit work undertaken by the
auditors. The audit committee considers that it is in a
position to take action if at any time it believes that
there is a risk of the auditors’ independence being
undermined through the award of this work.
Details of audit and non-audit fees for the period 
under review are disclosed in note 12 of the Group
financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
As set out more fully in the directors’ report, the
directors have formed the conclusion that the Company
and Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The
financial statements have, therefore, been prepared on
the going concern basis.
D Di ir re ec ct to or rs s  a an nd d  g go ov ve er rn na an nc ce e O Ov ve er rv vi ie ew w C Co on nt te en nt ts s F Fu ur rt th he er r  i in nf fo or rm ma at ti io on n F Fi in na an nc ci ia al ls s

law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable UK Accounting Standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Company financial
statements respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
This statement was approved by order of the board on 17 June 2013.

TO THE MEMBERS OF DAISY GROUP PLC
for the Group financial statements
We have audited the Group financial statements of Daisy Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which comprise
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity,
the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 45, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial
and non-financial information in the annual report and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2013 and of its loss and cash flows for the
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), International Financial Reporting
Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historic cost
convention. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to use certain critical accounting
estimates and are required to exercise judgement in the application of accounting policies. The principal accounting
policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
In all cases references to “EBITDA” relate to the operating result from continuing operations before amortisation and
depreciation. References to “adjusted EBITDA” also exclude share-based payment (credits)/costs and net exceptional
operating costs.
There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on
or after 1 April 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are not yet effective and have not been early adopted 
by the Group:
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2013 but have not been early adopted by the Group:
• Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’. The main change resulting from these amendments is a
requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’ (OCI) on the basis of whether
they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments). The amendments do
not address which items are presented in OCI.
• Annual improvements 2011. These annual improvements, address six issues in the 2009-2011 reporting cycle. 
It includes changes to:
– IFRS 1, ‘First time adoption’
– IAS 1, ‘Financial statement presentation’
– IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’
– IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments; Presentation’
– IAS 34, ‘Interim financial reporting’
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’. IFRS 13 aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a
precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use
across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRS and US GAAP, do not extend the use of
fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or
permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP.

2.1 Basis of preparation continued
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2014 but have not been early adopted by the Group:
• IFRS 10,‘Consolidated financial statements’. The objective of IFRS 10 is to establish principles for the presentation
and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities to present
consolidated financial statements. It defines the principle of control, and establishes controls as the basis for
consolidation. It sets out how to apply the principle of control to identify whether an investor controls an investee
and therefore must consolidate the investee. It also sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of
consolidated financial statements.
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’. IFRS 11 is a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights
and obligations of the parties to the arrangement rather than its legal form. There are two types of joint
arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Joint operations arise where a joint operator has rights to the
assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and therefore accounts for its share of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expenses. Joint ventures arise where the joint venture has rights to the net assets of the arrangement
and therefore equity accounts for its interest. Proportional consolidation of joint ventures is no longer allowed.
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’. IFRS 12 includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of
interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance
sheet vehicles.
• IAS 28 (revised 2011), ‘Associates and joint ventures’, includes the requirements for associates and joint ventures
that have to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
• Amendment to IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, on asset and liability offsetting. These amendments
are to the application guidance in IAS 32, ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’, and clarify some of the
requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2015 but have not been early adopted by the Group:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’. IFRS 9 is the first standard issued as part of a wider project to replace IAS 39. IFRS
9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes two primary measurement categories for
financial assets: amortised cost and fair value. The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The guidance in IAS 39 on impairment of
financial assets and hedge accounting continues to apply.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material
impact on the Group. 
2.2 Consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Daisy Group plc (“the Company”) and
enterprises controlled by the Company (its “subsidiaries”). The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition
below the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (“negative goodwill”) is recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed at the date of exchange. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recorded in the income statement.
Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially
measured at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.

2.2 Consolidation continued
Subsidiaries continued
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated
on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of
the asset transferred.
Joint ventures
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly
controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates and
joint ventures’. The net investment in the joint venture is a single line in the balance sheet, and the profit or loss
appears in a single line in the income statement. Where the joint venture is loss-making, a liability is recognised in the
balance sheet within other payables.
2.3 Foreign currency translation
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling. All Group companies have a functional currency of sterling which is
consistent with the presentation currency of the Group’s financial statements. Transactions in currencies other than
sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses
arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the year.
2.4 Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Group board of directors.
The Group’s segments comprise Daisy Retail, Daisy Wholesale, Daisy Distribution and central costs, which are those
businesses reported in the Group’s management accounts used by the board of directors as the primary means for
analysing trading performance.
Segmental revenue represents the total revenue of each business within a reporting segment and includes inter-
segment revenue. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is calculated as
adjusted EBITDA.
2.5 Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the
ordinary course of the Group’s activities. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably
measured and it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the entity and
when specific criteria have been achieved. Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts
and after eliminating sales between Group companies.
To the extent that invoices are raised to a different pattern than the revenue recognition described below, appropriate
adjustments are made through deferred and accrued income to account for revenue when the underlying service has
been performed or goods have transferred to the customer.
Revenue recognition for each of the Group’s main areas of revenue is described below.

2.5 Revenue recognition continued
Arrangements with multiple deliverables
Where goods and or services are sold in one bundled transaction, the Group allocates the total arrangement’s
consideration to the different individual elements based on their relative fair values. Management determines the fair
values of individual components based on actual amounts charged by the Group on a stand-alone basis, or
alternatively based on comparable pricing arrangements observable in the market.
Gross or net income presentation
When deciding the most appropriate basis for presenting revenue, both the legal form and substance of the
agreement between the Group and its business partners are reviewed to determine each party’s respective role in 
the transaction. The Group is considered to be principal in the arrangement when it provides the goods or services 
to the end user, has freedom to determine the price charged to the end user and bears inventory and credit risk from
the arrangement.
Where the Group’s role in a transaction is that of principal, revenue is recognised on a gross basis. This requires
revenue to comprise the gross value of the transaction billed to the customer, after trade discounts, with any related
expenditure charged as an operating cost.
Where the Group’s role in a transaction is that of an agent, revenue is recognised on a net basis with revenue
representing the margin earned.
Sale of services
Service income is recognised at fair value, evenly over the period to which the service relates. Usage charges are
recognised in the period when the service is received by the customer.
The Group provides certain maintenance services. Fees charged to customers for the provision of maintenance and
support services are recognised at fair value, on a straight-line basis over the period of the related agreement.
Sale of goods, licences and installation
Revenue from the sale, and or installation of hardware and associated licences is recognised at fair value in the
income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, usually on delivery
or installation.
External costs associated with the installation are recorded as work-in-progress until the revenue has been recognised.
Revenue in respect of licences is only recognised where there are no on-going obligations. Where on-going obligations
exist, revenue is deferred and recognised in line with the on-going obligations as appropriate.
Where hardware and associated licences are leased to customers under a finance lease arrangement, lease income is
recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of
return. Where assets are leased out under an operating lease arrangement, lease income is recognised over the term
of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Commissions
Commissions are received from mobile network operators when the Group connects or retains end users to their
network. The commissions are recognised as income by the Group over the period of service required by the
commission agreement. When the Group assesses that there is an on-going obligation beyond connection,
commission is recognised evenly over the period of the obligation. When the Group assesses that there is not an 
on-going obligation beyond connection, commission is recognised upon connection.
In some instances commission income is subject to adjustment by the mobile network operator. Where this is the
case, the Group assesses the likelihood of adjustment by reference to historical experience and adjusts commission
income accordingly.

2.5 Revenue recognition continued
Intermediaries are given commissions by the Group on provision of new customers and retaining existing customers.
Such commissions are recognised as an expense over the period of service required by the commission agreement,
except where they meet the criteria for capitalisation as an intangible asset, to the extent that they are supported by
expected future cash inflows, in which case they are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
customer life and the contractual period.
2.6 Exceptional items
Items that are material individually or in aggregate and non-operating or non-recurring in nature are presented as
exceptional items in the income statement, within the relevant account heading. Items that may give rise to
classification as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, significant Group restructuring and rationalisation
programmes, asset impairments, profits or losses on the disposal of businesses, negative goodwill, transaction fees
and re-measurement of contingent consideration. The directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of
exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance.
2.7 Finance income and expense
Interest payable on borrowings, the interest expense component of finance lease payments and interest income is
recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
2.8 Business combinations
Under the requirements of IFRS 3 (revised), all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method
(“acquisition accounting”). The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of
exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, equity instruments issued by the acquirer and any costs
directly attributable to the business combination. The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition
date by recognising the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition
criteria, at their fair values at that date. The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains
control of the acquiree. An intangible asset, such as customer or supplier relationships, computer software and
licences, is recognised if it meets the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38, ‘Intangible Assets’ and its fair value
can be measured reliably. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
2.9 Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair
value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled
entity at the date of acquisition.
Upon the acquisition of subsidiaries, goodwill is separately disclosed. Goodwill on acquisition of associates and jointly
controlled entities is included in investment in associates and jointly controlled entities.
At each balance sheet date goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a discounted cash flow method applied to
business forecasts. If this review demonstrates that impairment has occurred, this is expensed to the income
statement immediately and is not subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the
purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose, identified according to
operating segment.
Negative goodwill arises when the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities is greater than the cost of acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for indications of impairment or more
frequently if there are indications that it may be impaired.

2.10 Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are initially measured at either cost or fair value and amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful economic lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis. The fair value attributable
to intangible assets acquired through a business combination is determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows to be generated from that asset at the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital for the Group. The residual
values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
The estimated useful economic lives of intangible assets are as follows:
Customer lists and relationships: life of the customer contract between 2 and 7 years
Supplier relationships: life of the supplier relationship between 2 and 3 years
Computer software: 2 to 3 years
Telecommunication licences: 2 to 5 years
Intellectual property: 10 years
The following are the main categories of intangible assets:
Contract related intangible assets (customer and supplier relationships)
Customer and supplier portfolios acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value and
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair value
of acquired intangible assets and include management’s estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by the
acquired businesses. Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer and supplier relationships.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use
the specific software and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs
that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group,
and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible
assets. Direct costs include the software development, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant
overheads.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Telecommunication licences
Licences paid to regulatory bodies, which permit telecommunication activities to be operated for defined periods, are
initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period.
Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs (included within customer lists and relationships) comprise the direct third-party costs of
recruiting and retaining customers, net of incentives from network operators and provision for in-contract churn.
These costs are expensed as incurred, unless they meet the criteria for capitalisation as an intangible asset, to the
extent that they are supported by expected future cash inflows, in which case they are amortised on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the customer life and the contractual period.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property includes patents, utility models, trademarks, trade or business names, domain names, websites
and contents thereof, copyright, moral rights, rights to prevent passing off or unfair competition, database rights and
rights in designs. Intellectual property is capitalised and amortised over a period of 10 years.

Directors  and  governance Overview Contents Further  information Financials 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
2.11 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are included in the balance sheet at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and
any impairment losses. Historical cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Included within the cost for network infrastructure and
equipment are direct labour, contractors’ charges, materials and directly attributable overheads.
On disposal of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the
date of disposal is recorded in the income statement.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available
for use, so as to write off the asset’s cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual
value. Freehold land is not subject to depreciation.
The lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:
Leasehold improvements: shorter of unexpired portion of lease or 10 years
Freehold buildings: 50 years
Network infrastructure: 2 to 10 years
Computer equipment: 3 to 4 years
Office equipment: 3 to 5 years
Motor vehicles: 3 to 5 years
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and adjusted
prospectively if appropriate.
2.12 Impairment of non-current assets excluding goodwill
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that an
asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement if the recoverable amount (being the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use) of an asset or cash generating unit falls below its carrying value in the
balance sheet.
Such impairment losses may be reversed in subsequent periods if there is an indication that the impairment loss
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased.
2.13 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be
principally recovered through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a
sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
2.14 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at
inception date; whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the
arrangement conveys the right to use the asset.
Group as a lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership
are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at inception at the lower of the fair
value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Capitalised leased assets are
subsequently depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life.
Obligations related to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate
under current or non-current borrowings. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and
reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.

2.14 Leases continued
All other leases are classified as operating leases. Lease payments made under operating leases are charged to the
income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Group as a lessor
Assets leased to a customer under arrangements that meet the relevant criteria of IAS 17 are classified as finance
leases. The fair values of the assets provided to the end customer are recognised as a receivable.
There are no guaranteed residual values available to the Group at the end of any finance leases, and as unguaranteed
residual values are not considered to be material to the Group, they are not included in the net investment in the
finance lease.
Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant
periodic rate of return.
Any gain or loss on early termination of leases, calculated as the total net sums recovered and the book value of net
investments in finance leases, is recognised in the income statement when such terminations arise.
2.15 Inventories
Inventories mainly comprise items of equipment held for sale or rental and consumable items. Equipment held and
consumable items are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for
obsolescence. Cost is based on the price of purchase and is calculated on a first-in-first-out basis. Net realisable
value is based on estimated selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal.
2.16 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably
estimated. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring
which has been notified to affected parties. Onerous lease provisions have been measured at the lower of the cost to
fulfil the contract or the cost of terminating the contract.
2.17 Current and deferred income tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit,
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will
be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in jointly controlled entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

2.17 Current and deferred income tax continued
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
2.18 Employee benefits
Share-based payments
The Group operates a share option programme which allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The
fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes method which takes
into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Non-market vesting conditions are included
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity.
The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Where non-market vesting conditions are not met, the associated charge is reversed in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments 
made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where
the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit
plan. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future
payments is available.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when an employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits
when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed
formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to
encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are
discounted to present value.
Holiday pay
Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits
are earned. An accrual is made at the balance sheet date to reflect the fair value of holidays earned but not yet taken.
2.19 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the income
statement and loans and receivables. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were
acquired. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this
designation at every reporting date.

2.19 Financial instruments continued
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.
All financial assets are held at amortised cost except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading and are
held at fair value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of
business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they
are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established
when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised
in the income statement within ‘operating costs’.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and bank deposits repayable on demand. For the purposes of the cash
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method except for derivatives,
which are classified as held for trading and are held at fair value. Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include
trade payables, accruals, onerous lease provisions, deferred consideration and borrowings.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less
(or in the normal operating cycles of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount, and subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the value of the amount received, net of
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised
cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period
of the borrowing using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate risks arising from
financing activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Given the conditions applicable to the specific derivative instrument the Group
holds, it is not deemed to meet the criteria as required by IAS 39 to permit hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, i.e. cost. Subsequent to initial recognition
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is
recognised immediately in the income statement as a component of financing income or costs.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to
terminate the instrument at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current
creditworthiness of the instrument counterparties (refer to note 21).

2.20 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction
costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
2.21 Employee benefit trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial statements.
Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in
identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity.
The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a
gain or loss being recognised in the Group income statement.
2.22 Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are declared and approved by the Company’s
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by
definition, seldom equal the related actual results. Management continually evaluates the estimates, assumptions and
judgements based on available information and experience. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are
discussed below.
Revenue recognition and presentation of arrangements with multiple deliverables
In revenue arrangements including more than one deliverable, the deliverables are assigned to one or more separate
components of revenue and the arrangement consideration is allocated to each component based on its relative 
fair value.
Determining the fair value of each deliverable can require complex estimates due to the nature of the goods and
services provided. The Group generally determines the fair value of individual elements based on prices at which the
deliverable is regularly sold on a standalone basis or based on comparable pricing arrangements observable in the
market.
Recognition of connection commission in respect of revenue-share arrangements
Based on there being no substantive performance obligations post-connection and a well-established, robust track
record of revenue share income, the Group recognises revenue-share receivable from the networks in full on
connection based on the average in-bundle spend per connection. Adjustments are made for the churn of customers
based on empirical evidence. The Group continues to monitor this in order to ensure that the track record is reviewed
in detail and the key assumptions used remain appropriate. 
Receivables
Debts are recognised to the extent that they are judged to be recoverable. Management reviews are performed to
estimate the level of provision required for irrecoverable debt. Provisions are made specifically against invoices and
finance lease receivables to appropriately reflect any uncertainty as to ultimate collection.

Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable
taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or
tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Historical differences between forecast and actual
taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment as at the transition date and thereafter for all
non-financial assets at each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such
indicators exist. Other non-financial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from 
the asset or cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those
cash flows.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets
Acquisitions may result in customer relationships, supplier relationships, licences and computer software being
recognised. These are valued using discounted cash flow methods which require the application of certain key
judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of discount rates, customer churn and future 
cash flows.
Exceptional items
The Group applies judgement in assessing the substance of transactions to identify those that are material individually
or in aggregate and non-operating or non-recurring in nature and these are presented as exceptional items in the
income statement, within the relevant account heading. Items that may give rise to classification as exceptional items
include, but are not limited to, significant Group restructuring and rationalisation programmes, asset impairments,
profits or losses on the disposal of businesses, negative goodwill, transaction fees and re-measurement of contingent
consideration. The directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful
information about the Group’s underlying business performance.
Share-based payments
Share-based payments are valued by reference to the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The inputs to which include
dividend yield, expected volatility, time to maturity and the risk free interest rate. Refer to note 10 for further details.

Central costs
Central costs consist of central activities that are not directly attributable to the operating segments.
Segmental revenue represents the total revenue of each business within a reporting segment and includes 
inter-segment revenue. Segmental profit is the measure used to assess performance internally and is calculated as
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payment (credits)/costs and net
exceptional operating costs (“adjusted EBITDA”), excluding central costs recharged from the Company.
The Group has opted to disclose additional information on revenue and gross profit in respect of the product
categories described above.
All businesses are based in the UK. Inter-segmental transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis. The Group
does not have any customers who contribute more than 10% of total revenue.

a) Business combinations in the year ended 31 March 2013
On 16 April 2012 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Worldwide Group Holdings Limited (“WWG”) for a cash
consideration of £28.5 million. Further consideration of £4.6 million has been recognised in the balance sheet based
on challenging growth targets in adjusted EBITDA over an agreed earn-out period. WWG is a market-leader in 
audio-conferencing and call-handling technology, providing a full suite of communications solutions to business
customers, with a focus on voice services and data connectivity. Based in Peterborough, the business supplies
services to a number of the world’s largest audio-conferencing companies and, though UK-based, routes inbound
calls from multiple foreign territories.
On 31 January 2013 the Group acquired the entire share capital of The Net Crowd Limited (“TNC”) for a cash
consideration of £3.0 million. Deferred consideration of £2.1 million is payable post year end and a further £1.5 million
has been recognised in the balance sheet based on specific growth targets in adjusted EBITDA over an agreed 
earn-out period. TNC is an IT data specialist that provides ‘white-label’ professional services, maintenance and
installations to the UK channel. The Berkshire-based company works with vendors including Cisco, Juniper Networks,
HP and Microsoft to provide complex and specialist IT services, delivered through a UK-wide team of field engineers

(iii) Other restructuring costs include £1.7 million of costs relating to operating leases for sites in Harbour Exchange
and Prudhoe that are largely unoccupied and where there are no plans to use the space before the expiration of
the leases. Also included within this category are IT integration costs of £0.4 million and £0.6 million of costs
relating to previous acquisitions, identified after the measurement period under IFRS 3 (revised).
(iv) During the year the contingent consideration in respect of Murphx was revalued in light of the final settlement
payments to the vendors based on the performance of the business against the earn-out target. The contingent
consideration has been re-assessed during the year to £1.5 million at 31 March 2013. The difference of £2.9
million has been reflected in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3 (revised). During the prior year the
contingent consideration in respect of Murphx, MCL, SpiriTel and O-Bit was revalued based on expectations of the
performance of the businesses against their respective earn-out targets. The difference between the value
created on acquisition and the estimates was reflected in the income statement in accordance with 
IFRS 3 (revised).
(v) The leasehold improvement assets in our Stockley Park site have been fully impaired during the year as the site is
no longer occupied. Refer to note 19 for further details.
(vi) Costs directly relating to acquisitions include £0.6 million of contractual acquisition bonuses payable to directors
and a senior member of staff (2012: £nil). Refer to note 9 for further details.

The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of
the share options granted. The estimate of fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes
option pricing model.
The expected volatility is based on future volatility over the life of the award. The expected life is the average expected
period to exercise. The risk-free interest rate is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term equal to the
expected life of the warrants or share option awards. Assumptions have been made to incorporate dividend yield and
the effects of forfeiture using anticipated leaver rates. The calculations assume that the performance criteria
attaching to the options will be met in full.

A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2013 budget statement to reduce
the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to a proposed rate of 20% by 1 April 2015. Legislation reducing the main
rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 was enacted by the Finance Act 2012. The impact on the
income statement as a result of this rate change is approximately £1.0 million credit, reflecting a reduction in the net
deferred tax liabilities held on balance sheet.
The proposed further reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 3% to 20% are expected to be enacted through
the Finance Act 2013 to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015. The overall effect of the
changes from 23% to 20%, if these applied to the deferred tax balances at 31 March 2013, would be to reduce the
deferred tax asset by approximately £1.3 million and deferred tax liabilities by £3.6 million. The changes had not been
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.

Daisy Retail includes the acquisition of WWG and Daisy Wholesale includes the acquisition of TNC.
The carrying value of the Group’s goodwill is not subject to annual amortisation and was tested for impairment at
31 March 2013. The recoverable amount has been determined on a value-in-use basis on each cash-generating unit
using the management approved 12-month forecasts for each cash-generating unit. The base 12-month projection is
held constant with no growth to year 3 and then kept constant thereafter to perpetuity. These cash flows are then
discounted at the Group’s pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10%. 
Based on the results of the current period impairment review, no impairment charges have been recognised by the
Group in the year ended 31 March 2013 (2012: £nil). Management have considered various sensitivity analyses in order
to appropriately evaluate the carrying value of goodwill. Having assessed the anticipated future cash flows the
directors do not consider there to be any reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would lead to such an
impairment charge in the year ended 31 March 2013.

At 31 March 2013, there were unrelieved losses in the Group of approximately £53.5 million (2012: £55.7 million). The
Group had a potential deferred tax asset in relation to unrelieved losses, fixed asset timing differences and short-term
timing differences of £18.3 million (2012: £20.2 million). The deferred tax asset has been recognised where, in the
opinion of the directors, the Group is expected to make sufficient profits against which these tax assets can be utilised
in the future. This means that there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset at 31 March 2013 of £8.6 million 
(2012: £9.7 million). The majority of on-balance sheet tax losses are expected to be utilised over the next 5 years.

Directors  and  governance Overview Contents Further  information Financials 21. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
21.1 Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents and borrowings. Other
financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, net investments in finance leases and trade and other
payables, arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair
value of these financial instruments is not material.
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:
a) Floating rate borrowings
The fair value of floating rate borrowings approximates to carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates
where repayments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
b) Fixed rate borrowings
The fair value of fixed rate borrowings, namely the finance lease and the hire purchase obligations, are estimated by
discounting the future contracted cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value.
c) Trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and cash
For these items with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value as a
result of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
21.2 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal as the Group’s borrowings at variable and fixed rates were denominated
in sterling. No foreign exchange contracts were entered into in the current year as the Group has no direct material
foreign exchange exposure.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to
ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet its foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to these risks and, where appropriate, will take action to minimise the
impact of these risks on the business. The directors have not delegated the responsibility of monitoring financial risk
management to a sub-committee of the board. The Group’s finance department implements the policies set by the
board, with clearly defined authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Such instruments are only used on occasion to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets
or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and
also the interest cash flow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. Whilst floating rate borrowings are not
exposed to changes in fair value, the Group is exposed to cash flow risk as costs increase if market rates rise.
To manage this risk, the Group enters into interest rate cap agreements with other parties to generate the desired
interest profile, in which the Group will be compensated if interest rates rise above an agreed rate calculated by
reference to an agreed-upon notional principal. At the year end 58% (2012: 44%) of the Group’s borrowings were
covered by interest rate cap agreements.
The Group holds cash balances which are subject to floating rates of interest. Whilst the rates of interest inherent in
net investments in finance lease receivables are variable dependent on the credit worthiness of the end customer,
once contracts are entered into the rate is fixed and there is no further exposure to interest rate changes.
At 31 March 2013 it is estimated that a 0.5 percentage point movement in interest rates, which represents
management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, with all other variables remaining constant, would
impact the Group’s loss before tax by approximately £0.6 million (2012: £0.6 million).

21.2 Financial risk management continued
b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counter party may fail to perform its obligations. The Group is exposed to credit risk on
financial assets such as cash balances, net investments in finance leases and trade and other receivables. The
Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are
net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior
experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Appropriate credit checks are undertaken on
all potential customers before new contracts are accepted. Individual exposures are monitored with customers
subject to credit limits to ensure the Group’s exposure to bad debts is minimised. The Group’s customers are spread
across a wide range of industry and service sectors and consequently the Group is not exposed to material
concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and funding to purchase leased vehicles is managed by transacting with
financial institutions with high quality credit ratings. Accordingly, the Group’s associated credit risk is deemed to be
limited. All institutions utilised by the Group require the advance approval of the board.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date. See note
23 for further information on trade receivables and net investment in finance leases.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group actively forecasts, manages and reports its working capital
requirements on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds for its operations. Significant items of capital
expenditure require prior approval by the board.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts

d) Capital risk management
The Group’s capital structure consists of net debt and total equity. The Group is subject to the risk that its capital
structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. The Group’s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and
benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. There were
no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The banking facilities have a requirement for the Group to comply with certain covenant ratios including net debt to
adjusted EBITDA and interest cover. The Group monitors these covenants regularly and has met all covenant tests 
to date.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the use of share option schemes. Full details
are provided in note 10.
Consistent with industry practice, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated
as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as current and non-current borrowings (excluding
unamortised fees) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as disclosed in the consolidated
balance sheet plus net debt as defined above. The gearing ratios were as follows:

The carrying value of the Group’s external borrowings, which consist of floating rate and fixed rate borrowings,
approximates to fair value. All of the Group’s borrowings are denominated in sterling.
a) Bank facilities
In order to complete the acquisition of WWG in April 2012, the Group increased its borrowing facilities by a further
£25.0 million following the introduction of The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (“RBS”) to the incumbent four-strong group
of lenders. This took the total bank facilities to £140.0 million.
On 26 March 2013 the Group signed a new banking agreement for facilities of £200.0 million which expires on 30 June
2016. The new agreement makes available a £50.0 million term loan and a £150.0 million revolving credit facility to the
Group. The facilities have been arranged with a group of six banks comprising existing group members Barclays Bank
plc, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds Banking Group plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and Yorkshire Bank, who are joined by
ING Bank N.V. Each bank has committed an equal amount of funding. These new facilities will replace the Group’s
previous funding package which was due to expire on 30 June 2013, providing working capital and finance for 
further acquisitions.
The facilities are secured by way of a charge over shares in some of the Group’s subsidiary undertakings. The facilities
have principally been arranged to refinance the existing indebtedness of the Group, provide working capital and
finance for further acquisitions. Interest on the facilities is being charged at floating rates of interest of 2.0%-3.0%
above LIBOR as that rate fluctuates.
Covenants based on net debt to adjusted EBITDA and interest cover are tested on a quarterly basis. The Group has
passed all covenant tests to date.
The Group has entered into derivative transactions in the form of interest rate cap arrangements. The purpose of this
is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. Further details of
the interest rate cap can be found in note 21.
The Group had £80.0 million of unutilised bank borrowing facilities at 31 March 2013 (2012: £2.5 million). At the
balance sheet date the Group had no overdraft facility (2012: £nil).

Company profit and loss account. The profit for the Company for the year was £70.6 million (2012: £7.1 million loss)
due to the reversal of a previously-charged impairment loss for Managed Communications Ltd of £1.1 million, profit
on disposal of the Company’s investment in Freedom4 Limited of £17.0 million, a release of £2.9 million of contingent
consideration in respect of the acquisition of Daisy Wholesale Limited (formerly Murphx Innovative Solutions Limited)
(“Murphx”) and £50.0 million of dividends receivable from subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has not prepared a cash flow statement, on the basis that the cash flow of the Company is included
within the consolidated cash flow statement of Daisy Group plc.
The directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future
and therefore the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
C1.2 Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment. In the
opinion of the directors the values of such investments are not less than shown at the balance sheet date.
C1.3 Joint ventures
A jointly controlled entity is an entity in which the Company holds an interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly
controlled by the Company and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The investment in the joint venture is included in the balance sheet at cost less any impairment. Cost includes any
cash injections and interest income accrued on the redeemable preference shares. The interest income is calculated
using a market interest rate on the outstanding debt element of the preference shares, adjusted for each cash
injection as appropriate.
C1.4 Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated
at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is
recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has a continuing right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
C1.5 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange at the
balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.

C1.6 Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the taxable
profits/(losses) and results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax
assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences
are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
C1.7 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s
equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders.
C1.8 Share-based payments
The Company operates certain equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding
shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account equivalent to the fair
value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value of options over the Company’s shares awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a
capital contribution, resulting in an increase in investments. The fair value of the options granted is measured using
the Black-Scholes method which takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The charge is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award. At each balance sheet
date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. Any revision
to the original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to equity
immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value)
and share premium when the options are exercised.
C1.9 Employee Benefit Trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Benefit Trust (“EBT”) have been included in the Group financial statements.
Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Group balance sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in
identified beneficiaries. The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity.
The proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own shares leads to a
gain or loss being recognised in the profit and loss account.
C1.10 Financial instruments and risk management
The Company and Group’s policy in respect of financial instruments and risk management are disclosed in note 21 of
the consolidated financial statements. Disclosures have been made on financial instruments as required by the
Companies Act 2006.
C2. EMPLOYEES’ AND DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Company had an average of 25 employees during the year, including directors (2012: 19 employees). For
information on directors’ remuneration, see note 9 of the consolidated financial statements and the remuneration
report on page 39.

As part of a restructure of the Group, on 26 March 2013 the Company reversed its previously-recorded impairment
loss of £1.1 million relating to its investment in Managed Communications Ltd and then exchanged its shares in Daisy
Wholesale Limited, Daisy Communications Ltd., Worldwide Group Holdings Limited, Daisy Telecoms Limited, The Net
Crowd Limited, International VoIP Communications Limited and Managed Communications Ltd for shares in Daisy
Intermediate Holdings Limited. In addition, on 28 March 2013 the Company sold its shares in Freedom4 Limited to
Daisy Intermediate Holdings Limited, a fellow Group company, at market value. The consideration of £27.0 million was
settled via the intercompany accounts, resulting in a profit on disposal of £17.0 million.

Independent auditors’ report
TO THE MEMBERS OF DAISY GROUP PLC
for the parent Company financial statements
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Daisy Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2013 which
comprise the Company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 45, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report and accounts to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2013;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the directors’ report for the financial year for which the parent Company
financial statements are prepared, is consistent with the parent Company financial statements.

1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the Annual
General Meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of
the Company. A Form of Proxy which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. If you
do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact Capita Registrars on
0871 664 0300*. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy the Form of Proxy. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and
number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy (which in aggregate should not exceed the number of
shares held by you). Please also indicate if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and
should be returned together in the same envelope.
2. To be valid any Form of Proxy or other instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is
signed, or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority, must be received by post or (during normal business hours only)
by hand at Capita Registrars, Proxies, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by no later than 11.00 am on
15 September 2013.
3. The return of a completed Form of Proxy, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in paragraph 8 below) will
not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General
Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they may cast), shareholders must be registered in the
register of members of the Company at 6.00 pm on 15 September 2013 (or, in the event of any adjournment, 6.00 pm on the date which is
two days before the time of the adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of members after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded
in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.
5. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting is entitled pursuant to section 319A of the Companies Act 2006 to ask any question
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting. The Company will answer any such questions unless (i) to do so would interfere
unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; or (ii) the answer has already been
given on a website in the form of any answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of
the meeting that the question be answered.
6. As at 14 June 2013 (being the last business day prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital consisted of
266,967,587 ordinary shares of which none were held as treasury shares. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 14 June
2013 were 266,967,587.
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST
members who have appointed a service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take
the appropriate action on their behalf.
8. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications, and must contain the information
required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a
proxy or is an amendment to an instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be
received by the issuer’s agent ID (RA10) by 11.00 am on 15 September 2013. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the
time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
9. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST
member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST
sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST
system and timings.
10. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001.
11. There will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) from the date of this Notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the
Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting, copies of the following documents:
• the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment; and
• the executive directors’ service agreements.
* Calls cost 10p per minute plus network extras (lines are open from Monday to Friday between 9.00 am and 5.30 pm).
